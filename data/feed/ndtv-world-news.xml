       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A volcano in eastern Indonesia erupted overnight killing at least six people as it spewed fireballs and ash on surrounding villages, officials said Monday, as they raised its alert status to the highest level.</p>

<p>Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki, a 1,703-metre (5,587-feet) twin volcano located on the popular tourist island of Flores, first erupted shortly before midnight, forcing authorities to evacuate several villages.</p>

<p>"Six fatalities have been confirmed," Abdul Muhari, spokesman of the country's disaster mitigation agency (BNPB), told Kompas TV.</p>

<p>Footage received by AFP showed villages near the volcano covered by thick ash, with some areas on fire.</p>

<p>An AFP journalist near the volcano said five villages evacuated, affecting thousands of residents.</p>

<p>Some wooden houses caught fire, and the ground was pockmarked with holes caused by flying molten rocks.</p>

<p>The crater erupted just before midnight and then again at 1:27 am (1727 GMT Sunday) and 2:48 am, the country's volcanology agency said.</p>

<p>It raised the alert level to the highest and told locals and tourists not to carry out activities within a seven-kilometre (4.3-mile) radius of the crater.</p>

<p>"There has been a significant increase in volcanic activity on Mount Lewotobi Laki-laki," it said in a press release Monday.</p>

<p>It released images that showed the roofs of houses collapsed after they were hit by volcanic rocks, and locals sheltering in communal buildings.</p>

<p><strong>Ash rain</strong></p>

<p>The volcanology agency warned there was a potential for rain-induced lava floods and told locals to wear masks to avoid the effects of volcanic ash.</p>

<p>There were a series of eruptions at the volcano last week, the biggest on Thursday, sending a column of ash 2,000 metres (6,500 feet) into the sky.</p>

<p>The mountain had several major eruptions in January, prompting authorities at the time to raise the alert status to the highest level and evacuate at least 2,000 residents.</p>

<p>Indonesia, a vast archipelago nation, experiences frequent eruptions due to its position on the Pacific "Ring of Fire", an area of intense volcanic and seismic activity.</p>

<p>In December last year, an eruption at one of the country's most active volcanoes, Mount Marapi in West Sumatra, killed at least 24 climbers, most of them university students.</p>

<p>And in May, more than 60 people died after heavy rains washed volcanic material from Marapi into residential areas, sweeping away homes.</p>

<p>That month Mount Ruang in North Sulawesi province erupted more than half a dozen times, forcing thousands of residents of nearby islands to evacuate.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Former US president Donald Trump is 'clearly the better choice,' as compared to his Democratic rival Vice President Kamala Harris, former US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley has said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US president Donald Trump is 'clearly the better choice,' as compared to his Democratic rival Vice President Kamala Harris, former US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley has said.</p>

<p>Haley urged undecided voters to look at both candidates' policy proposals, which she said clearly show Trump as the better option in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published two days before Election Day.</p>

<p>"I don't agree with Trump 100 per cent of the time. But I do agree with him most of the time, and I disagree with Harris nearly all the time. That makes this an easy call. Here are the facts most relevant to me," the former South Carolina governor wrote in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal on Sunday.</p>

<p>Batting for her former boss, the Indian American wrote; “Will Trump do some things I don't like in a second term? I'm sure he will. If that was the question before voters, then I imagine Trump would lose. But that isn't the question in any election.</p>

<p>"No politician gets everything right. For those of us who are clear-eyed enough to see Trump's flaws and honest enough to acknowledge them, the question is whether we're better off with his policies or his opponent's. On taxes, spending, inflation, immigration, energy and national security, the candidates are miles apart. And Trump is clearly the better choice," she wrote.</p>

<p>Haley alleged that the Biden-Harris agenda has made the world far more dangerous.</p>

<p>"Our southern border is our most pressing security threat; Biden and Harris have made it dramatically worse. Their debacle in Afghanistan not only created a new terrorist state; it also signalled weakness that sparked Russia's war against Ukraine," she wrote.</p>

<p>"Their appeasement of Iran has enriched that despotic regime and emboldened it to pursue war with Israel through its terrorist proxies. And the administration's weakness toward China has done nothing to impede the communist power's expansion at our expense. This is the world that Biden-Harris failures have given us in four short years,” she said.</p>

<p>Haley argued a Trump administration would be different.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be perfect. But I agree with Trump that we need to keep taxes low and cut them more. I agree that we need to roll back trillions of dollars in special-interest handouts. I agree that we need to expand American energy to empower our families and job creators while making us less dependent on foreign energy," Haley said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The dollar slipped in Asia on Monday as investors braced for a potentially pivotal week for the global economy as the United States chooses a new leader and, probably, cuts interest rates again with major implications for bond yields.</p>

<p>The euro rose 0.4% to $1.0876 but faces resistance around $1.0905, while the dollar dipped 0.3% on the yen to 152.45 yen. The dollar index eased 0.3% to 103.94.</p>

<p>Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump remain virtually tied in opinion polls and the winner might not be known for days after voting ends.</p>

<p>Analysts believe Trump's policies on immigration, tax cuts and tariffs would put upward pressure on inflation, bond yields and the dollar, while Harris was seen as the continuity candidate.</p>

<p>Dealers said the early dip in the dollar might be linked to a well-respected poll that showed Harris taking a surprise 3-point lead in Iowa, thanks largely to her popularity with female voters.</p>

<p>"It is widely considered that a Trump win will be positive for the USD, though many feel this outcome has been discounted," said Chris Weston, an analyst at broker Pepperstone. "A Trump presidency with full control of Congress could be most impactful, as one would expect a solid sell-off in Treasuries resulting in a spike higher in the USD."</p>

<p>"A Harris win and a split Congress would likely result in 'Trump trades' quickly reversed and priced out," he added. "The USD, gold, bitcoin and U.S. equity would likely head lower."</p>

<p>Uncertainty over the outcome is one reason markets assume the Federal Reserve will choose to cut rates by a standard 25 basis points on Thursday, rather than repeat its outsized half-point easing.</p>

<p>Futures imply a 99% chance of a quarter-point cut to 4.50%-4.75%, and an 83% probability of a similar-sized move in December.</p>

<p>"We are pencilling in four more consecutive cuts in the first half of 2024 to a terminal rate of 3.25%-3.5%, but see more uncertainty about both the speed next year and the final destination," said Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius.</p>

<p>"Both our baseline and probability-weighted forecasts are now a bit more dovish than market pricing."</p>

<p>The Bank of England also meets Thursday and is expected to cut by 25 basis points, while the Riksbank is seen easing by 50 basis points and the Norges Bank is expected to stay on hold.</p>

<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia holds its meeting on Tuesday and again is expected to hold rates steady.</p>

<p>The BoE's decision has been complicated by a sharp sell-off in gilts following the Labour government's budget last week, which also dragged the pound lower.</p>

<p>Early Monday, sterling had regained some of its losses to stand at $1.2963, some way from last week's trough at $1.2841. [GB/]</p>

<p>More stimulus is also expected from China's National People's Congress, which is meeting from Monday through Friday.</p>

<p>Sources told Reuters last week that Beijing is considering approving next week the issuance of more than 10 trillion yuan ($1.40 trillion) in extra debt in the next few years to revive its fragile economy.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican former President Donald Trump will face Vice President Kamala Harris in a Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election, with both candidates making their final pitches in battleground states ahead of what is projected to be a tight race.</p>

<p>Several third-party hopefuls are also running. Here are the candidates.</p>

<p><strong>Democratic Party</strong></p>

<p><strong>Kamala Harris&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Harris, 60, won the Democratic Party's nomination after Biden ended his reelection bid, allowing Democrats to present a renewed American vision in contrast to Trump's agenda as they seek to revive their coalition of young voters, people of color and suburban women.</p>

<p>A former U.S. senator, California attorney general and San Francisco prosecutor, Harris became the first woman and person of color to serve as vice president after Biden selected her as his 2020 running mate. She would become the first woman to serve as president in the nation's 248-year history if she wins.</p>

<p>Opinion polls show Harris is in a close race against Trump. She leads the former president nationally 44% to 43%, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Oct. 29.</p>

<p>Other surveys show Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, in tight races among the seven battleground states that could decide the election: Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina, Michigan and Nevada.</p>

<p>During the final weeks of the campaign, Harris has renewed efforts to paint Trump as a threat to democracy after he made ominous comments about "the enemy within" the United States and threatened to deploy the military domestically. She also agreed with the assessment by Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, that her opponent is a fascist, a characterization Trump and his allies rejected.</p>

<p>Harris has made reproductive rights and personal freedoms a rallying cry and backs a national law codifying access to safe abortion.</p>

<p>Her economic plans include tax cuts for most Americans, bans on price gouging, more affordable housing and a new child tax credit as well as efforts to boost domestic manufacturing. She proposed increasing the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% and ending taxes on tips.</p>

<p>She has promised tougher immigration and fentanyl controls at the border. Her climate and energy positions are similar to those held by Biden, who made fighting climate change a top priority.</p>

<p>Harris has been seen as tech-friendly even as she took on alleged anticompetition and privacy issues, and she has sought to reassure donors that she backs capitalism.</p>

<p>On foreign policy, Harris is expected to stick largely to Biden's playbook on key issues such as Ukraine, China and Iran. She has also pressured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for a Gaza ceasefire deal but has also taken a hard line against Hamas, saying the militant group must be "eliminated," and remains committed to the U.S. policy of arming Israel.</p>

<p>Key labor groups, including the Service Employees International Union, the United Auto Workers and the American Federation of Teachers, endorsed her. Former U.S. military officials, company executives and numerous former top Republican officials have also backed her.</p>

<p><strong>Republican Party</strong></p>

<p><strong>Donald Trump</strong></p>

<p>Trump, 78, secured the Republican nomination in July to make his third consecutive run for the White House after losing his 2020 reelection bid.</p>

<p>Trump continues to repeat his false claim that Democrats stole the 2020 election as he campaigns amid unprecedented legal challenges, including a fresh U.S. indictment over efforts to subvert his loss to Biden.</p>

<p>In office from 2017 to 2021, he has cast his indictments in four criminal cases as a political attack, vowing "retribution" against perceived enemies and embracing increasingly dystopian rhetoric.</p>

<p>Trump became the first former U.S. president to be convicted of a crime in May, in New York City. He was also the first president to be impeached twice. He denies any wrongdoing.</p>

<p>Trump, who chose U.S. Senator JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate, has refused to commit to accepting the 2024 results or to rule out possible political violence, while he and Republicans lay the groundwork to contest a potential loss. His false claims about voter fraud in battleground Pennsylvania have raised concerns that he could again try to overturn election results if he loses.</p>

<p>Trump has also promised to pardon supporters imprisoned for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and threatened to prosecute election officials, donors, Google and others if he wins.</p>

<p>He said he would <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-presidential-elections-donald-trump-remark-on-2020-poll-sparks-fear-he-may-not-accept-result-if-he-loses-6937172">not run again if he loses</a>.</p>

<p>Trump is the oldest U.S. presidential nominee and would become the nation's second oldest president. He faced two assassination attempts, one at a Pennsylvania campaign rally in July and another one in September near one of his Florida golf courses.</p>

<p>Trump-friendly think tanks' sweeping "Project 2025" policy agenda would target the Justice Department's independence, among other plans. Trump has sought to distance himself from the project despite his former aides' and Vance's involvement. He also wants the power to replace federal civil service workers with loyalists.</p>

<p>On foreign policy, Trump has vowed to fundamentally alter the U.S. relationship with NATO and to resolve the Ukraine war with possible peace talks that might require Kyiv to cede territory. He has said Hamas must be "crushed" and vowed to be tougher on Iran, but has given few details or policy proposals.</p>

<p>Trump has made immigration a top issue, promising mass deportations, including legal Haitian immigrants given Temporary Protected Status in Springfield, Ohio. He would end birthright citizenship and expand a travel ban on people from certain countries.</p>

<p>He takes credit for the U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade protections, saying abortion laws should be left to the states. Trump said he does not support banning birth control.</p>

<p>On the economy, Trump would impose sweeping tariffs on imported goods and on specific companies and countries. He pledged to end taxes on tips and overtime, to make emergency generators tax-deductible in states hit by natural disasters, to lower corporate tax rates and to open federal lands to foreign companies and housing. He has also vowed to undo much of Biden's climate change work.</p>

<p>Trump has faced criticism, including from some Republicans, for personal attacks against Harris, including over her race and gender.</p>

<p>Trump appointed former Democrat Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to his transition team and said he would tap billionaire supporter Elon Musk to address government efficiency.</p>

<p>The National Fraternal Order of Police and other police groups have also backed his election bid.</p>

<p><strong>Third Parties &amp; Independents</strong></p>

<p><strong>Libertarian Party</strong></p>

<p><strong>Chase Oliver</strong></p>

<p>While the Libertarian Party invited Trump to its convention, it ultimately selected Oliver, 39. Oliver ran for a Georgia state Senate seat in 2022 and garnered 2% of the vote.</p>

<p><strong>Green Party</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jill Stein</strong></p>

<p>Stein, 74, a physician who ran under the Green Party in 2016, is running again in 2024.</p>

<p>She launched her current campaign accusing Democrats of betraying their promises "for working people, youth and the climate again and again - while Republicans don't even make such promises in the first place."</p>

<p><strong>Independent</strong></p>

<p><strong>Cornel West</strong></p>

<p>The political activist, philosopher and academic is making a bid to attract more progressive, Democratic-leaning voters.</p>

<p>West, 71, initially ran as a Green Party candidate but in October said people "want good policies over partisan politics" and declared himself an independent. He has promised to end poverty and guarantee housing.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shortly after a violent attack on a Hindu temple in Canada's Brampton, the Indian High Commission in Ottawa said a consular camp was being held near the temple and added that it was "deeply disturbing" that such "disruptions" are being allowed during routine consular work.</p>

<p>The remarks come amid diplomatic tension between India and Canada, which was sparked by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations of New Delhi's involvement in the assassination of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. India has trashed the charges.</p>

<p>"As in previous years, the High Commission of India in Ottawa and Consulates General of India in Vancouver and Toronto have organized/plan consular camps during this period, for the benefit and ease of local life certificate beneficiaries (Canadian and Indian). On account of the prevailing security situation in Canada, the Canadian authorities had been requested well in advance to provide strong security measures for these events, which constitute routine consular work," the High Commission said in a statement shared on X.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

— India in Canada (@HCI_Ottawa) <a href="https://twitter.com/HCI_Ottawa/status/1853268151108010113?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 4, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>"We have seen violent disruption today (Nov 3) orchestrated by anti-India elements outside the consular camp.co-organized with the Hindu Sabha Mandir, Brampton, near Toronto. It is deeply disappointing to see such disruptions being allowed for routine consular work being organized by our Consulates with the fullest cooperation of local co-organizers. We also remain very concerned for the safety of applicants, including Indian nationals, on whose demand such events are organized in the first place," it added.</p>

<p>"Despite these efforts by anti India elements, our Consulate was able to issue more than 1000 life certificates to the Indian and Canadian applicants. There were also attempts to disrupt similar camps held in Vancouver and Surrey on Nov 2-3," the High Commission said.</p>

<p>It added that in light of these incidents and with Indian diplomats receiving threats, the organisation of more scheduled consular camps would depend on security arrangements by local authorities</p>

<p>"In case any camp is infeasible to be held due to such disruptions, alternative arrangements will be made to render those services, which may unfortunately inconvenience local users of these services," the High Commission said.</p>

<p>Some Indian-Canadian leaders, including MP Chandra Arya, have alleged that Khalistani extremists were behind the violence at the Hindu Sabha Mandir temple. Some videos that went viral show a group of men attacking devotees at the temple.&nbsp;A spokesperson for Peel Regional Police told AFP that no arrests had been made.</p>

<p>Mr Arya said a "red line has been crossed by Canadian Khalistani extremists today". "The attack by Khalistanis on the Hindu-Canadian devotees inside the premises of the Hindu Sabha temple in Brampton shows how deep and brazen Khalistani violent extremism has become in Canada."</p>

<p>The Canadian Prime Minister has responded to the attack on the temple, describing it as "unacceptable". "The acts of violence at the Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton today are unacceptable. Every Canadian has the right to practice their faith freely and safely. Thank you to the Peel Regional Police for swiftly responding to protect the community and investigate this incident," Trudeau said in a post on X.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 21-year-old woman in the US state of Texas has been arrested for attempting to sell her baby on Facebook. The accused, identified as Juniper Bryson, posted on a Facebook group called "Birth Mothers Looking for Adoptive Parent(s)" in September, stating that she was looking for someone who would be willing to adopt her unborn baby boy, as per the court documents.&nbsp;She is currently being held in the Harris County Jail on a $30,000 bond and has been charged with a felony.</p>

<p>A day prior to posting the message, Bryson had reached out to a family member, asking if they knew someone who was looking to adopt a baby. She hinted during the conversation that the child would be drug-positive, according to a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://abc7chicago.com/post/texas-mom-arrested-after-allegedly-trying-sell-newborn-baby-facebook/15500818/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>ABC 13</em></a>. During a subsequent conversation, Bryson told the family member that she wanted payment in exchange for the baby.</p>

<p>"It's not even like that, just enough to move into an apartment so I can work a job and get (my daughter) back, or a cheap down payment, or any car to get to different places to DoorDash. Nothing crazy at all," Bryson told them.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-couple-accused-of-trying-to-sell-their-baby-for-1-000-and-beer-6675022" rel="nofollow, noindex">Also read |&nbsp;US Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Their Baby For $1,000 And Beer</a></strong></p>

<h2><strong>Bryson demands money</strong></h2>

<p>According to the police, Bryson spoke to several people about adopting her baby, including a same-sex couple and a woman who was with her in the hospital. The same-sex couple even drove overnight from Louisiana with the baby but pulled out when Bryson started demanding money.</p>

<p>According to the prospective parents, Bryson asked them to send her $150 after previously requesting $25 to pay for food delivery.</p>

<p>"If the baby wasn't worth $200 to them, then screw all," Bryson reportedly told the couple as they headed back to Louisiana.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Wendy Williams, who lives in Houston, was in the hospital when Bryson went into labour and stayed with Bryson for the subsequent days.</p>

<p>"I felt a connection as if he were biologically mine." She said she watched Bryson suffer from withdrawals while in the hospital. "I just thought this was someone who was in a really bad position," Williams said. "The drugs had overtaken, and she just wanted to get better."</p>

<p>Court documents reveal that Bryson allowed Williams and her husband to name the baby, with both parties signing legal documents as well. While she was still in the hospital. Bryson posted on Facebook, saying she found a home for the baby and tagged Williams.</p>

<p>However, the netizens who had seen Bryson's ad, lashed out at Williams for allegedly buying the baby, which left her confused.</p>

<p>"A lot of people started commenting really really ugly things. 'How dare you sell this baby?' And then they were tagging me, 'How dare you buy this baby?'" she said.</p>

<p>When Williams confronted her, Bryson told a nurse to escort Williams out of the room. Williams then notified the Child Protective Service about the incident who arrested Bryson days later.</p>

<p>Notably, in September, a couple from the state of Arkansas was also arrested after they attempted to sell their baby boy for $1,000 and cans of beer. The parents, identified as Darien Urban (21) and Shalene Ehlers (20), signed a letter granting custody of their kid and handed him off to another person.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In July 2022, Elon Musk suggested Donald Trumpt "hang up his hat and sail into the sunset." Fast forward a couple of years and Mr Musk now holds the world's largest megaphone with Make America Great Again (MAGA) printed on it.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The evolution of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/elon-musk" target="_blank">Elon Musk</a> and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/donald-trump" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a>'s relationship has been a slow burn. Not too long ago, it could best be described as contentious. In July 2022, Mr Musk even suggested the former US President "hang up his hat and sail into the sunset." Fast forward a couple of years and Mr Musk now holds the world's largest megaphone with Make America Great Again (MAGA) printed on it as the US braces for the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/us-elections" target="_blank">2024 presidential elections</a> this November.</p>

<p>Elon Musk's influence on X (formerly Twitter) has skyrocketed since its acquisition two years ago, with followers nearly doubling to 194 million.</p>

<p>This meteoric growth, however, is marred by a reputation for spreading misinformation, contributing to political violence in countries like the United Kingdom and Venezuela. Analysts link X's misinformation to real-world harm. Mr Musk's controversial moderation policy changes have weakened X's ability to regulate harmful content, amplifying incendiary rhetoric and spreading misinformation.</p>

<p>Engaging with far-right accounts, the self-proclaimed "free speech absolutist" Mr Musk has inadvertently provided these figures with a "personal algorithm booster," amplifying their reach and influence on the platform. According to the Center for Countering Digital Hate, Mr Musk has made at least 50 posts this year concerning the US election that have been debunked by independent fact-checkers, collectively attracting over 1.2 billion views. And none of these misleading posts has received community notes to fact-check the claims.</p>

<p>One example includes Mr Musk's repost in July of a manipulated campaign advertisement from Democratic nominee and US Vice President Kamala Harris, in which she seemingly referred to herself as "the ultimate diversity hire." This synthetic video has garnered 135.4 million views on X.</p>

<p>Mr Musk's increasingly subversive commentary on social media raises questions about his political alignment. How did a technocrat born in a foreign land, who previously voted "overwhelmingly" for Democrats, become Cheerleader No.1 for Republican Donald Trump, a man impeached twice while in office?</p>

<h2><strong>Elon Musk's Political Leaning</strong></h2>

<p>By the time Mr Musk was born in 1971 in apartheid South Africa, Nelson Mandela was into his seventh year of imprisonment in a cramped 8-foot by 7-foot dark cell at the isolated Robben Island prison, serving an 18-year sentence.</p>

<p>His rightward lean is the culmination of a political evolution unfolding over decades. As one of the richest and most powerful individuals globally, the Tesla and SpaceX chief's political stances carry weight.</p>

<p>Historically, Mr Musk has been somewhat reticent in his political donations. His donations have often straddled the political spectrum, reflecting a more centrist approach earlier in his career. Mr Musk referred to the US government as the "ultimate corporation" at a CEO summit in December 2020. Throughout his career, he has maintained a somewhat cautious approach to political donations, contributing moderate amounts to candidates from both parties.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><span class="ins_instory_span_credit">Photo Credit: AFP</span></p>
</div>

<p>At a Vanity Fair event in 2015, Mr Musk stated, "I get involved in politics as little as possible," though he acknowledged the necessity of engaging when business interests are at stake.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His donations illustrate this ambivalence; he gave $2,000 to both George W. Bush and John Kerry in 2004, supported California Democrats, and donated $25,000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) in 2006. During the 2008 primaries, he contributed to both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton but did not support either in 2016.</p>

<p>Initially a sceptic of Mr Trump, Mr Musk found himself publicly denouncing the idea of winning the GOP nomination as "embarrassing."</p>

<p>"I don't really have strong feelings except that hopefully Trump doesn't get the nomination of the Republican party, because I think that's, yeah ... that wouldn't be good," Mr Musk said at a Vanity Fair event in 2015. "I think at most he would get the Republican nomination, but I think that would still be a bit embarrassing."</p>

<h2><strong>2016 US Elections: A Radical Shift</strong></h2>

<p>Mr Musk has admitted to being a Democrat prior to the 2016 elections. His political worldview shifted dramatically during this time, particularly in response to Mr Trump's rise. In various tweets, The SpaceX chief has expressed disillusionment with established political norms and what he perceives as a failure of the political elite to address the real needs of the American people. The divisive atmosphere of the 2016 election seems to have played a role in reshaping his beliefs, leading him to embrace a more libertarian ethos that pushes for individual freedom and scepticism of government intervention.</p>

<p>As Mr Trump assumed the presidency, Mr Musk's political donations began to skew significantly Republican. By 2017, he was reportedly spending nearly seven times more on GOP campaigns than Democratic ones. His willingness to accept positions on two of Mr Trump's White House councils highlighted a shift in stance. While Mr Musk initially backed Hillary Clinton's environmental platform, he justified his participation in Mr Trump's business council as a means to raise critical issues, including the controversial travel ban targeting Muslim-majority countries. However, he resigned from these councils in June 2017, citing Mr Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord, tweeting, "Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world."</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><span class="ins_instory_span_credit">Photo Credit: AFP</span></p>
</div>

<p>After a period of relative silence regarding Mr Trump, his public interactions with the former president began to increase, especially following Mr Trump's attendance at a SpaceX launch in May 2020.</p>

<p>As Joe Biden took office, Mr Musk's flirtations with the Trump-led GOP escalated. In mid-2022, he disclosed that he voted for a Republican candidate in a Texas special election. Mr Musk has argued that the Democratic Party has drifted further from the centre, making the GOP appear more palatable.</p>

<p>After acquiring Twitter, now known as X, in late 2022, Mr Musk reinstated Mr Trump's account, calling the decision to expel him after the January 6 riots "morally bad" and "foolish to the extreme."</p>

<p>Mr Musk publicly defended the former president following his felony conviction, claiming that it undermined public faith in the legal system. He echoed Mr Trump's sentiments that the conviction was politically motivated. Mr Trump has even broached the possibility of the technocrat taking an advisory role in his cabinet should he win the presidency in 2024.</p>

<p>The relationship between the two culminated in an official endorsement. Mr Musk's positioning alongside Mr Trump places him in contrast to figures like Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, who has maintained a more centrist approach amid the increasing polarisation in tech and politics.</p>

<h2><strong>The Other Social Media Giant</strong></h2>

<p>Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta (formerly Facebook), has grown increasingly disillusioned with politics. Once seen as a bridge between technology and political advocacy, Mr Zuckerberg has retreated from that role.</p>

<p>The Facebook co-founder's disenchantment with politics has been shaped by years of negative experiences in Washington. In a letter to the US Congress in 2021, he revealed that the Biden administration pressured Meta to censor COVID-19 misinformation beyond what he was comfortable with, admitting that this interference made him appear biased. He also noted that he would not repeat his previous financial contributions to support election infrastructure, such as his infamous $400 million donations to the Center for Tech and Civic Life and the Center for Election Innovation and Research, which were intended to improve voting conditions during the pandemic. The contributions, earned severe backlash, especially from Republicans who accused Mr Zuckerberg of trying to bolster Democratic turnout.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-01/21mqmg78_mark-zuckerberg-getty_625x300_30_January_23.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Mr Zuckerburg has hired prominent Republican strategist Brian Baker to help repair Meta's strained relationship with conservative media and officials. The 2020 "Zuckerbucks" controversy, in particular, has become a flashpoint in Republican criticism of the Meta chief.</p>

<p>Mr Zuckerberg has also pivoted away from the political discourse that characterised his company's approach during the 2020 presidential polls. Just days before that election, Mr Zuckerberg was concerned about potential civil unrest resulting from a divided nation. He stated that Meta needed to do "well beyond what we've done before" to protect the electoral process.</p>

<p>However, in a recent statement announcing lacklustre third-quarter results, Mr Zuckerberg omitted any mention of democracy or election integrity. Instead, he expressed a focus on creating innovative products, leading analysts to question Meta's commitment to political accountability. This abrupt change is especially striking for those who recall Mr Zuckerberg's frequent reassurances about safeguarding the electoral process and combating misinformation during key electoral periods.</p>

<h2><strong>How Silicon Valley Votes</strong></h2>

<p>In Silicon Valley, once a liberal stronghold, tech elites are increasingly expressing support for Mr Trump. In 2016, nearly all political contributions from Silicon Valley went to Hillary Clinton. By 2020, tech executives intensified their efforts to defeat Mr Trump, except for a handful of contrarians. But something has changed.</p>

<p>As reported by the Wall Street Journal, Mr Musk pledged $45 million per month to a pro-Trump super Political Action Committee (PAC) starting in July. &nbsp;Other tech heavyweights like David Sacks, a former critic of Mr Trump's actions surrounding the January 6 Capitol riot, have also thrown their weight behind the former president.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/5jp369v8_jeff-bezos_625x300_03_July_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>In Silicon Valley's heartlands of San Mateo and Santa Clara counties, more than half of voters remain registered Democrats as of 2022, with Republicans making up just 15 per cent. Historically, venture capitalists and tech executives overwhelmingly supported Democratic candidates. According to a Wired analysis, Democrats received $2 for every dollar sent to Republicans from the 20 most active political contributors in Silicon Valley. This remains consistent with a 2017 study showing tech elites favouring progressive policies, from wealth redistribution to immigration reform.</p>

<p>However, there's one key issue where tech moguls diverge from the Democratic platform - government regulation. As Biden ramps up antitrust lawsuits against major tech companies, including Apple, Alphabet (Google's parent), Meta, and Amazon, some Silicon Valley elites are gravitating toward Mr Trump, whose economic stance and promises of lighter regulatory burdens appear more appealing to them.</p>

<p>The administration's crackdown on crypto, including lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance, has also nudged crypto moguls toward the Republican camp.</p>

<p>Amazon chief Jeff Bezos, who has kept a more subdued profile, faced his own controversy when he abruptly cancelled The Washington Post's endorsement of Democratic nominee Kamala Harris - a decision that prompted a mass cancellation by Post subscribers.</p>

<p>The repercussions of Mr Bezos's decision were immediate: nearly a quarter-million Post readers ended their subscriptions, perceiving the move as an attempt to appease Mr Trump. While Mr Bezos denies any political intent, many of The Post's loyal readers have their doubts, especially as it has often been critical of Mr Trump's policies.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Sam Altman, co-founder of ChatGPT's parent company Open AI, has consistently donated to Democrat politicians since 2013, as per data from OpenSecrets. Mr Altman has reportedly donated over $1 million to Democratic candidates in his home state California alone.</p>

<h2><strong>2024: What's The Endgame</strong></h2>

<p>For months, Mr Musk has used X to promote conservative causes, and push conspiracy theories, often targeting immigration policies and railing against what he calls the "woke mind virus." However, his endorsement of Mr Trump and participation in his public rallies signals Mr Musk's deeper engagement in US politics.</p>

<p>Election officials in critical battleground states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Arizona are grappling with a surge in election misinformation emanating from X. Mr Musk's amplification of debunked election claims is posing a serious challenge for officials trying to maintain public trust in the voting process. Despite multiple attempts to fact-check Mr Musk in real time, election officials find themselves repeatedly outmatched. According to CNN, Stephen Richer, an Arizona election official, has even sent personal notes to Mr Musk, urging him to curb the spread of falsehoods.</p>

<p>Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson has been one of the few officials able to counter Mr Musk's claims on X effectively. After Mr Musk posted inaccurate claims about Michigan's voter registration, Ms Benson's fact-check reached over 33 million views. But even this effort led Mr Musk to retaliate, accusing her of lying.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><span class="ins_instory_span_credit">Photo Credit: AFP </span></p>
</div>

<p>In other battleground states like Georgia, officials are forgoing attempts to engage with Mr Musk directly, instead holding regular press conferences to counter misinformation. As the election nears, officials are increasingly concerned about the unchecked spread of falsehoods on X, which they fear could lead to voter confusion and legal challenges post-election.</p>

<p>Beyond misinformation, Mr Musk has been accused of turning X into an echo chamber for conservative voices, reinstating White supremacists and conspiracy theorists while clamping down on content that challenges right-wing narratives.</p>

<p>Mr Musk's endorsement of Mr Trump goes beyond shared political ideologies. His vast business empire - spanning Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and X-relies heavily on government contracts, subsidies, and favourable policies. Should Mr Trump return to the White House, the tech billionaire stands to gain access to even more significant opportunities.</p>

<p>Mr Musk is building what he calls the "world's largest supercomputer" in Memphis for his AI startup, xAI. This high-stakes project, however, has raised eyebrows and concerns over its secrecy and potential impacts on local resources. According to a Forbes report, neither Memphis residents nor city council members were informed until the project was well underway, despite xAI's rapid progress and heavy resource demands.</p>

<p>The report claims that six months ago, Mr Musk's representatives held confidential meetings with local and federal law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Memphis Police Department. Organised by the Greater Memphis Chamber, the discussions around the project required attendees to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) with CTC Property, a shell company managed by Mr Musk's close advisor Jared Birchall. Known for overseeing Mr Musk's ventures from SpaceX to Neuralink, Mr Birchall has reportedly enforced similar confidentiality on other Musk-led projects across the US</p>

<p>In just four months, xAI's Memphis facility - dubbed "Colossus" - went online in a repurposed factory near the Mississippi River. This massive supercomputer will draw enough power for 100,000 homes and requires more than a million gallons of water daily for cooling. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), which will provide up to 150 megawatts of electricity, is now developing an entirely new substation to meet xAI's needs. TVA has not commented on its agreements with xAI, and it remains unclear if it signed an NDA with Mr Musk's team.</p>

<p>The handling of Mr Musk's project adds to the growing list of NDAs shielding corporate projects from public scrutiny. According to Forbes, in Texas and Nevada, Mr Musk's companies used similar agreements to conceal key details from state officials.</p>

<p>A key element of Mr Musk's potential influence under a Trump presidency is the proposal that he lead a government efficiency commission. During their August conversation, Mr Musk suggested the creation of such a commission to rein in government spending, offering his expertise in cost-cutting. Mr Trump responded enthusiastically, praising the Tesla chief as the "greatest cutter" of jobs and budgets.</p>

<p>It is not the first time that a call for an "efficiency commission" has been made. Former President Ronald Reagan established a similar body called the Grace Commission during his presidency between 1981-89.</p>

<p>If Mr Musk were to head such a commission, he would gain a direct role in shaping federal spending priorities, giving him unprecedented influence over the government's financial policies. This would also put him in a position to shape regulations that could benefit his own companies. SpaceX, for example, depends on federal contracts for rocket launches, while Tesla benefits from tax credits and subsidies for electric vehicles. Mr Musk's involvement in government could give him the power to shape rules in ways that favour his business ventures.</p>

<p>According to the New York Times, SpaceX and Tesla have secured at least $15 billion in government contracts over the last decade.</p>

<p>Mr Musk's foray into national politics is not entirely unexpected. His personal and business ethos have always been aligned with a libertarian, anti-regulation philosophy. He has frequently clashed with government oversight, particularly in California, where he fought against public health restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic and has sparred with labour interests.</p>

<p>But Washington is a different arena. The federal government's bureaucracy, regulations, and competing interests present a more complicated landscape than the world of Silicon Valley startups and high-tech innovation. Mr Musk's potential role in a future Trump administration could place him at the intersection of business, politics, and governance in unprecedented ways.</p>

<p>Critics argue that Mr Musk's history as a contrarian and his approach to leadership, which has often involved drastic cost-cutting and labour disputes, may not translate well into the political sphere.</p>

<p>Mr Musk's political clout has grown significantly since his purchase of X. While his platform has lost value, with investors reportedly losing over $24 billion, Mr Musk's influence in conservative political circles has increased. His willingness to leverage X as a political tool, combined with his ability to engage with Mr Trump and other political figures directly, positions Mr Musk as an unexpected player in the upcoming election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris courted voters angered by the Gaza war while Donald Trump doubled down on violent rhetoric with a comment about journalists being shot as the tense US election campaign entered its final hours.</p>

<p>The Democratic vice president and the Republican former president frantically blitzed several swing states as they tried to win over the last holdouts with less than 36 hours left until polls open on Election Day on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Trump predicted a "landslide", while Harris told a raucous rally in must-win Michigan that "we have momentum -- it's on our side."</p>

<p>The 2024 race is going down to the wire, with more key states effectively tied at this point than in any comparable election. Over 77.6 million people have cast early votes, around half of the total ballots cast in 2020.</p>

<p>With the clock ticking, Harris, 60, spent the day in Michigan where she risks losing the critical support of a 200,000-strong Arab-American community that has denounced US handling of the Israel-Hamas war.</p>

<p>"As president, I will do everything in my power to end the war in Gaza," Harris said at the start of her speech at Michigan State University, noting that there were leaders of the community present.</p>

<p><strong>'Demonic'</strong></p>

<p>But the rest of the speech was upbeat, with Harris spending more time on urging people to get out and vote than on attacks on Trump.</p>

<p>"We got two days to get this done," she said.</p>

<p>Earlier, Harris quoted scripture in a majority-Black church in Detroit, Michigan and urging Americans to look beyond Trump.</p>

<p>"Let us turn the page and write the next chapter of our history," she said.</p>

<p>Trump on Sunday zigzagged through Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia -- the three biggest swing-state prizes in the Electoral College system that awards US states influence according to their population.</p>

<p>The 78-year-old Trump, the oldest major party candidate in US history, added to his increasingly dark rhetoric by musing to supporters in Lititz, Pennsylvania, that he wouldn't mind if journalists were shot.</p>

<p>Discussing his the near-miss assassination attempt against him in July, he said to laughter that to be hit again "somebody would have to shoot through the fake news -- and I don't mind that so much."</p>

<p>Trump called Democrats "demonic" and, despite no evidence of any meaningful election cheating so far, claimed that Democrats in Pennsylvania "are fighting so hard to steal this damn thing."</p>

<p>Adding to fears that he would not accept a defeat in 2024, Trump added that he "shouldn't have left" the White House after he lost his 2020 reelection effort to Joe Biden.</p>

<p><strong>RFK Jr controversy</strong></p>

<p>Trump meanwhile said in Macon, Georgia, that he had asked vaccine-skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who dropped his own presidential bid to support Trump, to work on "women's health" and "pesticides."</p>

<p>His comments came a day after Kennedy caused consternation by saying that a Trump White House would order US water systems to remove fluoride from public water supplies.</p>

<p>Later in another rambling speech in Kinston, North Carolina Trump said "we're going to have on Tuesday a landslide that's too big to rig."</p>

<p>The polls however show that the result is likely to be historically tight.</p>

<p>A final New York Times/Siena poll Sunday flagged incremental changes in swing states, but the results from all seven remained within the margin of error.</p>

<p>Harris got a boost Saturday as the final Des Moines Register poll for Iowa -- seen as a highly credible test of wider public sentiment -- showed a stunning turnaround, with Harris ahead in a state won easily by Trump in 2016 and 2020.</p>

<p>In the last hours, both candidates are desperately trying to shore up their bases, and win over any undecided voters.</p>

<p>Pollsters have noted an erosion in Black support for Harris.</p>

<p>But with abortion rights a top voter concern, her campaign has hailed the large proportion of women turning out among early voters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All eyes are on the US elections 2024. Ahead of the November 5 voting, former President Donald Trump is leading the predictions, especially in all seven swing states, shows <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://file:///C:/Users/aasthaa/Downloads/Atlas%20Poll%20US%20Elections%20National%20-%2002%20Nov%202024.pdf" rel="nofollow,noindex">AtlasIntel's latest poll</a>.</p>

<p>About 49% of the respondents said they would vote for Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential election, the poll shows, as the Republicans hold a 1.8% vote lead over his counterpart Democrat Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>The survey conducted on the first two days of November included nearly 2,500 likely voters in the US, the majority female.</p>

<p>As the 2024 Presidential Election heads into its final days the focus is on swing states, the battleground states which are the major deciders of the US presidential election.</p>

<p>Another <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://file:///C:/Users/aasthaa/Downloads/Atlas%20Poll%20-%20US%20Swing%20States%20-%2002-11-2024.pdf" rel="nofollow,noindex">survey of swing states</a> has revealed that the Republican nominee is favored to win in all swing states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>In Arizona, Trump holds his widest margin — with a 51.9% to 45.1% lead over Harris.</p>

<p>In Nevada, when asked whom would people vote for in the upcoming presidential election, 51.4% of voters chose Trump while 45.9% chose Harris.</p>

<p>In North Carolina, Trump leads by 50.4% of votes, while Harris gets 46.8% of the vote share.</p>

<p>In the US, presidential elections are shaped by three types of states: Red States, Blue States, and Swing States. Red States are those where Republicans have consistently won since 1980, while Blue States are where Democrats have dominated since 1992. These states are generally considered predictable in terms of their electoral outcomes.</p>

<p>In Swing states, the battle between Republicans and Democrats is often extremely close, with winners prevailing by tiny margins. For instance, in the 2020 presidential election, Joe Biden won Arizona by just 10,000 votes.</p>

<p>A <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/days-ahead-of-2024-us-presidential-elections-poll-shows-kamala-harris-leading-donald-trump-by-single-point-6904709">Reuters/Ipsos poll</a> published last week on October 29 showed Kamala Harris lead over Donald Trump, with the Democrat ahead by a single percentage point over the Republican, 44% to 43%.</p>

<p>Interestingly, while Harris has led Trump in every Reuters/Ipsos poll of registered voters since she entered the race in July, her lead has steadily shrunk since late September.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Upholding the right to practice religion "freely and safely", Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday called the violence at a Hindu temple near Toronto "unacceptable".</p>

<p>Heavy police deployment was seen at the Hindu Sabha temple in Brampton after skirmishes blamed by some leaders on Sikh activists. In videos that went viral, some men were seen breaching the gates of the temple and assaulting devotees inside the complex.</p>

<p>A spokesman for the Peel Regional Police told AFP that no arrests had been made. Police have also declined to assign blame for the reported violence.</p>

<p>Canada MP Chandra Arya said the incident showed how "deep and brazen" violent extremism has become in Canada. "Hindu-Canadians, for the security and safety of our community, &nbsp;need to step up and asserts their rights and hold politicians accountable," the member of Trudeau's Liberal Party wrote. He also alleged that extremist elements have infiltrated both the political apparatus and law enforcement agencies of Canada.</p>

<p>The Mayor of Brampton Patrick Brown, meanwhile, called for punishment to the "greatest extent of law" for those held accountable for the violence. "Religious freedom is a foundational value in Canada. &nbsp;Everyone should feel safe in their place of worship," he wrote in a post on X.</p>

<p>While Canadian opposition leader Pierre Poilievre promised to unite the people and end the chaos, Toronto MP Kevin Vuong asserted that "Canada has become a safe harbour for radicals". Sharing a post on X, Vuong wrote, "Our leaders are failing to safeguard Hindus as they have Christians and Jewish Canadians from violence. We all deserve to worship in peace."</p>

<p>The violence comes amid ongoing diplomatic back and forth between India and Canada, including expulsion of diplomats. On Saturday, Ottawa named New Delhi as a cyberthreat adversary, suggesting that state-sponsored actors could be spying against it.</p>

<p>These actions come after Canada accused the Indian government of orchestrating the 2023 killing in Vancouver of 45-year-old naturalized Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a prominent Khalistan activist. It has also accused India of directing a broad campaign targeting Sikh activists on Canadian soil, which Ottawa says has included intimidation, threats and violence.</p>

<p>Last year, a Hindu temple in Windsor suffered defacement with anti-India graffiti, sparking widespread condemnation and calls for action from both Canadian and Indian officials. Earlier incidents in Mississauga and Brampton saw temples similarly targeted, drawing strong reactions from the Indian community in Canada</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Senator and Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance has waxed lyrical about the appeal of Indian vegetarian cuisine during his recent sit-down podcast interview on <em>The Joe Rogan Experience</em>. During the three-hour conversation with Rogan, Vance highlighted his culinary journey into Indian cuisine which has been hugely influenced by his Indian-American wife, Usha Vance. The duo were discussing the harmful effects of processed meats which Rogan described as "highly processed garbage". Mr Vance then chimed in with the benefits of adopting an Indian vegetarian diet.</p>

<p>"If you want to eat vegetables and be vegetarian, eat Indian food. They make really delicious vegetarian food," Mr Rogan said.</p>

<p>The Ohio senator agreed and shared how Usha's Indian heritage had opened him to the world of vegetarian food. "My wife is Indian-American, and the vegetarian food she makes is exceptional," Mr Vance remarked.</p>

<p>"For any vegetarian out there, indulge in paneer, rice, and chickpeas. Skip the nasty fake meat. If you want to embrace a vegetarian lifestyle, turn to Indian cuisine. It offers wonderful vegetarian options," he added.</p>

<p>The Republican leader also recalled an early attempt at impressing Usha with homemade vegetarian food which didn't go as he had planned.</p>

<p>"I rolled out a flat thing of crescent rolls. I put raw broccoli on top of it. I sprinkled ranch dressing, and I stuck them in the oven for 45 minutes." The result, he said, was "disgusting".&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Usha Vance on JD's vegetarian diet</strong></h2>

<p>Notably, during the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee earlier this year, Usha Vance revealed that her husband had adopted her vegetarian diet and learned to cook Indian food from her mother, integrating seamlessly into her family.</p>

<p>"That JD and I could meet at all, let alone fall in love and marry, is a testament to this great country. It is also a testament to JD," said Usha Vance, who described JD as a "meat and potatoes" kind of guy.</p>

<p>"It's hard to imagine a more powerful example of the American dream, a boy from Middletown, Ohio raised by his grandmother through tough times, chosen to help lead our country through some of its greatest challenges," she added.</p>

<p>Usha Vance and JD met at the Yale University in 2014 while pursuing their law degree. JD's memoir describes Usha as his "Yale spirit guide" who helped him navigate life at the elite varsity. The couple has three children together.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just days before the presidential election, former US President Donald Trump rallied in Kinston, North Carolina, and targeted Vice-President Kamala Harris by saying that "if elected, Harris would open the border, allowing an influx of migrants, gangs, and criminals into the country".</p>

<p>He said that Harris "has no vision, no ideas, and no solutions," and that her only message is blaming him for various issues.</p>

<p>Addressing the rally, Trump said, "Everything Kamala says is a lie--she has no vision, no ideas, and no solutions. All she can say is, 'Donald Trump did this, Donald Trump did that.'"</p>

<p>He added, "If she ever won, she would open the border on the first day. I don't know why, nobody knows why. If I win, the American people will be the rulers of this country again. Kamala has violated her oath, eradicated our sovereign border, and unleashed an army of gangs and criminal migrants from prisons and jails, insane asylums, and mental institutions around the world."</p>

<p>Trump's speech emphasised his commitment to restoring the prosperity and security of the US.</p>

<p>He promised to cut taxes for workers and small businesses and eliminate taxes on tips, overtime, and social security for senior citizens.</p>

<p>He also vowed to end the "migrant invasion" and restore America's sovereignty.</p>

<p>"The day I take the oath of office, the migrant invasion ends, and the restoration of our country begins. My plan will massively cut taxes for workers, and small businesses. There will be no taxes on tips, no tax on overtime, and for our seniors, no tax on social security," Trump said.</p>

<p>Stepping up his criticism of Harris' handling of the country's economy, Trump said, "Kamala talks about fixing the economy. She is in the office. Why is she not doing it now... Her plan will impose the largest tax hike in American history and raise taxes on the typical American family by more than $3,000 dollars a year."</p>

<p>The Republican candidate further said that he would work towards making the US wealthy and affordable again.</p>

<p>"We will make America wealthy again, and we will make America affordable again... We are two days away from the best jobs, the biggest paychecks, and the brightest economic future the world has ever seen," Trump said.</p>

<p>He added, "This is all you need to know: Kamala broke it, I will fix it. America will be bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer and stronger than ever before. This election is a choice between whether we will have four more years of incompetency and failure or whether we will gain the four greatest years of America in history. Four years of Kamala have delivered nothing but economic hell for American workers."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in New Delhi, spiritual leader Mahamandelshwar Swami Vedmutinand Saraswati performed hawan and rituals for the victory of Trump in the upcoming US elections.</p>

<p>The US presidential elections are set to take place on November 5, with Vice-President Kamala Harris contesting against former US President and Republican candidate Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Trump is aiming to make a comeback to the White House after his bitter exit last time, while Harris is aiming to create history by becoming the first woman president of the US.</p>

<p>A recent poll conducted by the New York Times and Siena College showed Harris and Trump tied at 48 per cent in the popular vote.</p>

<p>The two leaders remain tied even after three months of the most tumultuous months in the recent political history of the US.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States will on Tuesday witness one of the closest presidential elections in decades with Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic leader Kamala Harris making last ditch efforts to sway the remaining undecided voters in key battleground states.</p>

<p>More than 75 million Americans have already cast their votes as of Sunday, according to the University of Florida's Election Lab that tracks early and mail-in voting across the US.</p>

<p>With just two days left for the national election day, Vice President Harris and former President Donald Trump are criss-crossing politically pivotal battleground states making closing arguments to drum up support.</p>

<p>Various polls have predicted an exceptionally tight race between Harris and Trump. Political analysts say either of the two leaders wrestling at least four of the seven battleground states can take the reins at the White House in January.</p>

<p>In questioning the counting process in the 2020 presidential election, Trump said at a rally in Pennsylvania on Sunday that he shouldn't have "left" the White House, bringing back apprehensions that he may not accept the outcome if he loses the race to Harris.</p>

<p>In his address, Trump also questioned the immigration policy of the Biden administration and said the country's borders were safe till he was at the White House.</p>

<p>"We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left. I shouldn't have left. I mean, honestly, because... we did so well," the former President said at a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Trump refused to concede the 2020 election and unsuccessfully filed a series of court cases in challenging the outcome.</p>

<p>In the rally, Trump also targeted Harris and accused the Democratic Party of being a "corrupt machine".</p>

<p>"It's all corrupt. She is corrupt. She is a corrupt person. I am running against a totally corrupt person," he alleged.</p>

<p>"I am really not running against her. I am running against a corrupt machine called the Democrat Party." Pennsylvania has emerged as the most crucial of the seven battleground states having 19 electoral college votes followed by 16 each in North Carolina and Georgia, 15 in Michigan and 11 in Arizona. In other battleground states, Wisconsin has 10 and Nevada has six.</p>

<p>In the rally in Pennsylvania, Trump promised to usher in "a new golden age" in the US if he becomes the president and that he will "fix the misdeeds" of the Biden-Harris administration.</p>

<p>Trump is also holding rallies in North Carolina and Georgia while Harris is touring Michigan.</p>

<p>In her address at an event in Detroit, Harris said it is incumbent on the American people to decide the future course the United States takes, suggesting that Trump would be detrimental to the country.</p>

<p>Election Day offers voters the chance to reject "chaos, fear and hate", she said.</p>

<p>"In two days, we have the power to decide the fate of our nation for generations to come," she said.</p>

<p>"I see a nation determined to turn the page on hate and division and chart a new way forward. As I travel, I see Americans from so-called red states and so-called blue states who are ready to bend the arc of history toward justice," Harris added.</p>

<p>The Democratic Party leader also invoked God and said His plan is to "heal us and bring us together as one nation" but that it is not enough, adding "we must act" to realise the plan.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A UCSF study involving 20,880 people across 106 countries has found a possible connection between depression and elevated body temperatures.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recent research from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) has revealed a significant link between depression and body temperature, offering fresh perspectives on possible treatment approaches.</p>

<p>Over the course of seven months, data from 20,880 people in 106 countries was gathered and examined for the study. According to the research, some people may have greater body temperatures than others when they are depressed.</p>

<p>The study is among the biggest to investigate this field because earlier research was sometimes constrained by small sample sizes. The association found may pave the way for more research, even if the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2024/01/427051/are-body-temperature-and-depression-linked-science-says-yes">UCSF study</a> does not conclusively demonstrate that depression causes elevated body temperature or that depression causes elevated body temperature.</p>

<p>The findings shed light on how a novel depression treatment method might work, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2024/01/427051/are-body-temperature-and-depression-linked-science-says-yes">said Ashley Mason</a>, PhD, the study's lead author and associate professor of psychiatry at UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences. A small body of existing, causal studies has found that using hot tubs or saunas can reduce depression, possibly by triggering the body to self-cool, for example, through sweating.</p>

<p>"Ironically, heating people up actually can lead to rebound body temperature lowering that lasts longer than simply cooling people down directly, as through an ice bath," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2024/01/427051/are-body-temperature-and-depression-linked-science-says-yes">said Mason</a>, who is also a clinical psychologist at the UCSF Osher Centre for Integrative Health. "What if we can track the body temperature of people with depression to time heat-based treatments well?"</p>

<p>"To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date to examine the association between body temperature-assessed using both self-report methods and wearable sensors-and depressive symptoms in a geographically broad sample," added Mason. "Given the climbing rates of depression in the United States, we're excited by the possibilities of a new avenue for treatment."</p>

<p>This new connection may result in easy ways to treat the symptoms of depression. The treatment of millions of people worldwide may change if more research confirms the notion that cooling therapy may help those suffering from depression.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The streets of Paiporta, Spain, were blazing with rage and frustration on Sunday when King Felipe VI arrived to inspect the damage from the unprecedented flash floods that killed more than 200 people earlier in the week, according to <em>The Guardian.</em></p>

<p>As the king's entourage tried to manage the situation, a chaotic scene unfolded with crowds throwing mud and objects and shouting insults. Protesters yelled "Murderers!" and "Get out!" in response to the king's presence.</p>

<p>With calls for the resignation of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and Valencia regional head Carlos Mazon, a large portion of the fury appeared to be directed at elected leaders. Bodyguards used umbrellas to protect Sanchez and his group from the mud and debris as they swiftly departed the scene.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/03/residents-throw-mud-and-insults-at-spanish-king-on-visit-to-flood-hit-town"><em>The Guardian,</em></a> the public rage came as the death toll from the floods climbed to 217. As the meteorological agency on Sunday again issued a red alert, forecasting further heavy rain in the area, mayors from the affected municipalities pleaded with officials to send help.</p>

<p>"We're very angry, and we're devastated," said Guillermo Lujan, the mayor of Aldaia. "We have a town in ruins. We need to start over, and I'm begging for help. Please help us."</p>

<p>The town's 33,000 residents were among many in the region grappling with the aftermath of the ferocious floods that rank as the deadliest in Spain's modern history. The number of people missing remains unknown.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>"Swing states" - the elephant in the room is the major decider of the United States presidential election. Also known as battleground states, these states can make or break any candidate.</p>

<p>Historically speaking, in the United States, presidential elections are often shaped by three types of states: Red States, Blue States, and Swing States. Red States are those where Republicans have consistently won since 1980, while Blue States are where Democrats have dominated since 1992. These states are generally considered predictable in terms of their electoral outcomes.</p>

<p>However, Swing States are a different story altogether. Here, the battle between Republicans and Democrats is often extremely close, with winners prevailing by tiny margins. For instance, in the 2020 presidential election, Joe Biden won Arizona by just 10,000 votes.</p>

<p>Around 10 states have been considered swing states, but for the 2024 election, the key swing states to watch are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Interestingly, candidates often focus their campaigns on these swing states, spending disproportionate amounts of time to win these states.</p>

<p>According to polls taken by YouGov till 31st October, Vice President Kamala Harris leads by small margins in Wisconsin (4 percentage points), Pennsylvania (+3), Michigan (+3), and Nevada (+1). Trump barely leads in North Carolina (+1) and Georgia (+1) and Arizona is tied.</p>

<p>Georgia</p>

<p>Biden's 2020 victory marked the first Democratic win in Georgia since 1992. The state's shifting demographics, particularly its growing diversity and expanding population of over 10 million, are expected to benefit Kamala Harris, who has actively courted minority voters. However, the 2024 election has revealed an unexpected trend: Vice President Kamala Harris is performing stronger in predominantly white states like Michigan and Wisconsin, while more diverse states are slightly favoring former President Donald Trump. This surprising dynamic is also evident in Georgia, highlighting a shift in traditional voting patterns.</p>

<p>Nevada</p>

<p>Nevada may hold the key to winning the presidential election, despite having only six electoral votes. Its diverse population, with 40% of eligible voters identifying as Latino, Black, or Asian American Pacific Islanders, could play a crucial role. Historically, these groups have shown stronger support for Kamala Harris than Donald Trump. However, economic concerns such as the rising cost of living, inflation, and immigration may shift the tide in Trump's favor.</p>

<p>Michigan</p>

<p>Michigan, a state with 15 electoral votes, has traditionally been a Democratic stronghold, but Donald Trump's 2016 win shook things up. His appeal to white working-class voters secured his victory, dealing a surprise blow to Hillary Clinton's campaign. Fast forward to 2024, and Michigan's diversity could give Kamala Harris an edge, particularly since it's more diverse than other contested "blue wall" states. However, there is work involved when it comes to the Arab-American side of the state as they have expressed dissatisfaction with the way the war in Gaza has been handled by the Biden administration.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania</p>

<p>Pennsylvania, once a reliable Democratic stronghold, has become a fiercely contested battleground state. It has 19 electoral college votes and is the most coveted by both the parties. The state's transformation is rooted in its economic challenges, particularly the decline of its industrial manufacturing base in "Rust Belt" cities like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. This decline has left many residents seeking change and opportunity. Both Trump and Harris have frequently campaigned in the state, addressing key issues like infrastructure and manufacturing.</p>

<p>Arizona</p>

<p>Arizona was a nail-biter in the 2020 presidential election, with Biden securing a narrow victory of just 10,457 votes. Now, Trump is banking on voter dissatisfaction with the Biden-Harris administration's immigration policies to turn the state red again. As Arizona shares a border with Mexico, immigration is a hot-button issue, and Trump hopes to capitalise on frustrations with the current administration.</p>

<p>North Carolina</p>

<p>North Carolina, once a reliable Republican stronghold in presidential elections, is now a toss-up state due to its rapidly shifting demographics. Historically, the state voted Republican for most of the last half-century, with the notable exception of Barack Obama's win in 2008. However, the state's population growth, particularly in the Research Triangle, has brought an influx of white, college-educated voters, Latinos, Asian Americans, and a significant Black population, making up about 1 in 5 voters.</p>

<p>Wisconsin</p>

<p>Trump considers Wisconsin winnable and has taken steps to demonstrate his commitment to the state. The Republican Party even held its national convention there over the summer. Initially, Trump held a lead against Biden, but Kamala Harris has since closed the gap, making the state a nail-biting contest.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India, which is on the path of growth, wants to grow with the world, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Sunday, stressing that there is genuine goodwill and desire among nations to work with India.</p>

<p>Mr. Jaishankar arrived here earlier in the day on the first leg of his two-nation tour which will also take him to Singapore.</p>

<p>"Namaste Australia! Landed in Brisbane today. Look forward to productive engagements over the next few days to take forward the India-Australia Dosti," he posted on X.</p>

<p>Addressing the Indian community here, Mr. Jaishankar said: "India will grow. India is growing, but India wants to grow with the world."</p>

<p>When India looks at the world, it sees opportunities, he said.</p>

<p>"We are optimistic. There may be problems, but overall, we think the world has goodwill and a desire to work with India. We see a sentiment overall in the world for India to succeed and it's important we harness that sentiment," Jaishankar said.</p>

<p>He mentioned that there are numerous opportunities for global cooperation in the fields of education and research.</p>

<p>"The image today of Indians abroad, the image of being well educated, of being personally responsible, the work ethic, the family-centric nature of our lives. I think the combination of all of this today makes us very, very attractive in the global workplace," he said.</p>

<p>"And I think it's important that that brand is developed, that those skills are nurtured...And again, I emphasise that this era, you know, this era of AI, of electric mobility, of chips, this will require a global workforce," he added.</p>

<p>During his visit, Mr. Jaishankar will inaugurate India's fourth consulate in Australia in Brisbane.</p>

<p>He will also co-chair the 15th Foreign Ministers' Framework Dialogue (FMFD) with his Australian counterpart Penny Wong in Canberra.</p>

<p>He will deliver the keynote address at the inaugural session of the 2nd Raisina Down Under to be held in the Australian Parliament House.</p>

<p>He is also scheduled to have interactions with Australian leadership, parliamentarians, the business community, media and think tanks.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India and China have made "some progress" in disengagement, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Sunday, describing the development as a "welcome" step.</p>

<p>His comment comes days after Indian and Chinese troops completed disengagement at two friction points at Demchok and Depsang Plains in eastern Ladakh. The Indian Army commenced verification patrolling at Depsang, while patrolling at Demchok had begun on Friday.</p>

<p>"In terms of India and China, we have made some progress. You know, our relations were very, very disturbed for reasons all of you know. We have made some progress in what we call disengagement," Mr. Jaishankar said while responding to a question during an interaction with the Indian diaspora here.</p>

<p>"There are very large numbers of Chinese troops deployed along the Line of Actual Control who were not there before 2020 and we, in turn, have counter-deployed. There are other aspects of the relationship which also got affected during during this period. So clearly, we have to see after the disengagement, what is the direction we go. But we do think the disengagement is a welcome step. It opens up the possibility that you know, other steps could happen," said the minister.</p>

<p>He said that the expectation after Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Russia last month was that "both the national security advisor and myself, we would meet our counterpart. So that's really where things are".</p>

<p>On October 21, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said in Delhi that an agreement had been finalised between India and China following negotiations over the past several weeks and that it would lead to a resolution of the issues that arose in 2020.</p>

<p>The agreement was firmed up on patrolling and disengagement of troops along the LAC in eastern Ladakh, a breakthrough to end the over four-year standoff.</p>

<p>The ties between the two Asian giants nosedived following a fierce clash in the Galwan Valley in June 2020 that marked the most serious military conflict between the two sides in decades.</p>

<p>Mr. Jaishankar arrived here earlier in the day on the first leg of his two-nation tour which will also take him to Singapore.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris and Donald Trump began a frantic last push across US swing states Sunday, with less than 48 hours of campaigning left to secure a decisive edge in a bitterly fought and historically close presidential election.</p>

<p>Over 75 million people have cast early ballots ahead of Tuesday's climax and the race is down to the wire -- with more states functionally tied in polls at this point than in any comparable election.</p>

<p>The closeness of the race is all the more remarkable given its dramatic twists -- including an assassination bid and Harris's stunning late entrance -- and the fact that the candidates could hardly be further apart in their campaign styles and visions for the future.</p>

<p>A final New York Times/Siena poll on Sunday flagged some incremental changes in the key battleground states, but the results from all seven remained firmly within the margin of error.</p>

<p>Harris -- desperate to shore up the Great Lakes states seen as essential to any Democratic ticket -- was to spend the day in Michigan, beginning in Detroit before a stop in Pontiac and an evening rally at Michigan State University.</p>

<p>Trump's Sunday timetable centers on Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia, the three biggest prizes in the "Electoral College" system that awards states influence according to their population.</p>

<p>The 78-year-old has been scrambling to distract from the now week-long scandal around his rally at New York's iconic Madison Square Garden in which warm-up speakers alienated Hispanics and women with racist and sexist language.</p>

<p>Trump surrogates winced at the unforced error, which looked especially unprofessional when contrasted with Harris's address to a massive, jubilant crowd in Washington, with the White House providing the backdrop.</p>

<p>None of Trump's Sunday events take place in areas with large Hispanic populations but Pennsylvania is the swing state with the most Puerto Ricans, a community particularly angered by the bigotry at Trump's rally.</p>

<p><strong>Final polls</strong></p>

<p>Michigan is one of the seven closely watched battlegrounds.</p>

<p>Trump flipped the state, a former Democratic stronghold, on his way to defeating Hillary Clinton in 2016. Joe Biden returned it to the Democratic column in 2020, buoyed by unionized workers and a large Black community.</p>

<p>But this time, Harris risks losing the support of a 200,000-strong Arab-American community that has denounced Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.</p>

<p>Pollsters have noted an erosion in Black support for the Democratic ticket and Harris's aides acknowledge that they still have work to do to turn out enough African American men to match Biden's winning coalition in 2020.</p>

<p>But with reproductive rights emerging as a top voter concern, her campaign has taken some comfort from the large proportion of women turning out among the early voters.</p>

<p>In a bid to reach out beyond her traditional support bases, Harris wrapped a day on the campaign trail Saturday with a surprise appearance on "Saturday Night Live," mocking her presidential election rival Donald Trump on the iconic sketch show.</p>

<p>"Keep Kamala and carry on-ala!" the vice president said in a well-received appearance alongside Maya Rudolph, the comedian who has been playing her as "America's fun aunt" on the show.</p>

<p>Keen on as much TV exposure as possible, the Harris campaign has booked a two-minute spot to air during Sunday's NFL football games, including the matchup between the Green Bay Packers and Detroit Lions, both from crucial swing states.</p>

<p>In the ad, Harris pledges to be "a president for all Americans" and promises to "build a brighter future for our nation."</p>

<p>Her campaign said its own research shows the "last week has proven decisive in cementing the choice in this election with both undecided and lower-propensity voters," particularly the contrast of two candidates' closing argument rallies.</p>

<p>Harris, 60, got a boost Saturday as the final Des Moines Register poll before Election Day -- seen as a highly credible test of wider public sentiment -- showed a stunning turnaround, with Harris ahead in a state won easily by Trump in 2016 and 2020.</p>

<p>She leads by three points in a poll that showed her trailing Trump by four points in September.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vice President Kamala Harris made a surprise appearance on "Saturday Night Live" just days before the election, playing herself alongside Maya Rudolph's impression of her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The audience erupted in cheers as Harris, dressed identically to Rudolph, said, "It is nice to see you, Kamala. And I'm just here to remind you, you got this."</p>

<p>The two then delivered a synchronised message, urging supporters to "Keep Kamala and carry-on-ala" and expressing their shared "belief in the promise of America." They wrapped up the sketch with the iconic "Live from New York, it's Saturday night!"</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="tl">Kamala Harris talks to Kamala Harris <a href="https://t.co/AJuW7aO7VM">pic.twitter.com/AJuW7aO7VM</a></p>
— Saturday Night Live - SNL (@nbcsnl) <a href="https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/1852921270159163900?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 3, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>The episode, hosted by John Mulaney and featuring musical guest Chappell Roan, shifted focus away from politics after Harris's opening segment. Harris left after the opening segment and told reporters, “It was fun!” as she boarded the plane to leave New York.</p>

<p>Mulaney talked about his personal life, while Roan performed her hit "Pink Pony Club". Some half expected her to discuss her political views as she had earlier declined to endorse Harris and was critical about the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>Other notable appearances included Senator Tim Kaine in a game-show sketch, where contestants struggled to remember him as Hillary Clinton's running mate in 2016. Maya Rudolph's impression of Harris has earned critical acclaim, including from Harris herself, who praised Rudolph's spot-on portrayal.</p>

<p>She first played Harris on SNL in 2019 and has brought it back to life this season, doing a spot-on impression of the vice president, including calling herself “Momala” — a nod to the nickname her step-kids gave her.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time politicians have appeared on "SNL." Donald Trump hosted in 2015, Hillary Clinton appeared alongside Amy Poehler in 2008, and Barack Obama made a cameo in 2007. Harris's appearance, however, is notable for its proximity to Election Day.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia's Defence Ministry said on Monday that its forces had taken control of two villages in eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>It was the second day in succession that Moscow has announced the capture of new localities. Ukrainian military statements have, at least in part, denied the Russian assertion.</p>

<p>The Russian ministry said in a statement that its forces were in control of the settlement of Stepova Novoselivka in Kharkiv region, and of Novopokrovske in Donetsk region.</p>

<p>The General Staff of the Ukraine's Armed Forces, in an evening report, said its troops had repelled 17 attacks in the Kupiansk sector near Kharkiv, including by Stepova Novoselivka. It said fighting was raging near Synkivka, further west.</p>

<p>Russia has announced a string of incremental gains since capturing the city of Avdiivka in Donetsk region in February.</p>

<p>Donetsk and Kharkiv regions remain focal points along the 1,000-km (600-mile) front line in Ukraine's east and south.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian military earlier said it had repelled Russian attacks near two towns in Donetsk region -- Novooleksandrivka and Spirne, a day after Russian forces claimed control of them. The evening report said fighting continued near both localities.</p>

<p>The evening report identified the Pokrovsk front as the theatre of the fiercest fighting. Forty-four Russian assaults had been repelled in the last 24 hours, with 14 clashes still going on.</p>

<p>The military said Russia maintained a military presence across the border from Ukraine's northern Chernihiv and Sumy regions, adding that Moscow's forces were increasing the density of minefields and conducting sabotage activities.</p>

<p>That area is under scrutiny for any sign that Russia plans to open a new front to pressure Ukraine's outnumbered defenders.</p>

<p>Russia launched an assault into the border areas of the northeastern region of Kharkiv in May, opening a new front in 28-month full-scale invasion.</p>

<p>The latest Ukrainian report said Kyiv's troops controlled the area and turned back 11 Russian assaults near three towns, including Vovchansk, 5 km (3 miles) from the border.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;A 51-year-old Indian American physician from the Chicago area has pleaded guilty to a federal healthcare fraud by billing Medicaid and private insurers for nonexistent services.</p>

<p>Mona Ghosh, who owns and operates Progressive Women's Healthcare, specialising in obstetrics and gynaecology services, pleaded guilty to two counts of health care fraud.</p>

<p>Each count is punishable by up to ten years in federal prison.</p>

<p>US District Judge Franklin U Valderrama has set sentencing for October 22.</p>

<p>Federal prosecutors allege that Ghosh is accountable for at least $2.4 million in fraudulently obtained reimbursements.</p>

<p>She admitted in her plea agreement that she was accountable for more than $1.5 million of such fraudulently obtained reimbursements.</p>

<p>The final amount will be determined by the court at sentencing, a media release said.</p>

<p>According to court documents, from 2018 to 2022, Ghosh submitted, and caused her employees to submit, fraudulent claims to Medicaid, TRICARE, and numerous other insurers for procedures and services that were not provided or were not medically necessary, some of which were performed without patient consent.</p>

<p>Ghosh also fraudulently overstated the length and complexity of in-office and telemedicine visits and submitted claims using billing codes for which the visits did not qualify in order to seek higher reimbursement rates, her plea agreement states.</p>

<p>She admitted that she had prepared false patient medical records to support the fraudulent reimbursement claims.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 39 people have lost their lives in recent anti-government protests in Kenya against the new tax hike, reported Al Jazeera, citing the national rights watchdog.</p>

<p>The activists have geared up for a new round of protests this week in Kenya.</p>

<p>The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) announced the toll on Monday, which is almost double the figure previously disclosed by the government for those killed while demonstrating against a raft of unpopular tax increases that have now been withdrawn.</p>

<p>KNCHR records further indicated that 39 people have died and 361 have been injured "in relation to the protests countrywide", the state-funded body said in a statement, adding that the figures covered the period from June 18 to July 1, reported Al Jazeera.</p>

<p>It further stated that there had been 32 cases of "enforced or involuntary disappearances" and 627 arrests of protesters.</p>

<p>Moreover, largely peaceful anti-tax rallies, led by mostly young Gen-Z protesters, descended into shocking scenes of deadly violence last Tuesday when lawmakers passed the contentious legislation.<br />
Later, following the announcement of the vote, crowds ransacked the parliament complex in central Nairobi and it was partly set ablaze as police fired live bullets at protesters, as reported by Al Jazeera.</p>

<p>Notably, it is the most serious crisis to be confronted by the government of President William Ruto since he took office in September 2022 following a deeply divisive election in a nation often considered a beacon of stability in a turbulent region.</p>

<p>Ruto, in a televised interview on Sunday, said that 19 people had died in the protests, but insisted that he did not have "blood on my hands" and pledged an investigation into the deaths.<br />
The KNCHR "continues to condemn in the strongest terms possible the unwarranted violence and force that was inflicted on protesters, medical personnel, lawyers, journalists and on safe spaces such as churches, medical emergency centres and ambulances," the rights body said.</p>

<p>"We maintain that the force used against the protesters was excessive and disproportionate," it added.</p>

<p>The watchdog also said that it "strongly condemns the violent and shocking acts of lawlessness that were exhibited by some of the protesters" including the parliament and other government buildings.</p>

<p>Moreover, fresh protests have been called by activists beginning Tuesday despite last week, when Ruto announced that he would not sign into law the bill containing the tax hikes.</p>

<p>Additionally, leaflets have been posted on social media with the hashtags "Occupy Everywhere", "Ruto must go" and "Reject Budgeted Corruption".</p>

<p>India has also issued an advisory for its nationals in Kenya, as protests against a tax hike turned violent, causing a rampage in the African nation.</p>

<p>The Indian Embassy in Kenya earlier advised the Indian nationals there to "exercise utmost caution, restrict non-essential movement and avoid the areas affected by the protests and violence till the situation clears up."</p>

<p>"In view of the prevailing tense situation, all Indians in Kenya are advised to exercise utmost caution, restrict non-essential movement and avoid the areas affected by the protests and violence till the situation clears up," the Embassy stated.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea said it successfully tested a new tactical ballistic missile on Monday capable of carrying a 4.5-ton super-large warhead, official state news agency KCNA reported on Tuesday.</p>

<p>A day earlier, South Korea reported the launch of two ballistic missiles by North Korea and said the second likely failed soon after launch, blowing up in flight over land.</p>

<p>KCNA made no mention of the second missile.</p>

<p>It said the test of the new tactical ballistic missile, which it was named Hwasongpho-11 Da-4.5, was conducted with a simulated heavy warhead to verify flight stability and accuracy.</p>

<p>It did not elaborate on the nature of the simulated warhead.</p>

<p>The country's Missile Administration will conduct another launch of the same type of missile in July to test the "explosion power" of the super-large warhead, according to KCNA.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Steve Bannon, an outspoken right-wing figure in American politics and former senior advisor to Donald Trump, reported to prison Monday to begin a four-month sentence for contempt of Congress.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Steve Bannon, an outspoken right-wing figure in American politics and former senior advisor to Donald Trump, reported to prison Monday to begin a four-month sentence for contempt of Congress.</p>

<p>He was convicted of defying a subpoena to testify before the congressional panel that investigated the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters.</p>

<p>Bannon, 70, spoke defiantly as he showed up at a federal prison in Connecticut.</p>

<p>"I'm proud of going to prison today," Bannon said, "if it's what it takes to stand up to Joe Biden."</p>

<p>Bannon and others argue that legal proceedings stemming from the January 6 insurrection against the seat of US democracy amount to political persecution designed to thwart Trump's bid for reelection in November.</p>

<p>A cluster of people waving "Trump 2024" flags greeted Bannon outside the prison, as did Marjorie Taylor Greene, a fiercely pro-Trump lawmaker from Georgia who is one of the new faces of the Republican Party tightly controlled by the former president.</p>

<p>One of the masterminds behind Trump's successful 2016 presidential campaign, Bannon was sentenced to four months in prison in October 2022, but remained free until now while appealing his conviction.</p>

<p>A federal appeals court upheld the conviction in May, and District Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee, revoked Bannon's bail at a court hearing early this month, ordering him to report to prison by July 1.</p>

<p>Bannon no longer works officially for Trump, but reiterated his support for him Monday and promised to use all his influence to get him back in the White House, mainly through his podcast "The War Room," which will continue to release episodes, albeit without Bannon.</p>

<p>Before reporting for prison, Bannon warned the crowd of Trump's most imminent legal threat: on July 11, a judge in New York will announce a sentence in Trump's conviction on 34 felony counts for falsifying business records related to hush money payments to a porn star on the eve of the 2016 election.</p>

<p>"The most important thing to remember is President Trump is going to be sentenced to prison on July 11," Bannon said.</p>

<p>Judge Juan Merchan could also opt for other punishment, such as probation.</p>

<p>Earlier on his podcast, Bannon also welcomed the strong showing of the far-right in France's first round legislative election and in other countries in European parliament voting.</p>

<p>"This is the momentum of our movement," Bannon said.</p>

<p><strong>- Pardoned -</strong></p>

<p>Bannon served in the White House as chief strategist for the first seven months of Trump's term, leaving reportedly due to conflicts with other top staffers.</p>

<p>In 2020, he was charged with wire fraud and money laundering for taking for personal use millions of dollars contributed by donors for the construction of a border wall with Mexico.</p>

<p>While others were found guilty in the scheme, Trump issued a blanket pardon to Bannon before leaving office in January 2021, leading to the dismissal of the charges against him.</p>

<p>On the day of the Capitol riot, as thousands of pro-Trump supporters overran the congressional building to block the certification of Biden's win over Trump, Bannon spoke by telephone with the then-president.</p>

<p>As a result, congressional investigators wanted to question Bannon about his role in those events.</p>

<p>Bannon entered prison the same day that the conservative-dominated US Supreme Court effectively delayed the possibility of Trump being tried in federal court for trying to overturn the 2020 election.</p>

<p>Bannon joins the growing list of former Trump associates who have completed or are currently serving jail time as a result of their ties to Trump.</p>

<p>Another is a former Trump economic adviser, Peter Navarro, who was also sentenced to a four-month prison term for defying a congressional subpoena to testify about January 6.</p>

<p>Others include former Trump legal fixer turned whistleblower Michael Cohen and the CFO of the Trump Organization, Allen Weisselberg.</p>

<p>Trump has been indicted four times, but the hush money case is the only one that has actually gone to trial.</p>

<p>The other three cases -- two related to his attempts to cling to power illegally after the 2020 election and one for retaining classified documents after he left office -- are not expected to go to trial before the presidential election.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia has more than doubled the cost of student visa fees for international students from $710 to $1,600, a move which will impact lakhs of Indians planning to study in this country.</p>

<p>The move has triggered outrage from student representatives who say that the price hike will drive potential students to competitors, ABC News reported on Monday.</p>

<p>From July 1, the international student visa fee has risen to $1,600 from $710. The federal government said the additional revenue will help fund initiatives in education including cuts to graduate debt, financial support for apprentices, and the ongoing implementation of its migration strategy, the report said.</p>

<p>"International education is an incredibly important national asset and we need to ensure its integrity and quality," Minister for Education Jason Clare said in a statement.</p>

<p>According to the Indian High Commission in Canberra, the number of Indian students enrolled for studying in Australia is estimated at around 1,20,277 as of August 2023, making Indian students the second largest cohort of foreign students in Australia.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Yeganeh Soltanpour, the national president of the Council of International Students Australia, slammed the decision, noting the fee increase, combined with high deposit costs, places extra strain on international students, the ABC report said.</p>

<p>"The possibility of spending all that money only to face rejection is quite disheartening for many students. It has caused many in the student community to explore other options and competitive countries," she said.</p>

<p>Phil Honeywood, CEO of the International Education Association of Australia, told the ABC that the announcement was the "last straw" for the international education sector, which has already suffered from a slowdown in visa approvals.</p>

<p>"We are really in danger of losing a USD 48 billion a year industry," he said, adding that it will "heavily impact" on relationships with our Indo-Pacific neighbours who rely on Australia to deliver world-class qualifications to young people. He warned that this change could drive prospective students to the United Kingdom, Australia's closest competitor, which currently charges $900 for student visa fees.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Supreme Court on Monday ordered lower courts to review a pair of Republican-backed state laws that imposed restrictions on social media companies to moderate content, sidestepping a ruling on their constitutional validity.</p>

<p>Tech industry trade groups, which welcomed the decision, had challenged the laws passed in 2021 by conservative Republican lawmakers in Florida and Texas as part of a broader pushback against perceived anti-conservative bias by major platforms such as Meta-owned Facebook and X, formerly Twitter.</p>

<p>The companies denied that they were censoring conservative viewpoints under the guise of content moderation, as their advocates argued that the laws quashed the platforms' own First Amendment rights under the US Constitution.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court declined to rule on whether it was constitutional for states to pass such legislation, leaving the two laws in limbo as it instructed the lower courts for a thorough review.</p>

<p>Florida's measure bars social media platforms from pulling content from politicians, a law that was passed after former president Donald Trump was suspended from Twitter and Facebook in the wake of the January 6, 2021 assault on the US Capitol.</p>

<p>In Texas, the law stops sites from pulling content based on a "viewpoint" and is also intended to thwart what conservatives see as censorship by tech platforms such as Facebook and YouTube against right-wing ideas.</p>

<p>Neither law has gone into effect due to the litigation.</p>

<p>The challenge to the laws were brought by associations representing big tech companies, the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association (CCIA) and NetChoice, who argue that the First Amendment allows platforms to have the freedom to handle content as they see fit.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Orwellian' -</strong></p>

<p>"We are encouraged that a majority of the court has made clear that the government cannot tilt public debate in its favored direction," CCIA president Matt Schruers said in a statement.</p>

<p>"There is nothing more Orwellian than government attempting to dictate what speech should be carried, whether it is a newspaper or a social media site."</p>

<p>The decision was also welcomed by tech advocacy groups.</p>

<p>"The government does not have the right to impose rules on how companies like Meta and Google should accomplish" platform accountability measures, said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel at the watchdog Free Press.</p>

<p>"These laws would have further ratcheted up the amount of hate and disinformation online while undermining both the meaning and the intent of the First Amendment," she added.</p>

<p>But other advocates cautioned that the decision must not absolve tech firms of their responsibility to address threats to public safety and democracy.</p>

<p>"Today's unanimous opinion ensures platforms can enforce their community and safety standards during a critical election year," said Nicole Gill, executive director of the watchdog Accountable Tech.</p>

<p>"But make no mistake: this is not an excuse for platforms to continue to shrug off their role in the desecration of democracy and proliferation of a myriad of societal harms."</p>

<p>Monday's decision comes after the Supreme Court last week rejected a Republican-led bid to curb government contact with social media companies to moderate their content.</p>

<p>The decision handed a win to President Joe Biden's administration and top government agencies ahead of the presidential vote in November, allowing them to continue notifying major platforms including Facebook and X about what they deem as false or hateful content.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 100 victims and relatives of victims of the October 7 attack by Hamas militants in Israel sued Iran, Syria and North Korea on Monday, accusing the countries of providing Hamas support and demanding at least $4 billion in damages.</p>

<p>The lawsuit filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., by the Anti-Defamation League is the largest case against foreign countries in connection with the attack, and the first backed by a Jewish organization, the ADL said in a press release.</p>

<p>It accuses the three countries of providing financial, military and tactical support to Hamas. The US government has designed Iran, Syria and North Korea state sponsors of terrorism.</p>

<p>More than 1,200 people were killed in the attack and 250 others were taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies. The complainants in the case include US citizens injured on October 7, as well as relatives and the estates of victims killed in the attack.</p>

<p>Israel's offensive in Gaza in response has killed nearly 38,000 people, according to Gazan health officials, and left the enclave in ruins.</p>

<p>"Iran is the world's leading state sponsor of antisemitism and terror - along with Syria and North Korea, they must be held responsible for their roles in the largest antisemitic attack since the Holocaust," ADL Chief Executive Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement.</p>

<p>Iran already faced several similar lawsuits in connection with the October 7 attack.</p>

<p>The Iran, North Korea and Syria missions to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>It is common for countries accused of state-sponsored terrorism to ignore lawsuits in the US and not to honor judgments against them in US courts.</p>

<p>If the defendants are found liable, the complainants hope to tap the US Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund, which Congress created in 2015 to compensate individuals who have won judgments against state sponsors of terrorism.</p>

<p>But the fund has run low, prompting several members of Congress to introduce legislation in May that would enhance funding and guarantee annual payments to victims.</p>

<p>Monday's lawsuit seeks at least $1 billion of compensatory damages and $3 billion of punitive damages.</p>

<p>"While nothing will ever undo the unbearable pain Hamas caused our family or the brutal losses we've suffered, we hope this case will bring some sense of justice," complainant Nahar Neta, whose American-born mother Adrienne Neta was killed on October 7, said in a statement.</p>

<p>The law firm of Crowell &amp; Moring also represents the complainants.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta Platforms was charged by EU antitrust regulators on Monday for failing to comply with landmark tech rules as they took aim at the US company's newly introduced pay or consent advertising model, already the target of privacy regulators and activists' ire.</p>

<p>The tech giant launched the no-ads subscription service for Facebook and Instagram in Europe last November, saying users who consent to be tracked get a free service which is funded by advertising revenues. Or they could pay for an ad-free service.</p>

<p>The European Commission, which acts as the EU competition enforcer, said the binary choice breaches the bloc's Digital Markets Act (DMA) which seeks to rein in the power of Big Tech, as it sent its preliminary finding to Meta.</p>

<p>It said the binary choice forces users to consent to the combination of their personal data and fails to provide them a less personalised but equivalent version of Meta's social networks.</p>

<p>"We want to empower citizens to be able to take control over their own data and choose a less personalised ads experience," EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.</p>

<p>Meta said its model complied with a ruling from Europe's top court.</p>

<p>"Subscription for no ads follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA. We look forward to further constructive dialogue with the European Commission to bring this investigation to a close," a Meta spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Meta can tweak its advertising model to stave off a fine of as much as 10% of its global annual turnover if found guilty of DMA breaches. The Commission has until March next year to wrap up its investigation.</p>

<p>Privacy activists and privacy watchdogs have also taken issue with Meta's advertising model.</p>

<p>Reuters was the first to report that the EU competition enforcer would charge Meta with non-compliance under the Digital Markets Act.</p>

<p>The charge against Meta came a week after the EU watchdog issued its first DMA charge against Apple for not complying with the new rule.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The head of the Gaza Strip's biggest hospital said on Monday after being freed from more than seven months of detention that he had been "tortured" by Israel.</p>

<p>Al-Shifa hospital director Mohammed Abu Salmiya was among dozens of Palestinians released and returned to Gaza for treatment, according to Israeli authorities.</p>

<p>Abu Salmiya said he and other prisoners were put through "severe torture" in Israeli prisons, after being detained since the October 7 cross-border attacks by Hamas.</p>

<p>"Several inmates died in interrogation centres and were deprived of food and medicine," according to Abu Salmiya, who said he still had a broken thumb.</p>

<p>"For two months no prisoner ate more than a loaf of bread a day," he added.</p>

<p>"Detainees were subjected to physical and psychological humiliation."</p>

<p>The medical chief said no charge had ever been made against him.</p>

<p>Israel's Shin Bet intelligence agency said it had decided on the release with the Israeli military "to free up places in detention centres".</p>

<p>The agency said it "opposed the release of terrorists" who had taken part in attacks on Israeli civilians "so it was decided to free several Gaza detainees who represent a lesser danger".</p>

<p>However commenting on X, formerly Twitter, National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir called Abu Salmiya's release "with dozens of other terrorists" a "security abandonment".</p>

<p>Israeli forces detained Abu Salmiya during one of a number of raids on Al-Shifa.</p>

<p><strong>Emotional reunions</strong></p>

<p>Israel's military has accused Hamas of using hospitals in the Gaza Strip as a cover for military operations. It has raided Al-Shifa and other hospitals, and says it has found tunnels and other infrastructure.</p>

<p>The Hamas group, which has run the territory since 2007, denies the allegations.</p>

<p>Al-Shifa hospital has been reduced to rubble by successive raids since Israel launched its assault on Gaza after the October 7 Hamas attacks.</p>

<p>After crossing back to Gaza near the city of Khan Yunis, five detainees were admitted to Al-Aqsa hospital and the others were sent to hospitals in Khan Yunis, a medical source said.</p>

<p>An AFP correspondent at Deir al-Balah saw some detainees in emotional reunions with their families.</p>

<p>Abu Salmiya was not the only top medical practitioner detained.</p>

<p>The Gaza European hospital in Khan Yunis said the head of its orthopaedic unit, Bassam Miqdad, was among those freed on Monday.</p>

<p>In May, Palestinian rights groups said a senior Al-Shifa surgeon had died in an Israeli jail after being detained. The Israeli army said it was unaware of the death.</p>

<p>The war started with Hamas's October 7 attack which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,900 people, also mostly civilians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Nepali court on Monday sentenced a man whose followers believe him to be a reincarnation of Buddha to 10 years in prison for child sexual abuse.</p>

<p>Ram Bahadur Bomjan, known as "Buddha boy" by his devotees, became famous as a teenager after followers said he could meditate motionless for months without water, food or sleep.</p>

<p>He was convicted of child sexual abuse last week by the court in Nepal's southern town of Sarlahi.</p>

<p>"He has been sentenced to 10 years in jail," Sadan Adhikari, registrar at the district court, told AFP.</p>

<p>Bomjan was also fined 500,000 Nepali rupees ($3,743).</p>

<p>The 33-year-old guru has a devout following but has long been accused of physically and sexually assaulting his followers, and had been hiding from authorities for several years.</p>

<p>Nepal's Central Investigation Bureau arrested him in January at a house on the outskirts of the capital Kathmandu.</p>

<p>Police said he was caught with bundles of cash amounting to 30 million Nepali rupees and another $22,500 in foreign currency.</p>

<p>Dozens of assault complaints were filed against Bomjan in 2010.</p>

<p>He said he beat the victims because they disturbed his meditation.</p>

<p>An 18-year-old nun also accused Bomjan of raping her at a monastery in 2018.</p>

<p>Police opened another investigation against him the following year, after family members reported the disappearance of four of his devotees from one of his ashrams.</p>

<p>Before he went on the run, Bomjan still commanded a legion of followers.</p>

<p>At one point, tens of thousands of people gathered to witness his reputed miracles of meditation deep in the jungle.</p>

<p>Aged 16, Bomjan disappeared for nine months to wander the wilderness of eastern Nepal, prompting a round-the-clock vigil by Buddhist monks who prayed for his safe return.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli army on Monday issued a new evacuation order for parts of Khan Yunis and Rafah in southern Gaza, with witnesses reporting that many were fleeing.</p>

<p>Hundreds of thousands had already left Rafah ahead of and during a ground offensive launched by Israeli troops on the southernmost city since early May.</p>

<p>The warning for Al-Qarara, Bani Suhaila and other towns in the two governorates, made on social media and in an official statement, came hours after Israel said 20 "projectiles" were fired into Israel from the Khan Yunis region.</p>

<p>The attack was claimed by the armed wing of the Palestinian group Islamic Jihad. Israel had already staged air strikes in Rafah on Monday.</p>

<p>"Fear and extreme anxiety have gripped people after the evacuation order," said Bani Suhaila resident Ahmad Najjar. "There is a large displacement of residents."</p>

<p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres's spokesman said "it just shows yet again, that no place is safe in Gaza, more efforts need to be made to protect civilians".</p>

<p>"It's another stop in this deadly circle of movement that the population in Gaza has to undergo on a regular basis," added the spokesman, Stephane Dujarric.</p>

<p>Since launching its ground offensive in Gaza on October 27, Israeli forces progressively moved south in the Palestinian territory, seeking to destroy Hamas battalions, though fighting has restarted in the north.</p>

<p>The war began with Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza including 42 the army says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,900 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Air Europa Boeing plane made an emergency landing in Brazil Monday after several people were injured by "strong turbulence" on a flight from Madrid to Montevideo, the airline said.</p>

<p>The 787-9 Dreamliner was diverted to the airport of Natal in northeastern Brazil on its way to the Uruguayan capital, the Spanish company said on X, adding that passengers who suffered injuries "are receiving attention."</p>

<p>Uruguay's foreign ministry said in a statement that passengers in need of medical attention were taken to the Monsenhor Walfredo Gurgel hospital in Natal. Several have already been discharged.</p>

<p>A Uruguayan diplomatic source told AFP "between 25 and 30" people were injured, but the number was not final.</p>

<p>Most suffered "mild trauma" and "at first sight, no one's life is at risk," said the source.</p>

<p>Air Europa said a plane will leave from Madrid later Monday to pick up the passengers in Natal and continue the journey to Uruguay.</p>

<p>In May, a 73-year-old British man died and several other passengers and crew suffered skull, brain and spine injuries when a Singapore Airlines Boeing 777 hit severe turbulence on a flight from London and was forced to make an emergency landing in Bangkok.</p>

<p><strong>Worse turbulence</strong></p>

<p>Air safety experts say passengers are often too casual about wearing seatbelts, leaving them at risk if the plane hits unexpected turbulence.</p>

<p>Scientists also say that so-called clear air turbulence, which is invisible to radar, is getting worse because of climate change.</p>

<p>A 2023 study found the annual duration of clear air turbulence increased by 17 percent from 1979 to 2020, with the most severe cases increasing by more than 50 percent.</p>

<p>Monday's incident was the latest drama involving a Boeing plane, after a fuselage panel blew out of an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX in January as well as two crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people in total.</p>

<p>In March, the US aviation giant announced the departure of CEO Dave Calhoun as it faced intense scrutiny on safety and manufacturing standards.</p>

<p>The company announced earlier Monday it had reached a deal to buy its subcontractor Spirit in a move it said would boost safety and quality control.</p>

<p>Boeing this week also faces a key turning point with the Department of Justice, which concluded in May the company could be prosecuted for violating a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement reached following the two fatal 737 MAX crashes.</p>

<p>A lawyer for the victims' families said Sunday that the DOJ was offering Boeing a plea deal that would allow it to avoid a trial.</p>

<p>Victims' families have called for the criminal prosecution of Boeing and its executives, and are seeking a nearly $25 billion fine.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India and the United States signed a statement of intent to formally establish the Gandhi-King Development Foundation (GKDF) by October this year, which aims to address global development challenges. The statement of intent was signed during the visit by US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan to India last month.</p>

<p>"This significant step, occurring during White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan's visit to India, builds on the U.S. Congress's passage of the Gandhi-King Scholarly Exchange Initiative Act in December 2020, sponsored by Representative Gregory W. Meeks, which authorized USAID to create the Gandhi-King Development Foundation," the US Embassy in India said in a press release.</p>

<p>US Congressman and Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Gregory W Meeks expressed gratitude to be a part of this process and affirmed that this initiative will strengthen the bonds between both nations.</p>

<p>"I was glad to witness this important progress towards establishing the Gandhi-King Development Foundation, which will further strengthen the bonds between the United States and India. The Foundation will honour two visionary leaders and leverage the strength of our private sectors to address important issues such as public health, climate change and air pollution, and the empowerment of women," Mr Meeks said.</p>

<p>The Gandhi-King Development Foundation will operate locally in India, utilizing both public and private resources to advance India's national and global development objectives. These include addressing climate change, reducing tuberculosis, improving water and sanitation, minimizing the health impacts of air pollution, enhancing education outcomes, and promoting economic empowerment for women.</p>

<p>"The Gandhi-King Development Foundation signifies a groundbreaking partnership between the United States and India to address global development challenges," the embassy's statement added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hurricane Beryl slammed into the Caribbean island of Carriacou on Monday, producing "life-threatening conditions" including disastrous winds, according to US trackers, after the storm strengthened into a powerful Category 4 storm.</p>

<p>With the "extremely dangerous eyewall" moving over the island, which is part of Grenada, the US National Hurricane Center warned residents "not leave their shelter as winds will rapidly increase."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">1200 PM AST Jul 1 Position Update: Extremely dangerous <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Beryl?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Beryl</a> is producing catastrophic winds and life-threatening storm surge in the southern Windward Islands.

— National Hurricane Center (@NHC_Atlantic) <a href="https://twitter.com/NHC_Atlantic/status/1807805378140475635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 1, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>The eye of Beryl made landfall on Carriacou Island at 1510 GMT, the NHC reported on X, adding in a bulletin that it was creating "catastrophic winds and life-threatening storm surge."</p>

<p>Posting a video showing large waves, the Office of the Prime Minister of Grenada wrote on Facebook that the tri-island state was "experiencing intense winds and damage."</p>

<p>"This is an extremely dangerous and life-threatening situation," the NHC said. "Residents should not leave their shelter and remain in place through the passage of these life-threatening conditions."</p>

<p>Experts say that such a powerful storm forming this early in the Atlantic hurricane season -- which runs from early June to late November -- is extremely rare.</p>

<p>"Only five major (Category 3+) hurricanes have been recorded in the Atlantic before the first week of July," hurricane expert Michael Lowry posted on social media platform X.</p>

<p>"Beryl would be the sixth and earliest this far east in the tropical Atlantic."</p>

<p>Grenada Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell urged citizens to quickly seek shelter and respect an island-wide curfew ordered for 7:00 pm to 7:00 am Tuesday morning.</p>

<p>Farther northeast in the Caribbean, officials in Barbados said the island was buffeted by high winds and pelting rain, but appeared to have avoided disaster, reporting no injuries so far.</p>

<p>Barbados seems to have "dodged a bullet," Minister of Home Affairs and Information Wilfred Abrahams said in a video, but nonetheless "gusts are still coming, the storm-force winds are still coming" he said, warning residents to remain inside until the all-clear.</p>

<p>Barbados, Grenada, plus Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Tobago were all under hurricane warnings, the NHC said, while a hurricane watch or tropical storm warnings or watches were in effect for Jamaica, Martinique, Trinidad, St Lucia, and parts of the Dominican Republic and Haiti.</p>

<p>A state of emergency was declared in Tobago, the smaller of the two islands that make up Trinidad and Tobago, with schools ordered closed on Monday, top official Farley Augustine said.</p>

<p>A meeting this week in Grenada of the Caribbean regional bloc CARICOM was postponed.</p>

<p><strong>Extreme weather</strong></p>

<p>Beryl became the first hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic season early Saturday morning and quickly strengthened to Category 4, the first ever to reach that level in June, according to NHC records.</p>

<p>A Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale is considered a major hurricane, and a Category 4 storm packs sustained winds of at least 130 miles per hour (209 kilometers per hour).</p>

<p>As Beryl struck Carriacou, it was packing maximum sustained winds that had increased to 150 mph, the NHC said.</p>

<p>Beryl is expected to remain powerful as it moves across the Caribbean, the NHC said, warning residents and officials in the Lesser Antilles, Hispaniola, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and the remainder of the northwestern Caribbean to carefully monitor its progress.</p>

<p>The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in late May that it expects this year to be an "extraordinary" hurricane season, with up to seven storms of Category 3 or higher.</p>

<p>The agency cited warm Atlantic Ocean temperatures and conditions related to the weather phenomenon La Nina in the Pacific for the expected increase in storms.</p>

<p>Extreme weather events including hurricanes have become more frequent and more devastating in recent years as a result of climate change.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Supreme Court ruled Monday that Donald Trump enjoys some immunity from prosecution as a former president, a ruling that will likely delay his trial for conspiring to overturn the 2020 election.</p>

<p>The 6-3 decision split along ideological lines comes four months ahead of the election in which Trump is the Republican candidate to take on Democrat Joe Biden.</p>

<p>Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, in his majority opinion, said a president enjoys "absolute immunity" from criminal prosecution for official acts taken while in office.</p>

<p>"There is no immunity for unofficial acts," Roberts said, sending the case back to a lower court to determine which of the charges facing the former president involves official or unofficial conduct.</p>

<p>The three liberal justices dissented, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor saying "never in the history of our Republic has a President had reason to believe that he would be immune from criminal prosecution if he used the trappings of his office to violate the criminal law."</p>

<p>"With fear for our democracy, I dissent," she said.</p>

<p>Trump's original trial date in the election case had been for March 4, well before his November rematch with President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>But the Supreme Court -- dominated by conservatives, including the three appointed by Trump during his term in office -- agreed in February to hear his argument for presidential immunity, putting the case on hold while they considered the matter in April.</p>

<p>Facing four criminal cases, Trump has been doing everything in his power to delay the trials at least until after the election.</p>

<p>On May 30, a New York court convicted Trump on 34 felony charges of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal in the final stages of the 2016 presidential campaign, making Trump the first former US president ever convicted of a crime.</p>

<p>His sentencing will take place on July 11.</p>

<p>The New York hush money case was considered the weakest of the four cases by many legal experts, but likely the only one that will see trial before the vote.</p>

<p>By filing many pre-trial motions, Trump's lawyers have managed to put on hold the three other trials, which deal with his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results and hoarding top-secret documents at his home in Florida.</p>

<p>If reelected, Trump could, once sworn in as president in January 2025, order the federal trials against him closed.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a shaky debate performance on Thursday night, political analysts and several US media organisations have been calling for US President Joe Biden to drop out of the 2024 election race. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/democrats-rally-behind-biden-after-shaky-debate-performance-with-trump-6004687">Democratic leaders rallied behind Mr Biden</a> following his poor performance last week, as the White House denied a report he was meeting with family to assess his candidacy. Now, his wife and First Lady Jill Biden has spoken about the debate and has said that they "will continue to fight".</p>

<p>Talking to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.vogue.com/article/first-lady-jill-biden-august-2024-cover-interview"><em>Vogue </em></a>from Camp David where the family was spending the weekend, she told the magazine "will not let those 90 minutes define the four years he's been president."</p>

<p>She continued, "We will continue to fight," and claimed that Mr Biden "will always do what's best for the country."</p>

<p>Notably, President Biden's age is a particular concern with voters and there have been calls from some Democrats for him to step aside for a new candidate. Despite weak poll numbers and questions about his age, he has stuck to his plan to seek a second term.</p>

<p>On June 27, the 81-year-old's performance in the presidential debate, rekindled calls for him to step away. When responding to a question about the economy posed by a CNN anchor, the POTUS, who is often observed stuttering and freezing during public events, seemed to lose his train of thought. When asked if voters felt "worse off" under his presidency, the Democrat committed yet another error.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, President<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/i-know-i-am-not-young-man-but-joe-biden-after-poor-debate-showing-5994162"> Joe Biden said after the debate </a>that he would defeat Republican rival Donald Trump in the presidential election, giving no sign he would consider dropping out of the race. He said, "I know I'm not a young man, to state the obvious. I don't walk as easy as I used to, I don't speak as smoothly as I used to, I don't debate as well as I used to."</p>

<p>"I would not be running again if I didn't believe with all my heart and soul that I could do this job. The stakes are too high," he said at a rally.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google has begun rolling out an exciting update to its Messages app, integrating Gemini AI to enhance functionality and user interaction directly within chats.</p>

<p>This development follows Google's recent announcement and the initial introduction of Gemini AI on other platforms like Gmail, according to GSM Arena.</p>

<p>The Gemini AI integration aims to streamline user experience by providing quick access to artificial intelligence capabilities without leaving the Messages app.</p>

<p>Users will notice a new floating action button positioned above the "Start chat" button in the lower-right corner of the interface, facilitating easy access to the AI service.</p>

<p>Although the feature is currently not widely available, Google assures users that Gemini AI functions similarly to its standalone counterpart on Android devices, as per GSM Arena.</p>

<p>This integration allows users to ask questions, receive information, or issue commands seamlessly while continuing their conversations within Messages.</p>

<p>It's important to note that Gemini AI respects user privacy by not scanning private conversations.</p>

<p>However, interactions with the AI chatbot are not end-to-end encrypted, prompting users to exercise caution when sharing sensitive information.</p>

<p>Google also provides options for users to manage their chat history with Gemini, allowing storage customization from default settings of 18 months up to 36 months or as low as 3 months.</p>

<p>Regarding privacy concerns, Gemini AI does not track user location beyond general details derived from IP addresses or home addresses to provide relevant information.</p>

<p>As the update continues to roll out, users can look forward to enhanced capabilities and streamlined interactions within the Messages app.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

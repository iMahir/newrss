       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) reportedly operated its three aircraft carriers for exercises or tests over the past week for the first time. The show of "strength" by the PLAN comes ahead of the 12th anniversary of the commissioning of its first aircraft carrier, Liaoning.</p>

<p>China has commissioned two aircraft carriers - Liaoning and Shandong - the former is a Soviet-era aircraft carrier which China commissioned in 2012 and the latter is its first domestically built carrier. The third aircraft carrier, Fujian, is China's largest and most advanced aircraft carrier ever built with a potent aircraft launching system. Fujian underwent sea trials and is yet to be commissioned.</p>

<p>The Global Times, the mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, reported, that China's aircraft carrier program has entered a fast lane. The Liaoning aircraft carrier conducted routine exercises in water including the West Pacific, to enhance combat capabilities, Senior Colonel Zhang Xiaogang, spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of National Defense said.</p>

<p>Each carrier follows a deployment cycle, only a small part of which is spent on the station. When not on station, the ship is in one of three other phases: in transit to or from the operating area, in its home port for maintenance, crew rest, and shore training or at sea for short periods of crew training or operations when not deployed</p>

<p>Both conventionally powered and nuclear-powered carriers undergo several deployment cycles within one operating cycle, which is the time between complex overhauls (periods of major maintenance).</p>

<h2><strong>Type 001</strong></h2>

<p>The Liaoning aircraft carrier (Type 001) was spotted north of Taiwan and near Japan. The Japanese Ministry of Defence said they detected the Chinese navy's movement in its economic waters - a maritime area that extends 200 nautical miles beyond its territorial sea. An aircraft carrier is accompanied by warships and the group is called Carrier Battle Group (CBG). Japan said the group sailed from the East China Sea, passing between the Yonaguni and Iriomote islands - both under Japan - toward the Philippine Sea.</p>

<p>The Global Times said the group hosted takeoffs and landings of fighter jets and helicopters in the waters southeast of Miyako Islands. The islands are part of the First Island Chain a geopolitically important boundary for the US, with vast amounts of natural resources and economic significance. It is also called the first line of defence for the US west of the Pacific.</p>

<p>This is the first time Chinese warships have entered Japan's contiguous waters, which it said was "completely unacceptable". Territorial waters are different from a country's Exclusive Economic Zone. &nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Type 002</strong></h2>

<p>Shangdong aircraft carrier (Type 002) recently hosted a certification test for night-time operation for a group of new fighter jet pilots during a combat exercise in the South China Sea, the state-run CCTV reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The exercise aimed to improve its "round-the-clock" all-domain combat capabilities, as more fighter jets are capable of being operated on aircraft carriers, CCTV reported.</p>

<h2><strong>Type 003</strong></h2>

<p>Meanwhile, the third aircraft carrier was to sea for the fourth time on September 3 to conduct sea trials, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.newsweek.com/pacific-news-map-us-china-news-aircraft-carriers-september-20-2024-1956710" rel="no follow, no index">Newsweek</a> reported. Fujian took to the seas for its maiden trials in May this year.</p>

<p>Fujian was in the Bohai Sea. The satellite imagery spotted the warship conducting a replenishment test on Tuesday. The aircraft carrier departed from Shanghai's Jiangnan Shipyard for sea trials, with expected arrival in Shanghai on Saturday as it was in the Yellow Sea, making its way down south, the Newsweek report claimed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">Fujian aircraft carrier</p>
</div>

<p>The Fujian carrier (Type 003) weighs 79,000 tons, carrying the most potent fighter jet launch system - the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS). Currently, the USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, uses the EMALS launch system. The EMALS catapult offers more smooth, accurate launching of an aircraft carrier, allowing heavier fighter jets to take off. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The US Department of Defence, in its latest report on Chinese naval modernization, said China is reportedly building a fourth aircraft carrier similar to Fujian and is expected to be nuclear-powered. The Fujian aircraft carrier will be the first conventional-energy-powered platform with the EMALS system.</p>

<p>China wants its navy to be able to deter "US intervention in a conflict in China's near-seas region over Taiwan or some other issue, or failing that, delay the arrival or reduce the effectiveness of intervening US forces," a Congressional Research Service report said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for an urgent meeting of Moscow's top security council to discuss its nuclear deterrence. The move comes amid rising concerns in Russia over Ukraine being allowed by Western powers to use cruise missiles to target locations deep inside Russia.</p>

<p>Last week the UK reportedly cleared the use of its 'Storm Shadow' cruise missile to be used to bomb Russia. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer even flew to Washington DC to meet US President Joe Biden. The two leaders reportedly discussed Ukraine's use of weapons on Russian soil.</p>

<p>The Russian intelligence had information about such a possibility and had said earlier this month that "It has become necessary for Moscow to revise its nuclear doctrine because of the West's escalation of the war in Ukraine."</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-05/dvsfo8vg_storm-shadow-long-range-missiles_625x300_13_May_23.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that Mr Putin will meet the most powerful officials in his administration to discuss the war strategy going forward. "There will be a speech by the President," Mr Peskov said, adding that "The rest, for obvious reasons, will be marked 'top secret'."</p>

<p>Speaking about the reports that the United States and United Kingdom are about to give clearance to Ukraine for Kyiv to launch cruise missiles on Russian soil, President Putin said this month that, "The West would be directly fighting with Russia if it gave such permission to Ukraine (to bomb Russia)" adding that Moscow would be forced to make "appropriate decisions" in such a scenario.</p>

<h2><strong>RUSSIA'S NUCLEAR DOCTRINE &amp; TREATY WITH US</strong></h2>

<p>Russia is the world's largest nuclear power. Together, Russia and the United States control 88% of the world's nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Russia's current nuclear doctrine was set in place by Vladimir Putin four years ago, before the war with Ukraine broke out. According to the current doctrine, Russia may use nuclear weapons in the scenario where it comes under a nuclear attack or if a conventional attack threatens the existence of the state.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-09/im09u9j8_russian-yars-intercontinental-ballistic-missile-system-reuters_625x300_25_September_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>President Putin, who is the primary decision maker on Russia's massive nuclear arsenal, is now planning how to respond if the United States and its European allies allow Ukraine to use Western-supplied missiles to strike deep inside Russia.</p>

<p>The United States and Russia have a nuclear treaty called the US-Russia New START Treaty, which entered into force on February 5, 2011.</p>

<p>Under the treaty, the United States and the Russian Federation had seven years to meet the treaty's central limits on strategic offensive arms (by February 5, 2018) and are then obligated to maintain those limits for as long as the treaty remains in force.</p>

<p>According to the US State Department, this treaty enhances US national security by placing verifiable limits on all Russian deployed intercontinental-range nuclear weapons. The United States and the Russian Federation have agreed to extend the treaty through February 4, 2026.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-09/j4c9ihng_us-medium-range-ballistic-missile-launch-test-reuters_625x300_25_September_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>According to a Reuters report, the Kremlin said that any discussions about a replacement to the US-Russia New START Treaty, which expires in 2026, would need to take into account European nuclear potential - shorthand for the arsenals of Britain and France.</p>

<p>"We have not yet received a response from the Americans to this, but of course an agreement is needed and negotiations should begin as soon as possible," Peskov said when asked about a possible replacement for the New START Treaty.</p>

<h3><strong>THE STORM SHADOW MISSILE</strong></h3>

<p>Ukraine already has the UK-supplied Storm Shadow missile, but uses it only within its territory to combat Russian forces.</p>

<p>So far, there are restriction on Ukraine on the use of advanced western weaponry on targets within the Russian territory, but this is likely to change with clearances reportedly being issued by the UK, with US backing it.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-09/dit2seng_storm-shadow-missile-ukraine_625x300_12_September_24.jpeg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>The Storm Shadow is a low-observable, long-range air-launched cruise missile. It is jointly developed by the United Kingdom and France and has a range of around 500 km. It has already been integrated into Ukrainian fighter aircraft, including the Russia-built Su-24 bombers - a legacy of the past, from when Ukraine was part of the erstwhile Soviet Union.</p>

</div>

<p>Developed in 1994 and manufactured by Matra and British Aerospace, the Storm Shadow missile is now made by MBDA Systems. 'Storm Shadow' is the weapon's British name, while in France it is called the SCALP-EG.</p>

<h3><strong>RUSSIAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS STOCKPILE</strong></h3>

<p>Should Ukraine use cruise missiles to attack Russian territory, a Russian response to this could be massive. The international worry is that Moscow may seriously consider the use of nuclear weapons in such a scenario.</p>

<p>According to Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation - a nonpartisan non-profit organisation on nuclear weapons disarmament - Russia maintains a stockpile of an estimated 6,372 nuclear warheads - the world's largest.</p>

<p>Of these, 1,572 of which are deployed on strategic land-based ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers. Approximately 870 more strategic warheads and 1,870 non-strategic warheads are in reserve with an additional estimated 2,060 warheads awaiting dismantlement.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No city or village in certain areas has been spared in the Israeli strikes on Lebanon in which over 500 civilians, including 50 children have been killed, a resident of Beirut has told NDTV, claiming that citizens of the country are standing resolutely with Hezbollah.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Syed Ali Bakir said several areas have seen continuous bombing and structures have been reduced to ruins.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There were pager attacks initially, followed by walkie-talkie explosions and then missiles in which many from Hezbollah lost their lives. On Monday, Israel began a fresh wave of attacks in which civilians are dying. Approximately 600 common people have been killed and between 1,800 and 2,000 have been injured. In certain areas, no city or village has been spared. No supermarket, medical store or hospital has been spared," he said in Hindi.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To a question on whether the people were supporting Hezbollah or just wanted peace, Mr Bakir said the entire civilian population is standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the group.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There are queues to donate blood. Some people are even saying that they have two eyes and are willing to donate one or they have two kidneys and are willing to donate one. That is the kind of spirit we are seeing. There is a passion and enthusiasm in this community. Such a people can never lose to any enemy," he claimed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking to NDTV on Tuesday, Israeli envoy to India Reuven Azar said most of the 1,700 military targets that Israel targeted in southern Lebanon in the past 48 hours were "embedded" in the homes of civilians and the families did not evacuate on time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"(This was) despite the fact that we called them over the phone, we intercepted radio communications... we tried every way possible to take them out of harm's way. Despite that, &nbsp;yes, there were some civilians that were killed as well. But when you look at the magnitude of this - 1,700 military targets in 48 hours - you will see that, actually, this has been very successful; because at the end of the day, when you compare the damage that would be caused from these missiles to Israeli civilians to the price that the people have to pay, it's a relatively low price," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Azar said every loss of life is tragic and claimed that Israel does whatever is possible to take civilians out of harm's way.</p>

<p><strong>23 More Killed</strong></p>

<p>Lebanon said 23 people were killed and several injured on Wednesday, the third day of major Israeli strikes. Hezbollah has said it fired a ballistic missile that reached the key Israeli city of Tel Aviv for the first time, before being intercepted, news agency AFP reported.</p>

<p>The Israeli military also said it is calling up two reserve brigades to its northern border. "The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) is calling up two reserve brigades for operational missions in the northern arena... to enable the continuation of combat against the Hezbollah terrorist organisation," it said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Lou recounted how her supervisor demanded she bring her a hot Americano and an egg every morning, as well as keep a bottle of water readily available.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman in Shanghai, identified by her surname Lou, was briefly fired from her job at an educational institution after refusing to purchase breakfast for her boss, sparking widespread outrage on mainland social media. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3279487/outrage-after-china-firm-fires-woman-refusing-buy-breakfast-boss-results-reinstatement?module=top_story&amp;pgtype=section">South China Morning Post,</a></em> Lou shared her experience on Xiaohongshu, recounting how her supervisor, Liu, demanded she bring her a hot Americano and an egg every morning, as well as keep a bottle of water readily available. When Lou addressed these unreasonable demands in a work chat group, she was reprimanded and subsequently fired by the human resources department without compensation.</p>

<p>However, following public backlash, the company reinstated Lou and terminated Liu for abusing her authority and coercing subordinates into assisting her with personal matters. The company's HR head, Wang, clarified that Lou's termination was Liu's decision and not aligned with company policy.&nbsp;Though she has resumed work again, it is uncertain whether she will receive any compensation.</p>

<p>The incident has highlighted the pervasive issue of workplace bullying in China, with related discussions attracting over 2 million views on Weibo. A 2020 survey by Zhilian Zhaopin revealed that 64% of respondents experienced workplace bullying, commonly in the form of forced task completion, verbal abuse, and sexual harassment. Over half of those bullied chose to resign, while 6% turned to social media to expose the issue.</p>

<p>Chinese law does not explicitly define workplace bullying, and penalties vary. Lawyer He Bo advised employees to gather evidence, such as screenshots and recordings, to protect themselves. He emphasised that employees have the right to refuse unreasonable work requests and seek legal counsel if necessary.</p>

<p>He told SCMP, ''For instance, forcing employees to work overtime violates labour laws, and sexual harassment can result in administrative or criminal liability for the offenders. In combating workplace bullying, employees should gather evidence such as screenshots, audio recordings, and video.''</p>

<p>Lou's experience has sparked a national conversation about workplace bullying, with many praising her bravery in speaking out. One user wrote, ''This boss treated her subordinate like a free assistant, which is unethical and constitutes bullying.''</p>

<p>Another commented, ''Lou displayed significant bravery by exposing her boss's misconduct.''</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A South Korean vlogger has courted controversy after claiming that she terminated her pregnancy at nine months. According to <em>CNN</em>, the woman, whose identity hasn't been revealed, is being investigated for murder in a case that has prompted horror in South Korea. The case has raised urgent questions about the abortion laws in South Korea as there are no laws governing when, where, or how abortions can take place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/20/asia/south-korea-abortion-youtube-video-intl-hnk/index.html" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>CNN</em></a>, the Seoul National Police began investigating the woman in July at the request of the South Korean government after she posted a video to YouTube purportedly documenting her experience of getting an abortion, cops said.</p>

<p>Notably, abortions past 24 weeks are banned in many jurisdictions, or reserved for very exceptional cases. However, in South Korea, there are no laws governing when, where or how abortions can take place. But this was not always the case. For the last four years, there has been a policy vacuum. Before this, strict laws governing the medical procedure made abortion a crime punishable by up to two years in prison. It only limited exceptions for rape, incest, and a threat to the life, health of the mother or the baby.</p>

<p>It was in 2019 that South Korea's Constitutional Court overturned the ban, giving the National Assembly until the end of 2020 to enact new abortion laws, which the court recommended should include a term limit of 22 weeks. When the legislature failed to meet that deadline, the criminal provisions around abortion expired, effectively legalising abortion at any stage of pregnancy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In June, in a statement posted to its website, South Korea's Ministry of Justice said that "the direction, details, and timing of the revision" of the country's abortion laws is yet to be decided, and that it needs to consult with the Health and Welfare Ministry - which oversees the Maternal and Child Health Act.</p>

<p>"The Ministry of Justice will do its best to discuss the issue so that the right to life of the fetus, and the right to health and the right to self-determination of the pregnant woman can be harmonised," it added.</p>

<p>This policy vacuum experts say not only opens the door to potential malpractice but also hinders access to safe abortions. By not passing abortion laws, the National Assembly is "not doing its job," said Cho Hee-kyoung, a law professor at Hongik University in Seoul. "If there is no law criminalizing a conduct, then there is no crime for carrying out that conduct," Cho said.</p>

<p>Experts also say that in the absence of clear regulations, women and abortion providers currently operate in a grey area with little guidance as to what is permitted and what might break other laws. Credible information about where to get an abortion is hard to come by, and the procedure is not covered under the country's public health system, the outlet reported.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A nearly two-minute video of the four abusing the police officer at a crime scene was uploaded on Facebook.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four men of Indian origin were on Wednesday charged with causing public nuisance and using abusive language against a police officer in Singapore's Little Precinct.</p>

<p>A nearly two-minute video of the four abusing the police officer at a crime scene cordoned off to investigate an alleged murder on Sunday morning in Little India, was uploaded on the Facebook page ROADS.sg, Channel News Asia reported.</p>

<p>The post featuring Md Dino Marciano Abdul Wahab, 44, Alex Kumar Gnansekaran, 37, Mohamed Eusof Mohamed Yahiya, 32, and Mohanan V Balakrishnan, 32, shouting at police officers garnered more than 423,000 views in three days.</p>

<p>Court documents said they allegedly used phrases such as "You talked like a gangster, you know, we all scared, you know", "We are paying tax, we are paying our ****ing tax", and "I can show you 100 per cent gangster".</p>

<p>The incident took place in the back lane of Sam Leong Road in Little India, where an alleged murder had taken place.</p>

<p>The case involved Indian-origin Muhammad Sajid Saleem, 22, who was on Monday charged with the murder of a 25-year-old along Verdun Road. Another five men were also charged concerning the incident.</p>

<p>However, the four men charged on Wednesday are unrelated to the murder. They told the court they intended to seek legal representation.</p>

<p>The police prosecutor told the court that investigations were ongoing and the four men might face additional charges. They will be back in court on October 8.</p>

<p>The police in a statement said officers were preserving "a murder crime scene" at about 5.10 am on Sunday when the four men approached.</p>

<p>They allegedly tried to cross the cordoned-off area but were advised to use an alternative route.</p>

<p>"Three of the men then allegedly taunted and used abusive language against the officers, while the fourth man purportedly filmed the interactions with his mobile phone," said the police.</p>

<p>"Despite the four men's behaviour, the officers exercised restraint and strived to de-escalate the situation even as they were trying to manage the ongoing murder investigation." The four men used the alternative route "only after much persuasion", said the police.</p>

<p>The police said they would not hesitate to take action against persons who obstruct public servants carrying out their duties, and against those who use abusive behaviour towards their officers.</p>

<p>Any person found guilty of using abusive language against a public servant can be jailed for up to a year, fined up to SGD 5,000 (USD 3,900) or both.</p>

<p>Those found guilty of causing public nuisance face a jail term of up to three months, a fine of up to SGD 2,000 (USD 1,557) or both.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prominent Indian-American businessman Vinod Khosla and billionaire Elon Musk had a public war of words over a land battle in California and an allegedly altered image of a sign on a beach. It all started after Elon Musk posted a seemingly AI-generated picture of a beach sign that read "No plebs allowed. Property of Vinod Khosla" - a reference to a 16-year-long legal battle Mr Khosla has undertaken to restrict the use of his private property to access the public Martins Beach, <em>Forbes </em>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sharing the image on X on Saturday, Mr Musk claimed that Mr Khosla had put it up on his property. However, the billionaire venture capitalist vehemently denied putting up any such sign and demanded an apology from Mr Musk after his "lie" resulted in negative press for him. "You owe me an apology for spreading falsehoods. I think this post of yours needs a community comment for being a fraudulent photo. I have never put up this sign or anything even remotely like this. I presume it is AI generated but you can verify that," wrote Mr Khosla.&nbsp;</p>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Mr Musk then responded to Mr Khosla in his trademark style. "Sorry, I made a sign about you restricting access to a public beach. That was so extremely terrible. Please forgive me," the billionaire wrote.</p>

<p><strong>Take a look below:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Notably, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryroeloffs/2024/09/23/billionaire-vinod-khosla-demands-apology-after-elon-musk-slams-him-on-x-the-feud-explained/" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>Forbes</em></a>, Mr Khosla bought a piece of land in 2008 that previously served as a paid parking lot for Martins Beach south of San Francisco. Mr Khosla has said he no longer wants the privately owned property to be publicly accessible and has been battling with the state over the issue for almost two decades, including a rejected appeal to the Supreme Court in 2018.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elon Musk, however, used this issue to fuel a longstanding dispute between the pair that has seen them trade barbs over the 2024 election, the development of artificial intelligence and immigration issues.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previously, the two have also publicly argued about ChatGPT parent OpenAI. Mr Khosla has also called a conversation between Mr Musk and Donald Trump "dumb". Mr Musk, on the other hand, claimed Mr Khosla was "deranged about Trump". The billionaires even sparred on X over Mr Trump's false claims about Haitian immigrants.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Newly freed from an Israeli prison, Wael Masha rode atop friends' shoulders through the streets of his West Bank refugee camp before bursting into his home to kiss his mother's feet.</p>

<p>Less than a year later, those friends carried the 18-year-old's body through the same streets after Israeli forces killed him in an air strike, describing him as an armed militant who posed a threat to Israeli forces.</p>

<p>His journey was not unique: Masha is one of at least three Palestinians born in the Israeli-occupied West Bank who were arrested as teenagers, released during a brief truce in the Gaza war last November, then killed in intensifying Israeli military operations in the territory.</p>

<p>Israel says its raids and air strikes in the West Bank, which it has occupied since 1967, reflect the scope of the security threat it faces from Palestinian combatants.</p>

<p>His family and others like them say Israel is fuelling the problem it claims to be fighting, arresting young men -- Masha was 17 when he was taken into custody -- then abusing them in custody, ultimately driving them to seek revenge.</p>

<p>What is not in dispute is that Masha embraced "jihad" after his release, and knew where it would lead.</p>

<p>In his will, he instructed his mother: "When you hear the news of my martyrdom, God willing, do not cry, but ululate."</p>

<p>While some memorial posters show Masha brandishing an automatic weapon, his mother remembers him differently.</p>

<p>"He loved studying and repairing computers and mobile phones," Hanadi Masha told AFP in the family home in Balata refugee camp, east of Nablus, surrounded by pictures of her smiling son.</p>

<p>Perhaps this interest could have turned into a career, she added.</p>

<p>But "after he got out of prison, he had a grudge because of everything he saw inside".</p>

<h2><strong>'SHOCK' BEHIND BARS</strong></h2>

<p>The fallout from the nearly year-old war in Gaza has reverberated across the West Bank, where the health ministry says at least 680 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces and settlers since Hamas's October 7 attack.</p>

<p>Israeli officials say 24 Israelis, including troops, have been killed in Palestinian attacks during the same period.</p>

<p>Even before the war, Israeli round-ups of Palestinian men were common, including the one in November 2022 in which Masha was detained.</p>

<p>The Palestinian Prisoners' Club advocacy group says there are at least 250 Palestinians under the age of 18 currently in Israeli custody.</p>

<p>"The occupation does not hesitate to arrest children under 18 years old... The widespread arrests have nothing to do with any armed action," said Hilmi al-Araj of the Palestinian civil society group Hurryyat.</p>

<p>Israeli authorities took Masha to Megiddo prison in northern Israel and sentenced him to two and a half years on charges they never disclosed to his family.</p>

<p>His surprise release came during a weeklong truce in Gaza in November 2023, the only one of the war so far, during which Palestinian militants released 105 hostages seized on October 7, the Israelis among them in exchange for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.</p>

<p>Once out, Masha recounted a host of abuses: being instructed to kiss the Israeli flag, being burned with cigarette butts.</p>

<p>His father Bilal said the experience was "a huge shock" that "changed things completely" for him.</p>

<p>"My son entered as a cub and came out as a lion," he said.</p>

<h3><strong>'PRIME OF LIFE'</strong></h3>

<p>Israel has not explained the precise circumstances of Masha's death, and his parents say they do not know what he was doing when an Israeli strike killed him on August 15.</p>

<p>They only know that the day before the strike Masha said he received a threatening phone call from an Israeli officer warning: "It's your turn."</p>

<p>The details are clearer for Tariq Daoud, a second Palestinian teenager who was detained with Masha and released on the same day of the November truce.</p>

<p>Like Masha, Daoud said he was beaten at Megiddo prison, his brother Khaled told AFP at the family home in Qalqilyah, where children wear necklaces featuring his face.</p>

<p>Khaled said the abuse produced false confessions from Tariq -- aged 16 when he was arrested -- on charges including possessing an illegal firearm and attempting to build explosives.</p>

<p>Incarceration "shattered all his ambitions", which had included potentially becoming an engineer or a doctor, Khaled said.</p>

<p>Instead he joined Hamas's armed wing.</p>

<p>In the same week that Masha was killed, Tariq opened fire on an Israeli settler in Azzun, east of Qalqilyah, and Israeli troops shot him dead at the scene, both Khaled and the Israeli military said.</p>

<p>Israeli officials have not yet released his body, but Khaled still visits his plot at the Qalqilyah cemetery every day to water the flowers.</p>

<p>"I go because I feel that there is something of his presence," Khaled said.</p>

<p>Back in the Balata camp, Masha's mother Hanadi has found her own ways to honour her son, talking about him with his four younger siblings and stroking pictures of his beard -- just like she playfully greeted him when he was alive.</p>

<p>Shortly after Masha's death, the institute where he had been taking classes told her he had been awarded certificates in mobile phone repair and cybersecurity.</p>

<p>His mother attended the graduation ceremony on his behalf.</p>

<p>"He was a young man in the prime of life," she told AFP through tears.</p>

<p>His time behind bars "planted the idea of resistance in his head."<br />

       <description><![CDATA[The professor expressed frustration, stating that "facts don't matter to them" and that the students were reciting pre-determined statements rather than engaging with his actual account.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) interrupted an Israeli professor, Shahar Kvatinsky's lecture with an odd protest that included pizza stealing and war criminal claims.</p>

<p>Kvatinsky, a visiting lecturer at the University of Toronto, was discussing his experiences as an Israel Defence Forces (IDF) reservist officer in Gaza after the October 7th tragedy at an event organised by the MIT Israel Alliance. He described the Israeli military's stringent rules of engagement and related stories of discovering weapons hidden in residential buildings.</p>

<p>The normally uneventful lecture took an odd turn, though, when one student quietly left the room, taking four pizza boxes meant for the audience. This student, along with others, berated Kvatinsky during Q&amp;A, outlining charges of war crimes and calling him a "murderer." Other students did the same, citing reports of IDF soldiers raping women that had already been proven false.</p>

<p>With increasing frustration, Kvatinsky stated that "facts don't matter to them" and that the students weren't really listening to his explanation but were only reciting prepared lines.</p>

<p>Only more mayhem ensued as two more students stole five more pizzas and fled the room, and a third student pulled out a sign that said, "MIT Jews oppose genocide," as he was leaving the lecture.</p>

<p>Will Sussman, an MIT computer science student who attended the event, posted on social media about the event.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, the US administration sounded the alarm on Russia's alleged attempts to sway the upcoming presidential election through fake accounts spreading propaganda and disinformation. In the US, the move is understood to be Russia's broader strategy to undermine American democracy, with US intelligence officials labelling Moscow as the "primary threat to elections".&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is also investigating Iran's involvement in targeting the presidential campaigns of Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. However, US officials assert that Russia is the more formidable foe, with a clear preference for Donald Trump as their candidate of choice. The US government has seized 32 internet domains connected to the influencers, who were allegedly paid by Moscow to spread fake news. It has also sanctioned 10 individuals and two entities allegedly linked to these efforts&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Russia Facing Allegations Since 2016</strong></h2>

<p>This is the third consecutive presidential election in which American officials have accused Russia and President Vladimir Putin of attempting to influence outcomes. It was a huge issue during the 2016 election too. The FBI still lists 12 Russian military officers as "most wanted" for their role in hacking and meddling in that election. These officers, members of Russian military intelligence, were indicted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team in 2018. The indictments allege that they hacked Democratic Party emails and systems and leaked information to influence the election in favour of Donald Trump. Subsequently, hundreds of documents were leaked to Wikileaks. A federal arrest warrant was issued for these 12 officers after a grand jury in a US District Court found them responsible for conspiracy to interfere with the election. Their presence on the FBI's "most wanted" list underscores the ongoing tensions between the US and Russia regarding election interference and cyber-espionage.</p>

<p>Moscow has consistently refuted these allegations, with President Vladimir Putin personally denying the claims in various interviews and press conferences. Even Donald Trump came to Putin's defence, as he once told reporters, "He [Putin] said he didn't meddle. Every time he sees me he says, 'I didn't do that', and I really believe that when he tells me that he means it."</p>

<h2><strong>Western Hypocrisy</strong></h2>

<p>The Kremlin accuses the US and other Western powers of hypocrisy, citing numerous examples across decades in which America was accused of meddling in the elections of so many countries. Indeed, the West - particularly the US - has a long-standing track record of influencing elections, backing military coups, providing covert financial support and disseminating political propaganda in foreign countries to advance its own geopolitical interests. The Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) long history of alleged involvement in elections and regime changes in other countries is well-documented, with many declassified documents serving as evidence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prof Dov H. Levin's research for Carnegie-Mellon University involved looking at the election meddling by both the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. He claims that both countries were found to have interfered in 117 elections between WWll and 2000; the US was involved in two-thirds of them. According to him, in more recent times, 21 election interventions took place between 1990 and 2000, of which 18 were by the US. The alleged meddling by the USSR (later Russia) remained shrouded in secrecy, while the US had been more transparent in some cases.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The declassified CIA documents highlight the role of US operations in the overthrow of Iran's Mohammed Mossadegh's government in 1953, Chile's Salvador Allende in 1973, and, more recently, its efforts towards regime changes in Venezuela as well as in Ukraine in 2014, when the pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych's government was overthrown.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the most recent example, Sheikh Hasina, after resigning from office on August 5 and fleeing the country, &nbsp;suggested that the US had a hand in her political downfall. This wasn't the first time she had made such claims - in 2022, she had accused the US of attempting to undermine her rule. Her allegations have been echoed by some non-Western leaders, who accuse the US and other powerful nations, such as France and Britain, of using their influence to destabilise their governments.</p>

<h2><strong>Propaganda And Fake News</strong></h2>

<p>The truth is that the ongoing allegations and counter-allegations of election interference are just one front in a larger information war between the West and Russia. It's a battle of narratives, with Western media largely backing the West and Russian media championing Putin's perspective. Interestingly, Russian media has historically been dismissed by the West because of the Kremlin''s tight control over it. But the Western media, long proud of its impartiality, faces accusations of spreading propaganda and even fake news to further Western interests. For example, a few weeks after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Western media carried fake news about Putin's health. It suggested Putin was suffering from a mystery illness and may not survive for long. All mainstream Western media carried this lie. And no apologies were offered when it was found to be unfounded.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Janusz Bugajski, a renowned expert on Eastern European and Russian affairs and author of many scholarly books, is a senior fellow at the Jamestown Foundation in Washington, D.C. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Bugajski wrote a book titled Failed State: A Guide to Russia's Rupture. In that, he explored the potential disintegration of Russia. Last year, he told me that the Russian Federation's disintegration was inevitable. "I would say it would be a long process, a rolling process, it would be different in different parts of the country. I would say the war in Ukraine would certainly accelerate the process because you have an increasing number of casualties, particularly from poorer parts of Russia and particularly from ethnic parts of Russia who are usually discriminated against in Russia anyway," he said. Many in the West buy into his claim. Putin has often moaned about how the West was working to break up his country.</p>

<h2><strong>No One Is Equipped To Challenge Western Media's Dominance</strong></h2>

<p>In the ongoing information war, Russia appears to be at a disadvantage, with many believing it's already losing or will ultimately lose. This perspective is rooted in history, as Western media has consistently dominated the narrative, often to the detriment of regional media outlets.</p>

<p>Consider the example of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, where Western media spread the now-infamous claim that Saddam Hussein possessed Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). Despite the lack of evidence, this narrative persisted, and regional media, including Al Jazeera Arabic (Al Jazeera English came into being in 2006), struggled to counter the misinformation. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This phenomenon isn't isolated to the Middle East. Dutch Investigative journalist Bette Dam, whose work focuses on Afghanistan and how the Western media reported on the conflict, argues that Western media often promotes war by presenting one-sided stories, failing to explore underlying reasons for conflicts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the Cold War, Western media played a key role in promoting narratives that aligned with its governments' anti-communist stances. Media outlets were used as instruments of soft power, designed to promote liberal democratic values and present the Soviet bloc as an ideological enemy. These strategies were openly acknowledged by governments, often justified as necessary to counter Soviet disinformation.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The West-East Flow</strong></h2>

<p>Historically, ever since professional journalism came into being, the flow of information and news has always happened from the West to the East. It is the Western media that consistently shapes the narrative and influences public opinion by setting the global agenda every day. Of course, there are now disruptions to this flow, but countering the Western media narrative has proven hard. This dominance was evident, say, in the difference in coverage of the January 2014 attacks in France and Nigeria, where the former received extensive international attention while the latter was largely overlooked. The Westernisation of media perpetuates cultural imperialism, spreading Western ideals and values.</p>

<p>Ultimately, many people, especially young, have lost trust in mainstream media and have been switching over to social platforms to get their news and other information, including about the latest allegations and counter-allegations for election meddling in the US. This erosion of trust should be a wake-up call for traditional Western media.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Singapore's population has reached a record high of 6.04 million, rising two per cent from last year, as the manpower-constrained city-state took in more foreign workers, according to an official report.</p>

<p>The figure was released on Tuesday by the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) in the annual Population in Brief report by the National Population and Talent Division.</p>

<p>The population figure has crossed the six million mark for the first time in Singapore's history.</p>

<p>Of the 6.04 million people in the city-state as of June 2024, there were 4.18 million residents and about 1.86 million non-residents, which comprise the foreign workforce, migrant domestic workers, dependants and international students.</p>

<p>According to the report, the non-resident population jumped by about 5 per cent from last year.</p>

<p>The increase was seen across most 'work pass' types, with work permit holders contributing most to the rise (44 per cent of the non-resident population), followed by migrant domestic workers (15 per cent of the non-resident population).</p>

<p>"The (non-resident) population is diverse, and its size and composition fluctuate depending on our economic and social needs," Channel News Asia reported, citing the report.</p>

<p>"As Singapore is fundamentally labour constrained, the foreign workforce complements our local workforce and allows companies to access a broader range of skills from the global labour pool," said the report.</p>

<p>It also reiterated that Singapore's total population is likely to be "significantly" below 6.9 million by 2030, referring to a figure included in a Population White Paper released in 2013.</p>

<p>The NPTD of the Prime Minister's Office had said in the white paper that the city-state's total population could range between 6.5-6.9 million by 2030. This sparked a public outcry, after which the government clarified the figure was not a forecast or target but for planning purposes.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>American actor Meryl Streep has said a "squirrel has more rights" than a girl in Afghanistan, adding her voice to a call by Afghan women to end the Taliban government's severe restrictions on their lives.</p>

<p>Taliban authorities have implemented an austere interpretation of Islamic law since returning to power in Afghanistan in August 2021 following the withdrawal of US-led forces.</p>

<p>Women and girls have borne the brunt of restrictions -- including being barred from public parks, universities and singing in public -- which the United Nations has labelled "gender apartheid".</p>

<p>"A squirrel has more rights than a girl in Afghanistan today because the public parks have been closed to women and girls by the Taliban," Ms Streep said on Monday during a discussion on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York.</p>

<p>"A bird may sing in Kabul, but a girl may not, and a woman may not in public," the Oscar-winning actor said.</p>

<p>"I feel that the international community as a whole, if they came together, could affect change in Afghanistan, and stop the slow suffocation of an entire half (of) the population."</p>

<p>The Taliban government, which is yet to be recognised by any other country, published a widely criticised law in August further tightening restrictions on women's lives.</p>

<p>While many of the measures had been informally enforced since the Taliban's takeover in 2021, their formal codification sparked an outcry from the international community and rights groups.</p>

<p>The "vice and virtue" law dictates that a woman's voice should not be raised outside the home and that women should not sing or read poetry aloud.</p>

<p>It requires them to cover their entire body and face if they need to leave their homes, which they should only do "out of necessity".</p>

<p>Asila Wardak, a leader of the Women's Forum on Afghanistan, said at the UN discussion Afghan women were there to remind world leaders that "this fight is not only an Afghan fight" but "a global fight against extremism."</p>

<p>Speaking about the situation of Afghan women during the General Assembly this week was "a small sign of hope" for them, said Fawzia Koofi, a former member of parliament in Kabul.</p>

<p>"But it's not enough," she said, calling for the appointment of a UN special envoy to put pressure on the Taliban government.</p>

<p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that discrimination against women was causing major damage to Afghanistan.</p>

<p>"Educating girls is one of the fastest ways to kick-start economic development and improve the health, well-being and prosperity of communities and entire societies," Guterres said.</p>

<p>"Women's participation and leadership has proven benefits for peace and security, social protection, environmental stability and more," he said.</p>

<p>"Afghanistan faces serious challenges in all these areas."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Sri Lanka will hold a parliamentary election on November 14, the government announced on Tuesday, less than two months after the island nation elected Anura Kumara Dissanayake as its new President.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="CetSht_cn">
<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">
	<p><strong>RIDE MOMENTUM</strong><br />
	<br />
	Dissanayake polled 5.6 million votes, or 42.3%, in Saturday's poll, a massive boost to the 3% he managed in the last presidential election in 2019. His nearest rival, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, won 32.8%.<br />
	<br />
	The Marxist-leaning leader will hope to ride the same wave of approval and consolidate power in the 225-seat parliament.</p>
	</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li"><strong>SUPPORT FROM PARLIAMENT </strong><br />
	<br />
	Dissanayake ran as a candidate for the National People's Power alliance, which includes his Janatha Vimukhti Peremuna (JVP) party. The coalition held just three seats in the current parliament elected in August 2020, prompting the new president to dissolve the legislature to try to strengthen his hand.<br />
	<br />
	Despite his executive powers as president, fulfilling his pro-poor campaign promises of reducing taxes and freeing up public revenue for tax relief and investment will prove difficult without backing from parliament.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li"><strong>IMF PROGRAMME</strong><br />
	<br />
	A four-year, $2.9 billion IMF bailout programme has helped Sri Lanka boost reserves, stem a fall in its currency and tame runaway inflation to kickstart a tentative economic recovery. But the austerity measures linked to the bailout angered many, who have pinned hopes of a better future on their next leader.<br />
	<br />
	During campaigning, Dissanayake said he wanted to slash taxes and revisit the terms of the IMF bailout, promising to bring change for those reeling under the austerity measures. But passing a budget will be hard without support in parliament.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li"><strong>DEBT REWORK </strong><br />
	<br />
	Sri Lanka is in the middle of restructuring about $25 billion foreign debt. Getting parliamentary support will strengthen Dissanayake's hand in negotiations with bondholders, who may in turn find policy clarity from the new president reassuring.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li"><strong>CABINET NUMBERS </strong><br />
	<br />
	The lack of numbers in parliament has also meant that Dissanayake was unable to name a fully-fledged cabinet of ministers after taking office on Monday.<br />
	<br />
	He named Harini Amarasuriya as prime minister with five portfolios, while Vijitha Herath was given charge of six ministries, including foreign affairs. Dissanayake kept key ministries such finance, defence and energy to run himself.</li>

       <description><![CDATA[A 6.9-foot-long ocean sunfish (Mola mola) was recently discovered on an Oregon beach, sparking interest from locals and experts.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A gigantic ocean sunfish measuring 6.9 feet in length was spotted along the shores of Hug Point State Park in Arch Cape, Oregon. The creature, commonly known as a Mola Mola, caught the attention of local aquatic experts and stirred interest among beachgoers.</p>

<p>A local institution, the Seaside Aquarium, posted pictures of the dead sunfish on its Facebook page, saying it was unusually big and caused a lot of attention. While an average is to be considered at 6.9 feet, Mola mola can really go up to an astonishing 10 feet in length and weigh up to 5,000 pounds. This giant sunfish is but one example of the rich and diverse marine life existing off the coast of Oregon.</p>

<p>"Another Mola Mola has washed ashore at Hug Point State Park, and it is creating quite a stir. While it has been dead for quite some time, it is still an interesting site. If you want to go see it, we recommend heading to Huge Point at low tide and head north towards the waterfall. Three sunfish have washed ashore since June in Clatsop County. Two were ocean sunfish (Mola mola), and the other one was a hoodwinker sunfish (Mola tecta)," wrote Seaside Aquarium on Facebook.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="767" scrolling="no" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FSeasideAquarium%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0nCFoZJnDb3efVT9sfPFXemnYkiYk8f6fbvwmmQahaM8EdPwm9JMSAHBRuB3tCCMpl&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=500" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" width="500"></iframe></p>

<p>"It is not unusual for these guys to wash ashore, as they do reside off the Oregon Coast. We are getting more reports because of the stir that the Mola tecta caused when it washed in (it was the first Mola tecta documented in Oregon, but that is likely because it has just recently been described and designated as a new species). People are aware that we are interested in documenting these strandings and collecting information from them.</p>

<p>The most recent sunfish at Hug Point was 6.9 feet long, which is average size for our area; however, they can get up to 10 feet long and weigh up to 5,000 pounds. They feed heavily on jellyfish, which are in huge abundance this time of year," the institution added.</p>

<p>The Seaside Aquarium shared images of the sunfish, showing its grey, wrinkled body in a state of decay. This marks the third sunfish to wash ashore in Clatsop County since June.</p>

<p>One of the previous sunfish discoveries, a hoodwinker sunfish, was spotted in June. This 7.3-foot-long creature, also known as a Mola tecta, is a relatively new species, only identified in the past decade. The June discovery was believed to be one of the largest hoodwinker sunfish ever observed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[At least 558 people have been killed across southern Lebanon following Israel's largest aerial offensive against Hezbollah since the onset of the Gaza war on October 7.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">At least 558 people have been killed across southern Lebanon following Israel's largest aerial offensive against Hezbollah since the onset of the Gaza war on October 7. The Lebanese health ministry reported that around 1,650 have been wounded, with nearly 100 women and children among the dead. Meanwhile, Gaza faces a deepening humanitarian crisis as relentless Israeli airstrikes have killed over 40,000 Palestinians and displaced nearly the entire population.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">At the heart of this conflict lies the <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hamas-palestine-gaza-explained-axis-of-resistance-and-irans-proxy-network-across-middle-east-4534061 ">Axis of Resistance</a>, an informal alliance of state and non-state actors united against Western influence and Israeli aggression&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>What is the Axis of Resistance?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">The Axis of Resistance is a coalition led by Iran. It includes various militant groups and political organisations like Hezbollah in Lebanon, Syria's Assad regime, Hamas in Gaza and the Houthis in Yemen. These groups, backed by Iran's military expertise and financial resources, have intensified their opposition to Israeli actions, especially since the war in Gaza escalated after last October.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Iran's primary tool in coordinating these forces is the Quds Force, a division of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which is responsible for conducting covert operations and supporting militant groups across the region. Iran uses this network to solidify its influence and confront Israel and Western allies in the Middle East.</p>

<p dir="ltr">On multiple occasions, Yemen's Houthi movement, which has aligned itself with Iran and Hezbollah, have claimed responsibility for launching missiles and drones towards Israel. Yemen's Defence Minister Mohamed Nasser Al-Atifi recently declared that the Houthis were prepared to continue targeting Israeli forces after the Jewish state's attack on Lebanon.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Iran has methodically built this alliance over decades. It has long been accused of providing financial aid and military training to various factions within the Axis, especially Hezbollah and Hamas. According to US estimates, Iran provides around $700 million annually to Hezbollah and over $100 million to Palestinian groups, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Can the Axis of Resistance challenge Israel?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">The Axis of Resistance presents a significant military and ideological challenge to Israel. The country's military capabilities, backed by the US and advanced defence technology like the Iron Dome, give it a substantial advantage in terms of firepower and defence systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Groups like Hezbollah and Hamas, meanwhile, rely on asymmetric warfare, using rocket attacks, guerilla tactics and underground networks to combat Israel's superior conventional military strength.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In Lebanon, Hezbollah remains Israel's primary concern due to its proximity and large arsenal. A full-scale war between Hezbollah and Israel would likely be devastating for both sides, as Hezbollah's rockets could overwhelm Israeli defences, while Israeli airpower could inflict severe damage on Lebanon.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In Gaza, Hamas continues its resistance, despite heavy Israeli bombardment. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is deepening, with over thousand Palestinians reportedly killed and lakhs displaced since the conflict began.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Saudi court sentenced a retired teacher to 30 years' jail for criticising the government on social media, less than two months after his death sentence was overturned, his brother said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The death sentence against Mohammed al-Ghamdi highlighted what critics describe as heightened repression under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Gulf kingdom's de facto ruler.</p>

<p>Prince Mohammed addressed the case in an interview with Fox News that aired in September 2023, saying the government was "ashamed" over it and expressing hope the outcome could be changed.</p>

<p>Ghamdi's death sentence was overturned on appeal in August.</p>

<p>But the appeals court sentenced him to 30 years imprisonment on the same charges, his brother Saeed al-Ghamdi, an Islamic scholar who lives in Britain, told AFP.</p>

<p>Mohammed al-Ghamdi had been sentenced to death in July 2023 by the Specialised Criminal Court, which was set up in 2008 to deal with terrorism-related cases.</p>

<p>The former teacher, who is in his 50s, was arrested in June 2022.</p>

<p>The case against him was at least partly built on posts criticising the government and expressing support for "prisoners of conscience" like the jailed religious clerics Salman al-Awda and Awad al-Qarni, his brother has previously said.</p>

<p>His account on social media platform X had only nine followers, the Gulf Centre for Human Rights said when his legal troubles came to light last year.</p>

<p>The charges he faced included conspiracy against the Saudi leadership, undermining state institutions and supporting terrorist ideology, sources briefed on the details said at the time.</p>

<p>"This about-face in judgements testifies to the dramatic state of the kingdom's politicised judicial system," Saeed al-Ghamdi said on X.</p>

<p>"My brother is not guilty to be arrested and tried in this way," he added.</p>

<p>The Saudi authorities could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>

<p>Human Rights Watch and Saeed al-Ghamdi reported last month that another brother, 47-year-old Asaad al-Ghamdi, had been sentenced to 20 years over critical social media posts.</p>

<p>There was no word on Tuesday on whether judges would also review Asaad al-Ghamdi's sentence.</p>

<p>Under Prince Mohammed, Saudi Arabia has been pursuing an ambitious reform agenda known as Vision 2030 intended to transform the formerly closed-off kingdom into a global tourism and business destination.</p>

<p>However, Saudi authorities continue to take heat for the country's rights record and restrictions on free speech in particular.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Israel's assault on Iran-backed Hezbollah over the past week, including the targeting of senior commanders and the detonation of booby-trapped pagers and walkie-talkies, has left it reeling.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hezbollah's flexible chain of command, together with its extensive tunnel network and a vast arsenal of missiles and weapons it has bolstered over the past year, is helping it weather unprecedented Israeli strikes, three sources familiar with the Lebanese militant group's operations said. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/lebanese-journalist-thrown-off-screen-as-israeli-missile-strikes-during-live-interview-6645562">Israel's assault on Hezbollah</a> over the past week, including the targeting of senior commanders and the detonation of booby-trapped pagers and walkie-talkies, has left the powerful Lebanese Shiite militant group and political party reeling.</p>

<p>On Friday, Israel killed the commander who founded and led the group's elite Radwan force, Ibrahim Aqil. And since Monday, Lebanon's deadliest day of violence in decades, the health ministry says more than 560 people, among them 50 children, have died in air barrages.</p>

<p>The Israeli military chief of staff Herzi Halevi said on Sunday that Aqil's death had shaken the organisation. Israel says its strikes have also destroyed thousands of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hezbollah-israel-conflict-hezbollah-fires-ballistic-missile-at-mossad-base-near-tel-aviv-6644843">Hezbollah</a> rockets and shells.</p>

<p>But two of the sources familiar with Hezbollah operations said the group swiftly appointed replacements for Aqil and other senior figures killed in Friday's airstrike in Beirut's southern suburbs. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said in an Aug. 1 speech that the group quickly fills gaps whenever a leader is killed.</p>

<p>A fourth source, a Hezbollah official, said the attack on communication devices put 1,500 fighters out of commission because of their injuries, with many having been blinded or had their hands blown off.</p>

<p>While that is a major blow, it represents a fraction of Hezbollah's strength, which a report for the U.S. Congress on Friday put at 40,000-50,000 fighters. Nasrallah has said the group has 100,000 fighters.</p>

<p>Since October, when Hezbollah began firing at Israel in October in support of its ally Hamas in Gaza, it has redeployed fighters to frontline areas in the south, including some from Syria, the three sources said.</p>

<p>It has also been bringing rockets into Lebanon at a fast pace, anticipating a drawn-out conflict, the sources said, adding that the group sought to avoid all out war.</p>

<p>Hezbollah's main supporter and weapons supplier is Iran. The group is the most powerful faction in Tehran's "Axis of Resistance" of allied irregular forces across the Middle East. Many of its weapons are Iranian, Russian or Chinese models.</p>

<p>The sources, who all asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter, did not provide details of the weapons or where they were bought.</p>

<p>Hezbollah's media office did not reply to requests for comment for this story.</p>

<p>Andreas Krieg, a senior lecturer at the School of Security Studies at King's College London, said that while Hezbollah operations had been disrupted by the past week's attacks, the group's networked organisational structure helped make it an extremely resilient force.</p>

<p>"This is the most formidable enemy Israel has ever faced on the battlefield, not because of numbers and tech but in terms of resilience."</p>

<h3><strong>POWERFUL MISSILES</strong></h3>

<p>Fighting has escalated this week. Israel killed another top Hezbollah commander, Ibrahim Qubaisi, on Tuesday. For its part, Hezbollah has shown its capacity to continue operations, firing hundreds of rockets towards Israel in ever deeper attacks.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Hezbollah said it had targeted an Israeli intelligence base near Tel Aviv, more than 100 km (60 miles) from the border. Warning sirens sounded in Tel Aviv as a single surface-to-surface missile was intercepted by air defence systems, the Israeli military said.</p>

<p>The group has yet to say whether it has launched any of its most potent, precision-guided rockets, such as the Fateh-110, an Iranian-made ballistic missile with a range of 250-300 km (341.75 miles). Hezbollah's Fateh-110 have a 450-500 kg warhead, according to a 2018 paper published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-hezbollah-missile-chief-killed-in-israeli-airstrike-on-beirut-10-points-6643300">Hezbollah's rocket attacks</a> are possible because the chain of command has kept functioning despite the group suffering a brief spell of disarray after the pagers and radios detonated, one of the sources, a senior security official, said.</p>

<p>The three sources said Hezbollah's ability to communicate is underpinned by a dedicated, fixed-line telephone network - which it has described as critical to its communications and continues to work - as well as by other devices.</p>

<p>Many of its fighters were carrying older models of pagers, for example, that were unaffected by last week's attack.</p>

<p>Reuters could not independently verify the information. Most injuries from the exploding pagers were in Beirut, far from the front.</p>

<br />
Hezbollah stepped up the use of pagers after banning its fighters from using cellphones on the battlefield in February, in response to commanders being killed in strikes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the chain of command breaks, frontline fighters are trained to operate in small, independent clusters comprised of a few villages near the border, capable of fighting Israeli forces for long periods, the senior source added.</p>

<p>That is precisely what happened in 2006, during the last war between Hezbollah and Israel, when the group's fighters held out for weeks, some in frontline villages invaded by Israel.</p>

<p>Israel says it has escalated attacks to degrade Hezbollah's capabilities and make it safe for tens of thousands of displaced Israelis to return to their homes near the Lebanon border, which they fled when Hezbollah began firing rockets on Oct. 8.</p>

<p>Prime Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/netanyahus-message-for-people-of-lebanon-after-deadly-strikes-10-points-6635347">Benjamin Netanyahu's government</a> has said it prefers to reach a negotiated agreement that would see Hezbollah withdraw from the border region but stands ready to continue its bombing campaign if Hezbollah refuses, and does not rule out any military options.</p>

<p>Hezbollah's resilience means the fighting has raised fears of a protracted war that could suck in the U.S., Israel's close ally, and Iran - especially if Israel launches, and gets bogged down in, a ground offensive in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>Israel's military did not respond to a request for comment for this story.</p>

<p>Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian warned on Monday of "irreversible" consequences of a full blown war in the Middle East. A U.S. State Department official said Washington disagreed with Israel's strategy of escalation and sought to reduce tensions.</p>

<h3><strong>UNDERGROUND ARSENAL</strong></h3>

<p>In what two of the sources said was an indication of how well some of Hezbollah's weapons are hidden, on Sunday rockets were launched from areas of southern Lebanon that had been targeted by Israel shortly before, the two sources said.</p>

<p>Hezbollah is believed to have an underground arsenal and last month published footage that appeared to show its fighters driving trucks with rocket launchers through tunnels. The sources did not specify if the rockets fired on Sunday were launched from underground.</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Monday's barrage had destroyed tens of thousands of Hezbollah rockets and munitions.</p>

<br />
Israel's military said long-range cruise missiles, rockets with warheads capable of carrying 100kg of explosives, short-range rockets, and explosive UAVs were all struck on Monday.</p>

<p>Reuters could not independently verify the military claims.</p>

<p>Boaz Shapira a researcher at Alma, an Israeli think tank that specializes in Hezbollah, said Israel had yet to target strategic sites such as long-range missiles and drone sites.</p>

<p>"I don't think we are anywhere near finishing this," Shapira said.</p>

<p>Hezbollah's arsenal is believed to compromise some 150,000 rockets, the U.S. Congress report said. Krieg said its most powerful, long-range ballistic missiles were kept below ground.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has spent years building a tunnel network that by Israeli estimates extends for hundreds of kilometres. The Israeli military said Monday's air strikes hit Hezbollah missile launch sites hidden under homes in southern Lebanon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hezbollah has said it does not place military infrastructure near civilians. Hezbollah has issued no statement on the impact of Israel's strikes since Monday.</p>

<h3><strong>TUNNELS</strong></h3>

<p>The group's arsenal and tunnels have expanded since the 2006 war, especially precision guidance systems, leader Nasrallah has said. Hezbollah officials have said the group has used a small part of the arsenal in fighting over the past year.</p>

<p>Israeli officials have said Hezbollah's military infrastructure is tightly meshed into the villages and communities of southern Lebanon, with ammunition and missile launcher pads stored in houses throughout the area. Israel has been pounding some of those villages for months to degrade Hezbollah's capabilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Confirmed details on the tunnel network remain scarce.</p>

<p>A 2021 report by Alma, an Israeli think tank that specializes in Hezbollah, said Iran and North Korea both helped build up the network of tunnels in the aftermath of the 2006 war.</p>

<p>Israel has already struggled to root out Hamas commanders and self-reliant fighting units from the tunnels criss-crossing Gaza.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It is one of our biggest challenges in Gaza, and it is certainly something we could meet in Lebanon," said Carmit Valensi, a senior research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, a think-tank.</p>

<p>Krieg said that unlike Gaza, where most tunnels are manually dug into a sandy soil, the tunnels in Lebanon had been dug deep in mountain rock. "They are far less accessible than in Gaza and even less easy to destroy."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden professed his admiration for former First Lady Hillary Clinton and stated that he loved her for defending him in public after he was "trapped" by his wife, Jill Biden, to give a speech in New York City. It all happened at the Clinton Global Initiative's summit on Monday evening.</p>

<p>Mr Biden, who dropped out of the presidential race against Donald Trump in the November 5 US election, was not scheduled to address the event. He came there to support Jill Biden. He was later called to the stage to accept the Global Citizen Award.</p>

<p>"I — this is what you call being trapped," Biden said, thanking the former first couple, Bill and Hillary Clinton. Biden said he was not going to make a "long" speech "because I didn't think I was going to be talking about this."</p>

<p>Noting he had known the Clintons for a long time, Biden said that it was fair to say that he was one of the earliest supporters of Bill Clinton's presidency.</p>

<p>"... because what I saw in you was not an incredible intellect but a decency that you talked — you gave me credit for. It was always about the other guy, always about somebody else," he added.</p>

<p>Biden, 81, then went on to thank Hillary Clinton for helping him.</p>

<p>"Hillary, I want to thank you — and I maybe shouldn't do this publicly — but thank you personally for the way you have helped me, the way you've spoken up for me with such passion.&nbsp; I can't tell you — I — you can ask Jill.&nbsp; I — anyway, I — I love you.&nbsp; I love you," he said.</p>

<p>To this, the former first lady responded, "Thank you," while her husband had his arm around her shoulder. In the meantime, Jill Biden clapped lightly while looking on. Earlier, the Clintons extended their support to Biden following his debate with former US president Donald Trump on June 27.</p>

<p>"The choice in this election remains very simple. It's a choice between someone who cares about you—your rights, your prospects, your future—versus someone who's only in it for himself. I'll be voting for Biden," Hillary Clinton wrote on X, a day later.</p>

<p>However, Biden soon exited the US presidential race, paving the way for US Vice President Kamala Harris to be the Democratic nominee against Trump. The two had their first presidential debate on September 10. It lasted for almost 1 hour and 45 minutes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's main rival in Canada's parliament on Tuesday introduced a motion of no confidence in the ruling Liberals, in the first major test of his unpopular minority government.</p>

<p>Following a debate in the House of Commons, a vote on the long-shot Conservative motion is scheduled on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Far ahead in public opinion polls, Tory leader Pierre Poilievre has been itching for a snap election since the leftist New Democratic Party (NDP) earlier this month tore up a coalition agreement with the Liberals, leaving the Trudeau administration vulnerable to being toppled.</p>

<p>Kicking off the debate, a combative Poilievre railed against Trudeau for what he said was a failure to address soaring costs of living, a housing crisis and crime, while doubling the national debt.</p>

<p>He said the promise of Canada, "after nine years of Liberal government, is broken."</p>

<p>If elected prime minister, he said he would legislate "a common sense plan to axe the tax (on carbon emissions), build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime."</p>

<p>During an appearance in New York on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert on Monday evening, Justin Trudeau acknowledged that Canadians are facing "a really tough time."</p>

<p>"People are hurting. People are having trouble paying for groceries, paying for rent, filling up the tank," and "are looking at change," he said.</p>

<p>But he vowed to "keep fighting."</p>

<p>At a news conference at the United Nations on Tuesday, Trudeau criticized Poilievre for suggesting "the best way to get through these difficult times is to cut services and programs that Canadians rely on."</p>

<p>"I'm thinking about how we can best help Canadians," he said.</p>

<h2><strong>LIBERALS HOLDING ON</strong></h2>

<p>The no-confidence motion is not expected to succeed after two smaller political factions have signaled they will side with the government and vote against it.</p>

<p>But Poilievre has vowed to keep trying, with another opportunity to bring down the government to be presented in early October.</p>

<p>Trudeau swept to power in 2015, and has managed to hold on by defeating two of Poilievre's predecessors in 2019 and 2021 ballots.</p>

<p>The deal with the New Democratic Party to prop up the Liberals would have kept his government in office until late 2025.</p>

<p>But the NDP, seeing its alignment with the Liberals hurting its own popularity, exited the deal early.</p>

<p>According to a recent Angus Reid poll, the Conservatives are well ahead of the Liberals, with 43 percent of voting intention against 21 percent for the ruling party. The NDP is at 19 percent.</p>

<p>In Canada's Westminster parliamentary system, a ruling party must hold the confidence of the House of Commons, which means maintaining support from a majority of members.</p>

<p>The Liberals currently have 153 seats, versus 119 for the Conservatives, 33 for the Bloc Quebecois, and the NDP 25.</p>

<p>Political analysts who spoke to AFP suggest an election likely won't happen until at least spring 2025.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Lebanese journalist sustained injuries when an Israeli missile struck his home while he was conducting a live TV interview. Fadi Boudaya, the editor-in-chief of Miraya International Network, was seen losing his balance and thrown off-screen the moment the missile hit his home.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The footage, now viral on social media, showed Boudaya mid-sentence, which quickly turned into a scream when the explosion occurred. Fortunately, he sustained only minor injuries in the incident.</p>

<p>The journalist, reportedly considered sympathetic towards Hezbollah, later reassured his followers through X. “Thank you to everyone who called, texted, checked in and to everyone who felt any emotion,” he wrote. “Thank God, I am fine, thanks to God and His blessings upon us, and we return to continue our media duty in support of the resistance.

<p>The attack on Fadi Boudaya comes amid escalating tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militant group. Since the Gaza war erupted last October, both sides have been involved in intense cross-border conflict, with recent hostilities reaching new heights.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The situation worsened following a cyber attack on Hezbollah members, during which their communication devices – pagers and walkie-talkies – were targeted. Hezbollah accused Israel of orchestrating the attacks.</p>

<p>On Monday, Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon killed more than 550 people, including 50 children. That evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a video message, urging Lebanese citizens to evacuate their homes. “Once the operation is finished, they can return to their homes,” he said.&nbsp;<br />

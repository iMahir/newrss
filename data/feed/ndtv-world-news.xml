       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After an escalation of hostilities Sunday amid over 10 months of cross-border clashes between Israel and Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah movement, here are the major eruptions of violence since their 2006 war.</p>

<p>The devastating month-long war in the summer of 2006 cost Lebanon more than 1,200 lives, mostly civilians, while some 160 Israelis were killed, mostly soldiers.</p>

<p>The following years saw sporadic attacks, which surged following the October 7 attack by Hezbollah's Palestinian ally Hamas on <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/10-key-moments-in-israel-hamas-war-6240607" target="_blank">Israel.</a></p>

<h3><strong>2007-2013: rocket fire and incursion</strong></h3>

<p>On June 17, 2007, two rockets were fired into northern Israel from Lebanon hitting an industrial zone in the border town of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hamas-war-israel-to-evacuate-over-20-000-residents-of-town-near-lebanon-border-4499426" target="_blank">Kiryat Shmona</a> without causing casualties. Hezbollah denies responsibility.</p>

<p>In early August 2010, a move by Israeli troops to uproot trees in a disputed border area at Adaysseh sparks a deadly border battle in which two Lebanese soldiers and a journalist are killed along with a senior Israeli officer.</p>

<p>On August 7, 2013, four Israeli soldiers on patrol were wounded in a blast claimed by Hezbollah 400 metres (yards) inside Lebanese territory.</p>

<h3><strong>2014-2015: Israeli strikes</strong></h3>

<p>On February 26, 2014, Hezbollah says Israeli warplanes had carried out an air raid on one of its positions at Lebanon's border with Syria.</p>

<p>On October 7, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hezbollah-missile-exchange-how-israel-vs-hezbollah-unfolded-in-the-skies-6414952" target="_blank">Israel </a>strikes two Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon in response to its bomb attack against Israeli troops on the ceasefire line on the Shebaa hills between the two countries that wounded two soldiers.</p>

<p>On January 28, 2015, two Israeli soldiers are killed in a Hezbollah ambush in the Shebaa hills.</p>

<p>The attack is carried out in retaliation for a raid blamed on Israel 10 days earlier on the Syrian-controlled side of the Golan Heights, which killed at least six members of Hezbollah and an Iranian general.</p>

<p>In retaliation, Israeli tanks and artillery bombarded several villages in southern Lebanon.</p>

<h3><strong>2019: drones and missiles strikes</strong></h3>

<p>On August 25, 2019, two explosive-laden drones hit the southern Beirut suburbs, causing material damage according to Hezbollah, which blames the attack on Israel.</p>

<p>The day before, an Israeli air strike in Syria had killed two Hezbollah members.</p>

<p>On September 1, the Israeli army and Hezbollah traded missile fire along the border.</p>

<h3><strong>2021: uptick in clashes</strong></h3>

<p>On August 4, 2021, three rockets were fired from Lebanon, of which two fell in Israel. The Israeli army responds with air strikes on southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>On August 6, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/2021-and-2023-blasts-near-israel-embassy-share-chilling-similarities-4762886" target="_blank">Hezbollah</a> fires more than 10 rockets at Israel, which responds with artillery fire.</p>

<h3><strong>2023-2024: October 7 attacks aftermath</strong></h3>

<p>Hezbollah has traded almost daily cross-border fire with Israel since Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel which triggered the war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>In southern Lebanon, a Reuters video journalist was killed on October 13, and six other journalists from AFP, Reuters and Al Jazeera were wounded in a strike by an Israeli tank.</p>

<p>On January 2, 2024, Hamas deputy leader <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hamas-gaza-palestine-groups-deputy-head-assassinated-by-israel-in-lebanon-claims-hamas-4788700" target="_blank">Saleh al-Aruri</a> was killed in Beirut's southern suburbs in a strike blamed on Israel.</p>

<p>On February 26, Israeli strikes Hezbollah targets in the Bekaa Valley in the first such raid on Lebanon's east since fighting erupted in October.</p>

<h3><strong>July, August 2024: Hezbollah, Fatah chiefs killed</strong></h3>

<p>On July 27, a rocket strike killed 12 children aged 10-16 in the Druze Arab town of Majdal Shams in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights.</p>

<p>Israel blames the strike on Hezbollah, which denies the claim.</p>

<p>The Israeli army responds by striking Beirut's southern suburbs on July 30, killing Hezbollah's top commander in the south,<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/israel-targets-hezbollah-commander-fuad-shukr-820245" target="_blank"> Fuad Shukr.</a></p>

<p>In an August 21 strike, the Israeli military kills Khalil Maqdah, described by the Palestinian Fatah movement as "one of the leaders" of its armed wing in Lebanon.</p>

<h3><strong>August 2024: hostilities surge</strong></h3>

<p>On August 25, Hezbollah says it launched a barrage of hundreds of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hezbollah-launches-dozens-of-rockets-at-israel-spurs-fears-of-regional-war-6258426" target="_blank">rockets and drones</a> on Israel in response to the killing of Shukr. It says its operation "was completed and accomplished".</p>

<p>But Israel says it has thwarted the attack, launching air strikes into Lebanon that the military says destroyed "thousands" of Hezbollah rocket launchers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A gang involving Indian-origin men that used frozen chicken consignments among their many covers to smuggle drugs has been busted by UK police and now its members face prison sentences ranging between 16 and two years each.</p>

<p>Maninder Dosanjh, 39, was jailed for 16 years and eight months, and Amandeep Rishi, 42, faces imprisonment for 11 years and two months for their role in the conspiracy to supply class A banned drugs and money laundering at Birmingham Crown Court last week.</p>

<p>West Midlands Police told the court they seized 400kg of "high-purity" cocaine as well as GBP 1.6 million in illegal cash as investigators dismantled the wholesale supply chain, which saw the 10-strong gang transporting the drugs in pallets of raw chicken.</p>

<p>"This far-reaching investigation covered the importation, exportation and wholesale national supply of cocaine and money laundering," said Detective Chief Inspector Pete Cooke from the West Midlands Police's Regional Organised Crime Unit (ROCU).</p>

<p>"We were able to expose the gangs' activities which were both sophisticated and on a commercial scale, with them using a network of highly trusted individuals and a fleet of vehicles with hidden compartments," he said.</p>

<p>"We believe they were responsible for importing hundreds of kilos of cocaine, estimated to be over a tonne, resulting in them making huge sums of cash, thought to be over GBP 10 million," he added.</p>

<p>Some of the illegal cash recovered by West Midlands ROCU was found stashed in vehicle tyres and industrial machinery inside vans disguised as mechanical service vehicles. The police also recovered 225kg of cocaine destined for export to Australia that had been stored at a warehouse in Sutton Coldfield, in the West Midlands region of England.</p>

<p>"But all this enterprise was illegal and was putting large quantities of drugs, which we know destroy many lives and blight many communities, onto the streets both here in the UK and overseas. Our teams were able to trace the activity, identify the criminals and ultimately put them behind bars with considerable jail terms," DCI Cooke added.</p>

<p>The gang communicated with each other using the Encrochat platform, an encrypted messaging app that criminals believed couldn't be accessed by law enforcers. It has since been shut down by investigators as part of a major UK-wide operation.</p>

<p>These messages discussed the logistics, management and delivery of up to a tonne of cocaine and large amounts of criminal cash being collected or delivered in the UK.</p>

<p>Dosanjh and Rishi were the first to be arrested with over 150kg of cocaine hidden in frozen chicken produce when police officers in Birmingham stopped the van they were in coming back from docks in Essex. Others in the gang were arrested after one of the gangsters collected wheels and tyres in the West Midlands before driving to London, where they were passed to another gangster in a residential street. When the tyres were cut open, they were found to contain around GBP 500,000 in cash. On another occasion, just over GBP 1 million cash was recovered from a concealed compartment of an air compressor in another of the gang's vans stopped by officers.</p>

<p>The 10 men, who lived in Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Sandwell, Walsall, South Staffordshire and London, were all arrested within 10 days in July 2020. They went on to plead guilty to drug smuggling offences between March and August 2020, with their sentencing taking place on August 20 this year.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The boss of social media platform Telegram has been arrested in France, accused of allowing the sharing of illegal content.</p>

<p>The Russia-founded messaging platform has stayed out of the limelight in the West but has hundreds of millions of users across the world, and plays a key role in the Ukraine war.</p>

<h3><strong>Libertarian leanings</strong></h3>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-is-pavel-durov-telegram-ceo-arrested-in-france-6412272">Pavel Durov</a>, arrested after landing on his private jet in Paris on Saturday, launched the platform in 2013 with his brother Nikolai.</p>

<p>It claims to have 950 million users -- up from 550 million in 2022.</p>

<p>Durov told right-wing American journalist Tucker Carlson in April that users "love the privacy, the freedom" of the platform.</p>

<p>Telegram has made great play out of refusing to hand over or sell user data, distinguishing itself from the business models of US rivals like Meta or Google.</p>

<p>In Russia and Ukraine, some of its news channels are more popular than traditional media.</p>

<p>But the platform has long been criticised for failing to moderate extreme content.</p>

<p>Durov, who has a net worth of $15.5 billion according to Forbes, told the Financial Times in March he planned to improve the moderation mechanisms.</p>

<p>But "unless they cross red lines, I don't think that we should be policing people in the way they express themselves," he said.</p>

<p>Howewer, he also said the firm only employs a few dozen people, which experts said may not be enough to provide a properly secure platform.</p>

<h3><strong>Russian origins</strong></h3>

<p>The 39-year-old made a name for himself in 2006 when he launched the social network VKontakte (VK) shortly after graduating from St Petersburg State University.</p>

<p>Millions joined up and it quickly became known as "Russia's Facebook", its popularity piquing the interest of the Kremlin.</p>

<p>He said he had to fend off demands from the Russian security services to hand over details of opposition groups using VK to organise.</p>

<p>And later he came under huge pressure to hand over the personal data of pro-European activists in Ukraine.</p>

<p>These experiences led to him forming Telegram, and eventually selling his stake in VK in 2014 and leaving Russia.</p>

<p>By 2017, he set up in Dubai, keeping at arm's length from tougher regulatory regimes in the European Union and the United States.</p>

<p>Durov has citizenship of the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts and Nevis as well as French nationality, which he picked up in 2021.</p>

<h3><strong>Legal troubles</strong></h3>

<p>French prosecutors accuse Telegram of failing to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/telegram-chief-pavel-durov-arrested-at-french-airport-report-6411921">moderate content</a> or collaborate with the authorities.</p>

<p>They have highlighted content involving fraud, drug trafficking, organised crime, glorification of terrorism and cyberbullying.</p>

<p>The firm has said it cannot be held responsible for what its users do -- a defence long used by big tech platforms.</p>

<p>Several countries have tried to block Telegram in the past.</p>

<p>In 2018, Iran accused it of hosting violent opposition groups.</p>

<p>In the same year, Russia said it had failed to hand over encryption keys.</p>

<p>Last year, Brazil blocked it briefly for failing to provide data on neo-Nazi groups and Spain acted over intellectual property violations.</p>

<h3><strong>No profits yet</strong></h3>

<p>Telegram was fully funded by Durov until 2018, when it raised $1.7 billion to launch its own cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>The crypto project collapsed after US regulators refused to approve it, and the company reimbursed most of the investment.</p>

<p>The messaging service began running ads in 2021 but insisted it would not use users' private data for targeting.</p>

<p>A premium subscription system followed in 2022.</p>

<p>Durov told the Financial Times his company was generating hundreds of millions in revenue and hoped to turn a profit soon.</p>

<p>He also did not rule out floating on the stock exchange.</p>

<p>Though he has repeatedly stated his mission is not about getting rich.</p>

<p>"For me everything in my life was about becoming free," he told Carlson, saying Telegram was about allowing others to express their liberty.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[France held the Russian-born founder of Telegram Pavel Durov in custody for a second day of questioning on Monday over alleged offences related to the popular but controversial messaging app, which insisted he had "nothing to hide".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>France held the Russian-born founder of Telegram <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-is-pavel-durov-telegram-ceo-arrested-in-france-6412272">Pavel Durov</a>&nbsp;in custody for a second day of questioning on Monday over alleged offences related to the popular but controversial messaging app, which insisted he had "nothing to hide".</p>

<p>His arrest after flying into the Le Bourget airport outside Paris late Saturday is the latest extraordinary twist in the career of one of the world's most influential tech icons.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pavel-durov-arrest-explained-the-case-against-telegram-ceo-that-got-him-arrested-in-france-6412839">detention of Durov</a>, 39, was <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/france-extends-detention-of-telegram-chief-pavel-durov-6417625">extended beyond Sunday night</a> by the investigating magistrate who is handling the case, according to a source close to the investigation. This initial period of detention for questioning can last up to a maximum of 96 hours.</p>

<p>When this phase of detention ends, the judge can then decide to free Durov, whose fortune is estimated by Forbes magazine at $15.5 billion, or press charges and remand him in further custody.</p>

<p>Russia has accused France of "refusing to cooperate" while fellow tech mogul <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/zuckerberg-should-be-arrested-for-massive-child-exploitation-on-instagram-musk-6415730">Elon Musk</a> swept to Durov's defence and called for his release. Durov holds a French passport in addition to other nationalities.</p>

<p>Durov had arrived in Paris from Baku, Azerbaijan, and was planning to have dinner in the French capital, a source close to the case said.</p>

<p>He was accompanied by a bodyguard and a personal assistant who always accompany him, added the source, asking not to be named.</p>

<p>France's OFMIN, an office tasked with preventing violence against minors, had issued an arrest warrant for Durov in a preliminary investigation into alleged offences including fraud, drug trafficking, cyberbullying, organised crime and promotion of terrorism, another source said.</p>

<p>Durov is accused of failing to take action to curb the criminal use of his platform.</p>

<p>Telegram said in response that "Durov has nothing to hide and travels frequently in Europe."</p>

<p>"Telegram abides by EU laws, including the Digital Services Act -- its moderation is within industry standards," it added. "It is absurd to claim that a platform or its owner are responsible for abuse of that platform."</p>

<h3><strong>'Assault on basic human rights'</strong></h3>

<p>Durov founded Telegram in 2013 after his first project, the Russian social network VKontakte (VK), ran into ownership difficulties he blamed on the Kremlin. He left Russia in 2014.</p>

<p>Telegram has become hugely popular partly due to the ease of viewing and posting videos on its messaging "channels".</p>

<p>But critics accuse it of hosting often illegal content ranging from extreme sexual imagery, disinformation and also services for buying drugs.</p>

<p>Russia's embassy to Paris said it had demanded access to Durov but had had no response from France, saying "the French side is refusing to cooperate".</p>

<p>Musk, who leads the Tesla car group and the X social media platform, formerly Twitter, posted the hashtag #FreePavel on X and commented in French, "Liberte Liberte! Liberte?" (Freedom Freedom! Freedom?).</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="qme"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FreePavel?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FreePavel</a><br />
<a href="https://t.co/B7AcJWswMs">pic.twitter.com/B7AcJWswMs</a></p>
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1827572720936030703?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 25, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>US whistleblower Edward Snowden, who took asylum in Russia, blasted "an assault on the basic human rights of speech and association", saying he was saddened Paris had "descended to the level of taking hostages as a means for gaining access to private communications."</p>

<h3><strong>'Express their freedoms'</strong></h3>

<p>One of the key questions is why Durov flew into France when he would have likely been aware he was wanted in the country. "Perhaps he had a feeling of impunity," said a source close to the case, asking not to be named.</p>

<p>Telegram, an encrypted messaging app based in Dubai, has positioned itself as a "neutral" alternative to US-owned platforms, which have been criticised for their commercial exploitation of users' personal data.</p>

<p>It also plays a key role in the war between Ukraine and Russia after Moscow's invasion of its neighbour.</p>

<p>The app is used by Kyiv including President Volodymyr Zelensky in regular video statements to push Ukraine's message across but also by the so-called Russian "Z-bloggers" who strongly back the war and report from the front.</p>

<p>In a rare interview given to right-wing talk show host Tucker Carlson in April, Durov predicted Telegram would have one billion users next year and insisted that despite his wealth his priority was to be "free".</p>

<p>"My mission in life was to allow other people to also become free... and using the platforms that we created my hope was that they could express their freedoms. This is the mission of Telegram."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A knife attack at a street festival in western Germany killed three people on Friday.</p>

<p>A Syrian man has been detained on suspicion of carrying out the rampage on behalf of the Islamic State (IS) group.</p>

<h3><strong>Here is what we know:</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>Festival attacked</strong></h3>

<p>The attack took place at around 9:40 pm (1940 GMT) on the Fronhof, a busy square in Solingen city centre. Stages and various attractions had been set up as part of celebrations to mark the city's 650th anniversary.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/syrian-man-confesses-to-killing-3-in-germany-stabbing-attack-6415186" target="_blank">attacker</a> struck in front of one of the stages during a concert by the group Suzan Koecher's Suprafon, aiming for the victims' necks, according to police. He then fled the scene.</p>

<p>A witness told the local daily Solinger Tageblatt that he was just a few metres away and "understood from the expression on the singer's face that something was wrong".</p>

<p>"And then, a metre away from me, a person fell," the witness, Lars Breitzke, said.</p>

<p>When he turned around, he saw other people lying on the ground amid pools of blood, he added.</p>

<p>Two men aged 56 and 67 and a 56-year-old woman were <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/3-killed-in-knife-attack-during-street-festival-in-germany-6408590" target="_blank">killed in the attack</a> and eight people were wounded, four of them seriously.</p>

<h3><strong>Islamic State claim</strong></h3>

<p>On Saturday evening, the IS group said in a statement that one of its members had carried out the attack in "revenge" for Muslims "in Palestine and everywhere".</p>

<p>"The perpetrator of the attack on a gathering of Christians in the city of Solingen in Germany yesterday was a soldier of the Islamic State," the statement from the jihadists' Amaq news agency said on the Telegram messaging app.</p>

<p>Anti-terrorism prosecutors in Germany have taken over the investigation.</p>

<h3><strong>Suspect confesses</strong></h3>

<p>Police said on Sunday that a 26-year-old <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/suspected-german-festival-stabber-who-killed-3-arrested-6411953" target="_blank">Syrian </a>had turned himself in to the authorities and confessed to carrying out the attack.</p>

<p>The suspect, named as Issa Al H., managed to escape amid the panic and threw his knife into a bin, according to details published by the Bild daily that have not been confirmed by investigators.</p>

<p>Police have seized the knife as well as the suspect's "blood-stained" jacket, which still contained his wallet and identity papers, Bild reported.</p>

<p>After the attack, the suspect reportedly took cover in a courtyard around the corner from the home for refugees where he had been living in the city centre.</p>

<p>He was found there during a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/police-search-for-assailant-after-3-killed-in-germany-stabbing-incident-6406755" target="_blank">police patrol</a> in the pouring rain just before midnight on Saturday, Bild said.</p>

<p>Issa Al H. arrived in Germany in December 2022 and had a protected immigration status often given to those fleeing war-torn Syria, according to Bild and other news outlets.</p>

<p>He was meant to have been deported to Bulgaria, where he had first arrived in the European Union, but the operation failed after he went missing.</p>

<p>He was not known to the security services as an extremist considered dangerous.</p>

<p>Police also arrested a 15-year-old after witnesses allegedly saw him discussing the attack with a man who could have been the perpetrator shortly before it happened.</p>

<h3><strong>High alert</strong></h3>

<p>German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser warned earlier this month that "the threat posed by Islamist terrorism remains high" in Germany.</p>

<p>The biggest danger is thought to be posed by Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K), the same group believed to have been behind March's deadly massacre in a Moscow concert hall.</p>

<p>The number of people considered Islamist extremists in Germany fell slightly from 27,480 in 2022 to 27,200 last year, according to a report from the federal domestic intelligence agency.</p>

<p>Islamist extremists have carried out <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/3-german-teenagers-detained-for-planning-isis-like-attack-5425532" target="_blank">several attacks</a> in Germany in recent years, the deadliest being a truck rampage at a Berlin Christmas market in December 2016 that killed 12 people.</p>

<p>More recently, an Islamist motive is suspected in the killing of a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/germany-stabbing-german-cop-stabbed-at-anti-islam-rally-dies-police-5803947" target="_blank">police officer</a> in a knife attack on the market square in the city of Mannheim in late May.</p>

<p>In January, police arrested three people over an alleged attack plot targeting the cathedral in Cologne on New Year's Eve.</p>

<p>In July, German authorities raided and banned the Hamburg Islamic Centre, an association that the interior ministry described as an "Islamist extremist organisation pursuing anti-constitutional objectives".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The US has deployed its new long-range air-to-air missile that could potentially disrupt the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific in the US-China 'Cold War'.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US has deployed its new long-range air-to-air missile that could potentially disrupt the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific in the US-China 'Cold War'. The AIM-174B missile, onboard the US Navy's F-18 Super Hornet, as seen in many pictures, is known to have an operational range of approximately 400 km.</p>

<p>The AIM-174B derivative of the Raytheon SM-6 surface-to-air missile operated out of US naval platforms. The SM-6 is a multi-role missile used for anti-air warfare, anti-ballistic missiles, and anti-surface warfare.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-08/j3fpu9q_aim174b-missile_625x300_26_August_24.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>The AIM-174B was reportedly first spotted during the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise, the world's largest naval exercise with 26 participants. The missile was attached to a hardpoint under the wings of the Super Hornet, garnering attention due to its potential to disrupt the balance of power in the air.</p>

<h3><strong>All About AIM-17B</strong></h3>

<p>Air Interceptor Missile (AIM)-174B is the air-to-air version of the SM-6 missile. It is readily available due to the existing production line for the SM-6 missile. The Raytheon SM-6 missile has a booster stage, which propels the missile into the air, followed by a solid rocket booster and sustainer motor of the missile work to hit the target.</p>

<p>The SM-6 weighs around 1,500 kilograms, while the AIM-174 weighs approximately 850 kg due to no booster motor. The US Navy's new missile has a speed of Mach 3.5, i.e. 3.5 times the speed of sound. The missile is considered to be a direct equivalent of the Russian Rh-37 Vympel long-range hypersonic air-to-air missile with a range of 400 km and the Chinese PL-15 long-range missile has a range of 300-350 km.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="The SM-6 missile is three missiles in one" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-08/vf4u7vu8_sm6-missile-_625x300_26_August_24.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="The SM-6 missile is three missiles in one" /></div>

<p>China PLA Navy has reportedly deployed an advanced version of PL-15, the PL-17 missile, with a range of 400 km. The last dedicated long-range air-to-air missile the US Navy had was the AIM-54 Phoenix for the F-14 Tomcat. The fighter jet and the missile were out of service in 2004.</p>

<p>During the Cold War, the US Navy's doctrine used long-range AIM-54 Phoenix to defeat Russian air threats before they could come closer to carrier battle groups. After the USSR broke up and the Russian Navy's strength fell, the US Navy stopped investing in such missiles and retired the AIM-54 Phoenix. Today, the development of the AIM-174B over 30 years after the Soviet Union broke proves the US Navy is once again returning to its Cold War naval doctrine, with China replacing Russia as the main maritime threat.</p>

<h3><strong>Why air-to-air missiles in the age of stealth fighters?</strong></h3>

<p>The US and China are extensively building new generation stealth fighter jets that can evade enemy radars by going undetected and striking inside their territory. The US began with the F-117 Nighthawk fighter bomber, then the F-22 Raptor and now the F-35, the most advanced fighter jet in the world.</p>

<p>China is not behind with its Chengdu J-20 fifth-generation stealth fighter jet.</p>

<p>When stealth fighters can avoid detection, then why are nations focusing on long-range air-to-air missiles? The answer is fear. China developed the PL-15 long-range missile, which can be deployed on the J-20, meaning, now a stealth fighter can strike targets from far away without getting detected. Recently, the PL-17 was deployed on its J-16 fourth-generation fighter. China's move shifted the balance of power in the air in the volatile region of East Asia.</p>

<p>A stealthy Chinese aircraft could theoretically spot non-stealthy U.S. aircraft and shoot them down well outside the range where they could even fight back, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-navys-newest-air-to-air-missile-could-tilt-balance-in-south-china-sea-6336606">Reuters reported</a>, quoting Kelly Grieco, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center.</p>

<p>Even US stealth aircraft might be forced to fly dangerously close to fire their missiles. "If a Chinese fighter can outrange an American fighter, it means they can get the first shot," she said. "It's hard to outrun something that's travelling at Mach 4."</p>

<p>The AIM-174B was quickly developed to address this need. Now, US fighter jets can target Chinese military installations from long range, avoiding the danger of flying close to the targets.</p>

<p>Justin Bronk, an airpower and technology expert at London's Royal United Services Institute, told Reuters that China is developing long-range missiles, but the radar of launching aircraft may not be able to spot targets at such distances. "If you go too big and too heavy on missiles, then you end up trading off fuel," he said.</p>

<p>An Airborne Warning and Control (AWAC) aircraft acts as an aerial command centre during combat, and combat patrol missions. These aircraft detect the enemy from long range. The new missiles will be tasked to strike high-value targets like the AWACs as well.</p>

<h3><strong>The Island Chains</strong></h3>

<p>A potential direct military face-off between the US and China could happen near the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2015/07/americas-security-role-in-the-south-china-sea?lang=en" rel="no follow, no index">South China Sea</a>, a major transit route for maritime trade and the US Navy. China has threatened Taiwan with a military invasion and in the event of a full-blown Chinese assault, the US is bound by law to defend Taiwan.</p>

<p>The Taiwan Relations Act mandates that the US have a policy to provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character".</p>

<p>American Foreign Policy statesman John Foster Dulles presented the Island Chain Strategy to keep a check on USSR and Chinese expansion by establishing military bases on the West Pacific. The USSR collapsed in 1991, but the Chinese economic and military expansion made the strategy important.</p>

<p>It works on several lines of defence for the US to stop any military invasion. The strategy has its roots in World War II when Imperial Japan took over most of East Asia and attacked Pearl Harbour, effectively bringing the US to the war.</p>

<p>Any military conflict around the South China Sea will fall within the First Island Chain, which comprises the Kuril Island, claimed by Japan but under Russian control, the Japanese archipelago, Taiwan, the north Philippines, and Borneo.</p>

<p>The First Island Chain is an important geopolitically important boundary for the US area with vast amounts of natural resources and economic significance. Any conflict would mean the US operating close to China.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="The First Island Chain is the first line of defence for the US" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-08/djs875lo_first-island-chain_625x300_26_August_24.jpeg?im=FitAndFill,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="The First Island Chain is the first line of defence for the US" /></div>

</div>

<p>The US would come even closer to China if Beijing invaded Taiwan. An AIM-174B missile would keep its aircraft carriers and fighter jets at a safer distance and put PLA hunting ships and aircraft carriers out of range. Reuters reported quoting a Taiwan-based strategist that this would increase the likelihood of the US directly getting involved in a military conflict with China over Taiwan.</p>

<p>The game-changer missile would push the US further into the South China Sea region therefore titling the equation, which as of now remains in China's favour.</p>

<h3><strong>India And Its Air-to-Air Missile Arsenal</strong></h3>

<p>India has developed the<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.drdo.gov.in/drdo/technology-cluster-links/labs-products-detail/2093/182" rel="no follow, no index"> Astra Mk1</a> beyond visual range air-to-air missile that is operational and mounted on the Su-30MKI fighter jet. The Astra Mk1 has a speed of Mach 4.5 with a range of 100 kilometres. The Astra Mk2 and Mk3 are under trial but are far behind what the US and China have.</p>

<p>The use of extremely long-range BVR missiles is based on the requirements of the Indian Air Force or Indian Navy unlike the US and China. The Astra Mk1 is operational on Su-30MKI so at present only the IAF operates the missile but later it will be developed for other aircraft too. The primary long-range air-to-air missile in service with the Indian Air Force is the Meteor on the Rafale fighter jets, which is widely considered the most advanced air-to-air missile in the world.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan scrambled fighter jets after a Chinese military aircraft "violated" Japanese airspace, the defence ministry said Monday.</p>

<p>A Chinese aircraft was "confirmed to have violated the territorial airspace off the Danjo Islands in Nagasaki Prefecture," the ministry said in a statement, adding it had launched "fighter jets on an emergency basis".</p>

<p>The "Y-9 intelligence-gathering" aircraft entered Japanese airspace at 11:29 am (0229 GMT) for around two minutes, the ministry added.</p>

<p>Local media including public broadcaster NHK said the incident marked the first incursion by the Chinese military's aircraft into Japan's airspace.</p>

<p>Japanese and Chinese vessels have previously been involved in tense incidents in disputed areas, in particular the Senkaku islands in the East China Sea, known by Beijing as the Diaoyus.</p>

<p>The remote chain of islands have fuelled diplomatic tensions and been the scene of confrontations between Japanese coastguard vessels and Chinese fishing boats.</p>

<p>Beijing has grown more assertive about its claim to the islands in recent years, with Tokyo reporting the presence of Chinese coast guard vessels, a naval ship and even a nuclear-powered submarine.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday urged European nations to help down drones and missiles over Ukraine in the wake of deadly Russian aerial bombardments across his country.</p>

<p>He said a Russian barrage hit Ukraine Monday with more than 100 missiles and around 100 drones, including in several western regions neighbouring or near European countries.</p>

<p>"In our various regions of Ukraine, we could do much more to protect lives if the aviation of our European neighbours worked together with our F-16s and together with our air defence," Zelensky said in a post on social media.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>"If such unity has worked so well in the Middle East, it should work in Europe as well. Life has the same value everywhere," he added, apparently referring to the US helping Israel shoot down Iranian projectiles.</p>

<p>He also once again urged Ukraine's allies to drop restrictions on the use of long-range weapons, which Kyiv wants to use to launch strikes deeper inside Russian territory.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire Elon Musk has shared a rare glimpse into the inner workings of Tesla's latest innovation - Cortex, a cutting-edge AI training supercluster being built at Tesla Headquarters in Austin.</p>

<p>In a post on X, the Tesla CEO gave the world a view of the Cortex supercluster, a massive array of supercomputers. "Video of the inside of Cortex today, the giant new AI training supercluster being built at Tesla HQ in Austin to solve real-world AI," Mr Musk wrote on X.</p>

<p>The facility is expected to play a crucial role in developing and refining Tesla's AI models, which will be used to improve or enhance the company's electric vehicles, energy products and other technologies.</p>

<p>Earlier in July, Elon Musk announced that Tesla would bring a 50,000 GPU cluster online, doubling down on its Dojo custom AI chip supercomputer. The cluster will increase Tesla's capabilities to scale full-scale driving FSD and other AI initiatives.</p>

<p>Mr Musk also addressed internal Nvidia emails revealing plans to ship thousands of GPUs reserved for Tesla to his private ventures X and xAI. He stated that the GPUs were needed to fill Tesla's data centres and would be used to support Tesla's AI initiatives.</p>

<p>Tesla's CFO, Vaibhav Taneja, mentioned that the company still expects capital expenditures to pass $10 billion despite a dip in Q2 capex, as per a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/elon-musk-tesla-to-bring-50000-gpu-cluster-online-doubling-down-on-dojo-supercomputer/">DataCentreDynamics</a>. Mr Musk also launched a poll asking users whether Tesla should invest $5 billion in his AI startup xAI.</p>

<p>The announcements come as Tesla reported second-quarter earnings that missed expectations, with a decline in revenue and profits. However, Elon Musk remains committed to advancing Tesla's AI capabilities, stating that the company has "no choice" but to make Dojo work due to the high demand for Nvidia GPUs. Mr Musk aims to make Dojo a success, with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1815850297895576040">8,000 H100-equivalent training online</a> by year-end.</p>

<p>Mr Musk's xAI aims to release Grok 2 in August and work on Grok 3, which will rival OpenAI's GPT-5.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war shows no signs of ending soon, with daily reports of devastation emerging from the battlefield. The conflict has now encroached on residential areas, affecting ordinary citizens. A recent video has surfaced, capturing footage of a Ukrainian drone striking a residential building in Saratov. The attack bears a chilling resemblance to the way planes collided with the World Trade Centre during the 9/11 attacks.</p>

<p>The Russian regional health ministry told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://sputnikglobe.com/20240826/four-people-injured-after-drone-attack-on-russias-saratov---regional-health-ministry-1119908853.html" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>Sputnik,</em></a> "Four people were injured after a drone attack on the Russian city of Saratov, including one woman who was hospitalised in serious condition.".</p>

<p>"One woman was hospitalised in serious condition in one of the medical institutions of the city of Saratov. Three injured persons received assistance on the spot," it said.</p>

<p>Several social media handles shared a video on X, showing the aftermath of a drone strike on a high-rise apartment building in Saratov. The attack caused significant damage and disrupted air travel in the region.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Dutch data protection watchdog said Monday it hit ride-hailing app Uber with a 290-million-euro ($324 million) fine over the transfer of personal data of European drivers to US servers.</p>

<p>The regulator said the transfers were a "serious violation" of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as they failed to appropriately protect driver information.</p>

<p>"Uber did not meet the requirements of the GDPR to ensure the level of protection to the data with regard to transfers to the US. That is very serious," Dutch Data Protection Authority (DPA) chairman Aleid Wolfsen said in a statement.</p>

<p>The DPA said Uber collected sensitive information of European drivers, including taxi licences, location data, photos, payment details, identity documents, "and in some cases even criminal and medical data of drivers".</p>

<p>Over a two-year period, the DPA said, the information was transferred to Uber's US headquarters without using transfer tools.</p>

<p>"Because of this, the protection of personal data was not sufficient," the DPA said.</p>

<p>Uber said it would appeal the fine.</p>

<p>"This flawed decision and extraordinary fine are completely unjustified," an Uber spokesperson said in a statement</p>

<p>"Uber's cross-border data transfer process was compliant with GDPR during a 3-year period of immense uncertainty between the EU and US. We will appeal and remain confident that common sense will prevail," the statement said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One person has died and two others were still missing a day after an ice cave collapsed in southeast Iceland while a tour group was visiting the area, police said Monday.</p>

<p>A group of 25 people of "several nationalities" were on an organised tour of the glacier Breidamerkurjokull together with a guide, when the cave collapsed, police said in a statement.</p>

<p>Police said that four people got stuck under the ice and two of them had been found.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Sudurland police said the two people recovered were seriously injured, but added in a later statement early Monday that one of them had been "pronounced dead at the scene."</p>

<p>The other person was transported to a hospital by helicopter and was in a "stable" condition.</p>

<p>Rescue services began a search operation for the two missing Sunday and were continuing the search on Monday.</p>

<p>"A large number of rescuers and responders have taken part in the operation," police said, adding that the conditions were "difficult."</p>

<p>Authorities decided to temporarily suspend the search on Sunday evening once it became too dark and it was no longer considered safe.</p>

<p>The glacier where the accident happened is near the glacial lagoon Jokulsarlon, one of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/worst-volcanic-activity-in-50-years-in-iceland-after-major-volcano-eruption-6400507" target="_blank">Iceland's</a> more popular tourist destinations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lamis al-Jaar says she can hardly sleep at night after hardline Jewish settlers violently assaulted her and four other members of her Israeli Bedouin family, sparking outcry across the country.</p>

<p>On August 9, the 22-year-old got lost while driving with her young daughter, two sisters and a niece from the Bedouin city of Rahat in southern Israel towards Nablus, a large Palestinian city in the occupied West Bank.</p>

<p>The women say that when they asked a man for directions, they unwittingly set in motion what Israeli police would later describe as a "serious attack" -- one that heightened concerns about rising settler violence and spurred an outpouring of support for the family.</p>

<p>The man they approached sent them down the wrong road, then blocked their car when they tried to turn around, allowing a dozen assailants to descend on the vehicle, throwing stones and brandishing weapons.</p>

<p>Lamis, a teacher's aide in a kindergarten, was certain she was going to die. She told AFP how one of the men threatened her daughter Elaf, just two and a half years old, "with the barrel" of his firearm.</p>

<p>Her sister Raghda al-Jaar, a 29-year-old assistant in a dentist's office, said the men shattered the car windows and sprayed its occupants with tear gas.</p>

<p>"I said... that we were Israeli citizens," Raghda recounted, but when one of the men realised she was calling the police he threw a rock at her and shouted: "You will not leave here alive!"</p>

<p>Despite being outnumbered, the group managed to flee and were eventually rescued by Israeli police and soldiers.</p>

<p>Police said they had "accidentally entered" Givat Ronen, an outpost of the Jewish settlement of Har Bracha, south of Nablus.</p>

<h3><strong>Religious nationalists</strong></h3>

<p>The area is run by members of the so-called hilltop youth, religious nationalists who dream of settling all the biblical land of Israel, and who sometimes also clash with Israeli security forces.</p>

<p>Israel's Bedouins are descendants of Muslim shepherds who once roamed freely across desert expanses far beyond the country's current borders.</p>

<p>Like other Arab minorities in Israel, they often complain of discrimination.</p>

<p>Rahat, where the al-Jaar family lives, is home to one of the biggest concentrations of Bedouins.</p>

<p>During the interview with AFP, which took place at the home of their father Adnan al-Jaar, Lamis and Raghda described their injuries: fractured fingers and back pain for Lamis and a head injury for Raghda, whose left leg is also in a cast.</p>

<p>Two days after the attack, Israeli President Isaac Herzog called Adnan al-Jaar to tell him he was "shocked" by the violence and that "all citizens of Israel deserve equal and decent treatment", his office said.</p>

<p>Adnan al-Jaar, a 59-year-old truck driver who like his daughters switches easily between Hebrew and Arabic, told AFP such outreach "makes us feel good", even though he fears the crime, like other instances of violence, could go unpunished.</p>

<p>The police have so far announced the arrest of five suspects, four of whom remain in custody while the fifth is under house arrest.</p>

<h3><strong>Chorus of support</strong></h3>

<p>The attack against the al-Jaars occurred against the backdrop of worsening violence in the West Bank.</p>

<p>Israeli settlements in the territory are illegal under international law, and the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/new-israeli-settlements-threaten-creation-of-palestinian-state-says-un-5199759">United Nations</a> considers them an obstacle to peace with Palestinians.</p>

<p>But settlements have grown under all governments, both left and right after Israel occupied the West Bank in 1967, and they have increased significantly since the formation in December 2022 of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's current government.</p>

<p>Netanyahu appointed several far-right ministers who support the annexation of the entire West Bank, an agenda they have pursued even more aggressively since the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip on October 7.</p>

<p>The violence meted out to the al-Jaars nevertheless appears to have shaken Israel, and myriad voices have denounced it.</p>

<p>Centre-right opposition lawmaker Matan Kahana visited the al-Jaar home to show solidarity, saying he was "reassured that the majority of the Israeli people condemn this act".</p>

<p>Rabbi Benny Lau, known as a moderate Orthodox figure, posted a photo on Facebook of his meeting with Adnan al-Jaar, accompanied by a message emphasising the aspirations of "the millions... who want to live together".</p>

<p>Amit Segal, a television personality known for his right-wing views, condemned the remarks of a far-right parliamentarian whom he accused of colluding with "supporters of terrorism" by trying to shift blame for the August 9 attack onto the victims.</p>

<p>Ordinary Israelis have also spoken out.</p>

<p>Noa Epstein Tennenhaus, 41, recently drove an hour and a half with her husband and their four children to present a toy to young Elaf.</p>

<p>"I cried" upon learning of the attack, she told AFP.</p>

<p>"I imagined being in the position of Lamis in the car and being attacked by these monsters."</p>

<p>"Blind hatred is going to get us all killed in the end if we don't stand up to it," she added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Thai court will sentence Thursday a famed Spanish actor's son charged with murdering and dismembering a Colombian plastic surgeon he met online.</p>

<p>The case against Daniel Sancho Bronchalo, a 30-year-old chef and son of actor Rodolfo Sancho, has generated enormous interest in his home country, with scores of Spanish reporters flying in for the trial.</p>

<p>He is accused of murdering and dismembering Edwin Arrieta Arteaga on the tourist island of Koh Pha Ngan last year.</p>

<p>His trial on charges of premeditated murder, hiding a body and destroying documents was held in April on nearby Koh Samui, another tourist hotspot known for its turquoise waters and rave parties.</p>

<p>Sancho denies premeditated murder, but remains in detention after admitting he killed Arrieta, 44, in what he says was self-defence.</p>

<p>He has also admitted hiding the body, but denies destroying the Colombian's passport.</p>

<p>The two had agreed to meet up after getting to know each other online.</p>

<p>The trial heard that Sancho had placed parts of Arrieta's body in plastic bags and distributed them around Koh Pha Ngan.</p>

<p>Though his crimes are punishable by the death penalty, Arrieta's family has said they would prefer life in prison.</p>

<p>"Let him be left in Thailand so he can take time, all the time that God gives him to live, to think about what he did," Darling Arrieta, the victim's sister, said in an HBO documentary about the case.</p>

<p>"He not only dismembered my brother, he dismembered a family."</p>

<h3><strong>'An accident'</strong></h3>

<p>Sancho's father said in the same documentary that Arrieta had threatened his son, after which "there was a fight, and in this fight there was an accident".</p>

<p>The defence maintains that Sancho acted in legitimate self-defence after Arrieta tried to force him to have sex.</p>

<p>"He tried to rape me, and we fought," Sancho said in a statement quoted by the Spanish daily El Mundo.</p>

<p>According to the paper, Sancho said he didn't immediately inform the police of Arrieta's death because he was in shock, and because it was all "an accident".</p>

<p>But a lawyer for the victim's family, Juan Gonzalo Ospina, said in a recent interview with El Mundo that Sancho was living a "false reality".</p>

<p>"He continues to deny responsibility for what he did," he said.</p>

<p>The Thai police, he added, "have done a commendable job" reconstructing the crime and finding evidence.</p>

<p>"When Sancho went to report the disappearance of Edwin Arrieta looking for an alibi, they already knew the author of the crime was him," he said.</p>

<p>Ospina said it was proven at the trial in April that Sancho had bought knives, plastic bags and cleaning supplies ahead of the crime, and kept them in the room where the killing took place.</p>

<p>"This is indisputable," he added.</p>

<p>He said Sancho acknowledged at trial that Arrieta went into convulsions after he hit him.</p>

<p>"In his statement he admitted that afterwards, he finished him off. That is to say, he murdered him," he added.</p>

<p>However, a lawyer for Sancho's family, Carmen Balfagon, told the Spanish news programme Cronica that they were "very optimistic, because in the trial we demonstrated that there was no premeditation".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>North Korean state media reported earlier this month that leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the delivery of 250 new tactical ballistic missile launchers described as modern tactical weapons personally designed by Kim to be transferred to the border.</p>

<p>Experts have said Pyongyang could use them to attack or threaten Seoul.</p>

<p>South Korean intelligence officials, however, are sceptical over whether North Korea can supply enough missiles for the 250 missile launchers while it also supplies weapons to Russia as part of bilateral military cooperation, Yonhap reported on Monday, citing lawmakers on the intelligence committee.</p>

<p>North Korea and Russia have been accused of conducting <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/key-points-of-north-koreas-landmark-strategic-partnership-treaty-with-russia-5930166">arms trade</a> by Seoul and Washington to help replenish Russia's stock of missiles and artillery for its war with Ukraine.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Philippines has confirmed two more mpox virus infections of the milder clade 2 variety, its health ministry said Monday, bringing the number of active cases to three.</p>

<p>"We continue to see local transmission of mpox clade II here in the Philippines, in Metro Manila in particular," Health Minister Teodoro Herbosa said in a statement.</p>

<p>The newly confirmed cases were a 37-year-old male in Metro Manila who had rash on his body last week and was brought to a government hospital, and a 32-year-old male from the capital who had skin lesions on his body.</p>

<p>The Philippines announced last week it had detected a case of the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/what-is-mpox-how-it-spreads-critical-symptoms-and-more-6409144" target="_blank">mpox</a> virus' milder variant in a 33-year-old male who had no travel history outside the Philippines.</p>

<p>The three cases this year means the Philippines has had 12 laboratory-confirmed case since July 2022.</p>

<p>The World Health Organization earlier this month declared mpox a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-declares-mpox-global-health-emergency-for-second-time-in-2-years-6339042" target="_blank">global public health emergency</a>, its highest form of alert, for the second time in two years, because of an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo that had spread to neighbouring countries.</p>

<p>A new form of the virus has triggered global concern as it seems to spread easily though routine close contact.</p>

<p>The disease, caused by the monkeypox virus, leads to flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions. It is usually mild but can kill, with children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV, all at higher risk of complications.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine's incursion into Russia, which entered a third day Thursday, appears to be an unprecedented assault which experts say could aim to draw Russian resources away from other areas or to undermine morale.</p>

<p>Ukraine has maintained an unusual silence, with no one officially acknowledging that an operation was even taking place. Top officials have declined to comment, even on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>Russia has given only scarce updates as it seeks to strike a balance between denouncing the escalation and avoiding panic.</p>

<p>Here are some key issues surrounding the cross-border attack:</p>

<h3><strong>What has happened?</strong></h3>

<p>At about 8.00am (0600 GMT) on Tuesday, Ukrainian forces launched an assault into Russia's southwestern Kursk region, according to the Russian army.</p>

<p>Russia says Ukraine deployed around 1,000 troops and more than two dozen armoured vehicles and tanks.</p>

<p>Russia accused Ukrainian forces of indiscriminately attacking civilian buildings, and rushed reinforcements, air and artillery firepower to repel the attack. A state of emergency has been declared in the region.</p>

<p>At least five civilians have been killed and 31 wounded since Tuesday, Russian officials said Wednesday.</p>

<p>Russia evacuated several thousand people from zones that have been shelled, while Ukraine announced a mandatory evacuation of around 6,000 people in the Sumy region, just across the border from Kursk.</p>

<h3><strong>Why is it special?</strong></h3>

<p>The assault seems unprecedented due to its reported scale, and because it appears to involve regular Ukrainian troops.</p>

<p>Fighters from Ukraine have made several brief incursions into Russia before. Some have been by units of Russians fighting in support of Kyiv -- the Russian Volunteer Corps and the Freedom of Russia Legion.</p>

<p>In mid-March, during the Russian elections, Ukrainian assault groups repeatedly tried to gain control of territory in the Belgorod region, officials had said.</p>

<p>Ukraine's allies seem surprised by the assault, which had been surrounded in secrecy. The United States says it has reached out to Kyiv for information.</p>

<p>Ukrainian military expert Sergiy Zgurets, who runs his own consultancy, told AFP that "the photos of the destruction of Russian and Ukrainian equipment, helicopters, the use of aviation, the use of artillery on both sides" indicated a significant military operation.</p>

<h3><strong>What gains have Ukrainian forces made?</strong></h3>

<p>Ukrainian troops have advanced up to 10 kilometres (six miles) into Russia, the US-based Institute for the Study of War said on Thursday.</p>

<p>The advance has centred on the logistical hub of Sudzha, a town of around 5,000 inhabitants about eight kilometres (five miles) from the Ukraine border.</p>

<p>Russian military bloggers, who have links to the army, also reported Kyiv had made significant advances with some reporting that Ukrainian soldiers control some parts of Sudzha.</p>

<h3><strong>What could be the aim of this raid?</strong></h3>

<p>The goals of the assault are unclear, this early in the operation and without any official comment from Ukrainian forces, but experts suggest several hypotheses.</p>

<p>Some said the incursion may seek to draw Russian reserves away from the nearby Kharkiv front in Ukraine, where Russia launched an offensive in May.</p>

<p>"For now, this is a limited operation, whose direct consequence will be to reduce the stability of the Russian group attacking/hovering over Kharkiv," Ukrainian military analyst Oleksiy Kopytko said on social media.</p>

<p>"Judging by the scale and intensity of the Ukrainian operation, sooner or later, the enemy will be forced to pull troops from other operational areas," Ukrainian military observer Kostiantyn Mashovets said on Facebook.</p>

<p>The assault could also have a psychological effect -- boosting the morale of Ukrainians who have seen their troops suffer a string of setbacks while trying to destabilise Russia.</p>

<p>"Another goal is to show Russian society what it feels like when your territory is occupied," Sergiy Solodkyy, deputy director at Kyiv's New Europe Centre think tank, told AFP.</p>

<p>Finally, some argue that if Ukraine could hold the territory, it would gain leverage against Russia in hypothetical peace negotiations.</p>

<p>Gaining an edge is crucial to Ukraine ahead of the US presidential election in November. Republican candidate Donald Trump is a Ukraine-sceptic.</p>

<p>"This is coercion to peace... ideally, Russia should withdraw troops," Solodkyy said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>At the Democratic National Convention (DNC) stage in Chicago, Little Amara shouts, "Everybody over here, say 'Kama'." Then joins in her sister, Leela, "Everybody over here, say 'La'." The lesson continues, "Together 'Kama-la.'" The excited crowd shouts in unison, <em>"Kaama-la"</em>.</p>

<p>The two young women are the grand-nieces of the US Vice-President and the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, Kamala Harris. It's ironic that a nation that has seen its Vice President work tirelessly for the past three-and-a-half years still needs a lesson in pronouncing her first name. Even then, they don't get it right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pronunciation of her name is just scratching the surface. Kamala, in essence, is yet another example of how across the West, even if political leaders of colour manage to reach the top, they find themselves operating within systems that remain resistant to profound transformation and dominated by White leaders. Behind their historic achievements still lies that complex web of said and unsaid racism, bias, and discrimination, which continues to affect politicians and celebrities of colour, even at the highest levels of power. Barack Obama, Rishi Sunak, and even leaders who deny this reality, like Nikki Haley and Priti Patel, have all had to contend with it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Justifying Her Name, And Also Her Place In America</strong></h2>

<p>At the DNC, after that elaborate pronunciation lesson, 'Kaamala' - as the Americans pronounce it - went on to introduce herself to a nation she was born in 59 years ago. Daughter to immigrant parents, she tried to connect with her people emotionally. She spoke about herself, her beloved Indian mother, her sister, her Jamaican connection through her father, and her strong Indian links. The media was kind enough to say she "reintroduced" herself to all Americans. In her 40-minute-long speech, she urged people of colour to "never let anyone tell you who you are. You show them who you are".&nbsp;</p>

<p>And yet, she dedicated her whole speech telling all Americans who she was. She had to. It was not enough for her country folks that in 2021 she shattered all glass ceilings by becoming the first woman, first Black American, and first Indian American to hold the office of Vice-President of the United States. She passionately declared in Chicago, "I promise to be a President for all Americans." And, as if unsure of the people's trust in her, Harris pleaded with the people to put faith in her, "You can always trust me to put country above party and self."</p>

<h2><strong>Biden Didn't Have To Re-Introduce Himself</strong></h2>

<p>The difference between President Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is perhaps the fact that Biden was Obama's running mate twice, and both times, he did not have to get someone to tell the nation whether his name was pronounced as 'Biden', 'Beden', or 'Byden'. He did not have to "re-introduce" himself, and he did not have to punch above his weight.</p>

<p>Those privileges are not available to Kamala Harris.&nbsp;It has been a euphoric few days for Harris, and it's true that her party has welcomed her with open arms, and that she has so far been getting good press. But the question is, is America itself ready to accept a woman - and a person of colour - as President?</p>

<h2><strong>Obama Couldn't Escape Racism. Kamala Can't Either</strong></h2>

<p>When Barack Obama burst onto the political centre stage, campaigning for the coveted post in 2008, many had questioned whether America was ready for a Black President. He swept away the last racial barrier in American politics without much trouble. But even Obama faced questions about his birth certificate and legitimacy, something that has come to be known as the 'birther conspiracy'. It's a false and racist theory that claims Obama was not born in the United States and was therefore ineligible to be president. The theory was heavily promoted by former President and now Harris's Republican opponent Donald Trump, who was a private citizen at the time.</p>

<p>When he was finally elected, Obama offered hope and promised change-something Harris is repackaging today. But Trump, too, is repackaging his old playbook. He recently questioned Harris's racial identity in Chicago during a heated exchange at a convention for Black journalists; he had earlier even insinuated that Harris was "not American enough" to be the President. Kamala herself has spoken publicly about her experiences with racism and discrimination. In her memoir The Truths We Hold, she wrote about her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, teaching her and her sister how to cope with racism: "My mother would say, 'You will be faced with people who don't like you because of the colour of your skin. But you must never let that define you.'" In a 2020 speech, she spoke about the challenges of overcoming stereotypes: "As a woman of colour, I've had to fight to be seen, to be heard, and to be believed... But I've never let anyone define me or my potential."&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Sunak's Story</strong></h2>

<p>The problem non-White politicians face is universal across the West. During the UK election campaign early last month, a leader of Nigel Farage's Reform Party passed racist comments against his own sitting Prime Minister, calling Sunak a "Paki". Sunak was angry, but he did not push back enough except to show his hurt during a media interview: "My two daughters have to see and hear Reform people who campaign for Nigel Farage calling me an 'effing P***'. It hurts, and it makes me angry, and I think he has some questions to answer."</p>

<p>There was jubilation all over the UK when Rishi Sunak became the Prime Minister in 2022. From relative obscurity in 2015, when he was elected as an MP for the first time, to becoming the country's first Indian-origin, Hindu Prime Minister, Sunak's was a fairytale story. Back then I had been told by White people, Pakistani and Bangladesh-origin people that Rishi Sunak was the right choice. His leadership was lauded as evidence of the UK's commitment to diversity and meritocracy. But despite his position, Sunak was subjected to racial slurs and scepticism about his loyalty and cultural affiliations. Even the office of the Prime Minister could not exempt him from the prejudices and challenges faced by other people of colour.</p>

<p>The experiences of Obama, Kamala, and Sunak, along with other politicians of Indian descent, such as Priti Patel in the UK or Nikki Haley in the US, illustrate a broader pattern where the representation of minority groups in politics is no doubt celebrated but does not necessarily translate into meaningful change for those communities. The control, decision-making powers and authority remain with the White masters - even if leaders like Patel and Haley continue to defend racist and discriminatory actions or remarks against the people of their communities.</p>

<h2><strong>The Battle Ahead For Kamala</strong></h2>

<p>Anyway, it has been smooth sailing for Kamala Harris so far. But she faces an opponent known for dealing in personal insults. Apparently, Trump knew before Joe Biden withdrew himself from the race that he would be replaced by Harris. He told a crowd about it much before her nomination, "I got him [Joe Biden] out of the race, and that means we have Kamala." Trump then added, "She's so bad. She's so pathetic." He has already questioned her racial identity, and is now on to find a nickname for her that sticks. &nbsp;His personal attacks continue as he keeps reminding his supporters that she laughs like a "lunatic" and is "crazy".</p>

<p>For Kamala Harris, after a fantastic first few weeks, the honeymoon will well and truly be over soon.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 102-year-old woman in Britain opted for a unique birthday celebration this year. On August 25, Manette Baillie, who was once married to a paratrooper and served in the Women's Royal Naval Service during World War II, skydived out of a plane to become the oldest woman to do so.</p>

<p>Ms Baillie jumped with UK Parachuting Services Ltd as part of a charity event, raising money for Benhall's village hall, the Motor Neurone Disease Association, and the East Anglian Air Ambulance, which once saved her son's life on the Isle of Wight after a diving accident in 1969. Her efforts have so far raised over £10,000 of her £30,000&nbsp;target, inspiring others to give back.</p>

<p>Soon after her jump from 7,000 feet above Beccles Airfield in East Anglia, Ms Baillie told <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cvg3k02wlemo">BBC</a> radio that she was "breathless".</p>

<p>"It was a bit scary. I must admit I shut my eyes very firmly," she added.</p>

<p>On healthy ageing, she explained, "I just want other people who are getting towards 80 and 90 not to give up anything. Just keep going. I've been so lucky to be fit and well that I've got to do something with it, that's really the back of it," she said. I can't just waste it, other people are crippled with arthritis, and I'm not."</p>

<p>This wasn't the first time the former war veteran had sought an adrenaline rush. For her 100th birthday, she drove around Silverstone in a Ferrari at 130mph, setting another record. Speaking to Radio 4, she affirmed her fearless nature, saying, "I really don't do fear. It's no good. It's 130 miles per hour, to begin with, before they pull the rip cords for the parachute, and then it's gently floating down."</p>

<p>Ms Baillie was motivated to take on a skydiving challenge after a friend's 85-year-old father pulled off something similar. "If an 85-year-old man can do it, so can I," she remarked.</p>

<p>Prince William also commended Ms Baillie for her daring spirit, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/aug/25/manette-baillie-britain-oldest-skydiver-suffolk">The Guardian</a> reported. In a heartfelt note, the Prince wrote, "Catherine and I hear you'll be marking your 102nd birthday with a parachute jump! Given your history of racing a Ferrari at 100, we're not surprised!"</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Nearly three years after Russian forces invaded Ukraine, many medical facilities in war-battered eastern Ukraine have been damaged or destroyed, while those left untouched are overcrowded.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It looks like an ordinary train waiting to depart an ordinary station, but through its fogged windows, a Ukrainian serviceman with face injuries lies stretched out on a gurney.</p>

<p>All of the other blue-and-yellow carriages of this train operated by the military are carrying wounded soldiers to hospitals away from the precarious front line.</p>

<p>Nearly three years after Russian forces invaded Ukraine, many medical facilities in war-battered eastern Ukraine have been damaged or destroyed, while those left untouched are overcrowded.</p>

<p>For Oleksandr, the army doctor overseeing the evacuation, there are clear benefits to rail: many people can be moved at once and it is safer than transporting wounded soldiers by helicopter, given Russian superiority in Ukraine's airspace.</p>

<p>But there are risks too.</p>

<p>"Our adversary in the war does not distinguish between what's medical and military, so we take certain security measures," the 46-year-old said.</p>

<p>AFP was recently granted rare media access to the train, whose points of departure and arrival are not being disclosed for security reasons.</p>

<p><strong>'Everything on the move'</strong></p>

<p>Ambulances arrived at the station carrying dozens of wounded troops who were then hauled onto the train on stretchers and settled on beds with floral-patterned sheets.</p>

<p>Ukrainian flags and hand-drawn pictures by children annotated with patriotic messages lined the walls inside the train.</p>

<p>The carriages resemble a hospital until the train rolls away from the platform and gently rocks patients and staff -- and everything else inside -- as it crawls farther from the front.</p>

<p>"We do everything on the move, everything. Starting from the usual intravenous injections, ending with incubations," said Viktorya, a nurse dressed in khaki and wearing blue medical gloves.</p>

<p>"We get dizzy afterwards," the 25-year-old said, standing in front of a window, the sweeping Ukrainian landscape rolling by.</p>

<p>The journeys to and from the front, where Ukraine is coming under increasing pressure, have given Viktorya a painful insight into the cost of the conflict grinding through its third year.</p>

<p>"I understand the number of wounded now. It's very hard to see it every day," she said.</p>

<p>Kyiv -- like Moscow -- is tight-lipped about its soldier casualty count.</p>

<p>President Volodymyr Zelensky in February said the number of Ukrainian servicemen confirmed killed was around 31,000 -- a figure observers say is likely an underestimate -- but the number of missing and wounded has never been disclosed.</p>

<p><strong>Worried about others</strong></p>

<p>Most of those wounded were struck in artillery or drone attacks, staff explained, and many have had arms or legs amputated or were unconscious.</p>

<p>One carriage is designated for patients who have been in intensive care and doctors can even operate on patients in case of "force majeure," doctor Oleksandr said.</p>

<p>Things can go wrong and mass bleeding -- an unpredictable and rapid killer -- is a major concern for staff.</p>

<p>"Staff are always near the patient," Oleksandr explained, adding that they take turns using the toilet or eating.</p>

<p>Despite the logistical issues around caregiving on moving trains, the wounded soldiers' preoccupations lie elsewhere.</p>

<p>"Their psychological state is not good," Olena, a medical staff worker, told AFP.</p>

<p>"They're not worried about losing a limb or whatever else. What depresses them is how their comrades are and how their family is," Olena added.</p>

<p><strong>'A sigh of relief'</strong></p>

<p>One Ukrainian serviceman on the train was being treated for a gunshot wound after being caught in a Russian ambush that also killed one of his fellow soldiers.</p>

<p>"Four of us left but not all of us returned," the 28-year-old who identified himself as Murchyk said.</p>

<p>But he was already gauging when he might be able to make his way back to the front, where Ukraine's outnumbered forces have been ceding ground to determined Russian advances.</p>

<p>Whether Murchyk can return to combat will be decided by a medical commission, but he said he was clear-eyed about his wish.</p>

<p>"I'd like to go back," he told AFP.</p>

<p>The train evacuations in Ukraine began when the war did, in February 2022.</p>

<p>It revives a process used in World War II, with several refitted trains now taking wounded troops from the front.</p>

<p>When Oleksandr's train arrives at its destination, ambulances are already waiting for the patients to be loaded off and taken onwards to hospital.</p>

<p>"It is of course very stressful and yes, you breathe a sigh of relief when you arrive and unload," he said, "when you see that all the ambulances have left, when the platform is empty and the train is empty."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Courts, bullets and verbal stumbles have made their mark on this year's US election campaign -- one of the most extraordinary in the nation's history.</p>

<p>Here are five key moments so far as candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris edge towards Election Day on November 5.</p>

<p><strong>Trump The Felon</strong></p>

<p>"Trump Guilty," is splashed across the world's front pages. On May 30 the Republican becomes the first former US president to be convicted of felony crimes -- 34 counts to be exact.</p>

<p>He is found to have falsified business records to hide a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels on the eve of his 2016 election win, so that she would not publicize their alleged sexual encounter.</p>

<p>In the explosive six-week trial, Daniels shares excruciating details about their apparent one-night stand, including the sex position and Trump's silky pajamas.</p>

<p>The ordeal pulls him from the campaign trail, but huge media attention ensures he keeps the spotlight -- even if it is on his criminality.</p>

<p>Nothing in US law prevents Trump from running for the White House after the guilty verdict, and Republicans double down their unwavering support for the party standard-bearer, who still faces three other criminal cases.</p>

<p><strong>Debate Drama</strong></p>

<p>Democratic hopes appear shattered after President Joe Biden, the party's presumptive nominee, delivers a disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump on June 27.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old fumbles his words and often appears to forget what he is saying, bolstering fears that he is not fit to run again for president.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Biden brushes it off as a "bad night" but dissenters say otherwise, with donors threatening to pull funding if he does not step aside.</p>

<p>Post-debate polling shows Trump pulling away from Biden but the White House insists there is zero chance he will withdraw.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Assassination Attempt</strong></p>

<p>A sun-baked Trump rally in Pennsylvania on July 13 provides the election campaign's most shocking moment yet.</p>

<p>Popping sounds ring out, Trump touches his ear, sees blood, and drops to the stage floor. Secret Service officers surround him as screams ring out in the crowd.</p>

<p>Within seconds Trump is helped back to his feet. "Fight, fight, fight!" he mouths to a now cheering audience, raising his fist to create one of the most iconic images in US political history.</p>

<p>The gunman, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, is shot dead at the scene by the Secret Service, and Trump survives with a minor graze to his right ear.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump's base is galvanized. "I took a bullet for democracy," he tells his supporters at a later rally.</p>

<p><strong>Biden Says 'Bye'</strong></p>

<p>At 1.46 pm on Sunday, July 21, a beleaguered President Biden announces in a tweet that he will not seek reelection, yielding to intense concerns over his ability to defeat Trump in November.</p>

<p>It makes him the first sitting president since 1968 not to seek reelection, and upends the White House race.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris, the first female, Black and Asian-American to serve as US vice president, gains Biden's endorsement to replace him in the campaign.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Within two weeks she formally secures the Democratic nomination, making her the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harris re-energizes Democrats and delivers immediate results in opinion polls by clawing back Trump's gains, including in the election-deciding swing states.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Trump's Second Scare</strong></p>

<p>Trump's weekend round of golf in Florida on September 15 is shattered by the sound of gunshots -- this time fired by a Secret Service agent foiling what the FBI calls an apparent assassination attempt.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Republican nominee is unharmed in the second such scare in two months.</p>

<p>Investigators say the gunman, Ryan Routh, did not shoot at Trump but instead fled when a security agent opened fire after seeing his rifle pointing through a tree line at the golf course.</p>

<p>Trump attributes the assassination scare to the allegedly provocative "rhetoric" of Biden and Harris.</p>

<p>The Democrats say they condemn political violence, but the incident highlights the volatility of US politics just weeks before voters head to the polls.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The rise of social media has led to a deluge of reels and videos, with millions of people sharing content online. However, the craze has taken a disturbing turn as many&nbsp;prioritise likes and followers over their safety. The desire for the perfect shot has led people to take risks, often with disastrous consequences Insta Reels and other social media platforms are filled with videos of people taking videos and selfies in precarious locations, such as train tracks, mountains, waterfalls, and busy roads.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recently, a similar video went viral showing a teen getting struck by a speeding train. The footage is said to be shot at&nbsp;Shingimari Railway Bridge in Bangladeshi's Rangpur, but the date of the incident could not be confirmed.&nbsp;The footage shows a group of boys trying to take a TikTok video near a speeding train. In a split second, the situation turns tragic as one of them is accidentally hit by the train while standing too close to the tracks. Fortunately, according to subsequent social media posts, the teen survived the horrific accident.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The video has sparked a range of reactions, with many finding the accident terrifying and others blaming the boy's carelessness. While some have expressed relief that the kid survived, others have used the incident as a cautionary tale, highlighting the importance of being mindful and responsible when taking videos.</p>

<p>One user wrote, ''pls dont make such mistakes stay safe.'' Another commented, ''It's hard to believe how people can become so absorbed in making content that they ignore everything happening around them.'' A third said, ''I don't understand why people are so obsessed with taking selfies close to a moving train. It's not as if it's a monument or a heritage site worthy of a photo.''</p>

<p>Earlier this year, a woman died after coming too close to a train while <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/on-camera-woman-struck-dead-by-train-in-mexico-while-taking-selfie-5830443">clicking a selfie in Mexico</a>.&nbsp; According to local outlets, some people had gathered to click a photo of a vintage train with a steam engine near Hidalgo as it was passing by. The woman came too close to the tracks while positioning herself for a selfie with the approaching train, known as the 'Empress'.&nbsp;She dropped to one knee and the corner of the train engine hit her on the back of her head, sending her crashing forward.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jane Lu, the founder of online fashion retailer Showpo, has shared the "worst job application ever" she received. The application, to assist her, appears to have been written with artificial intelligence (AI), the Australian businesswoman said. She discovered blatant errors and likened it to “ChatGPT copy and paste.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/27/lifestyle/ceo-slams-embarrassing-gen-z-job-application-trend/">video on TikTok</a>, Ms Lu, a panellist on Shark Tank, read out the application, highlighting the lack of attention to various details in it. "I am confident that my experience in (relevant experience/skill) positions me as a strong candidate,” read the job application.<br />
<br />
In the document, key details such as the skills on “specific projects, courses or initiatives” were left blank, indicating how the applicant failed to proofread it before submitting it to the company.<br />
<br />
The applicant did not remove part of the prompt generated by the AI platform at the top of the cover letter, which read, “Here is a more polished and articulate version of your cover letter”.<br />
<br />
Lu noted that the applicant "copied and pasted this thing that's, like, half-filled”.<br />
<br />
She later apologised to the applicant for failing to make it to the next round (interviews), besides reminding others to "use a little bit of this", pointing to her head.<br />
<br />
As per the data released by YouGov, almost half of the people in Australia -- 48% -- are aware of major AI platforms, like ChatGPT, but it does not mean they are as likely to use them.<br />
<br />
Data show how youngsters were most likely to rely on AI platforms, with two-fifths of 'Gen Z' (40%) and millennials (37%) using ChatGPT at least once.</p>

<p>Jane Lu, a well known fashion guru, started Showpo in 2010 from her parent's garage. Over the last couple of years, the brand has emerged into a big name in the industry. It is known for its trendy and affordable clothing. She has also launched the Lazy Ceo's guide to starting and growing an online business.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Prince William has opened up about how a childhood experience with his late mother, Princess Diana, influenced him to help the homeless.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prince William has opened up about how a childhood experience with his late mother, Princess Diana, influenced him to help the homeless.&nbsp;In his upcoming documentary,<em> Prince William: We Can End Homelessness,</em> the 42-year-old recalls his first visit to 'The Passage', a London charity dedicated to helping homeless people. Accompanied by his brother, Prince Harry, and Diana, William first visited the organisation when he was 11.</p>

<p>“My mother took me to The Passage; she took Harry and I both there,” the Prince of Wales recalled in a newly released clip from the two-part series, as per <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/27/uk/prince-william-diana-photos-homelessness-intl/index.html" rel="nofollow,noindex">CNN</a>. “I'd never been to anything like that before, and I was a bit anxious as to what to expect.” His mother lightened the mood, “having a laugh and joking with everyone,” putting him at ease, the Royal added.</p>

<p>The visit had a profound impact on Prince William. “I remember thinking, 'Well, if everyone's not got a home, they're all going to be really sad.' But it was incredible how happy an environment it was... That's when it dawned on me that there are other people out there who don't have the same life as you do.”</p>

<p>The documentary, directed by BAFTA winner Leo Burley, chronicles the Prince's Homewards initiative — a five-year project launched in June 2023 aimed at ending homelessness in six flagship locations across the UK. It also highlights the stories of individuals experiencing homelessness or struggling with it.</p>

<p>Homelessness is “a complex societal issue”, he stressed, but added it can be eradicated. “Achieving this will require a movement that creates systemic change. A change that focuses on prevention rather than management. And one that ensures all young people have truly affordable options to live and thrive independently.”</p>

<p>The documentary also addresses criticisms over the Prince's privileged background and whether he is suited to tackle such issues. In another clip, he responded that he had “no other agenda than desperately trying to help people” who are in need. “I see that as part of my role.”</p>

<p>The documentary will premiere on ITV at 2:30 am IST on Thursday, October 31. The second episode will air at the same time the following day.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Swing states, electoral college votes, candidates up and down the ballot, and millions of potential voters: here is the US election, broken down by numbers.</p>

<h2><strong>Two</strong></h2>

<p>Several independents ran -- and at least one, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, stumbled into a number of eyebrow-raising headlines.</p>

<p>But in the end, the presidential race comes down to a binary choice, with the two candidates from the major parties -- Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump -- seeking to lead a polarized America.</p>

<h2><strong>Five</strong></h2>

<p>November 5 -- Election Day, traditionally held on the Tuesday following the first Monday in November.</p>

<h2><strong>Seven</strong></h2>

<p>The number of swing states -- those which don't clearly favor one party over the other, meaning they are up for grabs.</p>

<p>Harris and Trump are courting voters in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, concentrating their campaign efforts there in an effort to ensure victory.</p>

<p>In a razor-tight election, just a handful of votes in any of those states could decide the outcome.</p>

<h2><strong>34 and 435</strong></h2>

<p>Voters won't just decide the White House occupant on Election Day -- they will also hit refresh on the US Congress.</p>

<p>Thirty-four Senate seats and all 435 spots in the House of Representatives are up for grabs.</p>

<p>In the House, members serve a two-year term. Republicans currently have the majority, and Harris's Democrats will be hoping for a turnaround.</p>

<p>In the Senate, 34 seats out of 100 are available, for a six-year term. Republicans are hoping to overturn the narrow Democratic majority.</p>

<h2><strong>538</strong></h2>

<p>Welcome to the Electoral College, the indirect system of universal suffrage that governs presidential elections in the United States.</p>

<p>Each state has a different number of electors -- calculated by adding the number of their elected representatives in the House, which varies according to population, to the number of senators (two per state).</p>

<p>Rural Vermont, for example, has just three electoral votes. Giant California, meanwhile, has 54.</p>

<p>There are 538 electors in total scattered across the 50 states and the District of Columbia. To take the White House, a candidate must win 270 votes.</p>

<h2><strong>774,000</strong></h2>

<p>The number of poll workers who volunteered to make sure the 2020 election ran smoothly, according to the Pew Research Center.</p>

<p>There are three types of election staff in the United States.</p>

<p>The majority are poll workers -- recruited to do things like greet voters, help with languages, set up voting equipment, and verify voter IDs and registrations.</p>

<p>Election officials are elected, hired or appointed to carry out more specialized duties such as training poll workers, according to Pew.</p>

<p>Poll watchers are usually appointed by political parties to observe the ballot count -- expected to be particularly contentious this year, thanks to Trump's refusal to agree to unconditionally accept the result.</p>

<p>Many election workers have already spoken to AFP about the pressure and threats they are receiving ahead of the November 5 vote.</p>

<h2><strong>270 million and 78 million</strong></h2>

<p>Harris's team spent $270 million on her campaign in September, while Trump's spent much less -- only $78 million, official filing show.</p>

<p>According to the New York Times, Harris's campaign set a record for the biggest fund-raising quarter ever this fall, raising $1 billion since she entered the race following Joe Biden's withdrawal in July.</p>

<h2><strong>244 million</strong></h2>

<p>The number of Americans who will be eligible to vote in 2024, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.</p>

<p>How many of those will actually cast their ballot remains to be seen, of course. But the Pew Research Center says that the midterm elections of 2018 and 2022, and the presidential vote of 2020, produced three of the highest turnouts of their kind seen in the United States in decades.</p>

<p>"About two-thirds (66%) of the voting-eligible population turned out for the 2020 presidential election - the highest rate for any national election since 1900," Pew says on its website.</p>

<p>That translated to nearly 155 million voters, according to the Census Bureau.</p>

<h2><strong>41 million</strong></h2>

<p>As of October 27, more than 41 million Americans had voted early, according to a University of Florida database.</p>

<p>Most US states permit in-person voting or mail-in voting to allow people to deal with scheduling conflicts or an inability to cast their ballots on election day itself on November 5.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prince William publicly acknowledged his brother, Prince Harry, in a recent documentary. This was the first time he mentioned him amid the ongoing familial rift. In his new ITV documentary titled ‘Prince William: We Can End Homelessness,' the Prince of Wales reflected on a significant childhood memory he shared with Harry during a visit to a homelessness charity.</p>

<p>According to a report in the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/27/entertainment/prince-william-publicly-mentions-prince-harry-for-first-time-since-ongoing-riff/" rel="nofollow,noindex">New York Post</a>, William recalled, “My mother took me to The Passage; she took Harry and I both there. I must have been 11 at the time, maybe 10. I had never been to anything like that before, and I was a bit anxious about what to expect.”</p>

<p>A photograph from the visit shows the young princes at the charity, with Harry sitting on their mother, Princess Diana's lap, both smiling for the camera.</p>

<p>The Prince&nbsp;remembered how Princess Diana's presence created a cheerful atmosphere at the centre; she made the people “feel relaxed,” laughing and joking with them. He said, “I remember at the time kind of thinking, ‘Well, whoever's not got a home, they're all going to be really sad,' but it was incredible how happy an environment it was.”</p>

<p>The relations between the two brothers strained after Harry's marriage to Meghan Markle. While Kensington Palace's official account posted a 40th birthday wish for Harry, William's comments in the documentary represent a rare public reference to his brother in recent years.</p>

<p>Tensions increased when Harry and Meghan relocated to California in 2020, followed by their high-profile interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021, where they made allegations of racism against an unnamed royal family member. The release of their Netflix docuseries, ‘Harry &amp; Meghan,' in 2022 and Harry's memoir, ‘Spare,' have further complicated family dynamics, particularly after Harry accused William of physically attacking him during an argument over Meghan.</p>

<p>In June, Harry declined an invitation to the wedding of Hugh Grosvenor, the Duke of Westminster, due to William's expected attendance. Although Harry was invited, he declined to attend out of concern for an “awkward” confrontation with William, a royal expert told <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/prince-harry-skipped-royal-wedding-avoid-awkward-encounter-estranged-brother-prince-william-expert" rel="nofollow,noindex">Fox News Digital</a>.</p>

<p>Although Harry made a brief visit to London in February 2024 for a meeting with King Charles following the monarch's cancer diagnosis, he did not meet with William at that time. It is believed that their last conversation took place in 2022, after the death of Queen Elizabeth II.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump turned to the home stretch of his campaign with a marathon rally in the heart of Manhattan, flanked by Elon Musk and other allies aiming to frame voters' decision around who can fix America's woes.</p>

<p>Trump's event at the fabled Madison Square Garden, which lasted for nearly six hours Sunday, featured criticisms of Vice President Kamala Harris over the border, crime and the economy. Trump mused about safely Democratic New York flipping to his column, painting a view of an America gripped in crisis.</p>

<p>"We must defeat Kamala Harris and stop the radical left agenda with a landslide that is too big to rig," Trump said.</p>

<p>He was joined by roughly two dozen speakers, from celebrity wrestler Hulk Hogan to House Speaker Mike Johnson to Musk himself, who is campaigning for Trump and pouring money into the race. Some of the speeches included fraught remarks about Puerto Rico, Palestinians and Black Americans.</p>

<p>Musk predicted he could find $2 trillion in cuts in a Trump administration, a massive target that would fundamentally reshape government spending.</p>

<p>"Your money is being wasted," said Musk, the final speaker aside from Trump and his wife Melania in a rare appearance during the campaign. "We're going to get the government off your back and out of your pocket book."</p>

<p>The event at the iconic venue was intended to command the media spotlight and mobilize the former president's supporters about a week before Election Day. Trump's campaign had promised a spectacle, and thousands of people lined up along city streets hours before the rally kicked off shortly around 3 p.m. at the packed arena that has a 20,000-person capacity.</p>

<p><strong>Government Spending</strong></p>

<p>New York isn't considered a battleground state for a presidential race polls show is close between Trump and Harris, though it has several competitive House races that could decide control of the chamber. Still, the distinctive setting of Madison Square Garden - host to some of the nation's biggest cultural moments - offered a stage to help the Republican nominee amplify his message beyond his base, including undecided voters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was something of a capstone for Trump, who rose to fame in New York only to be shunned by many of its figures as president. It's also the city where a jury earlier this year found him guilty of 34 felony accounts of falsifying business records.</p>

<p>Trump has said he would ask Musk, the world's richest person and a major donor to his campaign, to head up an effort to cut government spending, nicknamed the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a reference to a cryptocurrency Musk has embraced.</p>

<p>Critics have said this position would represent a conflict of interest for Musk. The companies he runs, including Tesla Inc. and SpaceX, have billions of dollars worth of federal contracts and have benefited from federal spending, including electric vehicle tax credits and infrastructure investments.</p>

<p>Cantor Fitzgerald LP's Howard Lutnick asked Musk on stage how much he could "rip out of" the budget under President Joe Biden and Harris. Musk responded, "Well, I think we can do at least $2 trillion, yeah."</p>

<p>The $2 trillion target represents nearly a third of existing spending. The federal government spent $6.75 trillion in fiscal year 2024, according to the Treasury Department.</p>

<p>Musk has spent at least $132 million to elect Trump and other Republicans in 2024, federal filings show. That level of giving has vaulted him into the upper echelon of political donors, making Musk one of the most prolific contributors of the entire 2024 cycle.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Controversial Speakers</strong></p>

<p>The speeches also included controversial comments that undercut what at other points were messages of national unity from Trump. Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host, joked that Harris was a trailblazer as the first "Samoan-Malaysian low-IQ" person who could be elected. Harris would actually be the first Black woman and the first Indian-American in the White House.</p>

<p>Several speakers also urged supporters to be sure to vote, to bring people to the polls and to vote early. "You line up like you're the third monkey in line for the ark, and it's starting to rain," Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. said.</p>

<p>At the event, Trump unveiled a credit for caregivers who take care of family members. The Republican nominee didn't provide details or say how he would pay for it. His litany of tax proposals already includes benefits for tipped workers, hourly employees, senior citizens and higher-income residents of Democratic-led states whose tax breaks he took away while president.</p>

<p>Harris has proposed expanding Medicare to cover home care services. She's also proposed to expand tax credits for parents and boost deductions for startup businesses, offset by increasing levies on corporations and wealthy households.</p>

<p>Trump has said he would raise fresh revenue from across-the-board tariffs, which he aims to impose on imports from US allies and adversaries alike. Economists have warned tariffs won't offset the price tag of his tax cut ideas and could increase costs on US households.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The stabbings at a children's dance party on July 29 led to a wave of unrest fuelled by misinformation, particularly the false narrative that the suspect was an illegal migrant. ]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A single LinkedIn post, removed for false claims, was viewed millions of times, causing riots across England and Northern Ireland. The stabbings at a children's dance party on July 29 ignited a wave of unrest fuelled by misinformation, particularly the false narrative that the suspect was an illegal migrant.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just hours after the attack, misinformation spread widely through various unofficial news sources and personal accounts. Among them was a LinkedIn post from Eddie Murray, a local who posted three hours after the incident.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“My two youngest children went to a holiday club this morning in Southport for a day of fun only for a migrant to enter and murder/fatally wound multiple children,” he wrote. While Murray was relieved that his children were safe, he called for drastic measures, saying, “If there's any time to close the borders completely, it's right now! Enough is enough.”</p>

<p>Despite LinkedIn removing the post for harmful content, the damage was done. The post was copied and reshared widely, leading to over two million views across platforms, reported the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c99v90813j5o" rel="nofollow,noindex">BBC</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The misinformation spread like wildfire, partly due to the lack of detailed information from the Merseyside Police. Following protocol, the police couldn't reveal specifics about the suspect, who was a minor. After the attack, they only released a brief statement, saying armed officers arrested a male and seized a knife. But this limited update did little to stop the intense speculation, which had already taken off on social media.</p>

<p>Murray's post became just one among many fuelling the narrative. Shortly after, an Indian online news account ‘Upuknews' retweeted a screenshot of Murray's claims as “confirmed,” drawing over half a million views, as per the BBC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>High-profile figures, including Paul Golding, co-leader of Britain First, and Nicholas Lissack, a Reform Party activist, who claimed he had “confirmed the authenticity” of Murray's statement, amplified this misinformation. By this time, a fabricated name, “Ali Al-Shakati,” emerged as the supposed identity of the suspect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By the evening of July 30, a Telegram group named “Southport Wake Up” was established, calling for gatherings that turned violent. Activists and far-right groups used the chaos to fan the anti-immigrant sentiments. Reports from the scene captured the protesters chanting slogans against the police, fuelled by the false narratives circulating online.</p>

<p>Experts have noted the profound implications of such misinformation. Jonathan Hall KC, the government's independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, stated that the law currently “stokes the risk of online disinformation,” claiming that false claims about the suspect's identity are plausibly connected to the violence that followed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In response to the chaos, Ofcom, the media regulator, confirmed that there was a “clear connection” between the violence in England and Northern Ireland and the spread of disinformation on social media.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Days ahead of a close presidential election, two of the most prestigious liberal American newspapers have declined to give their usual endorsements to the Democratic Party candidate, sparking furious reactions.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Days ahead of a close presidential election, two of the most prestigious liberal American newspapers have declined to give their usual endorsements to the Democratic Party candidate, sparking furious reactions.</p>

<p>The Los Angeles Times and Washington Post announced they had ended their decades-long practice of officially backing a presidential contender.</p>

<p>That drew a pointed retort from the Post's former top editor Marty Baron, who suggested his old newspaper was giving in to intimidation from Republican Donald Trump.</p>

<p>"This is cowardice," Baron said on X, "with democracy as its casualty."</p>

<p>The generally left-leaning newspaper -- owned by the billionaire Jeff Bezos, the founder and owner of Amazon -- was about to back Kamala Harris but said Friday that it would no longer endorse presidential candidates in any future election.</p>

<p>That decision, following a similar move by the Los Angeles Times, sent shock waves through politics and journalism.</p>

<p>The Post, in seeking to justify its choice, said: "Our job as the newspaper of the capital city of the most important country in the world is to be independent. And that is what we are and will be."</p>

<p>But the newspaper's guild, representing its journalists, said it was "deeply concerned," adding that "an endorsement for Kamala Harris was already drafted, and the decision to not publish was made by The Post's owner, Jeff Bezos."</p>

<p>A source close to the paper's leadership denied that to AFP.</p>

<p>Earlier in the week, the billionaire owner of the Los Angeles Times, Patrick Soon-Shiong, overruled the paper's editorial staff, which also wanted to endorse Vice President Harris.</p>

<p>Several Times employees of both papers resigned in protest, including editorials editor Mariel Garza.</p>

<p>"I want to make it clear that I am not okay with us being silent," she said in an interview.</p>

<p>"In dangerous times, honest people need to stand up."</p>

<p><strong>Billionaires' power</strong></p>

<p>The Trump campaign responded with delight, saying, "Kamala is such an empty vessel, the Washington Post has decided to nuke presidential endorsements altogether rather than back her candidacy.</p>

<p>Many readers of both papers expressed outrage, vowing to cancel their subscriptions.</p>

<p>The decision not to endorse stemmed partly from the papers "not wanting to alienate potential readers," said Dannagal Young, a professor of communications at the University of Delaware.</p>

<p>But "let's be clear," she added. "The media mogul class is probably not very inclined to want to alienate (a person) who could be the president.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"People want to be on the good side of Donald Trump."</p>

<p>Many media owners have financial interests linked to the government. Bezos holds shares in companies with substantial contracts with the administration, including the Pentagon.</p>

<p>Dan Kennedy, a journalism professor at Northeastern University, said media owners were engaging in "anticipatory obedience."</p>

<p>For them "to take a pass on the presidential race this late in the campaign smacks of giving in to the punishment they might be subjected to if Trump returns to office," he added in a blog.</p>

<p><strong>Fading print giants </strong></p>

<p>Nonetheless, Harris this year won endorsements from the New York Times, the Boston Globe, Rolling Stone magazine and the Philadelphia Inquirer.</p>

<p>Trump, for his part, won the backing of the conservative Washington Times and the New York Post, a tabloid owned by magnate Rupert Murdoch.</p>

<p>But while the campaigns have increasingly bet on the influence of newer platforms like podcasts and TikTok, endorsements from prestige media "still matter," said Jane Hall, a communications professor at American University.</p>

<p>The reluctance to endorse comes at "a moment when Donald Trump is talking about going after the licenses of television stations, punishing journalists further and attacking the free press in an administration that hasn't even started."</p>

<p>In recent days, Trump has again blasted the news media as "the enemy of the people."</p>

<p>Hall said the Washington Post -- which in 2017 added the phrase "Democracy Dies in Darkness" to its masthead -- was "courageous in covering the January 6 insurrection and in standing up to threats against the media."&nbsp;</p>

<p>So its decision now to withhold an endorsement "will send a chilling effect to journalists," she said. "It's very shocking."&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US presidential election is toss-up between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump.</p>

<p>However, the two-party system still left room this year for three fringe players who could yet influence an ultra-tight election on November 5.</p>

<p><strong>Leftists Jill Stein, Cornel West</strong></p>

<p>Jill Stein, 74, ran for president as the Green Party candidate in 2012 and then in 2016, winning just 0.4 percent and one percent respectively.</p>

<p>This time, the Chicago-born physician and environmental activist will be on the ballot in nearly 40 states, presenting a headache for the Democrats as she could peel off a crucial handful of votes from Harris in contests where she is neck and neck against Trump.</p>

<p>Last week, the Democratic National Committee released a television ad against Stein in the battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which says that "a vote for Stein is really a vote for Trump."</p>

<p>Stein has sought to distance herself from President Joe Biden's administration and vowed to stop supporting what she called Israel's "genocide" in Gaza.</p>

<p>She has advocated for raising taxes for the richest Americans, canceling student debt and reducing defense spending.</p>

<p>Cornel West, another candidate from the green camp, chose to run independently of the Green Party.</p>

<p>The 71-year-old academic and anti-racism activist who calls Biden a "war criminal" and describes Trump as a "neofascist" will be on the ballot in nearly a dozen states. He too will siphon a tiny, but potentially painful number of votes from Harris.</p>

<p><strong>Chase Oliver, Libertarian</strong></p>

<p>The Libertarian Party received a little over one percent of the vote in 2020 and this year will be on the ballot in almost all 50 states, also acting as a potential spoiler.</p>

<p>The new face of the party, which advocates for free trade and limited government, is Chase Oliver, a 39-year-old former Democrat, who ran for a Senate seat from Georgia in 2022.</p>

<p>Unknown at the time, the science fiction fan who describes himself as "armed and gay" got around two percent of the vote, forcing a runoff between the incumbent Democrat and his Republican challenger.</p>

<p>Oliver favors pro-gun, fiscally conservative policies, but also supports abortion rights, the legalization of cannabis and is against the death penalty.</p>

<p>Oliver who will be on the ballot in three battleground states.</p>

<p><strong>Kennedy for Trump</strong></p>

<p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr, scion of America's storied political clan, was polling at four to five percent nationally, before he pulled out of the race in late August and endorsed Trump -- to the great chagrin of his family.</p>

<p>The environmental lawyer, conspiracy theorist and vaccine skeptic was for a time seen as a threat to Harris, with some of her supporters potentially migrating to RFK Jr. But he is also likely to draw away at least some Trump votes.</p>

<p>On quitting, he tried to get himself taken off the ballot in battleground states. But several of those states have refused to remove him as a candidate.</p>

<p>While he has since campaigned vigorously alongside Trump, it remains unclear what his ultimate impact on the election will be.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Voters in the handful of states expected to decide the US election wield outsized power in whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris becomes the next president.</p>

<p><strong>Here are what some voters in the key battleground states told AFP ahead of the November 5 election:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Pessimism in Nevada</strong></p>

<p>Leticia Chaparro, a 62-year-old bed and breakfast employee in the town of Dyer, said she sees "lots of division" now and voiced concerns about the future.</p>

<p>"I want better life for everybody, because I'm really scared for the kids, for the future."</p>

<p>"The new generations, you know, I feel sorry for them."</p>

<p>Stamp dealer Nadia Beekun of Goldfield, who gave her age as "too much," expressed frustration at the choice, but said she hopes people can begin "working together."</p>

<p>"Right now, I don't like any of the candidates that we have been offered."</p>

<p>"It is going to have to be a choice of who is a lesser of all evils, and I don't know who that is yet."</p>

<p>"I'm going to have to hold my nose and choose."</p>

<p><strong>Abortion and prices in Arizona</strong></p>

<p>At 18, medical student Madeline Tena, who identifies as Latina, will be casting her first vote for Kamala Harris, saying women's rights was a key factor.</p>

<p>"I'm worried about women's rights, and especially women's healthcare. It's like, they're already trying to take away our right for an abortion, what else can they take away? What's next?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to vote for Kamala because based on what I've seen on social media, Kamala looks a lot better than Trump. She's just really well read and looks a lot better than Trump. He looks really childish sometimes."</p>

<p>Graduate student Whitney Brown, a 35-year-old African American, similarly said abortion rights played a key role in her decision.</p>

<p>"The main thing for me is abortion rights, so I'll vote for Kamala."</p>

<p>"I have two daughters, they're now 11 and 13, and I want them to be able to have autonomy over their own body when they grow up, and not have the government in the exam room with them."</p>

<p>On the other hand, health sciences student Drew Roby says he will probably vote for Trump, expressing concerns about high prices but reservations over some of the ex-president's radical supporters.</p>

<p>"This is my first election, but I'm not really pumped up," said the 21-year-old African American.</p>

<p>"I'm probably gonna roll with Trump, because I see how the country's been run for the past four years, and honestly it was better when he was president."</p>

<p>"Life is very expensive now, between rent, groceries and gas, I don't have much to spend on myself."</p>

<p>"I worry about hate and racism spreading in this country."</p>

<p>"I only have a choice between Trump and Kamala, so I'm going for his policies, but Trump has crazy fans that really take it too far."</p>

<p><strong>Immigration in Michigan</strong></p>

<p>Brenda Adams of Sterling Heights, a 53-year-old hospital worker and part-time bakery employee, will be casting her ballot for Trump after switching from Democrat to Republican four years ago.</p>

<p>"A lot of that has to do with border patrol and inflation."</p>

<p>"Things have not changed at all in the last four years. It's gotten worse. So hopefully this year we can make a difference."</p>

<p>"I hope the prices of food, grocery, gas, hopefully things start to level out."</p>

<p><strong>'Do what's right' in North Carolina</strong></p>

<p>Shelley Hughes, 64, of Swannanoa, a mountain town impacted recently by a major hurricane, said she has some concerns about Trump but would still be voting for him.</p>

<p>"I don't care for a lot of things that he's done in the past, or even his personality sometimes," but "I just feel like he's going to do a better job."</p>

<p>"I just always feel like he's going to do what's right, regardless of what other people in government tell him. He's not a puppet."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[When political outsider Donald Trump defied polls and expectations to defeat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US presidential election, he described the victory as "beautiful."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When political outsider Donald Trump defied polls and expectations to defeat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US presidential election, he described the victory as "beautiful."</p>

<p>Not everyone saw it that way -- considering that Democrat Clinton had received nearly three million more votes nationally than her Republican rival. Non-Americans were particularly perplexed that the second-highest vote-getter would be crowned president.</p>

<p>But Trump had done what the US system requires: win enough individual states, sometimes by very narrow margins, to surpass the 270 Electoral College votes necessary to win the White House.</p>

<p>Now, as the 2024 election showdown between Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris approaches, the rules of this enigmatic and, to some, outmoded system is coming back into focus.</p>

<p><strong>Why an Electoral College?</strong></p>

<p>The 538 members of the US Electoral College gather in their state's respective capitals after the quadrennial presidential election to designate the winner.</p>

<p>A presidential candidate must obtain an absolute majority of the "electors" -- or 270 of the 538 -- to win.</p>

<p>The system originated with the US Constitution in 1787, establishing the rules for indirect, single-round presidential elections.</p>

<p>The country's Founding Fathers saw the system as a compromise between direct presidential elections with universal suffrage, and an election by members of Congress -- an approach rejected as insufficiently democratic.</p>

<p>Because many states predictably lean Republican or Democratic, presidential candidates focus heavily on the handful of "swing" states on which the election will likely turn -- nearly ignoring some large states such as left-leaning California and right-leaning Texas.</p>

<p>Over the years, hundreds of amendments have been proposed to Congress in efforts to modify or abolish the Electoral College. None has succeeded.</p>

<p>Trump's 2016 victory rekindled debate. And if the 2024 race is the nail-biter that most polls predict, the Electoral College will surely return to the spotlight.</p>

<p><strong>Who are the 538?</strong></p>

<p>Most are local elected officials or party leaders, but their names do not appear on ballots.</p>

<p>Each state has as many electors as it has members in the US House of Representatives (a number dependent on the state's population) plus the Senate (two in every state, regardless of size).</p>

<p>California, for example, has 54 electors; Texas has 40; and sparsely populated Alaska, Delaware, Vermont and Wyoming have only three each.</p>

<p>The US capital city, Washington, also gets three electors, despite having no voting members in Congress.</p>

<p>The Constitution leaves it to states to decide how their electors' votes should be cast. In every state but two (Nebraska and Maine, which award some electors by congressional district), the candidate winning the most votes theoretically wins all that state's electors.</p>

<p><strong>Controversial institution</strong></p>

<p>In November 2016, Trump won 306 electoral votes, well more than the 270 needed.</p>

<p>The extraordinary situation of losing the popular vote but winning the White House was not unprecedented.</p>

<p>Five presidents have risen to the office this way, the first being John Quincy Adams in 1824.</p>

<p>More recently, the 2000 election resulted in an epic Florida entanglement between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore.</p>

<p>Gore won nearly 500,000 more votes nationwide, but when Florida -- ultimately following a US Supreme Court intervention -- was awarded to Bush, it pushed his Electoral College total to 271 and a hair's-breadth victory.</p>

<p><strong>True vote or simple formality?</strong></p>

<p>Nothing in the Constitution obliges electors to vote one way or another.</p>

<p>If some states required them to respect the popular vote and they failed to do so, they were subjected to a simple fine. But in July 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that states could impose punishments on such "faithless electors."</p>

<p>To date, faithless electors have never determined a US election outcome.</p>

<p><strong>Electoral College schedule</strong></p>

<p>Electors will gather in their state capitals on December 17 and cast votes for president and vice president. US law states they "meet and cast their vote on the first Tuesday after the second Wednesday in December."</p>

<p>On January 6, 2025, Congress will convene to certify the winner -- a nervously watched event this cycle, four years after a mob of Trump supporters attacked the US Capitol attempting to block certification.</p>

<p>But there is a difference. Last time, it was Republican Vice President Mike Pence who, as president of the Senate, was responsible for overseeing the certification. Defying heavy pressure from Trump and the mob, he certified Biden's victory.</p>

<p>This time, the president of the Senate -- overseeing what normally would be the pro forma certification -- will be none other than today's vice president: Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>On January 20, the new president is to be sworn in.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tax breaks for families with children? Supporting Ukraine? Drilling for oil?</p>

<p>From taxes, to immigration, to abortion -- here are the five key issues which are at stake as Donald Trump and Kamala Harris enter a final sprint in the race for the White House.</p>

<p><strong>Economy</strong></p>

<p>Trump, who cut taxes for businesses and the wealthy during his 2017-2021 presidency, plans to impose tariffs of more than 10 percent on all US imports, which he says will enable him to lower taxes for Americans. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The Republican has also vowed to make the United States the "crypto capital of the planet," and launched his own cryptocurrency platform with his sons in September.</p>

<p>Democrat Harris, meanwhile, is appealing to the middle class with her promise to create an "opportunity economy," while pitching moderate tax hikes for the richest people.</p>

<p>The 60-year-old has also promoted child tax credits, support for first-time homebuyers, and help for small businesses.</p>

<p><strong>Immigration</strong></p>

<p>Trump has taken a hard-line approach on immigration, saying that he will order mass deportations of millions of undocumented migrants if reelected.</p>

<p>The former president, who in 2016 promised to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, has accused immigrants of "poisoning the blood of our country."</p>

<p>For her part, Harris has pledged a tough stance and warned of "consequences" for people who enter the country illegally.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She has supported President Joe Biden's plan to tighten up immigration policy, notably by investing in physical barriers on the border.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Abortion</strong></p>

<p>Reproductive rights are a big issue for some US voters after the federal right to abortion was removed in 2022 with the overturning of Roe v Wade, resulting in total abortion bans in some states.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump has often boasted of his role in appointing the Supreme Court justices who scrapped the 1973 decision, and has further hinted that he may restrict access to drugs used in medical abortions if reelected.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 78-year-old, who was found liable last year for sexually assaulting writer E. Jean Carroll, has nonetheless promised to be "great for women."</p>

<p>Harris wants to pass a federal law to reinstate nationwide abortion rights, making the issue a key part of her presidential campaign.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On November 5, voters in 10 states will decide whether to adopt constitutional amendments that could shape the future of abortion access in their states. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Foreign politics</strong></p>

<p>With wars raging in the Middle East and in Ukraine, Trump has promised to quickly resolve both conflicts -- though without explaining how.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He has denounced the huge amount of US funding for Kyiv since it was invaded by Russia in 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harris has pledged her enduring support for Ukraine if reelected.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both Trump and Harris offer continued backing for Israel, though the vice president has drawn more attention to the suffering of Palestinians.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Climate</strong></p>

<p>The United States is the world's second-biggest greenhouse gas emitter behind China, but neither candidate has outlined a comprehensive platform on the issue.</p>

<p>Trump, who has long denounced climate change as a "hoax" despite overwhelming scientific evidence, plans to cut subsidies for renewable energies and electric vehicles, which he says harm businesses.</p>

<p>The Republican has vowed to "drill, baby, drill" for oil, and to again remove the United States from the Paris climate agreement.</p>

<p>Harris has promoted the "Inflation Reduction Act" of President Joe Biden, which has driven investment in green energy.</p>

<p>She "is committed to continuing and building upon the United States' international climate leadership," according to her campaign website.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Much of the outside world's focus during the 2024 US election has been on what victory for Donald Trump might look like, but many Americans are fretting about the opposite outcome -- including some of his most vocal opponents.</p>

<p>The Republican ex-president, who is in a dead heat with Democrat Kamala Harris in the race for the White House, has never acknowledged the legitimacy of his election defeats -- from the 2016 Iowa primary to his presidential contest in 2020.</p>

<p>His denialism deeply polarized the country last time around, and his continued attempts to sow distrust in US democracy have sparked fears of a repeat of the violence seen during the 2021 storming of the US Capitol.</p>

<p>"Should he lose this year, I have no doubt that he will claim fraud, leave no stone unturned to reverse the results, and refuse to attend Harris's inauguration," said Donald Nieman, a political analyst at Binghamton University in New York state.</p>

<p>"He's not only a sore loser, he's someone who will never admit he lost."</p>

<p>Trump's rap sheet demonstrates that it is not beyond him to try to cheat in elections.</p>

<p>He has 34 felony convictions for a scandal involving covered-up payments to silence a porn star he feared was about to wreck his 2016 campaign with a salacious story about a sexual encounter.</p>

<p>And he has been indicted twice and impeached twice over alleged efforts to steal or otherwise cheat in the 2020 election, which he still has not conceded.</p>

<p>Rejected by the American people four years ago, Trump and his allies flooded the zone with bogus claims of irregularities and fraud.</p>

<p><strong>Deadly riot</strong></p>

<p>Trump's critics worry about a repeat of the violence that resulted from those lies -- a deadly riot by an angry mob summoned to Washington by Trump, pumped up by his claims of voter fraud and sent marching on the Capitol.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Especially since he's at it again.</p>

<p>"If I lose, I'll tell you what, it's possible because they cheat. That's the only way we're going to lose -- because they cheat," the 78-year-old told rally-goers in Michigan last month.</p>

<p>Trump has been dusting off the same baseless concerns over the legitimacy of vote counts, foreigners voting, the reliability of mail-in ballots and much else.</p>

<p>The ex-president and his allies set the stage for the 2021 riot through legal means -- more than 60 lawsuits largely complaining about the way state and local authorities had changed voting rules to take account of a raging pandemic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But they lost every substantive case, with judges ruling that objections to election organization should have been lodged long before the first ballot was cast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Republicans hit the ground running this time around, filing more than 100 lawsuits before early voting began about every aspect of the election, from how Americans register and cast ballots to who can vote.</p>

<p>Many of the suits seek to limit access to the polls and most will be unresolved by Election Day, but experts say this plays into distrust over vote-counting that Trump and other conspiracy theorists have spent years exacerbating.</p>

<p><strong>'Sporadic violence'</strong></p>

<p>"The legal skirmishes might drag on for weeks, and depending on their intensity, could lead to protests or even sporadic violence in certain areas," said political analyst Adrienne Uthe, the founder of Utah-based PR firm Kronus Communications.</p>

<p>Almost two-thirds of Americans are anticipating post-election violence, a Scripps News/Ipsos poll out Thursday found, and most support using the military to quell unrest after polls open on November 5.</p>

<p>More than a quarter believe that civil war could break out, according to a new YouGov poll, with 12 percent saying they know someone who might take up arms if they thought Trump had been cheated.</p>

<p>The intelligence community raised concerns about the potential for bloodshed in a report on election threats from foreign actors that was declassified, redacted and released last week by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.</p>

<p>"Foreign-driven or -amplified violent protests, violence, or physical threats... could challenge state and local officials' ability to conduct elements of the certification and Electoral College process," it said.</p>

<p>Security measures have been beefed up in Washington in anticipation of potential unrest, although analysts contacted by AFP saw a repeat of the 2021 insurrection in the capital as unlikely, with hundreds of subsequent prosecutions acting as a potent deterrent.</p>

<p>But they warned of the potential for violence in the battleground states during and after the election.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"My biggest fear is violence in Madison, Wisconsin; Lansing, Michigan; or Harrisburg, Pennsylvania by armed Trump supporters designed to prevent electors from casting their votes," said Nieman.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Saudi Arabia will host the biggest names in finance and technology this coming week in a test of investor appetite for the kingdom's ambitions of transforming itself into a global hub at a time of widening regional conflict.</p>

<p>International executives will have to contend with a region rocked by geopolitical tensions, with the threat of further military confrontation between Israel and Iran at the highest levels in decades. And they will land in a country that is increasingly facing up to the fact that even its vast oil wealth has limits.</p>

<p>But those arriving at the Future Investment Initiative - often dubbed Davos in the desert - seem undeterred, sensing an opportunity to plug into Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's trillion-dollar Vision 2030 economic remake. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s David Solomon, Citigroup Inc.'s Jane Fraser and BlackRock Inc.'s Larry Fink have become regulars at the Riyadh summit and are set to return this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reflecting Saudi Arabia's focus on technology and artificial intelligence, they'll be joined by prominent names in those industries. Alphabet Inc. President Ruth Porat and TikTok Inc. Chief Executive Officer Shou Chew are set to speak at the summit for the first time. Benjamin Horowitz, tech entrepreneur and co-founder of venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz, is also making an appearance.</p>

<p>Wall Street and Silicon Valley have increasingly turned to the oil-rich Middle East as liquidity gets tighter in other parts of the world, especially China. Saudi Arabia itself commands nearly $1 trillion in sovereign wealth, though the Crown Prince wants titans of industry to stop deploying that money overseas and instead help support his domestic ambitions.</p>

<p>Yet the backdrop is one of increasing uncertainty.</p>

<p>Saudi foreign policy has recently focused on lowering regional tensions in the hope that a more stable region will bring in foreign capital and technological know-how. But events of the past year have served as a reminder of how unstable the region can be.</p>

<p>"The impact of regional instability on the prospects for foreign investment is completely negative, with the possible exception of the defense industry," said Gregory Gause, Professor of International Affairs at Texas A&amp;M University. Capital is "not attracted to conflict regions, even if the country is not an immediate participant in the conflict."</p>

<p>To be sure, Saudi Arabia is still pushing ahead with its big development plans. Deals worth more than $28 billion are likely to be announced over the next week by executives from around the world, according to Richard Attias, CEO of the FII Institute.</p>

<p>Some of these will focus on AI, including potentially a new fund with Andreessen Horowitz that could grow to as large as $40 billion. The kingdom is also expected to announce a new company that will invest at least $10 billion in making Saudi Arabia a top global producer of hydrogen - a low carbon fuel that could be key to the world's transition away from burning fossil fuels.</p>

<p>Ahead of the event, General Atlantic said it's opening its first office in the Middle East - in Saudi Arabia - to scout for more deals in the region.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two exchange-traded funds will make their trading debuts in Riyadh, giving Saudi investors access to Hong Kong stocks - a reflection of the kingdom's growing ties with China as it looks to boost investment flows with its biggest trading partner. Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan, and the Commissioner for the Belt and Road, Nicholas Ho, will speak at FII as some of the highest profile speakers from Asia.</p>

<p>Still, the regional conflict is undoubtedly weighing on global investor sentiment in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia, the biggest Gulf economy, is feeling some of that.</p>

<p>The number of actively-managed emerging market funds with Saudi exposure had been rising sharply until earlier this year, but stalled at around 56% as tensions between Israel and Iran escalated, according to Copley Fund Research. The data show that the number of funds invested in the Saudi stock market fell slightly between March and September this year and that the country is the third-biggest underweight after Taiwan and India.</p>

<p>Coupled with that, Crown Prince Mohammed has had to come to terms with the limits of even Saudi Arabia's vast financial resources to pay for his ambitions. The government, which is forecasting deficits out to at least 2027, has said some projects will be need to be delayed.</p>

<p>At the same time, the Public Investment Fund, the kingdom's powerful sovereign fund that the de-facto ruler chairs, is becoming a tougher place for foreign firms to get money out of. An increased focus on domestic projects like the $1.5 trillion Neom has global asset managers fretting that the PIF will have less cash to spend abroad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The FII has always been designed as a mechanism for investment into Saudi, however in reality it has been an opportunity for foreign execs to extract financing from the Kingdom," said Zaid Belbagi, managing partner of political risk consultancy Hardcastle Advisory. "Sold-out hotels at $500-1000 per night are indicative of sustained international interest."</p>

<p>The organizers of the Riyadh jamboree remain confident, and about 7,000 people have registered to attend this year's event. That's higher than the numbers for last year's summit, which took place days after the current conflict in the region started.</p>

<p>When asked what attendees were speaking about ahead of the event, FII Institute's Attias said the US election was front of mind. There are many executives that feel developments in the Middle East hinge on the outcome of the vote, he said on a Bloomberg television interview on Monday.</p>

<p>Even so, investors are coming "despite what is happening in the world," Attias said. "The show must go on."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Beef patties have been ruled out as the source of the E. coli outbreak, McDonald's said on Sunday, adding the fast-food giant will soon resume sales of its quarter-pounder hamburgers. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) maintains that the contamination is most likely linked to slivered onions sourced from a specific supplier, McDonald's said. The company plans to reintroduce the quarter pounder but without slivered onions within a week, reported <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/mcdonalds-rules-out-beef-patties-source-e-coli-outbreak-2024-10-27/" rel="nofollow,noindex">Reuters</a>.</p>

<p>McDonald's had pulled out the quarter pounder from around 20 per cent&nbsp;of its US outlets, specifically in states such as Colorado, Kansas, Utah, Wyoming&nbsp;and parts of Idaho, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, and Oklahoma.</p>

<p>According to Reuters, Cesar Pina, the chief supply chain officer for McDonald's, reassured the public, stating, “We remain very confident that any contaminated product related to this outbreak has been removed from our supply chain and is out of all McDonald's restaurants.”</p>

<p>The Colorado Department of Agriculture conducted detailed testing, confirming all subsamples from various batches of McDonald's fresh and frozen beef patties returned negative results for E. coli. The department also indicated that it concluded its beef testing and did not foresee the need for additional samples.</p>

<p>The E. coli outbreak in the US has caused at least one death in Colorado and sickened nearly 75 others across multiple states in the US.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Max Prince, 18, discovered that a 30-pound annual administration fee eroded nearly all the savings his family expected to grow as part of Child Trust Fund.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An 18-year-old was shocked to discover that his Child Trust Fund, initially valued at 300 pounds, was reduced to just 12.39 pounds due to a hidden fee. UK's Max Prince, gifted the fund at birth as part of a government initiative, recently found that a 30-pound annual administration fee eroded nearly all the savings his family expected to grow.</p>

<p>Columbia Threadneedle, the investment firm managing the account, charged a 30-pound annual administration fee starting in 2013, something Mr Prince's family was unaware of after they moved and didn't receive notifications.</p>

<p>“We'd been waiting 18 years for this,” Mr Prince told the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg7j83drd5o " rel="nofollow,noindex">BBC</a>, “expecting to find at the very least 300 pounds or so, we instead saw the number 12.39 pounds.”</p>

<p>"It was certainly shocking, to say the least, and it's kind of outrageous as well,” he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fund was part of the Child Trust Fund (CTF) scheme, launched by then-Chancellor Gordon Brown in 2002 to encourage long-term savings for children born between September 2002 and January 2011. Each eligible child received at least 250 pounds from the government. However, after the family moved, they didn't receive letters detailing the new charges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Columbia Threadneedle explained that attempts to contact the family went unanswered, adding that returned mail meant they couldn't update Mr Prince's parents on the fee structure. “This is not the outcome we want for any of our customers,” the firm said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Statements reviewed show that by 2012, Mr Prince's account was worth over 300 pounds, but the introduction of the 30 pounds fee, which started in 2013, slowly depleted it. By the time it matured this year, nearly the entire amount was absorbed by charges, significantly exceeding the programme's 1.5 per cent cap on annual fees. The BBC calculated that Mr Prince's fund faced an effective fee rate of over 10 per cent annually.</p>

<p>Columbia Threadneedle explained that Mr Prince's CTF Shares account was subject to a specific fee model, including a 25 pounds plus VAT charge annually for administration. The firm noted that the account required the family to “actively make investment decisions,” adding that it couldn't adjust fees without direct communication from customers.</p>

<p>Mr Prince's family, who now lives in Cambridge, argued they updated their information with the postal service and set up mail forwarding but did not receive any notifications. They are now considering a complaint, calling the fee structure “unreasonable.”</p>

<p>In response to the case, Columbia Threadneedle said it would review similar accounts to identify other customers potentially affected. “As we assess our Child Trust Funds, we will place a specific focus on identifying other similar situations to assess, as appropriate, what action we can take,” the firm added.</p>

<p>“Our ongoing duty to the consumer is important to us.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A massive iceberg, A-68, which broke off from Antarctica's Larsen C Ice Shelf in 2017, has created a distinctive marine environment during its four-year drift, according to recent scientific analyses. In July 2017, the massive iceberg, later named A-68, broke off in an event called ‘calving,' and began a journey across the Southern Ocean. It became the largest iceberg adrift at the time.</p>

<p>Initially covering over 2,200 square miles (over 5,698 km) — more than twice the size of the European country Luxembourg — the iceberg captured global attention as it drifted north, propelled by ocean currents and winds.</p>

<p>Concerns rose in late 2020 when A-68 neared South Georgia Island, a critical breeding ground for threatened species. “South Georgia is an incredibly rich, dynamic marine ecosystem,” Geraint Tarling, a polar ecologist at the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, UK, told the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20241025-how-mega-icebergs-change-the-ocean" rel="nofollow,noindex">BBC</a>. The island's nutrient-rich waters support phytoplankton, krill and larger marine animals. Its shores are home to breeding colonies of threatened species, including king penguins and wandering albatrosses.</p>

<p>But the iceberg avoided a catastrophic collision with the island. It began to collapse in December 2020 and gradually broke apart and melted into smaller fragments over the course of 2021.</p>

<p>As it dissolved, A-68 released billions of tons of freshwater into the ocean, significantly altering the surrounding marine habitat. The iceberg created conditions that scientists say supported diverse ecosystems, functioning as a temporary sanctuary for various species.</p>

<p>Nutrient levels in the surrounding waters rose, drawing in ice-associated algae, which created temporary micro-ecosystems teeming with life. Zooplankton flocked to feed on the algae, and Tarling speculated larger animals like baleen whales would likely have followed.</p>

<p>“You have this sort of halo effect,” he said, as algae bloomed around the iceberg fragments.</p>

<p>"Everything was happening so fast it just completely changed the whole dynamic of that," Tarling added. “What was happening is that huge dumps of water were coming in.” The weight of the freshwater pushed down the underlying layers, causing conditions that would typically exist at 164 feet to occur at depths of 328 feet instead.</p>

<p>Any food particles drifting in the water were also forced downward. “This deepening of the water masses is creating an effect that we've never seen before, taking all this particulate material down with it,” he said.</p>

<p>This phenomenon may have actually increased the amount of carbon buried at the bottom of the Southern Ocean. Typically, organic material descends slowly through the water, with some being consumed, so only a small portion reaches the seabed to be trapped there. However, the immense weight of the freshwater from A-68a as it melted might have accelerated the descent of carbon-based material to depths where it is less likely to be consumed.</p>

<p>“No one's ever reported this,” Tarling said. This suggests that large icebergs like A-68 could play a role in driving carbon deep into the ocean, potentially reducing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>During its journey after breaking away from the Antarctic ice shelf, A-68 shed a staggering 802 billion tonnes of ice. Between late 2020 and early 2021, it released around 152 billion tonnes of freshwater into the ocean — equivalent to nearly 61 million Olympic-sized swimming pools.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A UK couple has won a 15-year-long legal battle against Google, with the tech giant facing a record 2.4 billion pound fine for market abuse. Shivaun and Adam Raff, founders of the price comparison website ‘Foundem', launched their business in 2006. Soon after going live, they noticed a dramatic drop in their website's visibility on Google searches for key terms such as “price comparison” and “shopping.”</p>

<p>The unexpected drop was caused by a search penalty from Google's automated spam filters that ranked their site much lower than expected. This penalty affected Foundem's ability to generate revenue after users couldn't access the site through Google's search results.</p>

<p>"We were monitoring our pages and how they were ranking, and then we saw them all plummet almost immediately," Mr Adam told the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr431lr72jo " rel="nofollow,noindex">BBC</a>. Initially, the couple assumed the dip in visibility was an error. "We just assumed we had to escalate to the right place and it would be overturned," Ms Shivaun explained. Even after two years and despite many attempts, Google didn't lift the penalty. Foundem's traffic continued to suffer, while other search engines ranked it normally.</p>

<p>In 2010, their case gained traction after they approached the European Commission. A lengthy antitrust investigation found Google unfairly promoted its own shopping service over competitors like Foundem. The Commission ultimately ruled, in 2017, that Google abused its market dominance, imposing a fine of 2.4 billion pounds.</p>

<p>However, Google appealed, sparking seven years of legal battles. In 2024, the European Court of Justice upheld the fine, rejecting Google's appeals.</p>

<p>For Shivaun and Adam Raff, the conclusion felt long overdue. "We've both been brought up maybe under the delusion that we can make a difference, and we really don't like bullies," said Ms Shivaun.</p>

<p>Google maintains the fine addresses practices that ended in 2017. A spokesperson told BBC, “The changes we made in 2017 to comply with the European Commission's Shopping decision have worked successfully for more than seven years, generating billions of clicks for more than 800 comparison shopping services.”</p>

<p>The Raffs are pursuing a civil damages claim against Google, set for trial in 2026, though Foundem was forced to close in 2016. "If we had known it would take this long, we might have thought twice," said Mr Adam, acknowledging the toll of their 15-year battle.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The centuries-old temples of Cambodia's famed Angkor Wat played host to a parade of Rolls-Royces, Ferraris and Lamborghinis today, although drivers were banned from revving their supercharged engines.</p>

<p>The event was intended to promote the environmentally sensitive UNESCO-listed World Heritage site, where the ruins of the Khmer empire's greatest monuments are surrounded by lush forests and giant trees. Angkor Wat is the world's largest temple complex.</p>

<p>Tourism is vital to the Southeast Asian country and received around 6.6 million visitors a year before the Covid-19 pandemic, when numbers nosedived to below 200,000 in 2021.</p>

<p>Visitors rebounded to nearly 5.5 million last year, netting more than $3 billion in revenue, but remained below pre-pandemic levels.</p>

<p>Asked about the apparently incongruous nature of the occasion, Cambodia's tourism minister Sok Soken told AFP that strict guidelines had been imposed, with engine-revving banned "in terms of disrespect to our heritage here".</p>

<p>He spoke a few metres away from a Bugatti Chiron, some models of which reportedly have list prices of more than $3 million.</p>

<p>"The display of cars is an art of technology, an inclusion of technology and a modern way of travelling," he said, adding Cambodia "will be ready to provide hospitality to all forms of travellers".</p>

<p>An attempt by organisers Gumball 3000, a British lifestyle brand, to set a record for the number of supercars and hypercars at a World Heritage site fell short.</p>

<p>However, the vehicles saw high traffic from locals and tourists taking pictures and selfies.</p>

<p>"This is the first time I have seen such modern cars at Angkor Wat," said university student Kuy Tola, 19. "It is amazing."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A public hearing has started to investigate the Titan submersible's catastrophic failure during its Titanic wreck expedition, which claimed five lives. The Titan Marine Board of Investigation is hearing testimonies from 24 witnesses, including 10 former Oceangate employees. At the South Carolina hearing, an animated recreation of the Titan's ill-fated journey was presented, revealing the crew's final messages, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/titan-sub-submersible-last-message-bodies-implosion-hearing-b2614007.html" rel="nofollow, noindex">Independent</a></em> reported. A chilling 3-word text, "all good here," appeared on screen, sent just moments before the submersible's catastrophic implosion.</p>

<p>The recreation showed the Titan crew's communication with the support vessel, Polar Prince, which had requested improved communication after a brief loss of contact. The Polar Prince then asked the Titan crew if they could still see the support vessel on their onboard display. The crew responded with reassurance: "yes" and, "all good here'' – their last transmission.</p>

<p>At the hearing, The US Coast Guard also presented a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/rawsalerts/status/1835799379132694670/photo/1">haunting image of the OceanGate Titan</a> submersible's tail cone, lying intact yet abandoned on the ocean floor at 12,500 feet.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>

<p>At the hearing, Tony Nissen, ex-engineering director at OceanGate, also testified that he had raised safety concerns about the submersible during his tenure. Mr Nissen claimed that he refused to approve a 2019 dive into the Titanic wreck due to hull concerns, which led to his termination later that year.&nbsp;He noted that the Titan was struck by lightning during a test mission in 2018, and that might have compromised its hull. When questioned about internal pressure to deploy the Titan, his response was "100%."</p>

<p>According to investigators, the Titan submersible was plagued by numerous problems during previous expeditions, including 70 equipment issues reported in 2021 and 48 more in 2022.</p>

<p>The Titan submersible tragedy on June 18, 2023, claimed the lives of five individuals, including renowned British adventurer Hamish Harding, father-son duo Shahzada and Suleman Dawood, French national Paul-Henri Nargeolet, and Stockton Rush, CEO of OceanGate Expeditions.</p>

<p>The two-week hearing into the catastrophe will feature evidence as to what went wrong and whether physical or design failure contributed to the accident, which garnered worldwide attention, as per AFP.</p>

<p>''There are no words to ease the loss endured by the families impacted by this tragic incident.&nbsp;But we hope that this hearing will help shed light on the cause of the tragedy and prevent anything like this from happening again,''&nbsp;said Jason Neubauer of the Coast Guard Office of Investigations, who led the hearing.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>17-year-old Emily Gold, a talented dancer and cheerleader from California, who competed with her Los Osos High School dance team on the latest season of '<em>America's Got Talent'</em>,&nbsp;died by suicide. Her body was found under an overpass in Rancho Cucamonga around midnight on Friday.&nbsp;The high school dancer and cheerleader died by suicide on September 13 at 11.52 pm, the San Bernardino Coroner's Office confirmed to&nbsp;<em><a data-link-type="article-inline" href="https://people.com/americas-got-talent-contestant-emily-gold-dies-from-suicide-after-standing-ovation-8713499" rel="noopener" target="_blank">People.</a></em></p>

<p>California Highway Patrol Public Information Officer Rodrigo Jimenez said: "When the officers arrived, they located a female, 17 year old, who was struck by at least one other vehicle in the carpool lane on eastbound 210.''</p>

<p>Her untimely death comes just one month after Ms Gold and her dance team had captivated the audience on America's Got Talent, advancing to the quarterfinals. Although their journey ended in August, the group left a lasting impression, earning a heartfelt standing ovation from judge Simon Cowell following their emotional departure.</p>

<p>Her sudden death has sparked an outpouring of support and condolences from fans, fellow performers, and loved ones.</p>

<p>“It is with such heavy heart that we share the passing of our beautiful, kind and loving Emily Gold, Senior and Varsity Dance Captain. Emily has always embodied every aspect of our core team values through her strength, commitment, kindness, compassion, and the most humble heart,'' the Los Osos High School Varsity Dance Team wrote via an Instagram statement on Monday.</p>

<p>The situation around the Ukraine conflict is becoming more complicated. The US is in an election mode, and that means that any step that might disadvantage the Democratic presidential candidate cannot be taken. After supporting a proxy war in Ukraine against Russia all this while, any step to de-escalate or open the doors to negotiation would be almost impossible politically.</p>

<p>The choice is between escalating or avoiding any serious new escalatory step. It is here that the discussion over allowing Zelenskyy to use NATO-supplied long-range missiles to strike deep into Russian territory comes in. Ukraine is already striking deep into Russia with drones and has also launched a land invasion of Russia in Kursk. But for Russia, it will mean a major escalation by NATO if the UK-supplied Storm Shadow cruise missiles were used against Russia itself, although they have been used against Ukrainian territories that Russia has annexed. Russia has in practice accepted that distinction and not raised the stakes as President Vladimir Putin has now done.</p>

<h2><strong>UK Determined To Escalate</strong></h2>

<p>The Russian president has warned that such a move will mean NATO entering into a direct conflict with Russia as these missiles cannot be launched without guidance by US satellites and, indeed, by NATO crews on the ground in Ukraine, as the Ukrainian military would not know how to prime them technically for targeting. Putin has declared that Russia will take appropriate steps to counter this escalation. What this could mean is a matter of speculation as Russia could have options below the nuclear threshold.</p>

<p>The UK, as usual, is determined to escalate the conflict. Five of its ex-Defence Secretaries want Ukraine to be given permission to use long-range weapons even without the US's approval. The UK's deep-seated hostility towards Russia seems almost compulsive. Its excessive warmongering could also be to both push the US to escalate while also acting as a willing front for the US to make the latter look more "responsible". The US, which is ultimately responsible for managing the consequences of escalation, and not Europe, seems hesitant to allow the use of its long-range missiles to strike deep into Russia but seems prepared to clear the use of British and French missiles. The fiction would be that the US would not be directly involved, though when Putin refers to NATO being involved - as these missiles need NATO technical support for launching them - he is implicating the US too.</p>

<h2><strong>The Western Narrative On Ukraine</strong></h2>

<p>Zelenskyy's strategy seems to be to drag NATO more and more into the conflict, no matter what the eventual cost is for Ukraine or for Europe, as the survival of his own regime is involved. The Western narrative on Ukraine is simple: Russia has violated the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a smaller European country; the attack is unprovoked and violates the international order; if Russia were to succeed it would next threaten Western Europe; Russia cannot be allowed to win, and therefore Ukraine has to be supported. Zelenskyy has exploited this simplistic narrative to seek more and more arms from the West, claiming that it is not merely a Ukrainian fight but a European one. He is now intending to go to the US to discuss his "victory plan" with Biden.</p>

<p>The US and Europe openly seek to use this conflict to impose a strategic defeat on Russia, and if that looks increasingly unlikely despite imposing draconian sanctions, then to, at least, continue to bleed and weaken Russia by prolonging the proxy war against it. This was the sense of the joint Op-Ed in Financial Times by the US and UK intelligence chiefs, which stressed it was vital to continue supporting Ukraine, with the CIA chief also seeing virtue in Ukraine's land attack against Russia in Kursk. The US Secretary of State and the UK Foreign Secretary also jointly visited Kyiv very recently and announced more financial aid to Ukraine.</p>

<h2><strong>India's Options</strong></h2>

<p>It is in this background that India is seeking to play some role to nudge the two sides towards a negotiated solution to the conflict. India has not been deterred from taking this initiative despite the complexity of the issue, the seemingly irreconcilable position of the two sides on some fundamental points, and the fact that any peace effort with Russia and Ukraine cannot move forward without the US. We have not announced contact with the US on this subject.</p>

<p>Actually, Europe will have to be involved too if India wants to play a substantive role.</p>

<p>That Modi will discuss India's initiative with Biden when he goes to the US this month is likely, now that he knows Putin's mind after his own talks with him and the feedback he has got from National Security Advisor Ajit Doval. But Biden can hardly modify its position in favour of dialogue and diplomacy with the US presidential election in the offing when all along the choice has been to wage a proxy war against Russia for larger geopolitical reasons that go beyond Ukraine.</p>

<p>The rhetoric against Russia has gone up, with accusations against the Russian spread of disinformation in the US and globally, and the effort to seek a worldwide ban on <em>RT</em> and related Russian media for intelligence activities, etc. With German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visiting India shortly, Modi will have a chance to discuss his peace initiative with him too.</p>

<h2><strong>Doval's Visit</strong></h2>

<p>India has raised its peacemaking profile by Modi sending Doval to St Petersburg to personally brief Putin on the talk the Prime Minister had with Zelenskyy in Kyiv. Despite the controversial comments made by Zelenskyy to the Indian press on India's purchase of Russian oil, calling on India to join the communiqu&amp;#233; issued after the first summit in Switzerland if it wanted to hold a peace summit, and differing perspectives on the agenda of the next peace summit that came out in External Affairs Minister Jaishankar's press briefing in Kyiv, enough of substance seems to have emerged from the private talks with Zelenskyy to warrant a personal briefing to Putin. Is it that the Ukrainian position in private is less rigid on substantive issues than its public enunciation? By accepting to receive Doval in an unprecedented gesture, Putin is endorsing India's peace efforts, though it is difficult to imagine that he would resign from his core position on territory and NATO membership of Ukraine.</p>

<p>Judging from what the Ukrainian ambassador to India said subsequently to the press here on India's peace efforts, it appears that Ukraine continues to aggressively define its position. The ambassador was out of line in asking India to convince Moscow to join peace talks, linking the legitimacy of India's bid for permanent membership of the UN Security Council to taking a position of its own on global issues and not simply conveying messages from one side to the other and being a courier or messenger or a post box. He reiterated Zelenskyy's position that the condition for India to hold the next peace summit would be to join the Burgenstock communique</p>

<p>All in all, it is difficult to judge the dynamics of the peace initiative India has taken as the hurdles to peace are all too apparent at present.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>"I am a rapist," a 71-year-old Frenchman accused of drugging his wife so he and scores of strangers could assault her told a court Tuesday, returning to the dock after being ill for around a week.</p>

<p>Dominique Pelicot used a cane as he slowly entered the courtroom in the southern city of Avignon, before sitting on a blue armchair to give him enough comfort to take part in the hearings.</p>

<p>"I am a rapist, like the others in this room," Pelicot said, referring to the 50 other defendants in the mass trial -- men he allegedly recruited online to rape his then-wife Gisele Pelicot.</p>

<p>"They all knew" that he was inviting them to rape her, he said.</p>

<p>But he added: "She did not deserve this."</p>

<p>Dominique Pelicot is accused of administering anti-anxiety drugs to Gisele over a period of almost a decade, from 2011 to 2020.</p>

<p>While she was unconscious, he would rape her and recruit dozens of other men he met online to do the same.</p>

<p>Dominique Pelicot has admitted the charges, but Tuesday is the first time he has spoken at any length since the trial began on September 2.</p>

<p>The court may also hear more from Gisele Pelicot, who was present in the courtroom alongside Dominique's brother Joel.</p>

<p>Beatrice Zavarro, the defendant's lawyer, told AFP on Monday that he was suffering from "a clot in the bladder" and the beginning of a kidney infection.</p>

<p>But a medical exam ordered by the presiding judge found that he was in a fit state to appear in court, avoiding a delay of weeks or even months to the hearings.</p>

<p>Adjustments would be made to the "sequencing of the hearings" and Dominique Pelicot would get "regular rest", Zavarro said, adding that the health complaints were not an attempt by her client to escape justice.</p>

<p>Dominique Pelicot's testimony will be decisive for the 50 other men aged 26 to 74 on trial, four of whose cases are set to be heard in the coming days.</p>

<p>Some of the accused have admitted that he told them he was drugging his then-wife, while others claim they believed they were participating in a swinger couple's fantasy.</p>

<p>The case has prompted outrage across France, with thousands demonstrating in cities at the weekend to demand an end to rape and support Gisele Pelicot.</p>

<p>She requested that the trial be open to the public to raise awareness about the use of drugs to commit sexual abuse.</p>

<p>"Thanks to you I have the strength to see this fight through to the end," Gisele told demonstrators Monday.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump hits the campaign trail again on Tuesday, travelling to Michigan two days after an apparent assassination attempt against him was foiled at his golf course in Florida.</p>

<p>His Democratic rival Kamala Harris will also be campaigning, as she heads to the key battleground state of Pennsylvania for an interview with the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ).</p>

<p>That event and another interview with Hispanic media, recorded Monday and set to air Tuesday, will be the first time Harris will have an opportunity to react in person to the apparent bid on Trump's life.</p>

<p>The Republican nominee and ex-president was whisked away by the Secret Service after a gunman was discovered on his golf course in Florida on Sunday, in the second such close call for Trump in as many months.</p>

<p>As security officials said they believed the suspect acted alone, Trump sought to blame Harris and President Joe Biden for the scare, citing what he called their rhetoric about him endangering democracy.</p>

<p>Trump's politicization of the incident -- even as he, on the campaign trail, paints Harris as an "evil" radical turning America into a "failing nation" -- has further stoked tensions ahead of the presidential election in seven weeks.</p>

<p>Both Biden and Harris have issued statements denouncing the apparent assassination bid, with Harris saying "violence has no place in America."</p>

<p>But Trump has claimed that rhetoric from Biden and Harris "is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country."</p>

<h3><strong>'Turned Black'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The duelling visits of Trump in Michigan and Harris in Pennsylvania come as both candidates focus on the half-dozen swing states most important to win in the country's Electoral College system.</p>

<p>A new poll from Suffolk University and USA Today shows Harris with a slight edge over Trump in Pennsylvania -- 49 per cent to 46 per cent -- thanks in large part to major support from women voters.</p>

<p>Still, her advantage in that poll remains within the margin of error -- and the election at-large remains close.</p>

<p>This year's particularly bitter presidential campaign has seen not just the two assassination attempts against Trump but also bomb threats against an Ohio town's immigrant community and a fringe party urging Harris's murder.</p>

<p>Trump previously had a close call with a would-be assassin when he was slightly wounded in an attack during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania in July.</p>

<p>When Harris arrives for her interview with the NABJ, however, another Trump moment is also likely to come up.</p>

<p>It was when Trump spoke with the professional association in July that he said Harris, who has an Indian mother and Jamaican father, "happened to turn Black," in remarks claiming that she opted to highlight one of her dual racial identities for political gain.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[When it comes to our experience of the internet, "the times, they are a-changin", as Bob Dylan would say. You can't quite recall how, but the internet certainly feels different these days.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to our experience of the internet, “the times, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_They_Are_a-Changin%27_(song)">they are a-changin'</a>”, as Bob Dylan would say. You can't quite recall how, but the internet certainly feels different these days.</p>

<p>To some, it is “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/01/16/1224878097/everyday-users-are-complaining-that-the-internet-is-more-chaotic-than-ever">less fun and less informative</a>” than it used to be. To others, online searches are made up of “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/23998379/google-search-seo-algorithm-webpage-optimization?src=longreads">cookie cutter</a>” pages that drown out useful information and are saturated with scams, spam and content generated by artificial intelligence (AI).</p>

<p>Your social media feeds are full of eye-catching, provocative, hyper-targeted, or anger-inducing content, from <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-dead-internet-theory-makes-eerie-claims-about-an-ai-run-web-the-truth-is-more-sinister-229609">bizarre AI-generated imagery</a> to robot-like comments. You're lucky if your video feeds are not solely made up of exhortations to “subscribe”.</p>

<p>How did we get here? And can we claw our way back?</p>

<h3><strong>Commercial interests rule</strong></h3>

<p>One major factor contributing to the current state of the internet is its over-commercialisation: financial motives drive much of the content. This has arguably led to the prevalence of sensationalism, prioritising virality over information quality.</p>

<p>Covert and deceptive advertising is widespread, blurring the line between commercial and non-commercial content to attract more attention and engagement.</p>

<p>Another driving force is the dominance of tech giants like Google, Meta and Amazon. They reach billions worldwide and wield immense power over the content we consume.</p>

<p>Their platforms use advanced tracking technologies and opaque algorithms to generate hyper-targeted media content, powered by extensive user data. This creates <a href="https://www.campaignasia.com/article/the-echo-chamber-effect-how-algorithms-shape-our-worldview/491762">filter bubbles</a>, where users are exposed to limited content that reinforces their existing beliefs and biases, and <a href="https://philarchive.org/archive/NGUECA">echo chambers</a> where other viewpoints are actively discredited.</p>

<p>Bad actors like <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/ai-fuel-financial-scams-online-industry-experts/story?id=103732051">cyber criminals and scammers</a> have been an enduring problem online. However, evolving technology like generative AI has further empowered them, enabling them to create highly realistic fake images, deepfake videos and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/science/annals-of-artificial-intelligence/the-terrifying-ai-scam-that-uses-your-loved-ones-voice">voice cloning</a>.</p>

<p>AI's ability to automate content creation has also flooded the internet with low-quality, misleading and harmful material at an unprecedented scale.</p>

<p>In sum, the accelerated commercialisation of the internet, the dominance of media tech giants and the presence of bad actors have infiltrated content on the internet. The rise of AI further intensifies this, making the internet more chaotic than ever.</p>

<h3><strong>Some of the ‘good' internet remains</strong></h3>

<p>So, what was the “good internet” some of us long for with nostalgia?</p>

<p>At the outset, the internet was meant to be a free egalitarian space where people were meant to “surf” and “browse”. Knowledge was meant to be shared: sites such as Wikipedia and The Internet Archive are continuing bastions of knowledge.</p>

<p>Before the advent of filter bubbles, the internet was a creative playground where people explored different ideas, discussed varying perspectives, and collaborated with individuals from “outgroups” – those outside their social circles who may hold opposing views.</p>

<p>Early social media platforms were built on the ethos of reconnecting with long-lost classmates and family members. Many of us have community groups, acquaintances and family we reach out to via the internet. The “connection” aspect of the internet remains as important as ever – as we all saw during the COVID pandemic.</p>

<p>What else do we want to preserve? Privacy. A New Yorker cartoon joke in 1993 stated that “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051029045942/http://www.unc.edu/depts/jomc/academics/dri/idog.html">on the internet, nobody knows you're a dog</a>”. Now everyone – especially advertisers – wants to know who you are. To quote the <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/your-privacy-rights/your-personal-information/what-is-privacy">Office of the Australian Information Commissioner</a>, one of the tenets of privacy is “to be able to control who can see or use information about you”.</p>

<p>At the very least, we want to control what big tech knows about us, especially if they could stand to profit from it.</p>

<h3><strong>Can we ever go back?</strong></h3>

<p>We can't control “a-changin'” times, but we can keep as much of the good parts as we can.</p>

<p>For starters, we can vote with our feet. Users can enact change and bring awareness to problems on existing platforms. In recent times, we have seen this with the <a href="https://theconversation.com/thinking-of-breaking-up-with-twitter-heres-the-right-way-to-do-it-195002">exodus of users</a> from X (formerly Twitter) to other platforms, and the <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/06/26/why-reddit-users-are-protesting-against-the-sites-leadership">platform-wide protest against Reddit</a> for changing its third-party data access policies.</p>

<p>However, voting with our feet is only possible when there's competition. In the case of X, various other platforms – from Mastodon to Threads to Bluesky – enable users to pick one that aligns with their preferences, values and social circles. Search engines have alternatives, too, such as DuckDuckGo or Ecosia.</p>

<p>However, competition can only be created by moving to decentralised systems and removing monopolies. This actually happened in the early days of the internet during the 1990s “<a href="https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/browser-wars/">browser wars</a>”, when Microsoft was eventually accused of illegally monopolising the web browser market in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.">a landmark court case</a>.</p>

<p>As users of technology, all of us must remain vigilant about threats to our privacy and knowledge. With cheap and ubiquitous generative AI, misleading content and scams are more realistic than ever.</p>

<p>We must exercise a healthy scepticism and ensure those most at risk from online threats – such as children and older people – are educated about potential harms.</p>

<p>Remember, the internet is not optimised for your best interests. It's up to you to decide how much power you give to the tech giants who are fuelling theirs.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An 11-year-old boy in the US who allegedly bragged about his massive cache of weapons and plans to execute a "kill list" at two different schools has been arrested. In a Facebook post on Monday, Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood said that deputies seized a bunch of airsoft rifles, pistols and fake ammunition along with knives, swords and other weapons after the 11-year-old, identified as Carlo "Kingston" Dorelli, showed a video of his armoury to classmates and threatened violence. "He had written a list of names and targets. He says it was all a joke," Mr Chitwood wrote.</p>

<p>For his actions, the sheriff slapped the 11-year-old with a felony charge for a written threat of mass shooting. The sheriff's department shared a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/1680665272501726">video </a>of officers leading the boy into the jailhouse with handcuffs on his wrists and ankles. It also shared his mugshot along with a photo of replica rifles, samurai swords and throwing stars displayed on a table, drug-bust style.</p>

<p>"I can and will release the names and photos of juveniles who are committing these felonies, threatening our students, disrupting our schools and consuming law enforcement resources," Mr Chitwood wrote on Facebook.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Take a look at the post below:</strong></p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/16/us-news/florida-boy-11-had-school-shooting-kill-list-and-arsenal-sheriff-says/" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>New York Post</em></a>, Dorelli's arrest comes days after the Sheriff vowed to "perp-walk" kids who make prank threats amid a flood of bogus tips in the wake of the deadly shooting at Apalachee High School in Georgia that left four dead.</p>

<p>"Every time we make an arrest, your kid's photo is going to be put out there...We're gonna come and get you. We're going to put you out for public embarrassment." Mr Chitwood said in a press conference last week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, a 14-year-old boy has been charged with shooting four people dead at Apalachee High School in the southern state of Georgia earlier this month. This incident prompted US President Joe Biden to call for a complete ban on assault weapons.</p>

<p>Speaking at an event, Mr Biden said, "I'd like to say a few words about the school shooting yesterday. As a nation, we cannot continue to accept the carnage of gun violence. I'm a gun owner. I believe strongly in the amendment. We need more than thoughts and prayers," <em>CNN </em>quoted the president as saying.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Little was revealed about the Trump family crypto project during a two-hour online presentation other than an offer to let people buy digital "tokens" giving them a vote in platform decisions.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">There is a long-standing belief that downing water after a night of heavy drinking can save you from a hangover. However, new research suggests that this popular remedy doesn't quite live up to its hype.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Researchers from Utrecht University in the Netherlands analysed data from three studies and found that dehydration is only part of the hangover story, and drinking water has minimal effect on symptoms like nausea, headaches and fatigue.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0741832924001009?via%3Dihub ">The research</a> sought to better understand the relationship between dehydration and the symptoms of a hangover. Participants were divided into two groups: those who drank water before going to sleep after drinking, and those who did not. Surprisingly, both groups experienced similar levels of pain, nausea and exhaustion the next morning. While those who hydrated reported feeling less thirsty, they still suffered from the same degree of hangover misery.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Dr Joris Verster, lead author of the study, explained that dehydration is not the primary cause of hangover symptoms. “The more you drink, the more likely you are to get a hangover. Drinking water may help against thirst and a dry mouth, but it will not take away the misery, the headache and the nausea,” he said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The findings indicate that consuming water, whether during or after drinking, does little to prevent or alleviate the effects of a hangover. Once the hangover has set in, gulping down water doesn't reduce its intensity.</p>

<p dir="ltr">According to the research, dehydration from alcohol consumption occurs because alcohol activates the hormone system responsible for regulating blood pressure, fluid, and electrolyte balance. This hormonal activation leads to the loss of water and electrolytes, which causes the common symptom of thirst the next day.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">However, studies show that thirst and dehydration are relatively short-lived in comparison to the other hallmark hangover symptoms caused by "oxidative stress" and the body's inflammatory response to alcohol.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The body's inflammatory reaction to alcohol causes significant discomfort, while oxidative stress – an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants – contributes to headaches and other symptoms. As a result, simply drinking water won't combat these underlying causes of hangovers.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Evidence and scientific studies also agree that hangovers tend to get worse with age. As we age, our liver function declines, reducing its efficiency in metabolising alcohol, research reveals. At the same time, the body's water content decreases, and we lose muscle mass, which leads to a higher concentration of alcohol in the bloodstream.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The study underlined that there is currently no scientifically proven, commercially available treatment for hangovers. For those looking for relief, the only sure fire way to avoid a hangover is to drink less or abstain from alcohol entirely.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar today spoke exclusively to NDTV's Sanjay Pugalia as the Modi Government 3.0 completes hundred days in office. In the exclusive interview to NDTV, Mr Jaishankar speaks about his ministry's focus and achievements in the first 100 days of the third term. He also speaks about Narendra Modi's plans in his third consecutive term as Prime Minister and the long-term vision for India as 'Viksit Bharat' by 2047 and India's rising global role in international diplomacy.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Here are the Highlights from S Jaishankar's exclusive interview to NDTV:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Good afternoon. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to come on your channel again.</li>
	<li>In the first 100 days, we got off to a very fast and good start.</li>
	<li>The visits that have happened in the first 100 days were based on India's role in international diplomacy and keeping in mind India's long-term goals and finding a confluence of the two.</li>
	<li>In the last 100 days, PM Modi went to Singapore and Brunei, and the Malaysian Prime Minister visited India.</li>
	<li>A visit to Singapore by top ministers and then followed up with Prime Minister Modi's visit shows India's focus on the global semiconductor industry.</li>
	<li>You see the conflicts that are going on around the world. There's war in Gaza, there's war between Russia and Ukraine. Prime Minister Modi visited Ukraine, we had talks with Russia. We want a conflict free world. These are the things that we have worked on in the last 100 days.</li>
	<li>In Ukraine, the war has been going on for the last many years and it is PM Modi's focus to help in whatever way he can to help end the war.</li>
	<li>PM Modi's first tour in the last 100 days was the G7 summit in Italy.</li>
	<li>I represented the PM at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Asthana.</li>
	<li>In August, the Voice of Global South took place. In a few days, the QUAD summit will take place. Like we have always said, <em>'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas'</em> is our motto.</li>
	<li>If we talk about India's capabilities, we can't evolve and become a developed country until we have the technology.</li>
	<li>Our strength is manufacturing and we need to up our manufacturing prowess and capitalise on newer emerging technologies.</li>
	<li>Manufacturing capabilities should be prioritised. Unfortunately, in the last few decades up to 2014, we had lost ground in the manufacturing sector, but in the last decade and now, our focus has been to emerge as a global manufacturing hub.</li>
	<li><em><strong>[On Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei's remark against India]:</strong></em> We have responded to the remark, I do not want to say anything else on it.</li>
	<li><em><strong>[On Bangladesh crisis and its fallout in its domestic politics]:</strong></em> What happens there is their internal matter. Bangladesh is our neighbour, and our relationship - on our part - we want to keep it stable. We have good trade, our people-to-people relationship is good. We want to keep it that way.</li>
	<li>In the coming days, there are two big events.</li>
	<li><em><strong>Summit of the Future:</strong></em> An inter-governmentally negotiated pact for the future based on sustainable development.</li>
	<li><em><strong>The QUAD Summit:</strong></em> This will be US President Joe Biden's last Quad summit. In the previous meets, we have made great progress and I hope this meet will also prove to be the same.</li>
	<li>Modi Government 3.0 will see great progress. In different sectors of national development, I am sure we can do a lot of great things. If you see data of the previous terms, I am sure we can double those in the third term alone. Modi 3.0 will be defined by national development as India pursues its vision for a <em>'Viksit Bharat'</em> by 2047.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta late Monday said it is banning Russian state media outlets from its apps around the world due to "foreign interference activity."</p>

<p>The ban comes after the United States accused RT and employees of the state-run outlet of funnelling $10 million through shell entities to covertly fund influence campaigns on social media channels including TikTok, Instagram, X, and YouTube, according to an unsealed indictment.</p>

<p>"After careful consideration, we expanded our ongoing enforcement against Russian state media outlets," Meta said in response to an AFP inquiry.</p>

<p>"Rossiya Segodnya, RT and other related entities are now banned from our apps globally for foreign interference activity," said Meta, whose apps include Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads.</p>

<p>RT was forced to cease formal operations in Britain, Canada, the European Union and the United States due to sanctions after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, according to the indictment unsealed in New York,</p>

<p>US prosecutors quoted an RT editor-in-chief as saying it created an "entire empire of covert projects" designed to shape public opinion in "Western audiences."</p>

<h3><strong>Secret content backing&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>One of the covert projects involved funding and direction of an online content creation company in Tennessee, according to the indictment.</p>

<p>Since launching in late 2023, the US content creation operation supported by Russia has posted nearly 2,000 videos that have logged more than 16 million views on YouTube alone, according to the indictment.</p>

<p>Prosecutors cited a content producer as grousing about being pressed by the company to post a video early this year of a "well-known US political commentator visiting a grocery store in Russia," complaining it felt like "overt shilling" but agreeing to put the video out.</p>

<p>The company never disclosed to viewers it was funded by RT, US prosecutors said.</p>

<p>"RT has pursued malign influence campaigns in countries opposed to its policies, including the United States, in an effort to sow domestic divisions and thereby weaken opposition to Government of Russia objectives," prosecutors argued in the indictment.</p>

<h3><strong>Proxies and mercenaries&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Russia is the biggest source of covert influence operations disrupted by Meta at its platform since 2017, and such efforts at deceptive online influence ramped up after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, according to threat reports released routinely by the social media giant.</p>

<p>Meta had previously banned the Federal News Agency in Russia to thwart foreign interference activities by the Russian Internet Research Agency.</p>

<p>RT capabilities were expanded early last year, with the Russian government enhancing it with "cyber operational capabilities and ties to Russian intelligence," the US State Department said in a recent release.</p>

<p>Cyber capabilities were focused primarily on influence and intelligence operations around the world, according to the State Department.</p>

<p>Information gathered by covert RT operations flows to Russia's intelligence services, Russian media outlets, Russian mercenary groups, and other "proxy arms" of the Russian government, the United States maintained.</p>

<p>The State Department said it was engaged in diplomatic efforts to inform governments around the world about Russia's use of RT to conduct covert activities and encourage them to take action to limit "Russia's ability to interfere in foreign elections and procure weapons for its war against Ukraine."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Sean "Diddy" Combs -- the rap mogul whose star has plunged after a wave of sex trafficking accusations and assault lawsuits -- was arrested by federal agents in Manhattan late Monday, a US federal court said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sean "Diddy" Combs -- the rap mogul whose star has plunged after a wave of sex trafficking accusations and assault lawsuits -- was arrested by federal agents in Manhattan late Monday, a US federal court said.</p>

<p>The attorney for the Southern District of New York, Damian Williams, said in a statement that the arrest stemmed from a sealed indictment filed by his office.</p>

<p>"We expect to move to unseal the indictment in the morning and will have more to say at that time," he said, without providing further details of the charges.</p>

<p>Diddy's lawyer Marc Agnifilo said in a statement provided to AFP that Combs had voluntarily relocated to New York anticipating the charges.</p>

<p>Combs's lawyer said their team is "disappointed with the decision to pursue what we believe is an unjust prosecution of Mr. Combs by the US Attorney's Office."</p>

<p>The rapper is the target of several civil lawsuits that characterize him as a violent sexual predator who used alcohol and drugs to subdue his victims.</p>

<p>His homes were raided in March by federal agents, in a heavily publicized bicoastal operation that indicated a federal investigation and potential criminal case was mounting against Combs.</p>

<p>Armed agents entered his sprawling luxury properties in Miami and Los Angeles, marking a rapid downfall for the powerful music industry figure who in recent years has vied to rebrand himself as "Brother Love."</p>

<p>His legal team said Monday that Combs was being "cooperative with this investigation" and "looks forward to clearing his name in court."</p>

<h3><strong>Bombshell suit&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The artist, who's gone by various monikers including Puff Daddy and P Diddy, was widely credited as being key to hip hop's journey from the streets to the bottle-service club.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the decades he's amassed vast wealth not least due to his ventures in the liquor industry.</p>

<p>But despite his efforts to cultivate an image of a smooth party kingpin and business magnate, a spate of lawsuits describe Combs as a violent man who used his celebrity to prey on women.</p>

<p>The artist has denied all accusations against him.</p>

<p>He has no major convictions but has long been trailed by allegations of physical assault, dating back well into the 1990s.</p>

<p>Late last year the floodgates opened after singer Cassie, whose real name is Casandra Ventura, alleged Combs subjected her to more than a decade of coercion by physical force and drugs as well as a 2018 rape.</p>

<p>The pair met when Ventura was 19 and he was 37, after which he signed her to his label and they began a romantic relationship.</p>

<p>The bombshell suit was quickly settled out of court, but a string of similarly lurid sexual assault claims followed -- including one in December by a woman who alleged Combs and others gang-raped her when she was 17.</p>

<p>Disturbing surveillance video then emerged in May showing Combs physically assaulting his then-girlfriend Ventura, corroborating allegations she made in the now-settled case.</p>

<h3><strong>Global fame with dark shadow</strong></h3>

<p>Born Sean John Combs on November 4, 1969 in Harlem, the artist entered the industry as an intern in 1990 at Uptown Records where he eventually became a talent director.</p>

<p>He gained a reputation as a party planner, which would be central to his brand as his fame rose.</p>

<p>In 1991 he promoted a celebrity basketball game and concert at the City College of New York that left nine people dead after a stampede.</p>

<p>The event was over capacity by the thousands and resulted in a string of lawsuits, with Combs blamed for hiring inadequate security.</p>

<p>He was fired from Uptown and founded his own label, Bad Boy Records.</p>

<p>Thus began a quick ascent to the top of East Coast hip hop, along with his disciple, the late The Notorious B.I.G.</p>

<p>Combs boasted a number of major signed acts and production collaborations with the likes of Mary J Blige, Usher, Lil' Kim, TLC, Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men.</p>

<p>He was also a Grammy-winning rapper in his own right, debuting with the chart-topping single "Can't Nobody Hold Me Down" and his album "No Way Out."</p>

<p>He built an image as a brash hustler with unapologetic swagger, a major producer who also ventured into Hollywood, reality television and fashion and had high-profile romantic links with the likes of Jennifer Lopez.</p>

<p>But a dark history of violence and serious misconduct has long haunted his fame -- and now appears to be eclipsing it.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sky gazers are in for a double treat tonight with two celestial events occurring in a rare coincidence -- a super harvest Moon and partial lunar eclipse -- on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>The Super Harvest Moon on Tuesday night will experience a partial lunar eclipse making it appear slightly larger in the night sky.</p>

<p>The visual delight will be visible in western Asia, North and South America, Europe, Africa, and parts of Antarctica. It will not be visible from India as during the time of the lunar eclipse, the Moon would be below the horizon in the country. It will appear at 8:04 am in New Delhi.</p>

<p>The term "Supermoon" was coined by astrologer Richard Nolle in 1979 as either a new or full Moon that occurs when the Moon is within 90 per cent of its closest to Earth.</p>

<p>The Old Farmer's Almanac calls the full moon of September as the Harvest moon, referring to when corn harvests traditionally started.</p>

<p>The eclipse occurs when the Moon is slightly closer to Earth, which happens because the Moon's orbit is slightly elliptical, or oval-shaped.</p>

<p>As per NASA, the Moon will appear full for about three days, from Monday evening through Thursday morning.</p>

<p>The Moon will start entering the Earth's partial shadow at 8:41 pm EDT on Tuesday (6:11 am IST, Wednesday).</p>

<p>NASA noted that “the slight dimming of the Moon will be difficult to notice until the top edge of the Moon starts entering the full shadow”.</p>

<p>The peak of the eclipse will be at 10:44 pm (8:14 am IST).</p>

<p>As it is a partial eclipse, “only the top 8 per cent of the Moon will be in full shadow”.</p>

<p>The Moon will finish exiting the full shadow at 11:16 pm and the partial shadow on Wednesday at 12:47 am.</p>

<p>"This will be the second of four consecutive Supermoons, appearing larger than last month's Supermoon and effectively tied with the full Moon in October for the closest full Moon of the year," NASA said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Less than two months ahead of the COP29 United Nations Climate Summit, the Azerbaijani leadership laid out its plans on Tuesday for what it hoped to achieve, as countries continue to wrestle with how to raise ambitions for a new financing target.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Less than two months ahead of the COP29 United Nations Climate Summit, the Azerbaijani leadership laid out its plans on Tuesday for what it hoped to achieve, as countries continue to wrestle with how to raise ambitions for a new financing target.</p>

<p>The main task for the November summit is for countries to agree on a new annual target for funding that wealthy countries will pay to help poorer nations cope with climate change. Many developing countries say they cannot upgrade their targets to cut emissions faster without first receiving more financial support to invest in doing this.</p>

<p>With countries remaining far from agreement on the financing goal, the COP29 presidency this week outlined more than a dozen side initiatives that could raise ambitions, but do not require party negotiation and building consensus which can hamper progress. These take the form of new funds, pledges, and declarations that national governments can adopt.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, this includes a fund with voluntary contributions from fossil fuel-producing countries and companies for the public and private sectors working on climate issues, as well as grants that can be doled out to assist with climate-fuelled natural disasters in developing countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Such side agendas use "the convening power of COP and the hosts' respective national capabilities to form coalitions and drive progress," said Mukhtar Babayev, who holds the rotating COP presidency, in a letter to all parties and stakeholders.</p>

<p>Over 120 countries pledged at last year's COP28 summit in Dubai, for example, to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The COP29 presidency also hopes to build support around a pledge to increase global energy storage capacity six times above 2022 levels, reaching 1,500 gigawatts by 2030. This would include a commitment to scale up investments in energy grids, adding or refurbishing more than 80 million km (50 million miles) by 2040.</p>

<p>Babayev, who is Azerbaijan's minister of ecology and natural resources, said the agenda would "help to enhance ambition by bringing stakeholders together around common principles and goals."</p>

<p>"We hope to address some of the most pressing issues while also highlighting remaining priorities," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another declaration would see countries and companies create a global market for clean hydrogen, addressing regulatory, technological, financing and standardisation barriers.</p>

<p>COP29 leaders have also appealed for a "COP Truce" that would highlight the importance of peace and climate action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite countries' existing climate commitments, carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels hit a record high last year, and the world just registered its hottest summer on record as temperatures climb.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In his memo, Mr Jassy wrote that he expects the employees to adhere to the new policy beginning January 2, 2025.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is asking its corporate staff to return to the office five days a week starting in January, CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/ceo-andy-jassy-latest-update-on-amazon-return-to-office-manager-team-ratio" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>memo </em></a>on September 16. In his memo, Mr Jassy wrote that he expects the employees to adhere to the new policy beginning January 2, 2025.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/16/amazon-return-to-office-five-days-week/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, before this change, Amazon employees were required to be in the office three days a week.</p>

<p>"When we look back over the last five years, we continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant," Jassy's note to staff said. "We've observed that it's easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another."</p>

<p>"Before the pandemic, it was not a given that folks could work remotely two days a week, and that will also be true moving forward - our expectation is that people will be in the office outside of extenuating circumstances," Mr Jassy said.</p>

<p>Amazon's announcement comes as more companies scale back on remote work and enforce stricter return-to-office policies. While Amazon is the first major tech firm to mandate a full week in the office, other tech companies have been gradually revising their policies in recent years, taking firmer stances. Companies like SAP, AT&amp;T, and Dell have also rolled back their flexible work arrangements. In response, some employees have resisted, with threats, protests, or even resignations over the new policies.</p>

<p>Tech companies were early adopters of flexible work arrangements during the pandemic, often touting the success of remote operations. However, more than four years later, many of those companies are bringing employees back to the office, at least on a part-time basis. Even Zoom, which became a symbol of remote work during the pandemic, has called its employees back part-time. Other companies outside the tech industry, such as Disney, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America, have also reversed their remote work policies.</p>

<p>Amazon's CEO, Andy Jassy, stated that the company's updated policy will resemble pre-pandemic norms. While exceptions will still be allowed for reasons such as a sick child, emergencies, or the need for isolation, employees will no longer be able to work from home two days a week without a valid reason, unless they have explicit approval for remote work from their supervisor.</p>

<p>Jassy also mentioned plans to flatten Amazon's organizational structure by increasing the ratio of employees to managers, aiming to reduce bureaucracy and improve team efficiency.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Booker Prize for fiction shortlist for 2024, announced on Monday, featured the largest-ever number of women authors in its 55-year history as well as its first Dutch author.</p>

<p>Five women and one man are in the running for the prestigious literary prize, from a longlist of 13 authors. They include writers from Australia, the Netherlands, Britain, Canada and the US.</p>

<p>English pottery maker, author and chair of the judges Edmund de Waal said the shortlist comprised "books that made us want to keep on reading, to ring up friends and tell them about them, novels that inspired us to write, to score music, and even - in my case - to go back to my wheel and make pots".</p>

<p>Among them is the spy novel "Creation Lake" by American Rachel Kushner, who was shortlisted in 2018 as well.</p>

<p>Set in a remote outpost in France, the book follows an American secret agent whose mission is to infiltrate a group of radical eco-activists.</p>

<p>British author Samantha Harvey, previously longlisted in 2009, made the cut this year with "Orbital", which follows six astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS).</p>

<p>Yael van der Wouden is the first Dutch author to be shortlisted with her debut novel, "The Safekeep", a family drama set in the Netherlands 15 years after the end of the Second World War.</p>

<p>The other authors on the shortlist are American Percival Everett for the novel "James", Canadian Anne Michaels for "Held", and Australian Charlotte Wood for "Stone Yard Devotional".</p>

<p>The Booker is open to works of fiction by writers of any nationality, written in English and published in the UK or Ireland between October 1, 2023 and September 30, 2024.</p>

<p>The Booker Prize ceremony will take place on November 12. Each of the shortlisted authors will receive 2,500 Pounds, and the winner will get &amp; 50,000 Pounds.</p>

<p>Last year's winner was Irish author Paul Lynch and his dystopian novel Prophet Song.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Authorities on Monday charged a man suspected of plotting to assassinate Donald Trump with federal gun crimes.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authorities on Monday charged a man suspected of plotting to assassinate Donald Trump with federal gun crimes.</p>

<p>Here are five things to know about the weekend incident, where the Secret Service discovered the gunman on Trump's Florida golf course.</p>

<h3><strong>What happened?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>At approximately 1:30 pm (1730 GMT) on Sunday, a US Secret Service agent noticed the barrel of a rifle pointing out of shrubbery on the Trump International Golf Course in West Palm Beach.</p>

<p>Agents, who were deployed in a moving security bubble one or two holes ahead of the former president, "engaged" the individual, the Secret Service's Rafael Barros said, with the suspect fleeing.</p>

<p>The gunman did not "fire or get off any shots," Secret Service acting director Ronald Rowe told reporters Monday, adding that he had no clear line of sight on the former president at the time of the confrontation.</p>

<p>Police recovered a loaded semi-automatic rifle equipped with a scope, two backpacks, and a GoPro video camera from the scene, according to the criminal complaint submitted Monday.</p>

<p>The gunman was "between 300 and 500 yards (meters)" away from Trump when he was discovered, Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said.</p>

<p>"With a rifle and a scope like that, that's not a long distance," said Bradshaw.</p>

<h3><strong>The arrest&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>About 45 minutes later, police apprehended a suspect after receiving information from a witness who reported a man fleeing in a black vehicle.</p>

<p>It was identified by its registration information and spotted on the I-95 highway as it entered adjacent Martin County.</p>

<p>Authorities pulled over the car -- whose tags belonged to a different, stolen, vehicle -- and detained the suspect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Phone records showed he had been waiting in the shrubbery overnight, according to the criminal complaint.</p>

<h3><strong>Who is the suspect?</strong></h3>

<p>Police identified the would-be attacker as Ryan Wesley Routh, whom AFP interviewed in Kyiv in 2022, where he had travelled to support the war effort against Russia.</p>

<p>Amid claims Routh is registered as a Republican or a Democratic voter, public records indicate he is currently neither.</p>

<p>Scattered social media posts on Routh's since-suspended X account show his political opinions shifting over time, with support shown for both Trump and President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>In several posts earlier this year, Routh called for a Republican presidential ticket featuring entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley. He most recently cast an in-person ballot during the 2024 Democratic primary.</p>

<p>Routh, 58, is reportedly a builder based in Hawaii, with an arrest record spanning decades and several states.</p>

<p>He regularly posted about politics and current events on social media, including criticism of Trump, US media said.</p>

<h3><strong>Tense election&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The incident appeared to be the second assassination attempt on Trump, after an attack at a rally in July that left him slightly wounded in his right ear, with one rally attendee killed.</p>

<p>Since then, Trump has moved most campaign events indoors and addresses audiences from behind a bulletproof screen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His Democratic rival Kamala Harris has also taken to speaking from behind a screen.</p>

<p>Trump's political rhetoric has always been aggressive, but his 2024 campaign has increased the temperature, with a focus on the hot-button issue of immigration.</p>

<p>Last week, the Ohio town of Springfield saw bomb threats called in after Trump riled his base against the town's 15,000 Haitian migrant residents, falsely accusing them of eating people's pets.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Secret Service in crosshairs</strong></h3>

<p>Sunday's drama brings the spotlight back on the US Secret Service, which is tasked with the security of sitting and former US presidents.</p>

<p>The July rally attack on Trump raised questions about the Secret Service's competence and led to the resignation of the agency's director.</p>

<p>In Florida, the Secret Service had not secured the whole golf course, focusing on a zone around the president, Sheriff Bradshaw said.</p>

<p>"He's not the sitting president. If he was, we would have had this entire golf course surrounded," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"But because he's not, security is limited to the areas that the Secret Service deems possible."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Biden called for Congress to authorize more personnel for the agency.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media users are variously claiming the man accused of planning to assassinate Donald Trump in Florida is registered as a Republican or a Democratic voter, but public records indicate he is currently neither.</p>

<p>Numerous posts tying the alleged plot to political parties ricocheted across platforms after Ryan Wesley Routh was foiled Sunday when a Secret Service agent spotted his rifle protruding from bushes while the former US president was playing golf nearby.</p>

<p>Many claims centred on Routh, 58, saying in one 2020 post that Trump was his "choice" in 2016 but had disappointed him as president, adding: "I will be glad when you gone (sic)."</p>

<p>However, Patrick Gannon, public information director for the North Carolina State Board of Elections, told AFP that Routh requested an absentee ballot in 2016, but did not actually vote.</p>

<p>Data from North Carolina shows Routh -- a self-employed builder now based in Hawaii with a decades-long arrest record -- is actively registered as an unaffiliated, or independent, voter in the swing state. He most recently cast an in-person ballot during the 2024 Democratic primary.</p>

<p>Routh was removed from the rolls in 2003 following a felony conviction, re-registered in 2005 as an unaffiliated voter, but was removed again in 2010 after another felony conviction, Gannon said.</p>

<p>In 2012, Routh submitted his current registration as unaffiliated.</p>

<p>In a book he self-published in 2023 about the war in Ukraine, Routh maintained he was politically independent.</p>

<p>"I get so tired of people asking me if I am a Democrat or Republican as I refuse to be put in a category and I must always answer independent," he wrote.</p>

<p>Scattered social media posts on Routh's since-suspended X account show his political opinions shifting over time, with support shown for both Trump and President Joe Biden, as well as Bernie Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman turned Trump adviser.</p>

<p>In several posts earlier this year, Routh called for a Republican presidential ticket featuring entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley.</p>

<p>He has also posted fervently about his support for Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion, and in 2022 was interviewed by AFP while demonstrating in Kyiv.</p>

<p>AFP photos from his Hawaii home show a Biden-Harris bumper sticker -- the decal Biden used before dropping out of the race -- on the back of a truck in the driveway.</p>

<p>Electoral information indicates he is a registered voter in Hawaii, as well as North Carolina.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the City and County of Honolulu said Routh was registered there and that his status is active. The authorities do not collect information on voters' party affiliation, the official added.</p>

<p>Federal Election Commission data shows various small-dollar donations from a Ryan Routh in Hawaii to 2020 Democratic presidential candidates including Gabbard, Andrew Yang, Elizabeth Warren, Tom Steyer and Beto O'Rourke.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Israel's leadership on Tuesday that the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar presented an "important opportunity" to end the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>"I believe very much that the death of Sinwar does create an important opportunity to bring the hostages home, to bring the war to an end and to ensure Israel's security," Blinken said as he met Israeli President Isaac Herzog following talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

<p>Blinken also met with families of hostages who are still held in Gaza since the October 7, 2023 attack by Hamas sparked the war.</p>

<p>Herzog, who holds a largely ceremonial role, agreed that Israel's killing of Sinwar could change the dynamic.</p>

<p>"Following the killing of Sinwar and the other circumstances that have evolved, there is a unique opportunity to make a special effort to employ all tools necessary and possible to move forward and bring the hostages back home," Herzog said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The FBI announced Tuesday it was investigating the alleged leak of classified US intelligence documents about Israel's plans for a retaliatory strike on Iran.</p>

<p>Iran has been bracing for a response since it unleashed a wave of close to 200 ballistic missiles on Israel on October 1 in retaliation for the killings of Tehran-backed senior figures in Hamas and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>The classified documents, circulated on the Telegram app last week by an account called Middle East Spectator, describe Israeli preparations for a possible strike -- but do not identify any actual targets.</p>

<p>"The FBI is investigating the alleged leak of classified documents and working closely with our partners in the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community," the FBI said in a statement.</p>

<p>White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Monday that US authorities were unaware if the documents had been leaked or hacked.</p>

<p>"We're not exactly sure how these documents found their way into the public domain," Kirby said, adding that such a leak would be "unacceptable."</p>

<p>President Joe Biden had indicated last week that his administration was privy to Israel's plans, answering "yes and yes" to a reporter who asked if he had "a good understanding" of how and when Israel would respond.</p>

<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump seized upon the apparent leak Tuesday, painting it as an example of government incompetence.</p>

<p>"They leaked all the information about the way that Israel is going to fight, and how they're going to fight, and where they're going to go," the former US president said, exaggerating the actual content of the classified material.</p>

<p>"Can you imagine somebody doing that? That's the enemy, I guess, that maybe is the enemy from within," Trump said -- using a formula for describing political opponents that has become a persistent refrain at his campaign events.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Days after External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar's visit to Pakistan for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation or SCO meeting, India and Pakistan on Tuesday agreed to renew the agreement on the Kartarpur corridor for another five years. However, the issue of Islamabad charging a fee of $20 per pilgrim, per visit still persists.</p>

<p>Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur, often called just Kartarpur Sahib, is one of the holiest shrines for Sikhs. That is because Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak Dev preached there during the last eighteen years of his life.</p>

<p>After Partition of India in 1947, Kartarpur Sahib fell on the Pakistan side of the International Border. With India being the home for more than 95 per cent of all Sikhs globally, pilgrims from all over India always demanded access to go to Kartarpur Sahib, which is in Shakargarh Tehsil, Narowal District, in Pakistan's Punjab Province.</p>

<p>On October 24, 2019, India and Pakistan signed an agreement to facilitate the visit of pilgrims from India to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur through the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor. This was initially signed for a period of five years. This has now been renewed for another 5-year term.</p>

<p>"It has been agreed between India and Pakistan through diplomatic channels to extend the validity of the Agreement on Sri Kartarpur Sahib Corridor for a further period of five years," the Ministry of External Affairs said.</p>

<p>"Extension of the validity of this agreement will ensure uninterrupted operation of the Corridor for use by the pilgrims from India to visit the holy Gurdwara in Pakistan," it added.</p>

<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar also posted about it on social media platform X, writing "India and Pakistan have renewed the agreement on Sri Kartarpur Sahib Corridor for the next five years. PM @narendramodi's government will continue to facilitate our Sikh community's access to their holy sites."</p>

<p>During his recent 24-hour visit to Pakistan for the SCO Summit, Mr Jaishankar held no bilateral meeting with his Pakistani counterpart, nor was there any official meeting. He however, greeted the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Shehbaz Sharif, when the latter welcomed him to a state dinner organised of all SCO delegates. Mr Jaishankar also reportedly had a brief exchange of greetings with his counterpart Ishaq Dar at the official dinner. However, no official talks were held and no note takers were present either.</p>

<h2><strong>FEE WAIVER REQUEST</strong></h2>

<p>Pakistan has been levying a fee of $20 per pilgrim, per visit for them to visit the holy shrine. Devotees from India have been urging the Government of India to try and get this fee waived by Islamabad. However, there has been no breakthrough in this regard.</p>

<p>"In view of the continued requests of the pilgrims regarding the removal of USD 20 service charge levied by Pakistan per pilgrim per visit, India has once again urged Pakistan to not levy any fee or charges on the pilgrims," the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said in its statement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India on Tuesday scrapped the export tax on parboiled rice, the government said in an official order, as inventories in the world's biggest exporter of the grain surged and the country is set to produce a bumper crop after copious monsoon rains.</p>

<p>Tuesday's decision to remove the tax follows last month's move to reduce the duty to 10% from 20% to boost exports.</p>

<p>Last month India also gave the go ahead for exports of non-basmati white rice to resume. But New Delhi set a floor price for non-basmati white rice exports at $490 a metric ton.</p>

<p>Bigger rice shipments from India would beef up overall global supplies and soften international prices by forcing other major exporters - such as Pakistan, Thailand and Vietnam - to reduce their rates, trade and industry officials said.</p>

<p>The decision to remove the export tax on parboiled rice signals the government's confidence about the new season crop, said Dev Garg, vice-president of the Indian Rice Exporters Association.</p>

<p>Duty-free exports of parboiled rice would encourage price-sensitive African buyers to step up purchases from India, said B.V. Krishna Rao, president of the Rice Exporters' Association.</p>

<p>India also scrapped the 10% export duty on husked brown rice and rice paddy, the order said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A much-awaited posthumous memoir by Russian dissident Alexei Navalny was published worldwide on Tuesday, containing sometimes humorous descriptions of his life including his time in prison and the now-famous prediction that he expected to die there.</p>

<p>Navalny, the top opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin, began writing "Patriot: A Memoir" after his near-fatal poisoning in 2020.</p>

<p>The book recounts his youth, activism, personal life and his fight against Putin's increasingly authoritarian hold on Russia.</p>

<p>Navalny worked on the manuscript and diaries that form the basis of the book until his death, aged 47, eight months ago.</p>

<p>US magazine The New Yorker and The Times of Britain published excerpts from the book earlier this month, including Navalny's chilling expectation of his own death.</p>

<p>"I will spend the rest of my life in prison and die here," he wrote on March 22, 2022.</p>

<p>"There will not be anybody to say goodbye to... All anniversaries will be celebrated without me. I'll never see my grandchildren."</p>

<p>Navalny had been serving a 19-year prison sentence on "extremism" charges in an Arctic penal colony.</p>

<p>His death on February 16 at age 47 drew widespread condemnation, with many blaming Putin.</p>

<p>Navalny was arrested in January 2021 upon returning to Russia after suffering major health problems from being poisoned in 2020.</p>

<p>"The only thing we should fear is that we will surrender our homeland to be plundered by a gang of liars, thieves, and hypocrites," he wrote on January 17, 2022.</p>

<p>In a lucid, and sometimes lighthearted, tone Navalny also talks about matters far from politics or activism, such as his taste for cartoons, and the love for his wife, Yulia Navalnaya.</p>

<p><strong>'Cheery stoicism'</strong></p>

<p>He also describes the drudgery, and pointlessness of daily prison routines: "At work, you sit for seven hours at the sewing machine on a stool below knee height," he wrote.</p>

<p>"After work, you continue to sit for a few hours on a wooden bench under a portrait of Putin. This is called 'disciplinary activity.'"</p>

<p>Looking back at his childhood, Navalny remembered that the absence of chewing gum in the Soviet Union seemed to him to indicate his country's inferiority on the world stage.</p>

<p>After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Navalny the student observed the corruption among university professors and the wealth grab by oligarchs in the new Russia.</p>

<p>Whatever hope he may have put in post-Soviet Russia's political elite evaporated with Boris Yeltsin, whom he calls a drunk surrounded by thugs, and Dmitry Medvedev, president between 2008 and 2012, whom he calls both corrupt and stupid.</p>

<p>Navalny said he hated Putin, not only because he targeted him personally, but also because he thought the president had deprived Russia of two decades of development.</p>

<p>In an entry dated January 17, 2024, Navalny responds to the question put to him by his fellow inmates and prison guards: why did he come back to Russia?</p>

<p>"I don't want to give up my country or betray it. If your convictions mean something, you must be prepared to stand up for them and make sacrifices if necessary," he said.</p>

<p>In the Arctic colony where he was sent in December 2023, walks longer than half an hour were impossible because of the bitter cold, Navalny writes.</p>

<p>On February 16, 2024, he was declared dead, under unclear circumstances.</p>

<p>"'Patriot' reveals less about Navalny's politics than it does about his fundamental decency, his wry sense of humor and his (mostly) cheery stoicism under conditions that would flatten a lesser person," the New York Times said.</p>

<p>"It is important to publish these kinds of books," said Caroline Babulle, at the book's French publishers Robert Laffont, which has printed a first run of 60,000 copies.</p>

<p>"Patriot", which had a worldwide run of several hundred thousand copies, topped Amazon.com's list of bestselling books on Tuesday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rock legend Bruce Springsteen will hold a concert and rally with former President Barack Obama in Atlanta and Philadelphia in the coming days as part of a series of get-out-the-vote events for Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign in battleground states, a senior campaign official said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>With early voting under way, the Harris campaign is betting these surrogate rallies will help drive enthusiasm and turn out voters in states that will decide November's tightly-contested election between Democrat Harris and Republican rival Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The 75-year-old rock star is expected to play some of his most popular songs such as "Born to Run" on Thursday in Atlanta in a campaign event with Harris and Obama. The event will mark the first time Harris and Obama have appeared together this campaign.</p>

<p>On Monday, Springsteen will appear in Philadelphia with Obama, the senior campaign official said.</p>

<p>In 2016, Springsteen played a three-song set at a rally in front of 20,000 people at Philadelphia's Independence Hall for Democrat Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign on the eve of the election. In 2008, Springsteen played a seven-song set for tens of thousands of people on the city's Benjamin Franklin Parkway to encourage voter registration and rally for Obama's campaign.</p>

<p>In October, Springsteen announced his support for Harris saying she and her running mate Tim Walz have "a vision of this country that respects and includes everyone, regardless of class, religion, race, your political point of view or sexual identity, and they want to grow our economy in a way that benefits all."</p>

<p>Taylor Swift, Pink, Oprah Winfrey, George Clooney, and many other celebrities have endorsed Harris and Walz. Celebrities endorsing Trump include Hulk Hogan, Kid Rock, Jason Aldean, Russell Brand, Amber Rose, among others.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Idris Abdurashidov, a Russian mixed martial arts boxer, was banned from fighting for life after knocking out his opponent with an illegal head kick on October 20 during his professional boxing debut in Phuket, Thailand. The 21-year-old, who has a 4-0 record and is unbeaten in mixed martial arts, is well-known for his ability to knock out opponents in MMA, but he made a risky switch to boxing rules.</p>

<p>By the fourth round of his bout with Iranian boxer Bagher Faraji, Abdurashidov seemed to be having trouble. In a startling turn of events, Faraji was immediately floored by the Russian fighter's MMA-style head kick. Both officials and onlookers were taken aback by this unlawful action.</p>

<p>Later, Abdurashidov boasted about his feat on social media while posting the knockout footage, which heightened the debate.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the tightest US election races of modern times enters its final, two-week stretch Tuesday, with Republican Donald Trump making a special pitch to Latino voters as Democratic rival Kamala Harris sits down for a national network interview.</p>

<p>Both campaigns are pumping hundreds of millions of dollars into a final push for any wavering, undecided voters who could tilt the balance in their favor, with polls consistently showing their candidates in a dead heat ahead of Election Day.</p>

<p>Whatever the outcome, Americans will make history on November 5: they will either elect the first woman president in the world's leading superpower -- or they will put the first convicted felon into the White House.</p>

<p>Polls appear to be giving Trump, who at 78 is the oldest nominee from a major party in US history, a slight edge recently -- but all within the margin of error, making them little comfort for a former president making his third consecutive White House run.</p>

<p>Vice President Harris -- who only threw herself into the race in July, when President Joe Biden made the stunning decision to drop out and endorse her instead -- will give a television interview to NBC on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The 60-year-old, who celebrated her birthday over the weekend, will also deploy one of her party's most popular emissaries back into the field: Barack Obama.</p>

<p>The former Democratic president will hold a series of rallies in Wisconsin and Michigan, two of the seven most hotly contested swing states in the election which, under the US system of indirect universal suffrage, are likely to decide the outcome.</p>

<p><strong>15 million ballots cast</strong></p>

<p>Trump, whose anti-migrant rhetoric is becoming coarser and more extreme by the day, will take part in a roundtable discussion with Latino voters at one of his Florida properties.</p>

<p>The Republican will then fly to North Carolina, another swing state where he also campaigned on Monday, for an event that is supposed to be devoted to the economy.</p>

<p>He rarely sticks to the topic at his rallies, however -- instead, he has been criticized for a tumultuous few weeks that have featured rambling monologues and threats about weaponizing the military against Democrats who he calls "the enemy from within."</p>

<p>One recent televised town hall veered into a surreal, impromptu music session as Trump abandoned discussion of the election to play his favorite hits while swaying on stage.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign has begun to hammer at his mental and physical fitness to serve.</p>

<p>But a tide of MAGA-capped supporters continue to flock to his rallies, convinced that he is the victim of political persecution, or that Democrats are instigating threats against him.</p>

<p>Democrats are also seeking to woo moderate Republicans turned off by Trump's ominous rhetoric and scandals.</p>

<p>Harris has sought to frame herself as a "joyful warrior" seeking to turn the page on Trump's years of outrage and move into a new generation of American political leadership.</p>

<p>More than 15 million Americans have already voted by mail or in person, according to the independent organization Elections Project, representing around 10 percent of the total turnout in 2020.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping told Russia's Vladimir Putin that the international situation was gripped by chaos but that Beijing's strategic partnership with Moscow was a force for stability amid the most significant changes seen in a century.</p>

<p>Xi and Putin in May pledged a "new era" of partnership between the two most powerful rivals of the United States, which they cast as an aggressive Cold War hegemon sowing chaos across the world.</p>

<p>"At present, the world is going through changes unseen in a hundred years, the international situation is intertwined with chaos," Xi told Putin in the Russian city of Kazan at the opening of the BRICS summit.</p>

<p>"But I firmly believe that the friendship between China and Russia will continue for generations, and great countries' responsibility to their people will not change."</p>

<p>Russia, waging war against NATO-supplied Ukrainian forces, and China, under pressure from a concerted U.S. effort to counter its growing military and economic strength, increasingly have found common geopolitical cause.</p>

<p>Russia and China, pushing back against perceived humiliations of the 1991 Soviet collapse and centuries of European colonial dominance of China, have sought to portray the West as decadent and in decline.</p>

<p>The United States casts China as its biggest competitor and Russia as its biggest nation-state threat, and President Joe Biden has said the democracies face a challenge from autocracies such as China and Russia.</p>

<p>Biden has referred to Xi as a "dictator" and has said Putin is a "killer" and even a "crazy SOB". Beijing and Moscow have scolded Biden for the comments.</p>

<p>Putin called Xi "dear friend" and said the partnership with China was a force for stability in the world.</p>

<p>"Russian-Chinese cooperation in world affairs is one of the main stabilising factors on the world stage," Putin said.</p>

<p>"We intend to further enhance coordination on all multilateral platforms in order to ensure global security and a just world order."</p>

<p>Xi said cooperation in the BRICS group was "the most important platform for solidarity and cooperation between emerging market countries and developing countries in the world today."</p>

<p>He said it was "a mainstay force in promoting the realization of equal and orderly global multipolarity, as well as inclusive and tolerant economic globalisation."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Michael Jeffries, former CEO of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, was arrested by federal agents investigating allegations that he ran a sex-trafficking operation, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>He was arrested on Tuesday in Florida as part of an investigation being led by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, New York, the report said.</p>

<p>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch declined to comment to Reuters queries, while Jeffries was not immediately reachable.</p>

<p>Last year, a group of once-aspiring Abercrombie &amp; Fitch male models sued the retailer and the former CEO alleging that the company had benefited from a sex-trafficking operation led by Jeffries.</p>

<p>The proposed class action filed by former model David Bradberry in Manhattan federal court claims Jeffries forced models to take drugs and engage in sexual acts with him and others for the chance to be featured in Abercrombie's provocative catalogs.</p>

<p>The lawsuit had alleged that company officers knew about the conduct and Abercrombie paid settlements to people who accused Jeffries of sexual abuse or harassment.</p>

<p>Jeffries, who was CEO from 1992 to 2014, was credited with turning around the retailer into a successful teen apparel maker known for its cologne-filled stores and ads featuring semi-nude models. He, however, resigned amid criticism that he had failed to keep pace with the tastes of teen shoppers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ties between India and Russia have been time-tested and has had a strong foundation since Independence in 1947, but another factor that bonds the two nations together is the friendship between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>The two leaders met today in Russia's Kazan where they will attend the 16th BRICS Summit today and tomorrow. After a handshake and a hug, PM Modi and Putin held India-Russia talks.</p>

<p>Highlighting his friendship with Prime Minister Modi, President Putin said that the bond between the two countries and the two leaders is so strong that PM Modi would understand him even without the help of any translator.</p>

<p>"Our relationship is so strong that you will understand me without any translation," President Putin said, sparking laughter in the room at the Governor's Palace. He further noted that "In Kazan we must make a number of important decisions aimed at further improving the activities of the association and strengthening multifaceted cooperation within its framework. And we greatly value our cooperation in this area, I mean that our states stood at the origins of the association's creation."</p>

<p>President Putin also hailed Russia and India's "privileged strategic partnership" and vowed to build ties further. "Interaction between legislative bodies is strengthening. Our foreign ministers are in constant contact. Trade turnover is in good condition. And the next meeting of the intergovernmental commission is scheduled for November 12 in New Delhi," he said.</p>

<p>"Major projects are being developed consistently, and we welcome your decision to open the Consulate General of India in Kazan. Expanding India's diplomatic presence in Russia will contribute to the further development of bilateral relations," he added.</p>

<h2><strong>MEDIATING PEACE BETWEEN RUSSIA AND UKRAINE</strong></h2>

<p>In his opening statement during his meeting with Vladimir Putin, PM Modi said he wanted the Ukraine conflict to be resolved "peacefully and quickly", adding that "We have been in constant touch over the conflict between Russia and Ukraine."</p>

<p>"We believe that disputes should only be resolved peacefully. We totally support efforts to quickly restore peace and stability," the prime minister further said.</p>

<p>PM Modi visited Kyiv in August and Moscow in July in an effort to encourage talks, as India cast itself as a potential mediator. In both countries he was welcomed with a warm embrace. Both Putin and Zelenskyy have remained in close contact with PM Modi over the duration of the Ukraine conflict - as India has a unique position maintaining friendly relations with both nations.</p>

<p>After his visit to Kyiv, Prime Minister Modi reportedly sent National Security Adviser Ajit Doval to Moscow with a "peace plan", which was reportedly handed over to President Putin when Mr Doval had a meeting with him.</p>

<p>During his meeting with President Zelenskyy, Prime Minister Modi reiterated his commitment to peace and sustainable development.</p>

<p>"He emphasised that without peace, long-term progress is impossible. While the outcome of the war remains uncertain, India continues to advocate for a peaceful resolution," said Mr. Misri.</p>

<p>India's initiative to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine has been praised by US President Joe Biden and several European leaders too. President Biden had also praised India's prominent global role, including Prime Minister Modi's leadership in the G20 and Global South, as well as his efforts to strengthen the Quad, ensuring a free, open, and prosperous Indo-Pacific.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hold a bilateral meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Russia on Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri has said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hold a bilateral meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping -- their first since the 2020 Galwan clash -- on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Russia on Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri has said. The meet will underscore the upturn in the India-China relation following a consensus on patrolling arrangement along the Line of Actual Control that had faced multiple hiccups over the last few years.</p>

<p>Amid speculation about renewed ties, Mr Misri announced that the bilateral was on. "I can confirm that there will be a bilateral meeting held between Prime Minister Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping tomorrow on the sidelines of the BRICS Summit," he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.</p>

<p>There has been only one formal meeting between the two leaders since the 2020 Galwan clash. That was held on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in South Africa's Johannesburg in August 2023. There has also been a brief informal interaction during the G20 summit in Indonesia's Bali.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both leaders are currently in Russia's Kazan, where Russian President Vladimir Putin, Brazil's Lula da Silva, and South Africa's Cyril Ramaphosa are also attending the summit.</p>

<p>The breakthrough in the patrolling arrangement comes four years after the Galwan Valley clash and signals a move towards de-escalation in a region where both countries stationed tens of thousands of troops.&nbsp;The arrangement, which would involve a return to the pre-2020 system, is also a move to stabilize the situation and work as a confidence-building measure between New Delhi and Beijing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Indian and Chinese troops had clashed in Galwan Valley on June 15, 2020, amid a major escalation along the Line of Actual Control. Both sides had sustained casualties, which had led to tension in bilateral ties.</p>

<p>While a gradual de-escalation was effected, a return to the pre-Galwan status had proved elusive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Besides bilateral relations, it had also led to strain in other areas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There had been no direct flight between the two nations for four years. Visa for Chinese technicians was granted after extra layers of security and investments from companies based in neighbouring countries needed extra vetting and security clearances.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States is set to announce "strong new sanctions" as early as next week, with targets including parties in countries that support Russia's military, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Tuesday.</p>

<p>"We will unveil strong new sanctions targeting those facilitating the Kremlin's war machine, including intermediaries in third countries that are supplying Russia with critical inputs for its military," she said in opening remarks to a press conference.</p>

<p>Her comments come as world financial leaders gather in Washington this week for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.</p>

<p>They also come more than 2.5 years after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, which prompted a series of US actions taking aim at Russia's revenues and industrial complex.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Yellen also appeared to take aim at former president Donald Trump's economic approach, adding that the United States has "rejected isolationism that made America and the world worse off."</p>

<p>The world's biggest economy is two weeks away from its presidential election, which sees Republican candidate Trump running against Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Yellen stressed that under the current Democratic administration, Washington has "pursued global economic leadership that supports economies around the world and brings significant benefits to the American people and the US economy."</p>

<p>The economy has proven to be a critical issue for US voters according to polls.</p>

<p>Households have been feeling the pinch from higher costs of living after the pandemic, even as inflation has cooled from high levels seen in 2022 and the central bank started cutting interest rates -- with borrowing costs set to ease in turn.</p>

<p>The race between Harris and Trump is neck-and-neck, with some polls suggesting voters favor the former president on economic issues.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as the IMF and World Bank meetings take place, Yellen urged countries to do more for nations struggling with debt.</p>

<p>She said US President Joe Biden's administration will continue pushing for improvements to a framework to aid countries in debt distress.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[This initiative by West Japan Railway Co (JR West) comes in response to several violent incidents on trains, including a knife attack in July 2023.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hundreds of blade-resistant umbrellas will soon be deployed on Japanese trains to boost passenger safety following a series of knife attacks.&nbsp;A Japanese company is set to introduce around 1,200 stab-proof, lightweight umbrellas on 600 trains in the Kansai region. These umbrellas are about 20cm longer than standard ones, featuring reinforced canopies and thicker handles for enhanced protection, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/health-environment/article/3283201/blade-proof-umbrellas-be-deployed-japanese-trains-fend-knife-attacks" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>South China Morning Post </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This initiative by West Japan Railway Co (JR West) comes in response to several violent incidents on trains, including a knife attack in July 2023 that left three passengers injured. In a separate incident last year, a 37-year-old man was arrested after stabbing three people on a train in Osaka.</p>

<p>The attacker, who was found carrying three knives, was arrested at Rinku Town station shortly after the assault. The victims, including a train conductor in his 20s and two male passengers aged 23 and 79, were hospitalised but did not suffer life-threatening injuries.</p>

<p>According to <em>Mainichi</em>, the blade-proof umbrellas are designed to act as shields in the event of an attack, extending about 20cm longer than regular umbrellas to help create distance between the user and the assailant.</p>

<p>The added length of these umbrellas is intended to provide passengers behind the shield extra time to escape to safety.</p>

<p>A JR West official stated, "Previous protective shields were bulky and designed for close-range use. We've developed a shield that's lightweight and easier for female employees to handle."</p>

<p>The umbrella-like design makes it more compact, lightweight, and easier to store and use compared to other defense tools, such as the traditional Japanese sasumata-a long forked polearm-which was used during an attempted robbery in Tokyo late last year.</p>

<p>JR West president, Kazuaki Hasegawa, stated, "These umbrellas can be effectively used inside a train carriage and are durable. In an emergency, we want the crew to respond quickly and ensure passengers evacuate safely."</p>

<p>While violent crimes are uncommon in Japan, recent concerns over random knife attacks have led train operators to step up security measures, such as installing more cameras and conducting safety drills.</p>

<p>"We will continue to enhance passenger safety ahead of next year's Osaka-Kansai Expo," a JR West official told <em>The Japan News</em>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The road to success is often paved with failure. At least that's how things turned out for entrepreneur and investor Kunal Bahl. He didn't get into IIT (something his parents were hoping for) but that didn't stop him from achieving massive success in life.</p>

<p>"Many things that I wanted didn't go as per plan at that point in time but it set me on a path that was better for me. I didn't get into IIT but I got into a good US college that opened my mind and really helped me blossom," Mr Bahl said at the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ndtv-world-summit-2024-live-updates-indias-g20-sherpa-amitabh-kant-british-envoy-lindy-cameron-to-speak-on-day-2-6843569">NDTV World Summit 2024</a>.</p>

<p>"So, at that point in time, it feels like you have failed, that's how society will make you feel. Like I said earlier come out of the bottom of that abyss, find that little bit of courage to continue. I remember the day I didn't get into IIT, everyone was upset in my family. I went and played three hours of cricket and picked up from where I left off," he added.</p>

<p>The Snapdeal and Titan Capital co-founder also said that his H-1B visa application was rejected but that led to the beginning of his entrepreneurial journey.</p>

<p>"I was working at Microsoft in the US and they applied for my H-1B visa. I thought I would live in the US for a few years. But one day I was sitting in my office and I got a one-line email that my H1b visa had been rejected and that's how I came back and started my journey as an entrepreneur. If you keep working with hardwork and sincerity, eventually success will follow," he said.</p>

<p>The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.</p>

<p>After returning to India, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ratan-tata-remembered-promise-made-in-passing-many-years-later-snapdeal-co-founder-kunal-bahl-at-ndtv-world-summit-6846414">Kunal Bahl</a> co-founded Snapdeal - a major e-commerce platform and Titan Capital, a venture capital firm that supports early-stage startups.</p>

<p>At the summit, he also explained why India should celebrate 'Indicorns'. "The term unicorn has emerged from the US, suited more to the American context, and India needs to celebrate 'Indicorns' with its own benchmarks of success and business goals tailored to the Indian context."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The complaint alleges the crew member transmitted images of passengers without consent, causing severe mental distress.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A passenger on a Royal Caribbean International cruise has filed a class-action lawsuit against the company and a former crew member after a hidden camera was found in a bathroom, possibly filming up to 960 people, according to <em>USA Today.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>The Southern District of Florida received the case, which was filed on behalf of a passenger known as "Jane Doe" and other impacted passengers from the Symphony of the Seas cruise, as per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2024/10/16/royal-caribbean-guest-sues-class-action/75704159007/?tbref=hp"><em>news portal.</em></a></p>

<p>The case comes after Arvin Joseph Mirasol, a Filipino stateroom attendant, was found guilty of creating child pornography and given a 30-year sentence in federal prison.</p>

<p>On February 25, a visitor reported the camera to ship security after finding it concealed beneath the bathroom sink. When the ship anchored in Fort Lauderdale, Mirasol was taken into custody.</p>

<p>Authorities found videos on Mirasol's devices showing children aged 2 to 17 in various stages of undress. However, the lawsuit alleges his illegal surveillance also targeted adult passengers.</p>

<p>"Upon information and belief, Mirasol transmitted and/or uploaded images of the Plaintiff while undressed and engaging in private activities, to third parties and/or to the world wide web, including, but not limited to, the dark web, without Plaintiff's prior knowledge or consent," the complaint filed this week states.</p>

<p>As a result, the traveller has experienced severe mental turmoil, which has led to physical symptoms like dizziness, insomnia, and discomfort.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli vlogger Nuseir Yassin, who took the world of video content by storm with his Nas Daily channel, took a difficult personal question head-on when, at the NDTV World Summit, somebody asked him whether he'd have found the kind of success he enjoys today had his political opinion been something else.</p>

<p>After Nas Daily gave a presentation at the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ndtv-world-summit-2024-live-updates-indias-g20-sherpa-amitabh-kant-british-envoy-lindy-cameron-to-speak-on-day-2-6843569">NDTV World Summit</a> held in Delhi on the evolution of content creation and delivery, he agreed to take questions from the audience.</p>

<p>"You're an Israeli citizen of Palestinian descent. Do you think - you can say yes or no - the kind of success you have and the sort of political opinion, if you had a different political opinion, do you think you'd have been successful this way?" a member of the audience asked.</p>

<p>Nas Daily responded, "That's a great question. Did I succeed because of my political opinion?"</p>

<p>"So, my friend, I succeeded despite my political opinion, not because of it," Nas Daily said.</p>

</div>

<p>"And you have no idea how difficult it is. Israel is eight million people; the Muslim world is a billion people. There's 200 million in Indonesia, 200 million in Pakistan, 100 million in Egypt, 100 million in Libya and Tunisia, another 200 million in Bangladesh, right?</p>

<p>"If I just make what is popular, and say 'oh yeah yeah yeah free Palestine, I'm with everybody', then I'd literally gain followers, I'd succeed more. I wouldn't need security. But that is what I believe in. I believe that the truth is a little bit more nuanced, that it's not black and white. It's actually grey because unfortunately, I spent 30 years studying and living this conflict.</p>

<p>"So, somebody sitting in Pakistan or Indonesia telling me what to think about this conflict, I wouldn't listen to him," said Nas Daily, who rose to global fame with his Facebook page and YouTube channel, where he ran a project to create and publish a daily one-minute video for 1,000 consecutive days.</p>

<p>Each video, known as a "Nas Daily" video, featured him sharing stories, experiences, and insights from his travels around the world. He eventually launched a media company, Nas Daily Corporation.</p>

</div>

<p>"... My political opinion, which I make very clear, that we need two states for two people, but also we need to free Palestine from Hamas, from radicalism, from terrorism. I am not for that at all. I think Israel should exist. Every time I say the 'I' word, which is Israel, I lose followers. Every time I say the 'I' word, which is the country I am from, I lose brand deals.</p>

<p>"So, I succeeded despite being cancelled more than 10 times. Because the videos are just so damn good, you're willing to listen to somebody from Israel even though you hate Israel so much. And the lesson here I think for everybody is - there is this amazing picture of one guy standing and a 10,000 people and the guy says 'You're all wrong'. I want everybody to think about this picture, 'You're all wrong'.</p>

<p>"What are you willing to stand in front of 10,000 people who disagree with you and tell them 'You're all wrong'? What is something you deeply believe in, that is deeply, deeply unpopular? For me, it is the Israel-Palestine conflict. But for you it is something else. It is a great exercise for every single person sitting here.</p>

<p>"What is something you deeply believe in that everybody around you still disagrees with? Yet for some reason you still believe in it. I think that is what you should make videos about," Nas Daily said.</p>

<p>At the event, continuing NDTV's legacy of pioneering media, NDTV World was launched; it aims to be a leading voice from Asia and India on the global stage.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Rs 76,000 crore "Semiconductor Mission" of the government is a critical move in view of possible Chinese control of the semiconductor market, G20 Sherpa Amitabh Kant told NDTV in an exclusive interview today.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Rs 76,000 crore "Semiconductor Mission" of the government is a critical move in view of possible Chinese control of the semiconductor market, G20 Sherpa Amitabh Kant told NDTV in an exclusive interview today. Speaking at the "NDTV World Summit", Mr Kant said it is a very risky proposition for countries to be dependent on chip manufacturers from abroad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Calling the government's Semiconductor Mission a "most dynamic measure", he said it would be transformational in the years to come.<br />
To explain this, he referred to a book on "chips war" by Chris Miller. "It says if China were to annex Taiwan tomorrow, it would control automobiles, batteries, defence and aerospace," he said. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"Because the whole world will be running on chips. That's why for countries to be totally dependent on chip manufacturing from abroad is a dangerous proposition and therefore India must build its own ecosystem because we are a very large consumer of automobiles, of mobiles... every Indian has a smartphone and you need chips for that," he said.</p>

<p>Even now, global supply chains across the world are badly disrupted because the US imposed huge duty on imports from China, he said -- 100 per cent on electric vehicles, 50 per cent on batteries, on solar imports, to name a few.</p>

<p>The logic US applies is that China subsidises manufacturing, their government supports it. "Therefore they are doing extra production to penetrate global markets and that is why China is controlling 70 per cent EV market, 75 per cent of solar market, 74 per cent of the battery market... So we must put an end to this power supply on global market," he added. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Semiconductor is a foundational industry and semiconductor chips are used in medical instruments, mobile phones, laptops, cars, trucks, trains, televisions and practically every device. India's semiconductor-related market will reach 64 billion dollars in 2026, nearly triple the size in 2019.</p>

<p>Earlier today, participating in the Summit, Mark Mobius, the founder of Mobius Capital Partners LLP, expressed hope that India would be tomorrow's leader in semiconductor production, given its strong software base and the availability of labour.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The government is working towards making the country the next big semiconductor hub. The Central government has cleared five semiconductor manufacturing proposals, with a total combined investment of around Rs 1.52 lakh crore.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon's Hezbollah movement said on Tuesday there would be no negotiations while fighting continued with Israel and it claimed sole responsibility for a drone attack on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's holiday home.</p>

<p>The group "takes full and sole responsibility" for targeting Netanyahu's house, Mohammad Afif, head of the Iranian-backed operator group's media office, told a press conference in the southern suburbs of Beirut.</p>

<p>"If our hands didn't reach you the previous time, then days, nights and the battlefield are still between us," he said.</p>

<p>Israel said a drone was launched at Netanyahu's holiday home on Saturday. Netanyahu was not there at the time, but he described it as an assassination attempt by "Iran's proxy Hezbollah" and called it a "grave mistake".</p>

<p>Hezbollah also for the first time acknowledged that Israel had captured some of its fighters since it launched a ground offensive in south Lebanon, and said that Israel was responsible for their wellbeing.</p>

<p>Hezbollah had not captured any Israeli soldiers but had come close, Afif said. "It won't take long before we have captives from the enemy (Israel).".</p>

<p>He also denied that the group's Al-Qard Al-Hassan Association was involved in financing Hezbollah salaries or weapons and would fulfil its obligations to clients in full even after Israel targeted it with some 30 strikes on Sunday.</p>

<p>Israel and the US say Al-Qard Al-Hassan, which has over 30 outlets across Lebanon, is used by Hezbollah for money laundering and terrorism financing, assertions the group denies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India's road to becoming a developed country will require immense ambition and a focus on manufacturing, urbanisation and "firing on all cylinders", the country's G20 Sherpa Amitabh Kant has said.</p>

<p>In a conversation during the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ndtv-world-summit-2024-live-updates-indias-g20-sherpa-amitabh-kant-british-envoy-lindy-cameron-to-speak-on-day-2-6843569">NDTV World Summit</a> on Tuesday, Mr Kant said 500 million people will get into the process of urbanisation in India in the next five decades, which means India will have to create "two Americas" in the same time period.</p>

<p>Responding to a question on India's demographic dividend and the need for reskilling, Mr Kant, who is also a former CEO of the Niti Aayog, said, "India can't grow only on the back of services, it needs to become a manufacturing nation. 17.5% of your GDP comes from manufacturing, you need to take it to 25%. You need to urbanise because 500 million people are going to get into the process of urbanisation in the next five decades, that means India's challenge is to create two Americas in the next five decades."</p>

<p>Mr Kant stressed that there is a need to improve agricultural productivity and bring down the proportion of people involved in agriculture from the nearly 45% it is now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"So you need to fire on all cylinders - services, manufacturing, urbanisation, agriculture, all of them. And for manufacturing and urbanisation, you need to provide skills. You need to get them (the workforce) into completely new areas of growth - artificial intelligence, machine learning, quantum computing - and that's why India has rolled out these new missions in all these areas, including a mission for semiconductors and a mission for green hydrogen," he said. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Number Crunching</strong></p>

<p>On the question of <em>'atmanirbharta'</em> or self-reliance, the former Niti Aayog CEO said it involves India being an integral part of global value chains.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You can't grow at rates of 9-10% year after year for three decades or more - that's what you need to do - so when we are talking of a <em>'viksit'</em> (developed) Bharat or a $30-trillion economy in &nbsp;2047, growing from 4 trillion to 30 trillion means that your GDP has to grow nine times, your per capita income has to grow 8 times and your manufacturing has to grow 16 times, that's the challenge. And to overcome that challenge, India needs to become a very integral part of global value chains," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Kant said India needs to export in a big way and that is why there has been a thrust on the production-linked investment scheme.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;"You need 10,000 large manufacturing companies here to penetrate global markets. You need size and scale of manufacturing, and you need 12 Indian states to grow at 10% plus. So you need ambition and hunger in states to grow rapidly and you need large companies to penetrate global markets," he said.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

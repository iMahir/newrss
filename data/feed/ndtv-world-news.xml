       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>Since Donald Trump's recent electoral victory, <a href="https://x.com/SciGuySpace/status/1856522880143745133">rumours</a> and <a href="https://eu.floridatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2024/11/17/elon-musk-president-trump-impact-on-nasa-artemis-sls-moon-mars-spacex-starship/76255421007/">speculation</a> have circulated that Nasa's giant Moon rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), could be under threat. The rocket is one of several key elements needed for the US space agency's Artemis programme, which aims to return humans to the Moon for the first time since 1972.</p>

<p>For the first <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/artemis_plan-20200921.pdf">lunar landing mission</a>, called Artemis III, the SLS will launch four astronauts on Nasa's Orion crew capsule. Orion will then travel to the Moon. Once in lunar orbit, Orion will dock with Elon Musk's Starship vehicle (which has been launched separately). Two astronauts will float into Starship, which undocks from Orion and travels down to the lunar surface.</p>

<p>After walking on the Moon, the two astronauts return to lunar orbit in Starship, which docks with Orion. The two moonwalkers rejoin their crewmates and go home on Orion, leaving Starship in orbit around the Moon.</p>

<p>The US space journalist Eric Berger recently posted on X: “To be clear we are far from anything being settled, but based on what I'm hearing it seems at least 50-50 that Nasa's Space Launch System rocket will be cancelled.”</p>

<p>No official announcements have been made. However, such a move could be in line with previous speculation that the Trump administration <a href="https://spacenews.com/dont-let-trump-and-musk-gut-nasa/">could gut Nasa</a>, forcing it to contract out much of its work to the private companies.</p>

<p>But could another rocket easily take the place of the SLS? This question goes to the heart of what America wants to achieve amid an emerging 21st-century space race. China has pledged to send its astronauts <a href="https://www.space.com/the-universe/moon/how-china-plans-to-put-astronauts-on-the-moon-by-2030-video">to the lunar surface by 2030</a>. Unlike the US, China is usually conservative in its estimates, so we can assume deadline slippage is unlikely. Meanwhile, several elements of Artemis <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/d24106256.pdf">are holding up</a> the schedule.</p>

<p>One of these delayed elements is Musk's Starship, which acts as the lander on Artemis III. It still needs to demonstrate key milestones including refuelling in space and performing a landing on the Moon without crew. Some in the space community believe that if China were to get to the Moon first this century, it <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/4992934-elon-musk-trump-space-policy/">would deal</a> a <a href="https://spacenews.com/make-space-great-again/">significant blow</a> to US ambitions in space.</p>

<p>Musk has been brought into the incoming administration as one of two chief cost cutters, aiming to make reductions of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/government-spending-doge-elon-musk-trump-administration-60477bc5">up to US$2 trillion</a> (£1.57 trillion) from the federal budget. Some observers have been alarmed by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/22/elon-musk-donald-trump">Elon Musk's closeness</a> to Trump and by comments by the president-elect about <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/4992934-elon-musk-trump-space-policy/">shifting focus</a> towards a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2024/10/27/trump-musk-mars/">crewed Mars mission</a>.</p>

<p>These comments seem to mirror the views of Musk, who has focused much of his energy on ambitions to <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/22/science/mars-human-settlement-elon-musk/index.html">settle the red planet</a>, not the Moon. The billionaire has said he wants to send humans on a trip to Mars using his Starship vehicle by 2028 – a timeline that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/space-policy-is-about-to-get-pretty-wild-yall/">some view as unrealistic</a>.</p>

<p>It was actually the first Trump administration that <a href="https://spacenews.com/national-space-council-calls-for-human-return-to-the-moon/">established the Artemis programme</a> in 2017. After initial missions to the lunar surface, the programme aims to establish <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/2020/10/28/lunar-living-nasas-artemis-base-camp-concept/">a permanent base</a> where astronauts can learn how to live and work on the Moon, carrying out cutting-edge research.</p>

<p>However, the schedule <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-shares-progress-toward-early-artemis-moon-missions-with-crew/">has been slipping</a>. US astronauts were to have landed on the Moon this year. Nasa now says the first landing, during the Artemis III mission, will not take place until Autumn 2026.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/d24106256.pdf">Delays have been introduced</a> by redesigns to spacesuits, problems with Orion's heat-shield and life support systems and, as mentioned, with Starship. An upgraded <a href="https://oig.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ig-24-016.pdf">mobile launch tower</a> for the SLS has also been plagued by cost overruns and schedule slippage.</p>

</figure>

<p>Notably, an element that isn't contributing to delays is <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/analysis-confirms-successful-artemis-i-moon-mission-reviews-continue-2/">the SLS</a>, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/artemis/initial-assessment-shows-excellent-performance-for-artemis-moon-rocket/">which performed</a> <a href="https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/6.2024-4600">very well</a> <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2022/12/icps-artemis-i-review/">during</a> the Artemis I mission in 2022. Many billions of dollars have <a href="https://www.planetary.org/space-policy/cost-of-sls-and-orion">already been invested</a> in designing and building the SLS and associated infrastructure at Nasa's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/reference/space-launch-system/">Nasa says</a> the SLS is “the only rocket that can send Orion, astronauts, and cargo directly to the Moon in a single launch”. But its expense has been criticised: each SLS launch is estimated to cost <a href="https://oig.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ig-24-001.pdf">more than US$2 billion</a> (£1.6 billion).</p>

<p>News of delays and technical issues with Artemis have coincided with hugely positive PR for Musk's SpaceX – especially around its test flights of Starship. This included last month's feat, where the vehicle's massive <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/168874/spacexs-mechazilla-catches-starship-booster/">booster stage was caught</a> in a pair of robotic arms as it fell back from space to the company's launchpad in Texas – wowing space enthusiasts around the world.</p>

<p>Unlike many launch vehicles, Starship is designed to be fully reusable. Its cost efficiency could greatly benefit future crewed missions.</p>

<p>If the SLS were to be cancelled, could Musk's Starship replace it? Under this scenario, the SpaceX vehicle could presumably serve both as the launcher to send astronauts on their way to lunar orbit and as the lander to take them down to the surface. This is technically feasible, but would be far from a straightforward, like-for-like replacement. The SLS is already an operational rocket, whereas Starship is still in its testing phase and has key steps still to achieve before astronauts can board it.</p>

<p>Another SpaceX rocket that has previously been touted as a contender to launch Orion is the Falcon Heavy. However, engineers would <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2019/04/nasa-lsp-studies-alternate-orion-options/2/">need to modify</a> both the rocket and procedures for assembly and launch. This would carry <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/04/nasa-chief-says-a-falcon-heavy-rocket-could-fly-humans-to-the-moon/">many uncertainties</a>, and with it the risk of further, significant delays to the Artemis schedule. This all suggests that there <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-us-is-now-at-risk-of-losing-to-china-in-the-race-to-send-people-back-to-the-moons-surface-241716">is not a lot of time</a> to make major changes to Nasa's Moon programme if the US is to get ahead in this 21st-century space race.</p>

<p>Rocket launches require specific designs to meet mission requirements, as well as extensive planning for carrying astronauts, spacecraft and payloads. The aims of Artemis are not just to land astronauts on the Moon, but to be able to land in a variety of regions on the lunar surface, including the relatively unexplored south pole.</p>

<p>The planning and development required is hugely complex and ambitious. It remains to be seen whether SpaceX, or any other commercial launch companies, are ready for such a major undertaking and commitment.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://www.planetary.org/space-policy/cost-of-sls-and-orion">tens of billions of dollars</a> already invested in the SLS, it does not seem economically beneficial to completely scrap the rocket. As indicated by Nasa's willingness to seek an innovative approach and work with commercial companies on future Artemis missions, there could be other ways for commercial space players to get involved.</p>

<p>It's understandable for the incoming Trump administration to raise questions and query cost models in Nasa programmes. But it would be advisable for them to carefully consider the trade offs before making decisions with such wide-ranging consequences.</p>

<p>It might fall down to whether the priority is winning the new space race. Whatever goals that the new administration chooses to prioritise or target, it may have to carefully justify that decision to other legislators and to the American public.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With a tape measure around his neck and thimble on his finger, Raniero Mancinelli slides a needle into a black cassock with red piping destined for a Catholic cardinal.</p>

<p>"It takes two or three days to make an outfit: taking the measurements, cutting it out, and putting it all together," according to the 86-year-old Italian, one of the last ecclesiastical tailors in Rome.</p>

<p>Mancinelli has been working flat out in his historic shop on the Borgo Pio, a stone's throw from the Vatican, ahead of a ceremony this weekend to make 21 new cardinals.</p>

<p>A third of those being elevated by Pope Francis have placed orders with the tailor.</p>

<p>"They trust me and I know what I have to do, depending on where they live, the climate, their financial means," said Mancinelli, bushy black eyebrows moving animatedly above rectangular glasses, his hands stroking a tiny silver goatee.</p>

<p>Gold chalices, embroidered headdresses, signet rings, and rosaries with gleaming crucifixes fill the shop's display cases.</p>

<p>Entering his workshop at the back of the shop is like stepping back in time: an olive green Necchi sewing machine sits on a wooden bench, underneath a map of the Vatican.</p>

<p>Large scissors and an old cast-iron iron lie on a nearby table.</p>

<h3><strong>Less sumptuous</strong></h3>

<p>Mancinelli, assisted by his daughter and grandson, arms himself with scissors, pins, bobbins and buttons.</p>

<p>Two scarlet cassocks hang ready nearby. The future cardinals will also need a "biretta" (a square cap), "mozzetta" (an elbow-length cape), and "rochet" (a white lace garment).</p>

<p>The tailor also makes the black habits and white collars for priests, and the violet skullcaps and belts worn by bishops.</p>

<p>The luxury silks once used have today been replaced by "light, cheaper wools", and cassocks now cost around 200 euros ($210) each.</p>

<p>Mancinelli, originally from the Marche region in central Italy, has worked under seven popes but fell into the profession "by chance".</p>

<p>"One day I was offered the job of making cassocks for the Vatican," he told AFP.</p>

<p>"I started like that, cautiously, little by little, but I immediately saw that I liked it."</p>

<p>After honing his skills in Rome in the late 1950s under Pius XII, Mancinelli opened his own business in 1962.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He thinks back with nostalgia of long scarlet trains "of 6-7 metres of silk" once worn by cardinals, and the clergy who used to favour very high collars.</p>

<p>But ecclesiastical fashions change.</p>

<p>After the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s brought the Church into a more modern era, outfits became more simple.</p>

<p>And they have become humbler still under Pope Francis, who refused to wear the furs and velvets donned by his predecessors.</p>

<p>Clerical clothing is now "lighter, less expensive, less sumptuous, less flashy", Mancinelli said.</p>

<h3><strong>'Maestro'</strong></h3>

<p>The workshop is lined with photographs of Mancinelli and popes. He personally made cassocks for the last three, including Argentine Francis.</p>

<p>But it is his "exceptional" relationship with common clergymen that drives him, and gave him the strength to reopen after a difficult pandemic.</p>

<p>"They are the ones who give me this energy, this desire to work," he said.</p>

<p>Clerics from all over the world drop in on him during their visits to Rome.</p>

<p>Some have become friends, others have climbed the ranks of the Catholic hierarchy.</p>

<p>Over the decades, he has seen the number of ecclesiastical tailors dwindle as the sector industrialises.</p>

<p>"It's a very particular job, everything is done by hand," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But one person is learning the centuries-old skills.</p>

<p>Mancinelli's 23-year-old grandson Lorenzo di Toro has been working alongside him for the past three years.</p>

<p>"I didn't think it would be so difficult," said di Toro, whose hoodie and sneakers contrast starkly with the decor.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has landed in hot water after referring to India as “a kind of laboratory to try things” during a podcast with LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. His remarks, while intended to highlight India's progress and its collaboration with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, have revived a controversial 2009 clinical trial -- funded by Gates' foundation -- which killed seven tribal schoolgirls and left many others severely ill.</p>

<p>Mr Gates said in the recent podcast, “India is an example of a country where there's plenty of things that are difficult there—the health, nutrition, education is improving, and they are stable enough and generating their government revenue enough that it's very likely that 20 years from now people will be dramatically better off. It's kind of a laboratory to try things that then when you prove them out in India, you can take to other places.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>His choice of words struck a nerve among the Indian audience. Among the critics was a Scotland-based doctor, known as “The Skin Doctor” on X, who brought up a 2009 clinical trial conducted by PATH (Programme for Appropriate Technology in Health), an NGO funded by the Gates Foundation.</p>

<p>In 2009, PATH collaborated with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to conduct clinical trials of a cervical cancer vaccine on 14,000 tribal schoolgirls in Khammam district, Telangana, and Vadodara, Gujarat. Months after the trials began, several participants reported severe side effects and seven deaths were recorded, although the deaths were later attributed to unrelated causes.</p>

<p>An investigation into the trials uncovered serious ethical lapses, revealed the skin doctor. The trials were presented as a public health initiative, concealing their experimental nature. Consent forms were allegedly signed by hostel wardens instead of the girls' parents, leaving families unaware of potential risks.</p>

<p>The trials specifically targeted tribal communities with limited healthcare access and awareness. Severe side effects were reported, fuelling allegations that the trials exploited vulnerable populations under the guise of aid.</p>

<p>PATH denied any wrongdoing, attributing the deaths to infections and suicides.</p>

<p>Critics argue the 2009 vaccine trials are just one example of how India and other developing nations have been used as testing grounds by organisations with foreign funding.</p>

<p>“Who knows how many Gates-funded NGOs are conducting similar trials in India and Africa? It's disturbing how easily they access our governance and policies, while openly treating us as guinea pigs,” the skin doctor concluded.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new rumour has sparked concern online, suggesting that the Disney Channel may be shutting down in the United States. However, Disney has not made any official announcements about discontinuing the channel in the US.</p>

<p>While the Disney Channel remains active in North America, the company has already closed its channels in various regions, including Australia, Southeast Asia, Italy, the UK, South Korea, and others. Disney XD has been discontinued in even more locations as Disney shifts its focus toward Disney+.</p>

<p>In France, Disney XD has already been phased out, and both Disney Junior and the Disney Channel are scheduled to shut down on January 1, 2025. Similarly, in Spain, the Disney Channel will cease operations on January 7, 2025.</p>

<p>Despite the rumours circulating on social media, one user on X (formerly Twitter) has dismissed the claims of a US shutdown as false.</p>

<p>The growing popularity of Disney+ has fueled speculation about the future of traditional Disney channels, but Disney has clarified that all content previously aired on the Disney Channel will remain accessible on Disney+. This shift allows viewers greater flexibility with on-demand access while marking the end of an era for linear television. For now, Disney Channel in the United States is not slated for closure, and the rumours appear to stem from confusion about its shutdowns in other countries.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Based on your brain activity, scientists can even determine who you love or whether you have a pet.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new study suggests that love, in all its forms, stimulates the reward and addiction systems of the brain-those same parts of the brain that are involved in behaviours like drug use and video game addiction. The current research outcomes further make it more clear why breakups and losses tend to be marked by a depth of emotional anguish and sharp physical pain.</p>

<p>This research published in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/34/8/bhae331/7741043"><em>Cerebral Cortex </em></a>explores how different forms of love-romantic, familial, friendly, and even love for pets or for nature-affect the brain. Researchers from Aalto University in Finland, under Parttyli Rinne, mapped out brain activity that had links to various kinds of love and discovered each activates different regions of the brain related to social understanding. However, common to all the varieties of love was the stimulating of the brain's reward system, also implicated in the perception of addictive behaviours.</p>

<p>Lucy Brown, a neuroscientist at Einstein College of Medicine in New York, said this study confirms that romantic love and long-term attachments utilise the brain's reward and addiction circuits. She added that the research is slowly painting a clearer picture of what the brain looks like when somebody is in love.</p>

<p>The researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a brain scanning technique, to analyse the brain activity of 55 people.</p>

<p>"Our results demonstrate that love in closer interpersonal relationships - like for one's child, romantic partner, and friend - is associated with significantly stronger activation in the brain's reward system than love for strangers, pets, or nature," Rinne told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dw.com/en/humans-are-addicted-to-love-heres-how-we-know/a-70858166?maca=en-Whatsapp-sharing"><em>Deutsche Welle.</em></a></p>

<p>Love of people also activates brain areas associated with thinking, feeling, and understanding - also known as social cognition. Differences in brain activity in social cognition regions revealed whether participants had a pet or not.</p>

<p>"In pet owners, love for pets activates these same social brain regions significantly more than in participants without pets," said Rinne.</p>

<p>Love of nature or art are also strong types of love, but we tend to feel it differently than a romantic or familial love of people. Indeed, love of nature lit up the brain's reward system and visual areas associated with viewing landscapes, but not the areas associated with social cognition.</p>

<p>"This provides evidence that different types of love draw on partly distinct and partly overlapping brain regions," said Roland Zahn, a psychiatrist and expert in mood disorders at King's College London, UK, who was not involved in the study.</p>

<p>This study provides new insight into the powerful influence love has on the brain and how it may impact both emotional states as well as physical ones.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The bail hearing of Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, the Hindu priest arrested and accused of sedition in Bangladesh, has been pushed to next month after no lawyer appeared in court for the hearing on Tuesday. Earlier, ISKCON (International Society for Krishna Consciousness) claimed that a Bangladeshi lawyer defending the Hindu monk was "brutally attacked at his home by Islamists" and is in the Intensive Care Unit.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, lawyers denied appearing for him during the bail hearing, following which the Chattogram court adjourned the proceedings. The court fixed the next date of hearing on January 2, 2025.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagran Jote has alleged that approximately 70 Hindu lawyers were "falsely sued in a case to prevent their participation" in a bail hearing for their spokesperson Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, according to a report by Bangladeshi daily <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.tbsnews.net/bangladesh/70-lawyers-falsely-sued-bar-participation-chinmoys-bail-hearing-alleges-sanatani-jagran" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">The Business Standard</a>.</p>

<p>As per the report, the minority coalition, with which the arrested Hindu monk was associated, in a statement on Sunday night claimed that the lawyers were being sued in a case filed under the Explosives Act with Kotwali Police Station in Chattogram, to "sabotage their ability to advocate for Chinmoy Das".</p>

<p>The coalition reportedly also accused "members of a political group" of assaulting lawyers defending the Hindu monk.</p>

<p>On Monday, Radharaman Das, the spokesperson for ISKCON Kolkata, said in a post on X, "Please pray for Advocate Ramen Roy. His only 'fault' was defending Chinmoy Krishna Prabhu in court. Islamists ransacked his home and brutally attacked him, leaving him in the ICU, fighting for his life".</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Many lawyers in Bangladesh, however, have denied any such event.</p>

<p>Last month too, there were claims on social media and a few news outlets that a lawyer defending Chinmoy Krishna Das was killed. But investigations revealed that the murdered lawyer, Saiful Islam, was an assistant public prosecutor and he was not defending Chinmoy Das.</p>

<p>Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, a prominent former ISKCON leader, is currently serving as a spokesperson of Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagran Jote. He&nbsp;was arrested in Dhaka last month after protests by the Hindu community in Rangpur, demanding stronger legal protections for minority groups. The monk has been accused of sedition.</p>

<p>Following the rejection of his bail plea on November 26, clashes erupted between protestors and police outside Chattogram court premises, resulting in the killing of Advocate Saiful Islam Alif.</p>

<p>Four days later, the murdered lawyer's brother reportedly filed a case under the Explosives Act in Chattogram, naming 116 individuals as accused. His father also filed a murder case involving 31 suspects, the Bangladeshi daily report said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US lawmakers concluded a two-year investigation Monday into the Covid-19 outbreak that killed 1.1 million Americans -- backing the theory that the virus likely leaked from a Chinese laboratory.</p>

<p>A 520-page report from the Republican-controlled House Select Sub-committee on the Coronavirus Pandemic looked at the federal and state-level response, as well as the pandemic's origins and vaccination efforts.</p>

<p>"This work will help the United States, and the world, predict the next pandemic, prepare for the next pandemic, protect ourselves from the next pandemic, and hopefully prevent the next pandemic," panel chairman Brad Wenstrup said in a letter to Congress.&nbsp;</p>

<p>US federal agencies, the World Health Organization and scientists across the planet have arrived at different conclusions about the most likely origin of Covid-19, and no consensus has emerged.</p>

<p>Most believe it to have spread from animals in China, but a US intelligence analysis said last year that the virus may have been genetically engineered and escaped from a virology lab in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where human cases first emerged.</p>

<p>The congressional panel was persuaded by the lab leak theory after meeting 25 times, conducting more than 30 transcribed interviews, and reviewing more than one million pages of documents.</p>

<p>The investigation included two days of interviews behind closed doors with Anthony Fauci, the government scientist who became the nation's most trusted expert in the chaotic early days of the 2020 outbreak.</p>

<p>Fauci's clashes with former and incoming president Donald Trump over the response sparked fury on the right, and he now lives with security protection following death threats against his family.</p>

<p>Republicans accuse the 83-year-old immunologist of helping to set off the worst pandemic in a century by approving funding passed on to Chinese scientists they accuse of manufacturing the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes Covid-19.</p>

<p>Among its headline conclusions, the report said the National Institutes of Health had indeed funded contentious "gain-of-function" research -- which seeks to enhance viruses as a way of finding ways to combat them -- at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fauci angrily denied covering up the origins of Covid-19 before the panel in June, arguing that it would be "molecularly impossible" for the bat viruses studied at the lab to be turned into the virus that caused the pandemic.</p>

<p>But the panel's report said SARS-CoV-2 "likely emerged because of a laboratory or research related accident."</p>

<p>The probe found that lockdowns "did more harm than good" and that mask mandates were "ineffective at controlling the spread of Covid-19," contradicting other research showing that masking in public does reduce transmission rates.</p>

<p>Social distancing guidelines also came under criticism, although travel restrictions were deemed to have saved lives.</p>

<p>Investigators found that Trump's Operation Warp Speed -- the publicly-funded project to develop Covid vaccines -- was a "tremendous success" but that school closures would have an "enduring impact" on US children.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A writ petition has been filed in the Bangladesh High Court seeking a ban on the broadcast of Indian TV channels in the country citing growing concerns over the impact of Indian media on Bangladeshi culture and society, Dhaka Tribune reported.</p>

<p>Lawyer Ekhlas Uddin Bhuiyan, who filed the petition on Monday, is seeking a directive under the Cable Television Network Operation Act 2006 to prohibit the broadcast of Indian TV channels.</p>

<p>It also asks why a rule should not be issued instructing a ban on Indian TV channels in Bangladesh, as per Dhaka Tribune.</p>

<p>The hearing on the application may take place in the High Court bench comprising Justice Fatema Najib and Justice Sikder Mahmudur Razi.</p>

<p>The secretaries of the Information Ministry and the Home Ministry, the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC), and others are named as respondents in the petition.</p>

<p>According to Dhaka Tribune, the writ calls for a ban on channels like Star Jalsha, Star Plus, Zee Bangla, Republic Bangla, and all other Indian TV channels.</p>

<p>The petition alleges that provocative news is being aired on Indian channels and that unregulated broadcasts of content opposing Bangladeshi culture are leading to the destruction of the youth.</p>

<p>Further, it alleges that these channels operate without adhering to any regulations .</p>

<p>Notably, Bangladesh has witnessed a surge in violent attacks against Hindus and other minority groups, prompting calls for greater protection and support.</p>

<p>The situation in Bangladesh has been marked by increasing violence against minority communities, with temples, being destroyed after the arrest of a former priest Chinmoy Krishna Das over sedition charges and for allegedly hoisting a saffron flag above Bangladesh's national flag in Chittagong on October 25.</p>

<p>Tensions escalated further after a lawyer was killed during clashes between police and alleged followers of Das in the Chattogram Court Building area on November 27.</p>

<p>India has multiple times raised concerns regarding the Bangladesh situation and urged Bangladesh's interim government to take steps to protect minorities.</p>

<p>Last week, during the weekly media briefing, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal expressed concern over the rise of "extremist rhetoric, increasing incidents of violence and provocation," and said "We are concerned about the surge of extremist rhetoric, and increasing incidents of violence and provocation. These developments cannot be dismissed only as media exaggerations. We once again call upon Bangladesh to take all steps for the protection of minorities and safeguarding their interests."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jill Biden, the wife of Joe Biden, reportedly may have played an instrumental role in convincing the outgoing US President to pardon his son Hunter. "Clearly there was pressure inside the family," said Jeff Zeleny, CNN's chief national affairs correspondent. During a Monday broadcast, Mr Zeleny said that Jill Biden had been "very supportive of the president doing something like this" in recent weeks.</p>

<p>The 82-year-old was reportedly in two minds, with Mr Zeleny implying that Jill's persistent push may have tipped the scales. "We were told really in recent weeks that Dr. Jill Biden - first lady Jill Biden - was very supportive of the president doing something like this," Mr Zeleny said.</p>

<p>Jill Biden openly approved of the move, telling reporters at the White House, "Of course, I support the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/joe-biden-pardons-son-hunter-in-2-criminal-cases-hope-americans-will-understand-7151191" target="_blank">pardon</a> of my son."</p>

<p>Hunter Biden is the President's son from his first wife, Neilia, who died in a car crash in 1972.</p>

<p>While Jill Biden is recognised as one of the most influential first ladies in recent history, her relationship with Hunter Biden has been tumultuous. Text messages from Hunter's infamous laptop - seized by the police ahead of Joe Biden's presidential campaign - revealed instances where he referred to his stepmother in derogatory terms, calling her an "entitled c**t" and a "vindictive moron," as per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/02/us-news/jill-biden-pushed-for-hunters-pardon-report/" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">NY Post</a>.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/charges-against-hunter-biden-and-consequences-avoided-through-presidential-pardon-7152668" target="_blank">Hunter Biden</a> pleaded guilty to nine counts of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes and was convicted in June on three federal gun charges for possessing a firearm while addicted to illegal drugs. He was set to face sentencing hearings for the charges later this month but will now avoid court proceedings following the presidential pardon. Defending his decision, President Biden said on Sunday, "I felt Hunter was being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The concept design called 'Type 00' depicts 'Miami Pink' and 'London Blue' coloured vehicles with a minimalist design.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Days after facing backlash for its marketing campaign, Jaguar, on Monday (Dec 2) unveiled a concept design for its next generation of electric vehicles (EV). The 'Copy nothing' rebrand is part of Jaguar's transition towards an EV future with the British luxury car company aiming to offer an entirely electrified model range while phasing out ICE (Internal Combustion Engines) vehicles by 2025. The car designs, however, appear to have further angered social media users, who claimed the 'colourful' rebrand was diluting the legacy of the brand.</p>

<p>The concept design called <em>Type 00 </em>depicts <em>Miami Pink </em>and <em>London Blue </em>coloured vehicles with a minimalist design, featuring oval-shaped steering wheels and a wide front grill. The car appears to have no rear window, suggesting that cameras may be used to show drivers the road behind them.</p>

<p>"London Blue honours the iconic Opalescent Silver Blue of the 1960s E-type. Miami Pink pays tribute to the city's pastel colours and Art Deco architecture," Jaguar captioned its post, adding that <em>Type 00 </em>is a non-production vehicle.</p>

<p>Notably, hours before the launch, the designs had been leaked, leading to a deluge of reactions from social media users.</p>

<p>"This is really embarrassing. It's all over for Jaguar. Goes woke, alienates its existing customer base, removes any reference to its legacy, and expects buyers to go with a car that's ugly and looks like a 90's Chrysler," said one user, while another added: "They're going to write chapters in textbooks about how bad this rebrand is. Jaguar is ruined."</p>

<p>A third commented: "Don't be so hard on yourselves...GO COPY!!!"</p>

<p>Despite the backlash, some users appeared to have resonated with the car design and applauded the company. "Pretty sick. I love it! Love their rebrand and the campaign surrounding it. It's been brilliant and thus far effective," said a user. "</p>

<p>Another added: "I know everyone's been hating on them but I actually like this a lot. Gives me that Cyberpunk 2077 energy."</p>

<h3><strong>Jaguar faces backlash</strong></h3>

<p>The luxury carmaker unveiled a new minimalist logo and designed a marketing ad last month that featured a diverse cast of models, dressed in bold, techno-inspired outfits, showcasing the brand's seemingly modern aesthetic.</p>

<p>The launch surprisingly didn't showcase any of Jaguar's iconic luxury vehicles, which left social media users puzzled who called out the British brand for pandering to identity politics instead of manufacturing luxury cars.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British singer Elton John told a theatre audience on Sunday that he had lost his sight, months after suffering a severe eye infection. One of the biggest-selling artists of all time, Mr John attended the launch of the "The Devil Wears Prada" musical in London's West End but said he had been unable to watch the performance.</p>

<p>"I haven't been able to come to many of the previews because, as you know, I have lost my eyesight," the 77-year-old singer told the audience at a charity gala performance of the musical based on the best-selling novel for which he has written the score.</p>

<p>"So it's hard for me to see it, but I love to hear it and, boy, it sounded good tonight," he said.</p>

<p>The "Tiny Dancer" and "Rocket Man" star thanked his husband, David Furnish, saying he "has been my rock."</p>

<p>The "Rocket Man" star posted on Instagram in September that an infection had "left me with only limited vision in one eye".</p>

<p>Last month, he told ABC News in the US that the infection had left him unable to see out of his right eye and that his left was "not the greatest," meaning he could no longer read or watch anything and putting his ability to record any new music in the future at risk.</p>

<p>"I am healing, but it's an extremely slow process and it will take some time before sight returns to the impacted eye," he added.</p>

<p>The music legend, whose piano-led rock songs and ballads such as "Candle in the Wind" have kept him in the spotlight since the 1970s, wound down a glittering live career with a global farewell tour in 2022 and 2023. He played his final show in his native UK at the Glastonbury Festival and his last-ever gig in Sweden and has since focused on his family.</p>

<p>In 1994, Mr John was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for contributions to music and charity In 1998 gaining the title 'Sir'.</p>

<p>While he is officially retired from touring, he wrote the music for the musical "The Devil Wears Prada", which is based on the 2003 novel by Lauren Weisberger, which was also turned into a movie in 2006.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 47-year-old Florida woman, who zipped her boyfriend in a suitcase -- causing his death -- during a hide-and-seek game, has been sentenced to life in prison.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-woman-guilty-of-killing-boyfriend-after-zipping-him-in-a-suitcase-during-hide-and-seek-game-6890288">Sarah Boone</a> was on Monday found guilty of second-degree murder of Jorge Torres Jr, 42, in October.<br />
<br />
Boone zipped the man into a suitcase and recorded a video taunting her boyfriend before leaving him inside for several hours to suffocate and die, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/02/us/sarah-boone-sentencing-suitcase?cid=ios_app" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">CNN</a> reported.<br />
<br />
Speaking about the impact of his death, Jorge's mother, Blanca Torres, said the accused “not only killed my son, but she also killed a father, a brother, an uncle.”<br />
<br />
“Sometimes when I look out the window, I'm waiting for him to come and say, ‘Mom, I love you',” the mother said.<br />
<br />
Victoria Torres, sister of the victim, said Boone has "caused a lifetime of pain" to the family.<br />
<br />
Ana Victoria Torres, one of Jorge's daughters, said in court that the death of her “incredible father” left her with chronic depression and anxiety.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
She added that for a year after his death, she almost woke up “screaming every morning or night wishing I was having a nightmare."<br />
<br />
Boone, in her defence, said she was being abused by Jorge. Throughout the trial, she and her team claimed that she was suffering from “battered spouse syndrome”.<br />
<br />
Jorge "kicked, punched, spit on, raped, stabbed (and) choked” her, besides several forms of abuse, Boone alleged.<br />
<br />
“I forgive myself for falling in love with a monster,” Boone said, adding that she still loved him no matter how "grotesque he may become".<br />
<br />
In February 2020, the couple got drunk while playing a hide-and-seek game, a statement from State Attorney Andrew Bain's office said. The couple thought “it would be funny” to get inside a suitcase as part of the game.<br />
<br />
Boone told the court that her boyfriend voluntarily got inside the suitcase, while she zipped it from outside.<br />
<br />
As per the statement, she then started recording herself “taunting” the victim. He requested her to let him out, but she went upstairs to sleep.<br />
<br />
Boone thought that since Jorge had two of his fingers stuck outside the suitcase, he would be able to unzip himself and get out of it.<br />
<br />
When Boone woke up the next morning, she found him unresponsive in the suitcase and called police.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Thanksgiving, a family in southern Connecticut lost their waterfront mansion, valued at over $4 million, after a turkey fryer reportedly caused a fire in the garage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Weston Volunteer Fire Department reported that the fire occurred at a home near a large pond in Weston, about 65 miles southwest of Hartford, the state capital.</p>

<p>Weston Fire Chief John Pokorny told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/12/02/connecticut-mansion-fire-turkey-garage/76703986007/" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>USA Today</em></a> that approximately 40 people were inside the house when the blaze began. Thankfully, no injuries were reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to a news release from the fire department, crews were dispatched to Weston Road at 3:42 p.m. Thursday following a fire alarm activation. Upon arrival, firefighters found a fully involved garage fire that was quickly spreading to the rest of the home. Public Relations Officer Ryan Blake confirmed that everyone inside the house evacuated safely after the fire broke out.</p>

<p>"Firefighters attempted an aggressive fire attack however their efforts were thwarted by dangerous fire conditions and structural collapse," the agency wrote in the release. "In addition, a vehicle drove over the water supply hose on Weston Road, damaging the line, which completely stopped the flow of water for several minutes."</p>

<p>The agency reported that crews battled the fire for more than 16 hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The cause of the fire remains under investigation by the Weston Fire Marshal, however, based on the preliminary investigation it appears the fire began in the garage and was the result of frying a turkey," the agency wrote.</p>

<p>The mansion that caught fire was deemed uninhabitable and a total loss.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Zillow, the 11-bedroom, 9.5-bath, 9,378 square-foot home sold for $4,01,800.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I would like to thank all the Weston volunteer firefighters, Weston volunteer EMS, WPD, as well as the mutual aid fire departments from Westport, Easton, Wilton, Ridgefield, Georgetown, Redding, and West Redding, who battled the house fire during Thanksgiving," said Weston First Selectwoman Samantha Nestor. "Special thanks to the Weston Public Work, American Red Cross, Salvation Army of Danbury, Aquarion, Eversource and Soco Gas for their assistance. Thank you for your Service and I am grateful everyone is safe."</p>

<p>The official cause of the fire was still under investigation as of Monday, but a preliminary inquiry identified a turkey fryer inside the garage as the likely source.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A post on Georgetown's Facebook page described the incident as "a stark reminder of the dangers of frying turkeys indoors."<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Less than four years after taking the helm of Intel, Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger resigned from the company on Monday following pressure from the board.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Less than four years after taking the helm of Intel, Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger resigned from the company on Monday, following pressure from the board. Mr Gelsinger reportedly left after the company's directors, during a board meeting last week, felt his costly and ambitious plan to turn Intel around was not working and the progress of change was not fast enough.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The board told Mr Gelsinger he could retire or be removed, and he chose to step down, news agency Reuters report quoting source.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As per the report, Intel's communications chief, Karen Kahn, is also planning to leave the company.</p>

<p>With Mr Gelsinger gone, Intel has handed control of the company to two lieutenants--CFO David Zinsner and former head of client computing Michelle Johnston Holthaus-- as the faltering American chipmaking icon searches for a permanent replacement. The moves come less than a week after U.S. officials gave Intel $7.86 billion in subsidies.</p>

<h2><strong>Pat Gelsinger's Time At Intel</strong></h2>

<p>Mr Gelsinger in 2021 inherited Intel rife with challenges that he compounded. Setting lofty ambitions for manufacturing and AI capabilities among major clients, Intel ultimately lost or cancelled contracts under his watch, and was unable to deliver the promised goods, according to a Reuters special report in October.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He made optimistic claims about prospective AI chip deals that exceeded Intel's own estimates, leading the company to scrap a recent revenue forecast about a month ago. Under him, Intel, which was founded in 1968 and for decades formed the bedrock of Silicon Valley's global dominance in chips, has withered to a market value more than 30 times smaller than Nvidia, the leader in artificial intelligence chips.</p>

<p>Under his watch, the company's shares fell 0.5 per cent. The stock has reportedly lost over half of its value this year, and it was replaced last month by Nvidia on the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average index. Other rivels including Advanced Micro Devices climbed 3.6 per cent and the PHLX Semiconductor Index rose 2.6 per cent.</p>

<p>The sixty-three-year-old's departure comes well before the completion of his four-year roadmap to restore the company's lead in making the fastest and smallest computer chips, a crown it lost to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, which makes chips for Intel rivals such as Nvidia.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What's Next For Intel</strong></h2>

<p>Mr Gelsinger's abrupt departure has opened the doors for the troubled company to consider potential deal options, including scenarios that the former CEO rejected during his time&nbsp;running the chipmaker.</p>

<p>According to a Bloomberg report, the company's board has discussed a range of possibilities in recent months, such as private equity transactions and even a split of Intel's factory and product-design businesses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the former CEO was opposed to breaking up the company and instead focused on his plan to restore Intel's technological edge and become a made-to-order manufacturer for outside clients. With Mr Gelsinger gone, there's a chance to reset the conversation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The report said that Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have been helping Intel to explore its options, and may find a more receptive audience in new management.</p>

<p>The new management also gives the opportunity for suitors to take another look at the acquisition plans of some or all of the business. Bloomberg News has reported that Qualcomm Inc. had expressed some interest in a transaction before, though nothing got very far.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple has been accused in a new lawsuit of illegally monitoring its workers' personal devices and iCloud accounts while also barring them from discussing their pay and working conditions.</p>

<p>The complaint filed in California state court on Sunday by Amar Bhakta, who works in digital advertising for Apple, claims the company requires employees to install software on personal devices that they use for work allowing Apple to access their email, photo libraries, health and "smart home" data and other personal information.</p>

<p>At the same time, the lawsuit alleges, Apple imposes confidentiality policies that prohibit employees from discussing working conditions, including with the media, and engaging in legally-protected whistleblowing.</p>

<p>Bhakta, who has worked for Apple since 2020, says he was barred from talking about his work on podcasts and instructed to remove information about his working conditions from his LinkedIn profile.</p>

<p>"Apple's surveillance policies and practices chill, and thus also unlawfully restrain, employee whistleblowing, competition, freedom of employee movement in the job market, and freedom of speech," the lawsuit said.</p>

<p>Apple in a statement provided by a spokesperson said the claims in the lawsuit lack merit and that its workers are trained annually on their rights to discuss their working conditions.</p>

<p>"At Apple, we're focused on creating the best products and services in the world and we work to protect the inventions our teams create for customers," the company said.</p>

<p>Lawyers for Bhakta also represent two women who filed a lawsuit in June accusing Apple of systematically underpaying female workers in its engineering, marketing, and AppleCare divisions. Apple has said it is committed to inclusion and pay equity.</p>

<p>Apple is also facing at least three complaints from a US labor board claiming it has illegally deterred employees from discussing issues such as sex bias and pay discrimination with each other and the media, including by restricting their use of social media and workplace messaging app Slack. The company has denied wrongdoing.</p>

<p>The new lawsuit was filed under a unique California law that allows workers to sue their employers on behalf of the state and keep 35% of any penalties that are recovered.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Popular rapper Dave Blunts' recent performance has left the internet worried. The 23-year-old rapper appeared on the stage at Chicago's United Center during the fourth annual Juide Wrld Day, while hooked to an oxygen tank. Mr Blunts, who is believed to weigh over 225 kilograms, sat on a couch through his performance, paying tribute to Juice Wrld, who died of an overdose in 2019. Sharing the video, an X user wrote, "Rapper Dave Blunts performs in front of a crowd while connected to an oxygen tank at Juice WRLD Day 2024 in Chicago. The event is put on every year to honour rapper Juice WRLD who d*ed from an overdose.</p>

<p>"I do this for Juice. I do this for me. We keep going no matter what," said Mr Blunts while addressing the audience. "I got demons, and a tank to prove it. Don't come for me when you have been blessed enough to be here that long; respect the struggle," he added.</p>

<p>The video of his performance went viral on social media with many of Mr Blunts' fans applauding his routine but also expressing concern that he needed to take care of his health.</p>

<p>"This isn't even about just being overweight, he cannot hard breathe because his body is suffocating him at this point. I hope he gets some help before too late. He's got a great voice when he can use it," said one user, while another added: "This is absolutely heartbreaking.He needs to get healthy ASAP or he won't be performing at all."</p>

<p>A third commented: "He's not going to make it another five years if he doesn't change something. Hoping he can get the help he needs."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ripple's XRP has surged to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, surpassing notable tokens such as Solana, USDT, and Binance Coin, as the landscape for crypto-friendly policies begins to shift in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>On Monday, XRP skyrocketed by an impressive 40% within 24 hours, reaching $ 2.80- a milestone it hadn't achieved in seven years. The cryptocurrency has attracted over $120 billion in new investments, pushing its market cap to $156 billion following the Nov. 5 election of Donald Trump and other pro-crypto candidates.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/17028189168194" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>Crypto News</em></a> reports that the primary driver behind XRP's rally was Trump's victory, expected to usher in more favourable regulations for the crypto sector. This is particularly significant for Ripple Labs, embroiled in a legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission since 2020.</p>

<p>The election results have also revived hopes for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) by 2025. Earlier this week, asset manager WisdomTree, which oversees $111 billion in assets, applied for a spot Ripple ETF.</p>

<p>In a recent X post, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju emphasized that whale activity on Coinbase has been a major driver of the XRP rally, with exchange premiums rising between 3% and 13%. In contrast, South Korea's Upbit exchange- known for its significant XRP trading base-has shown no such premium during this period.</p>

<p>According to Santiment, a leading analytics firm, wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP accumulated 671 million coins within three weeks. This marked the first notable increase in non-empty wallets in eight years, fueled by FOMO-driven buying.</p>

<p>However, Ripple's price could face a potential pullback in the coming weeks. Currently, XRP is trading well above its short- and long-term moving averages, suggesting the possibility of mean reversion, where prices tend to return to their average levels over time.</p>

<p>Moreover, technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Stochastic Oscillator signal overbought conditions, indicating potential price weakness. XRP may also be in the markup phase of the Wyckoff Method, a stage characterized by demand exceeding supply. This phase is often followed by the distribution phase, typically resulting in a sell-off.</p>

<p>If a pullback occurs, XRP could retreat to retest support at $1.9697, a critical level last reached in April 2021.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The White House said on Monday that President Joe&nbsp;Biden&nbsp;pardoned his son Hunter in part because of concern his political opponents would continue to persecute the younger&nbsp;Biden&nbsp;in the future, as a growing chorus of Democrats and Republicans criticized his decision.</p>

<p>Mr Biden, a Democrat whose term ends on Jan. 20 when Republican President-elect Donald Trump takes office, signed an unconditional pardon for Hunter&nbsp;Biden&nbsp;on Sunday and said he believed his son had been selectively prosecuted and targeted unfairly by the president's political opponents.</p>

<p>Mr Biden&nbsp;said in the past that he would not pardon his son, including to ABC News in June when he was asked if he would rule out a pardon, and replied "yes."</p>

<p>His surprise move was panned by his Republican political opposition, but also by Democrats who say it threatens to undermine public trust in the rule of law, a concept Mr Biden&nbsp;and his party had used to criticize Trump.</p>

<p>Hunter was prosecuted for tax offenses and gun charges, after being targeted for years by Republicans in Congress who accused him of making business deals using his father's name but failed to establish any clear connections.</p>

<p>White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre on Monday defended the president's action and said Mr Biden&nbsp;believed Hunter faced further grief from his adversaries without naming them, and suggested it could continue even after the president left office. Ms Jean-Pierre was among the White House officials who had repeatedly said in the past Mr Biden&nbsp;would not pardon his son.</p>

<p>"One of the reasons the president did the pardon is because they didn't seem like his political opponents would let go of it. It didn't seem like they would move on," she told reporters on Air Force One during a trip to Angola. "They would continue to go after his son. That's what he believed."</p>

<p>Ms Jean-Pierre stressed this was not the first time a president had pardoned a family member. Bill Clinton pardoned his half-brother Roger before he left office, and Trump his daughter's father-in-law, Charles Kushner.</p>

<p>She said Mr Biden&nbsp;believed in the Department of Justice despite his statement that his son's process in the judicial system was "infected with politics."</p>

<p>"Two things could be true: the president does believe in the justice ... system and ... Department of Justice, and he also believes that his son was singled out politically," she said.</p>

<p>She declined to give further details on why or how Mr Biden&nbsp;had changed his mind, or whether the recent election that put Republicans in charge of the White House and both branches of Congress played a role.</p>

<p>Republicans have accused Mr Biden&nbsp;of corruption, while Democratic lawmakers have been split, with some suggesting he put family over country, and others pointing to Trump's nominees for judiciary positions as a rationale.</p>

<p>Hunter&nbsp;Biden&nbsp;pleaded guilty in September to federal tax charges in federal court in Los Angeles and was due to be sentenced Dec. 16 under Mark C. Scarsi, a judge nominated by Republican President-elect Donald Trump. A jury found him guilty in June of making false statements on a gun background check; he was due to be sentenced for those charges this month as well.</p>

<p>Mr Biden&nbsp;said on Sunday that his son had been selectively prosecuted and treated differently than others with similar situations. "No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son – and that is wrong," he said.</p>

<p>Late on Sunday, Hunter&nbsp;Biden's attorney filed to dismiss the indictments against him.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Moscow on Saturday launched a "counter-terror operation" in three border regions adjoining Ukraine to halt Kyiv's biggest cross-border offensive in the two-and-a-half-year conflict.</p>

<p>Ukrainian units stormed across the border into Russia's western Kursk region on Tuesday morning in a shock attack and have advanced several kilometres, according to independent analysts.</p>

<p>Russia has deployed additional troops and equipment, including tanks, rocket launchers and aviation units to stop the advancing troops.</p>

<p>Russia's national anti-terrorism committee said late Friday it was starting "counter-terror operations in the Belgorod, Bryansk and Kursk regions ... in order to ensure the safety of citizens and suppress the threat of terrorist acts being carried out by the enemy's sabotage groups."</p>

<p>Under Russian law, security forces and the military are given sweeping emergency powers during "counter-terror" operations.</p>

<p>Movement is restricted, vehicles can be seized, phone calls can be monitored, areas are declared no-go zones, checkpoints are introduced, and security is beefed up at key infrastructure sites.</p>

<p>The anti-terrorism committee said Ukraine had mounted an "unprecedented attempt to destabilise the situation in a number of regions of our country."</p>

<p>It called Ukraine's incursion a "terrorist attack" and said Kyiv's troops had wounded civilians and destroyed residential buildings.</p>

<p>Ukrainian leaders have remained tight-lipped on the operation, and the United States, Kyiv's closest ally, said it was not informed of the plans in advance.</p>

<p>But President Volodymyr Zelensky has appeared to tout his troops' early successes, saying earlier this week that Russia must "feel" the consequences of the full-scale offensive it has waged against Ukraine since February 2022.</p>

<p>Russia's defence ministry published footage on Saturday of tank crews firing on Ukrainian positions in the Kursk region, as well as an overnight air strike, after it said Friday it had deployed yet more units to the border region.</p>

<p>It also said it had downed 26 Ukrainian drones that tried to attack the region overnight.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, who was also one of the first Google employees, has died after a two-year battle with cancer. She was 56.</p>

<p>In a post on Facebook, Ms Wojcicki's husband Dennis Troper said that she was battling non-small cell lung cancer. "My beloved wife of 26 years and mother to our five children left us today after 2 years of living with non-small cell lung cancer. Susan was not just my best friend and partner in life, but a brilliant mind, a loving mother, and a dear friend to many," Troper wrote alongside a few family photographs.<br />
<br />
He noted that her impact on the family and the world was "immeasurable."&nbsp;<br />

<strong>Who was Susan Wojcicki?</strong><br />
<br />
1. Born on July 5, 1968, in Santa Clara, California, she was the daughter of Stanley, who taught physics at Stanford University. Her mother Esther worked as a journalist and teacher at the Palo Alto High School, Bloomberg reported.<br />
<br />
2. Ms Wojcicki studied history at Harvard University and later worked as a photojournalist in India. Within a few years, she returned to California to receive advanced degrees in economics and business. Later on, she took up a marketing role with Intel Corp.<br />
<br />
3. In 1998, when Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin incorporated the search engine into a business, Ms Wojcicki rented the garage of her home in Menlo Park, California, to them for $1,700 a month. After working there for a few months, they later moved Google into a more formal office.<br />
<br />
4. She was hired in 1999 as the 16th employee of Google and later went on to work towards everything from AdSense, Google Analytics and Google Books to Google Images. In 2006, the company bought her home to serve as a monument to its roots. At the same time, Brin became her brother-in-law and married her sister, Anne, in 2007. However, the former couple parted ways in 2015.<br />
<br />
5. Wojcicki had in 2006 advocated for the $1.65 billion acquisition of YouTube. Being its CEO, she went on to expand its viewership to 2.5 billion monthly users. In February 2023, Ms Wojcicki announced her decision to step down as YouTube's CEO after spending around nine years of being the front and centre of the company.<br />
<br />
From being one of the early employees of Google who helped jumpstart the company in her garage to running the tech giant's advertising business and then YouTube for most of the past decade, Wojcicki has had a journey of a lifetime. Ms Wojcicki married Dennis Troper, who was a fellow veteran Google manager, back in 1998. In February this year, one of their children -- son Marco -- passed away due to an accidental drug overdose at the age of 19.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Protests refuse to die down in Bangladesh. The country's Chief Justice, seen as a loyalist of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, was forced to resign this afternoon after an ultimatum from protesting students. An interim government is already in place in Bangladesh where clashes during a quota protest claimed at least 400 lives earlier this week and forced Ms Hasina to resign and flee the country.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ouster of Bangladesh's autocratic premier sparked celebrations in Dhaka this week but alarm in India, which backed Sheikh Hasina to counter rival China and quash Islamist alternatives, analysts say.</p>

<p>It has created a diplomatic dilemma for the regional powerhouse.</p>

<p>Hasina, 76, quit as prime minister in the face of a student-led uprising on Monday and fled by helicopter to longtime ally New Delhi.</p>

<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first to offer his "best wishes" after Bangladesh's newly sworn-in interim leader Muhammad Yunus took power Thursday, saying New Delhi was "committed" to working with Dhaka.</p>

<p>But China was also swift to welcome Dhaka's new authorities, saying it "attaches importance to the development" of relations.</p>

<p>With Hasina's rivals in control in Dhaka, India's support for the old government has come back to bite.</p>

<p>"From the point of view of Bangladeshis, India has been on the wrong side for a couple of years now," said International Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean.</p>

<p>"The Indian government absolutely did not want to see a change in Dhaka, and had made that very clear for years that they didn't see any alternative to Hasina and the Awami League."</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'Detrimental'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Bangladesh is almost entirely encircled by India, with a deeply intertwined history long before they were partitioned out of the Indian subcontinent in 1947.</p>

<p>But while India's 1.4 billion population and dominating economy overshadows Bangladesh -- with a population of 170 million -- Hasina also courted China.</p>

<p>India and China, the world's two most populous nations, are intense rivals competing for strategic influence across South Asia, including in Nepal, Sri Lanka and the Maldives.</p>

<p>Hasina pursued a delicate balancing act, benefiting from support from New Delhi, while maintaining strong relations with Beijing.</p>

<p>New Delhi saw a common threat in groups Hasina viewed as rivals and crushed with brutal force, including the key Bangladesh National Party (BNP).</p>

<p>"India... worried that any alternative to Hasina and the Awami League could be detrimental to Indian interests," said Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Washington-based Wilson Center.</p>

<p>"In New Delhi's view, the BNP and its allies are dangerous Islamist forces that could imperil Indian interests."</p>

<p>Yunus has said he wants elections in Bangladesh "within a few months".</p>

<p>The BNP could be poised for a comeback, holding a mass rally in Dhaka this week.</p>

<p>In the immediate aftermath of Hasina's fall, some businesses and homes owned by Hindus were attacked, a group seen by some in Muslim-majority Bangladesh as having been her supporters.</p>

<p>Hundreds of Bangladeshi Hindus this week arrived on India's border, asking to cross.</p>

<p>Hindu nationalist leader Modi on Thursday said he hoped "for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities."</p>

<h3><strong>'She will go back'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The fact Hasina is sheltering in India may prove to be a stumbling block to relations between New Delhi and Dhaka.</p>

<p>Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told parliament Hasina had flown to India "at very short notice", and according to Indian media, intended to stay only briefly in transit.</p>

<p>But her reported bid to travel onwards to Britain was scuppered after London called for a "full and independent UN-led investigation" into the deadly crackdown on protests in the last weeks of her rule.</p>

<p>The United States in the past had praised Hasina's economic track record and saw her as a partner on priorities such as countering Islamist extremism, but Washington more recently imposed visa sanctions over concerns about democracy.</p>

<p>It is not clear how long she will now stay in India, or where else she might go.</p>

<p>Since arriving at a military airbase near New Delhi, she has been hosted in a secret safe house and not spoken publically.</p>

<p>Her daughter Saima Wazed said she was "heartbroken" she could not see her mother.</p>

<p>"As much as I would love to see Ma, I don't want to compromise her whereabouts in any way", Wazed, the World Health Organization's Southeast Asia chief, said in a since-deleted post on social media platform X.</p>

<p>Her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy told the Times of India newspaper his mother still hoped to contest for political office.</p>

<p>"She will go back to Bangladesh the moment the interim government decides to hold an election," he said.</p>

<h3><strong>'Earned the enmity'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Indian media warn of the "formidable diplomatic challenge" the country now faces.</p>

<p>"New Delhi must actively work to limit the damage, and ensure the high stakes in the relationship are protected," the Indian Express newspaper warned. "This could involve some near-term setbacks."</p>

<p>But Bangladesh's new leader Yunus has offered an olive branch.</p>

<p>"Although some countries, such as India, backed the ousted prime minister and earned the enmity of the Bangladeshi people as a result, there will be many opportunities to heal these kinds of rifts," Yunus wrote in The Economist, shortly before returning to Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Crisis Group's Kean meanwhile said he believes the nations will put the past aside for pragmatic relations.</p>

<p>"India is Bangladesh's most important international partner, and there's no reason that they can't find a way to move forward from this," said Kean.</p>

<p>"Economic forces will compel them to work together."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Late arrival for boarding helped a Brazilian man escape death as the flight he missed met a tragic end last evening.</p>

<p>Adriano Assis was to board the Voepass 2283 flight that crashed in Sao Paulo, killing all passengers and crew on board. In an interview with local news outlet TV Globo, Adriano said he was stopped from boarding the flight because he was late.</p>

<p>An excerpt from the interview was shared on X with the caption, "This man wasn't allowed to board the plane that just crashed in Vinhedo in Sao Paulo, Brazil because he was LATE. He argued with the man at the boarding gate but ended up hugging him after hearing the plane had crashed. This is unbelievable."</p>

<p>Adriano said the airline employee who stopped him from boarding the flight saved his life. He said a confusion over his flight details got him late for boarding. When the staff refused to let him on the flight, he "argued with him and so on, and that was it. And he saved my life."</p>

<p>According to the flight manifest, the aircraft was intended to carry 58 passengers. The 58th passenger to never make it onboard was Adriano Assis. He added that after finding out about the accident, he searched for the airline employee and hugged him.</p>

<p>"I hugged him because he's done his job. If he hadn't done his job, maybe I wouldn't be doing this interview today. I spoke out of anger, but this chap, I don't even know his name, he really saved my life," he said.</p>

<p>Several videos of the Voepass ATR 72 turboprop spinning out of control and slamming into a gated community in Vinhedo, some 80 km northwest of Sao Paulo, went viral on social media yesterday. All those who were on board -- 57 passengers and four crew members -- died. No deaths were reported on the ground, according to authorities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The chief justice of Bangladesh's top court agreed to resign "in principle" following intense pressure from protesters surrounding the Supreme Court, broadcaster Jamuna TV reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hassan, appointed last year and seen as a loyalist to ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, faced an ultimatum from demonstrators demanding his resignation. The protests, part of the wider unrest that led to Hasina's departure, have resulted in over 450 deaths, including dozens of police officers.</p>

<p>The police union has declared a strike, refusing to return to work until their safety is assured, further complicating the situation.</p>

<p>Bangladesh's interim leader Muhammad Yunus appealed for religious unityas he embraced the weeping mother of a student shot dead by police, a flashpoint in mass protests that ended Sheikh Hasina's 15-year rule.</p>

<p>Hasina has been sheltering in New Delhi since Monday and plans to return to the country and take part in elections.</p>

<p>Many homes and businesses of the country's minority Hindu community have also been vandalised this week, prompting hundreds of them in northwest Bangladesh to try and flee to neighbouring India.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI says it is concerned that a realistic voice feature for its artificial intelligence might cause people to bond with the bot at the cost of human interactions.</p>

<p>The San Francisco-based company cited literature which it said indicates that chatting with AI as one might with a person can result in misplaced trust and that the high quality of the GPT-4o voice may exacerbate that effect.</p>

<p>"Anthropomorphization involves attributing human-like behaviors and characteristics to nonhuman entities, such as AI models," OpenAI said Thursday in a report on safety work it is doing on a ChatGPT-4o version of its AI.</p>

<p>"This risk may be heightened by the audio capabilities of GPT-4o, which facilitate more human-like interactions with the model."</p>

<p>OpenAI said it noticed testers speaking to the AI in ways that hinted at shared bonds, such as lamenting aloud that it was their last day together.</p>

<p>It said these instances appear benign but must be studied to see how they might evolve over longer periods of time.</p>

<p>Socializing with AI could also make users less adept or inclined when it comes to relationships with humans, OpenAI speculated.</p>

<p>"Extended interaction with the model might influence social norms," the report said.</p>

<p>"For example, our models are deferential, allowing users to interrupt and 'take the mic' at any time, which, while expected for an AI, would be anti-normative in human interactions."</p>

<p>The ability for AI to remember details while conversing and to tend to tasks could also make people over-reliant on the technology, according to OpenAI.</p>

<p>"The recent concerns shared by OpenAI around potential dependence on ChatGPT's voice mode indicate what many have already begun asking: Is it time to pause and consider how this technology affects human interaction and relationships?" said Alon Yamin, co-founder and CEO of AI anti-plagiarism detection platform Copyleaks.</p>

<p>He said AI should never be a replacement for actual human interaction.</p>

<p>OpenAI said it will further test how voice capabilities in its AI might cause people to become emotionally attached.</p>

<p>Teams testing ChatGPT-4o voice capabilities were also able to prompt it to repeat false information and produce conspiracy theories, raising concerns the AI model could be told to do so convincingly.</p>

<p>OpenAI was forced to apologize to actress Scarlett Johansson in June for using something very similar to her voice in its latest chatbot, throwing a spotlight on voice-cloning tech.</p>

<p>Although OpenAI denied the voice they used was Johansson's, their case was not helped by CEO Sam Altman flagging the new model with a one-word message on social media -- "Her".</p>

<p>Johansson voiced an AI character in the film "Her", which Altman has previously said is his favorite film about technology.</p>

<p>The 2013 film stars Joaquin Phoenix as a man who falls in love with an AI assistant named Samantha.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Susan Wojcicki, once a key figure in Google's history, died after a two-year battle with cancer, Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai informed on Saturday.</p>

<p>Wojcicki played a foundational role in shaping YouTube's trajectory.</p>

<p>“Unbelievably saddened by the loss of my dear friend @SusanWojcicki after two years of living with cancer. She is as core to the history of Google as anyone, and it's hard to imagine the world without her,” Mr Pichai posted on X social media platform.</p>

<p>Mr Pichai said she was an incredible person, leader and friend who had a tremendous impact on the world.</p>

<p>“I am one of countless Googlers who is better for knowing her. We will miss her dearly. Our thoughts with her family. RIP Susan,” the Google CEO posted.</p>

<p>She was one of Google's earliest employees and had received a 'Google Founders Award' for making AdSense, which helped tremendously in Google's advertising.</p>

<p>Her tenure as CEO of YouTube saw the platform's growth into a global powerhouse, impacting millions of content creators and billions of viewers.</p>

<p>Wojcicki's legacy is not only in the products sector she helped develop but also in her advocacy for women in tech, making her a role model for aspiring leaders worldwide.</p>

<p>Indian-American Neal Mohan was appointed the new YouTube CEO after Wojcicki in February 2023 announced to step down after 25 years at the Google-owned company.</p>

<p>Wojcicki managed marketing, co-created Google Image Search, led Google's first Video and Book search, as well as early parts of AdSense's creation, worked on the YouTube and DoubleClick acquisitions and served as SVP of Ads.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Simone Biles and MyKayla Skinner, the two teammates during the 2016 Rio and the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, have been embroiled in a major feud recently. It all started after Skinner questioned the work ethic and dedication of the US Olympic squad for the 2024 Paris Olympics.</p>

<p>The two former teammates have been at daggers drawn after Skinner targeted the four members of Team USA at the ongoing games: Suni Lee, Jordan Chiles, Jade Carey and Hezly Rivera.<br />
<br />
<b>MyKayla Skinner criticises Team USA</b><br />
<br />
Skinner made negative comments about Team USA after its Olympic qualifiers in June earlier this year. In a July 3 video, she stated that she felt the team didn't work as hard as previous gymnasts.</p>

<p>"Besides Simone, I feel like the talent and the depth just isn't like what it used to be," Skinner said in the video posted on YouTube. While the video was soon deleted, it has since captured major attention on social media platform X.</p>

<p>She added, "I just notice like, I mean, obviously a lot of girls don't work as hard. The girls just don't have the work ethic."</p>

<p>Skinner further blamed SafeSport, the independent organisation working towards increasing safety and preventing athlete abuse.</p>

<p><b>Skinner apologises for negative comments</b></p>

<p>Many from the gymnastics world, including Biles, heavily criticised Skinner for her remarks. Biles seemingly addressed her on Instagram Threads and wrote, “Not everyone needs a mic and a platform.”</p>

<p>Amid criticism, Skinner shared an apology video on her Instagram Stories and claimed her comments were “misinterpreted.”</p>

<p>She further explained a lot of things she said were not "always necessarily about the current team because I love and support all the girls that made it and I'm so proud of them."</p>

<p>"It was more about going back into my own gym, just the work ethic is different compared to when we were doing gymnastics in the Márta era," she said, adding that she was "not sticking up for Márta or saying what she did was good, I'm just saying it was different."</p>

<p>In conclusion, she apologised to the current team and said she was “seriously so happy for them”.</p>

<p>In a statement to People magazine last month, she said, "Upon reflection I was comparing the 'Marta Era' to the current era. I am coming to terms that I have not fully dealt with the emotional and verbal abuse I endured under Marta that perhaps led to my hurtful comments. I take full responsibility for what I said and I deeply apologise."</p>

<p><b>Biles takes a jibe at Skinner</b></p>

<p>Soon after Team USA won the gold medal in the team all-around competition at the 2024 Paris Olympics, Biles shared photographs of herself with other teammates and wrote, "lack of talent, lazy, olympic champions".</p>

<p>As the post went viral, the comments section was soon flooded with support.</p>

<p>'Heartbroken' Skinner blocks Biles</p>

<p>A day after the post by Biles, she revealed that Skinner had blocked her on Instagram.</p>

<p>"Pop I've been blocked," she wrote while sharing a few emojis.</p>

<p>Nearly a week later, Skinner returned to the social media platform and posted a 4-minute-long video, making a direct request to Biles to ask her followers to avoid attacking Skinner and her family -- including her infant daughter Charlotte.</p>

<p>"Only Simone had responded and she told me that she was proud of me," Skinner said, adding that if Biles "truly believes" that she thinks the team is "lazy and lacking talent," then she was "really heartbroken over it."</p>

<p>She further claimed that Biles' post "fueled another wave of hateful comments," that led towards death threats to her and her family.</p>

<p>"To Simone, I am asking you directly and publicly to please put a stop to this... Please ask your followers to stop," Skinner said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Chief Justice of Bangladesh, Obaidul Hassan, resigned today following massive protests by students who surrounded the Supreme Court. Mr Hassan agreed to resign "in principle" after an ultimatum to do so from protesters. He was appointed to helm the Supreme Court last year and is seen as a loyalist to ousted premier Sheikh Hasina.</p>

<p>Hundreds of protesters, largely comprising students, surrounded the Bangladesh Supreme Court, demanding the immediate resignation of Chief Justice. The situation escalated rapidly, with reports suggesting the Chief Justice fled the premises before announcing his resignation.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bangladesh-chief-justice-says-will-resign-after-massive-student-protests-6306355">Bangladesh protests</a> were sparked by a full-court meeting called by the Chief Justice without consulting the newly formed interim government. Student protestors alleged that the judges of the court are part of a conspiracy, prompting outrage and demands for accountability.</p>

<p>As tensions mounted, the scheduled full-court meeting was abruptly called off. Protestors, undeterred, continued to besiege the Supreme Court, giving the Chief Justice a one-hour ultimatum to step down.</p>

<p>The fresh protests come days after a student-led uprising against government hiring rules resulted in Nobel peace prize winner Muhammad Yunus taking charge of a caretaker government.</p>

<p>At least 450 people were killed in more than a month of deadly protests that ended the autocratic rule of 76-year-old prime minister Sheikh Hasina.</p>

<p>Hasina faces allegations of murder, forced disappearance, money laundering and corruption, and must face the law, Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury, a senior member of Bangladesh Nationalist Party said.</p>

<p>Hasina, one of Asia's longest-serving leaders, resigned and fled Bangladesh on August 5 under pressure from millions of protesters who had taken to the streets for weeks to demand she step down.</p>

<p>An interim government was appointed in Bangladesh Thursday, led by Nobel Prize-winning economist Muhammad Yunus. Under the constitution, an election needs to be called within 90 days, although Yunus, the military - which backs the interim government - and the president haven't commented on when elections will be held.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fugitive Catalan separatist leader Carles Puigdemont said Friday he had left Spain for Belgium after briefly addressing supporters in Barcelona, sparking a row over how he evaded arrest again.</p>

<p>"Today I am in Waterloo after an extremely difficult few days," he wrote in Catalan on X, formerly Twitter, referring to the Belgian town where he has spent most of the past seven years.</p>

<p>Puigdemont, who fled abroad after leading a failed 2017 independence bid for Catalonia, defied an arrest warrant to return to Spain on Thursday.</p>

<p>He delivered a speech to thousands gathered at the Catalan regional parliament in Barcelona before slipping away.</p>

<p>The 61-year-old had been expected to try to enter the parliament building for a vote to pick a new leader for the wealthy northeastern region. Instead, he disappeared into the crowd.</p>

<p>His lawyer, Gonzalo Boye, and the secretary general of Puigdemont's hardline separatist JxCAT party, Josep Turull, had both told Catalan radio earlier Friday that he had headed back to Belgium.</p>

<p>But Eduard Sallent, head of Catalonia's regional police, the Mossos d'Esquadra, said Friday he had not ruled out that Puigdemont might still be in Barcelona.</p>

<h3><strong>Police manhunt&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Catalonia's regional police launched a manhunt for Puigdemont after Thursday's appearance, insisting in a statement issued after he evaded them that there had been no collusion with him.</p>

<p>Officers had planned to arrest him "at the most opportune time so as not to generate public disorder", the force said.</p>

<p>Two officers were arrested on Thursday, including one who owned the car he had used to leave the scene. Released after a few hours, they are still accused of having helped Puigdemont.</p>

<p>The force told AFP on Friday that a third officer had now been arrested over the incident.</p>

<p>Supreme Court judge Pablo Llarena, who issued the arrest warrant for Puigdemont, on Friday demanded the names of the officers who approved the operation to arrest Puigdemont.</p>

<p>He also wanted the names of those "entrusted with its execution or operational deployment", according to a court document.</p>

<p>Sallent said his force had been ready to arrest Puigdemont near the regional parliament, but he did not go there as had been expected.</p>

<p>"The events unfolded very quickly," he said, adding Puigdemont was "surrounded by a crowd of people and authorities" with the "aim of obstructing the action of the police".</p>

<p>Puigdemont led the regional government in 2017 when it carried out an independence referendum despite a court ban.</p>

<p>A short-lived declaration of independence sparked Spain's worst political crisis since the country returned to democracy following the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975.</p>

<p>Puigdemont fled Spain shortly after the failed independence bid to avoid prosecution and has since lived in Belgium and more recently France.</p>

<p>While Spain's parliament passed an amnesty law in May for those involved in the secession bid, the Supreme Court ruled on July 1 that the measure would not fully apply to Puigdemont.</p>

<h3><strong>'Unspeakable'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Puigdemont's latest escape has brought political recriminations,</p>

<p>The head of Spain's main opposition Popular Party, Alberto Nunez Feijoo, said the interior and defence ministers should be dismissed for the "police negligence" that allowed Puigdemont to evade arrest.</p>

<p>"What happened yesterday is unspeakable and cannot go unpunished," he wrote on social network X.</p>

<p>But Justice Minister Felix Bolanos said the operation to arrest Puigdemont "was the responsibility of the Mossos", whose job it was to enforce court orders in Catalonia.</p>

<p>"In Spain the law must be respected and court orders must be complied with," the minister said.</p>

<p>Catalonia's parliament on Thursday elected Salvador Illa of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's Socialists as Catalonia's first head not from the pro-independence movement since 2010.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Malkinson, who spent 17 years wrongfully imprisoned, will see a deduction of 100,000 pounds (Rs 1,06,88,639) from his compensation.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The British government has informed victims of historic miscarriages of justice-theoretically, including Andrew Malkinson-that they will now have to meet "bed and board" costs for the period spent in prison, according to the <em>BBC</em>. According to the decision, compensation payments made to those wrongfully jailed will be reduced by these expenses.</p>

<p>One of these victims is Andrew Malkinson, who spent 17 years in prison for the false conviction of raping a woman in Salford, Greater Manchester, in 2003. He will see deductions of 100,000 pounds (Rs 1,06,88639) from his compensation to pay for these costs, despite having since been cleared, according to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy31pk1w0lo"><em>news outlet</em></a>. It was revealed that former Justice Secretary Alex Chalk axed the previous policy, which allowed such deductions, last year. However, the new ruling reverses this change, placing a financial burden on individuals who have already suffered significant injustices.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/uk-man-comes-out-17-years-after-wrong-rape-conviction-kidnapped-by-state-4248062"><strong>Also Read | UK Man Comes Out 17 Years After Wrong Rape Conviction: "Kidnapped By State"</strong></a></p>

<p>According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy31pk1w0lo">the BBC</a>,</em> Mr Malkinson, whose case sparked the policy change, served nearly two decades in prison for a rape he did not commit and was formally cleared by the Court of Appeal last July.</p>

<p>He has called for an overhaul of the jury and appeals system to give wrongly convicted people more protection. Mr Malkinson said that even with the living costs rule removed, he expected to wait two years for any compensation while the independent board, which determined how much he was entitled to, made its decision.</p>

<p>Calling for the system to be speeded up and requirements to be simplified, he said: "It's a silly barrier that's been artificially erected. It's inexcusable. It's not justified."</p>

<p>A House of Commons library document from 2015 describes compensation as "the exception rather than the rule" in miscarriage of justice cases.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ahead of the crucial US presidential elections on November 5 this year, "The Mandate for Leadership 2025: The Conservative Promise," a policy wishlist by the 2025 Presidential Transition Project or simply called 'Project 2025' is making waves in the country.<br />
<br />
"The project is the effort of a broad coalition of conservative organisations that have come together to ensure a successful administration begins in January 2025," according to its official website.<br />
<br />
Since 1980, The Heritage Foundation has published a book of policy recommendations for the next Republican administration, The Washington Post stated.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
For this election cycle, it has convened a coalition of over 100 right-wing groups, presenting its controversial proposals as a movement consensus under the banner of 'Project 2025'. According to reports, this coalition involved at least 140 Trump administration alumni.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The 900-page policy book was published in April last year, proposing a total overhaul of the executive branch.<br />
<br />
<b>Project 2025 makes the following suggestions&nbsp;</b><br />
<br />
It's asking for securing the border, finishing the wall, and deportation of "illegal aliens".<br />
<br />
It calls for de-weaponising the Federal Government via more accountability and "oversight of the FBI and DOJ".<br />
<br />
Unleash American energy production to reduce energy prices.<br />
<br />
To reduce inflation, Project 2025 suggests cutting the growth of government spending.<br />
<br />
Make federal bureaucrats more accountable to the democratically elected President and Congress.<br />
<br />
Improve education by moving control and funding of education from DC bureaucrats directly to parents and state and local governments.<br />
<br />
Project 2025 also suggests banning "biological males from competing in women's sports".<br />
<br />
<b>Is Project 2025 linked to Donald Trump?</b><br />
<br />
Donald Trump shared a private flight with the head of the organisation behind Project 2025 in April 2022 and was said to have been briefed on the controversial policy agenda, The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/08/07/trump-heritage-project-2025-roberts/">Washington Post</a> reported.<br />
<br />
While Trump has on multiple occasions denied knowing about its policy blueprint or even those behind it, the former US president shared the 45-minute private flight with Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts, people familiar with the trip told the leading US daily.<br />
<br />
Together, Trump and Roberts flew from the former US president's home in Palm Beach, Florida to the foundation's annual conference on Amelia Island, where the 78-year-old delivered a keynote address that pointed out Heritage's forthcoming policy proposals, the report stated.<br />
<br />
Back then, the organisation was in the early stages of organising Project 2025. During the flight, Roberts brought up the matter with Trump, but he seemed uninterested and moved on to a different subject, a Heritage official said.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
However, an official of the Trump campaign stated that he didn't discuss Project 2025 on the plane with Roberts, who took over day-to-day management of the controversial agenda recently after the departure of director Paul Dans.<br />
<br />
In July this year, Trump decried it on his Truth Social platform and said that he had “nothing to do with them”. Further, he called some of its projected ideas “absolutely ridiculous and abysmal”.<br />
<br />
Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said, "Project 2025 has never and will never be an accurate reflection of President Trump's policies”.<br />
<br />
Leavitt noted that Trump's 20 promises to the forgotten men and women and the RNC platform are "the only policies endorsed by President Trump for a second term."<br />
<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>King Charles III made his first comments on Friday about riots that have shaken British cities, praising the work of police in countering the violence.</p>

<p>While the monarch and Queen Camilla conveyed their condolences to the families of three girls killed in a mass stabbing on July 29, Buckingham Palace had not commented on the near-daily riots which followed.</p>

<p>The king praised British police and emergency services "for all they are doing to restore peace in those areas that have been affected by violent disorder", according to a Buckingham Palace spokesperson.</p>

<p>He hoped the "shared values of mutual respect and understanding will continue to strengthen and unite the nation", the spokesperson added.</p>

<p>Many observers had been watching to see if the king, who is on his annual summer holiday in Scotland, would end his noticeable silence on the disturbances.</p>

<p>Hundreds of people have been arrested in the near-nightly unrest that hit cities across England and in Northern Ireland and which authorities have blamed on far-right agitators.</p>

<p>Officials say the rioters took advantage of the killings of the girls in the northwestern English coastal town of Southport to launch racist and Islamophobic protests. The suspect accused of the killings was born in Britain.</p>

<p>Traditionally, the monarch does not comment on anything that could cause political controversy.</p>

<p>But in calls with Prime Minister Keir Starmer and police chiefs, the king said he had been "greatly encouraged" by the reaction "that countered the aggression and criminality from a few with the compassion and resilience of the many".</p>

<p>While extra police have been put on standby, there have been many counter-demonstrations in cities where far-right protests had been planned.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'Perilous moment'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>His call for unity followed a silence that had concerned some royal watchers.</p>

<p>"I am surprised that the king as head of state hasn't come out more forcefully, given that it's a perilous moment for the United Kingdom," historian and royal commentator Ed Owens said before the statement's release.</p>

<p>According to constitutional law expert Craig Prescott, however, "the monarchy does not comment on current political events". The late Queen Elizabeth II remained similarly quiet during the last wave of riots which shook England in 2011.</p>

<p>"Once the riots have subsided, you might expect members of the royal family to visit places affected and perhaps to see them more in multicultural settings," Prescott said in a post on the X social media platform.</p>

<p>"If the king speaks out about this, then what about the next big issue and the one after that."</p>

<p>Owens argued that Charles, who has gradually resumed public duties after a cancer diagnosis earlier this year, may not have publicly reacted for two main reasons.</p>

<p>He may have been "advised by his government that it would be unwise at this stage" to intervene directly.</p>

<p>And the monarch might himself have deemed the issue too "combustible". The question of "illegal migration" is politically divisive and sensitive in Britain, said Owens.</p>

<p>But as heir to the throne, Charles made known his opposition to the previous government's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda.</p>

<p>And the king has been more vocal about topics such as climate change over the years. Since becoming the monarch he is seen as having presented himself as more accessible than his predecessors, including by opening up about his health.</p>

<p>But for Graham Smith, head of Republic, a pressure group which campaigns for an elected UK head of state to replace the monarch, the lack of a response to the riots showed that the monarchy is an institution "for someone who isn't able to speak really".</p>

<p>According to media reports, quoting palace sources, the king has asked for a daily update on the crisis.</p>

<p>But Smith said: "There's no value in a billionaire sitting in his holiday home being updated about what's happening. I mean, it's easy to be updated -- switch the TV on."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An airplane with 57 passengers and four crew members on board crashed in Brazil's Sao Paulo, killing everyone on board. Images and videos from the spot show that the crash left flaming wreckage in a residential neighborhood.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Videos shared on social media showed the plane suddenly dropping from the sky, spiraling as it fell. It remains unclear how the accident occurred, VoePass airlines said in a statement. The last known tracking by FlightRadar24 of the plane was when it was at 4,100 feet and was approaching Sao Paulo.</p>

<p>Eyewitnesses described the heart-stopping moment scene as the ATR 72-500 aircraft plummeted almost vertically, spinning out of control before falling in a residential area.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Truck driver Martins Barbosa, 49, was working when he learned of the plane crash, which occurred 150 meters from his home.</p>

<p>"I thought it might have fallen on my house, with my son inside," he told AFP, adding he felt despondent before learning his family was okay.</p>

<p>Nathalie Cicari, who lives near the crash site, told CNN Brasil the impact was "terrifying."</p>

<p>"I was having lunch, I heard a very loud noise very close by," she said, describing the sound as drone-like but "much louder."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I went out on the balcony and saw the plane spinning. Within seconds, I realized that it was not a normal movement for a plane."</p>

<p>Cicari was not hurt but had to evacuate her house, which was filled with black smoke from the crash.</p>

<p>"I arrived at the scene and saw many bodies on the ground -- many of them," another witness, Ricardo Rodrigues, told local Band News.</p>

<p>The cause of the crash remains unknown, and investigations are underway. VoePass, one of Brazil's oldest operating airlines, has pledged cooperation with authorities to determine the circumstances surrounding the accident.</p>

<p>The ATR 72 model, manufactured by Airbus and Leonardo SpA, generally boasts a good safety record. However, this incident marks one of the deadliest aviation disasters this year.</p>

<p>Recovery efforts continue, with identification of the victims' remains ongoing. The black box has been recovered, which will aid investigators in their inquiry.</p>

<p>VoePass initially said that 62 passengers and crew had been on the aircraft before updating the figure to 61.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia on Friday deployed more troops and munitions to a border region where Ukraine has mounted a major ground offensive, the defence ministry said.</p>

<p>Ukraine said meanwhile that a Russian strike on a supermarket in the east of its territory had killed 14 people.</p>

<p>Ukrainian troops launched a surprise offensive into Russia's western Kursk region on Tuesday, in the most significant attack across the border since Moscow invaded in February 2022.</p>

<p>Russia's defence ministry said it was sending rocket launchers, artillery, tanks and heavy trucks to reinforce its defences in the region, state media reported.</p>

<p>Around 1,000 Ukrainian troops and more than two dozen armoured vehicles and tanks were involved in the initial attack, said Moscow, though it later claimed to have destroyed many more pieces of equipment.</p>

<p>While Ukraine has not officially confirmed the offensive, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday that Russia needed to "feel" the consequences of its invasion.</p>

<p>On Friday, both sides stepped up aerial attacks behind the frontlines.</p>

<p>A Russian missile strike on a supermarket and post office in the east Ukrainian town of Kostyantynivka killed at least 14 people and wounded 43, Ukraine's general prosecutor said.</p>

<p>The town is about 13 kilometres (eight miles) from the nearest Russian positions.</p>

<p>"Russia will be held accountable for this terror," Zelensky said in a post on Telegram.</p>

<h3><strong>'The war has come to us'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Ukraine's offensive into the Kursk region appeared to catch Russia off guard.</p>

<p>Influential Russian military bloggers have blasted army leaders for failing to spot or quash the incursion.</p>

<p>Senior Ukrainian officials have not commented although Zelensky alluded to the attack on Thursday.</p>

<p>"Everyone can see that the Ukraine army knows how to surprise and knows how to achieve results," he said.</p>

<p>Moscow has not presented detailed information on the extent of the advance.</p>

<p>It said Friday it had struck Ukrainian positions on the western edge of Sudzha, a town around eight kilometres (five miles) from the border that appeared to be the focus of Kyiv's offensive.</p>

<p>Several Russian media shared a video purporting to show Sudzha residents appealing to President Vladimir Putin for help, warning that many were unable to evacuate.</p>

<p>"In a few hours our town was turned into ruins ... Our relatives are left behind, we can't call them, and there is no communication. Please help us get our land back," one resident said in the video.</p>

<p>Thousands have been evacuated from the border region, with Russia putting on an extra train to Moscow from the regional capital, Kursk.</p>

<p>At a train station in Moscow, AFP journalists saw families disembarking with children.</p>

<p>"The war has come to us, so all the relatives have gone to Moscow," AFP heard a woman with her young daughter saying at the station.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;<strong>'Rapid advance'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"Ukrainian forces are reportedly present in areas as far as 35 kilometres from the international border," said the independent US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) in its daily assessment drawing on geolocated videos and photos.</p>

<p>But those troops "most certainly do not control" that entire area, it added.</p>

<p>Putin has called the incursion a "large-scale provocation" by Kyiv, and Russia's top general has vowed to crush it.</p>

<p>On the first day of the assault, Kursk regional governor Alexei Smirnov said five civilians had been killed.</p>

<p>The health ministry said Thursday that 66 people had been wounded. Twelve were hospitalised in a serious condition, it said Friday.</p>

<p>Ukraine on Friday expanded its own evacuation zone in the Sumy region, just across the border from Kursk. "About 20,000 people need to be evacuated" from 28 settlements, Ukraine's police force said.</p>

<p>Ukraine also said it had carried out a major air strike on a Russian military base in the Lipetsk region, around 280 kilometres (175 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border.</p>

<p>It said it had struck "warehouses containing guided aerial bombs and a number of other facilities".</p>

<p>The International Atomic Energy Agency issued a statement warning both sides of the dangers as the fighting neared the Kursk nuclear power plant.</p>

<p>"I would like to appeal to all sides to exercise maximum restraint in order to avoid a nuclear accident with the potential for serious radiological consequences," said IAEA chief Rafael Grossi.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump's plane was diverted on Friday (local time) to Billings, due to a mechanical issue, CBS News reported citing airport officials.</p>

<p>Trump's plane suffered the technical snag, details of which are unconfirmed as of now, ahead of a scheduled rally in Montana's Bozeman.</p>

<p>The former US President is slated to hold the rally on Friday night (local time). It was supposed to begin at 8 pm local time, or 10 pm ET. However, his private plane landed in Billings Friday afternoon, Billings-Logan International Airport said in a statement.</p>

<p>Notably, Bozeman is about 150 miles west of Billings.</p>

<p>The airport stated that Trump's plane "landed without incident," and added that he had departed for Bozeman on another private plane, according to CBS News.</p>

<p>This is Trump's first rally of the week; his rivals, Gov. Tim Walz and Vice President Kamala Harris, as well as running mate Sen. JD Vance, have been travelling across important battleground states.</p>

<p>Trump was shot during his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, less than a month ago. Since Bill Clinton won the state's presidential contest in 1992, Montana is seen as a safe Republican state.</p>

<p>However, the goal of Trump's visit is to help Republican Senate candidate Tim Sheehy defeat Democratic incumbent Sen. Jon Tester, who is running for re-election in November, reported CBS News.</p>

<p>Trump launched his bid to reclaim the White House in November 2022.</p>

<p>He aims to reclaim the White House after his bitter exit in 2020, as he looks forward to becoming only the second commander-in-chief to win two non-consecutive terms in office.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gaza's civil defence agency said Saturday an Israeli strike hit a school in Gaza City, killing 90-100 people, while the Israeli military said it had struck a Hamas command centre.</p>

<p>"Forty martyrs and dozens wounded after the Israeli bombing of the Al-Taba'een school in the Al-Sahaba area in Gaza City," agency spokesman Mahmoud Basal said in a post on Telegram.</p>

<p>Basal described the incident as "a horrific massacre", with some bodies catching fire.</p>

<p>"The crews are trying to control the fire to retrieve the bodies of the martyrs and rescue the wounded," he said.</p>

<p>Israel's army said Saturday it had "precisely struck Hamas terrorists operating within a Hamas command and control center embedded in the Al-Taba'een school".</p>

<p>On Thursday, the agency said Israeli strikes had hit two schools in Gaza City, killing more than 18 people.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said at the time it had struck Hamas command centres.</p>

<p>The war in Gaza began with Hamas's October 7 attack that resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Palestinian operatives seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 39 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,699 people, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.</p>

<p>Israel has vowed to destroy the Palestinian group in retaliation for its October attack, but during 10 months of war across the Gaza Strip, the military has found itself returning to some areas to fight the militants again.</p>

<p>Israel's military on Friday said troops were operating around Khan Yunis, the southern Gaza city from which soldiers had withdrawn in April after months of fierce fighting with Hamas.</p>

<p>After the military issued an evacuation order for parts of Khan Yunis, AFPTV images showed a crowd of people flowing through dusty, damaged streets on foot or on donkeys and motorcycle carts piled with belongings.</p>

<p>By Friday, the United Nations Humanitarian Office OCHA estimated that "at least 60,000 Palestinians may have moved towards western Khan Yunis in the past 72 hours", said UN spokeswoman Florencia Soto Nino.</p>

<p>The Gaza war has already pulled in Iran-aligned groups in the region, and fears of a broader Middle East war have surged following vows of vengeance for the killing of two senior militants, including Hamas's political leader.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An inquest will begin next week to investigate the death of a teenage girl who died after suffering a suspected allergic reaction to a hot chocolate purchased from Costa Coffee, according to <em>The Guardian.</em></p>

<p>Thirteen-year-old Hannah Jacobs, of Barking, East London, collapsed and died on February 8 last year following a suspected anaphylactic reaction to the hot chocolate from Costa Coffee.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/aug/09/inquest-to-look-into-13-year-old-girl-who-died-after-drinking-costa-hot-chocolate"><em>The Guardian,</em></a> Hannah and her mother had visited the Costa Coffee shop on the way to a dentist appointment. Despite Hannah's mother warning the barista that Hannah was intolerant of dairy and she should have soy milk, regular milk was in the drink.</p>

<p>Hannah had suffered from a number of food allergies since she was young to things like dairy, eggs, fish, and wheat. When she tasted the hot chocolate, she knew she had been given the wrong milk, and she felt acute distress.</p>

<p>The mother rushed Hannah to a pharmacy for help, where an EpiPen was administered to try and calm the allergic reaction. Emergency services rushed her to the hospital within minutes, but Hannah couldn't be revived and was pronounced dead at 1 pm.</p>

<p>According to<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/schoolgirl-13-dies-after-suffering-severe-allergic-reaction-to-costa-hot-chocola/"><em> LBC news</em></a>, the death of Hannah reminds us of another case-that of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, who died in 2016 from an allergic reaction to sesame seeds in a Pret a Manger baguette. That led the UK government to implement Natasha's Law in 2021, under which firms are compelled to label the allergens used in pre-packaged foods prepared on their premises.</p>

<p>Every year, some 10 people in Britain die from food allergies, while about 5,000 get hospitalised for severe reactions. Some 2.4 million people live with food allergies in the UK.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A man described by prosecutors as one of the "most violent" members of a pro-Donald Trump mob that stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, was sentenced to 20 years in prison on Friday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man described by prosecutors as one of the "most violent" members of a pro-Donald Trump mob that stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, was sentenced to 20 years in prison on Friday.</p>

<p>The sentence handed down to David Dempsey, 37, of Santa Ana, California, is the second longest for any of the nearly 1,500 people charged for their roles in the attack on Congress.</p>

<p>Enrique Tarrio, the former leader of the far-right Proud Boys group, was convicted of seditious conspiracy and sentenced to 22 years in prison.</p>

<p>The assault on the Capitol left at least five people dead and 140 police officers injured.</p>

<p>It followed a fiery speech by then-president Trump to tens of thousands of his supporters near the White House in which he repeated his false claims that he won the 2020 election.</p>

<p>Prosecutors sought a term of nearly 22 years for Dempsey, noting in their sentencing memorandum that the former construction worker and fast-food restaurant employee had an extensive criminal record.</p>

<p>Dempsey pleaded guilty to two counts of assaulting police officers and was sentenced by Senior District Judge Royce Lamberth, an appointee of Republican president Ronald Reagan, to 20 years in prison and three years of supervised release.</p>

<p>Prosecutors, in their memo, called Dempsey "one of the most violent rioters, during one of the most violent stretches of time, at the scene of the most violent confrontations at the Capitol."</p>

<p>"Unlike other rioters who slowly pushed their way through the crowd towards the Capitol, Dempsey climbed atop his fellow rioters, using them like human scaffolding, thrusting himself to the front," they said.</p>

<p>Dempsey used his "hands, feet, flag poles, crutches, pepper spray, broken pieces of furniture, and anything else he could get his hands on, as weapons against the police," they said.</p>

<p>Trump faces four federal felony charges in Washington related to efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, but the case is unlikely to reach trial before the November presidential vote, in which he is once again the Republican candidate.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

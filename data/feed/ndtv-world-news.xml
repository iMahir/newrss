       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to hostile exchanges between prosecutor and felon, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are old hands.</p>

<p>But Tuesday's high-stakes debate will be new territory for the Democratic vice president and her Republican rival, due to meet for the first time in front of a prime-time television audience of millions.</p>

<p>"The striking thing about this debate is, it's the first time in history where we'll see a prosecutor and convicted felon facing off against each other," Andrew Koneschusky, a PR expert and former press secretary for US Senate leader Chuck Schumer, told AFP.</p>

<p>"That's an incredible contrast. I wouldn't expect a lot of intricate policy discussion. I expect we'll see more style than substance."</p>

<p>Students of debating technique identify Trump, who is 78, as an avid proponent of the "Gish Gallop," named for Duane Gish.</p>

<p>Gish, who defended as literally true the Biblical account of the world's creation in six days, would overwhelm opponents with a dizzying torrent of rapid-fire falsehoods, distortions and distractions.</p>

<p>Trump -- who is not known to have a granular grasp of policy -- owes much of his success to this kind of filibustering, as he packs conspiracy theory, anecdote and aside into an arcane, rebuttal-proof word salad.</p>

<p>"It's very hard to debate someone who is quickly changing topics and not fully or truthfully answering the questions," said Flavio Hickel, a politics professor at Maryland liberal arts school Washington College.</p>

<p>But while the "Gish Gallop" may be good at putting opponents on the back foot, it is a risky strategy for someone trying to look presidential, analysts warn.</p>

<h2><strong>'Certainty and strength'</strong></h2>

<p>"As a debater, Trump brings energy, conveys certainty and strength, and never admits error, which translates for many people into presidential qualities," said Donald Nieman, a political analyst and professor at Binghamton University in New York state.</p>

<p>"Of course, they are likely to be coupled with transparent lies, wild exaggerations, unseemly ad hominem attacks and loopy digressions that have the opposite effect, especially on the few undecided voters."</p>

<p>Harris rose to the top of the Democratic ticket after 81-year-old President Joe Biden's dismal debate performance against Trump led to him dropping out of the race amid questions around his advanced years.</p>

<p>Analysts expect the 59-year-old Californian -- "Kamala the Cop" to her admirers -- to lean into her experience as a district attorney and press Trump on his role in the deadly 2021 insurrection at the US Capitol, as well as his multiple criminal cases.</p>

<p>"Harris is a sharp prosecutor," said Keith Gaddie, a politics professor at Texas Christian University.</p>

<p>"She showed her chops debating Biden and others in 2020, and will likely lean into a combination of tricks used by prosecutors to control witnesses, while also cultivating 'jury sympathy.'"</p>

<p>Since Harris's ascension, Democrats' messaging has evolved from presenting Trump as a powerful and existential threat to democracy to minimizing him as "weird" and small.</p>

<p>Koneschusky expects to see more of this in the debate, but warned that Harris faces a balancing act between going after her opponent and using her precious airtime to make her own pitch for the Oval Office.</p>

<h2><strong>Former prosecutor</strong></h2>

<p>"On the one hand, this is a chance for Harris to define herself, and she needs to fully capitalize on that opportunity," he said.</p>

<p>"On the other hand, it's also important that Harris prosecutes the case against Trump in this debate, and she's well-equipped to do so as a former prosecutor. This is something Biden failed to do in the last debate."</p>

<p>One of Harris's standout debate moments came against Biden, ironically, in the 2019-20 Democratic presidential nominating contest, when she took her then-rival to task for his opposition to using federal funds to desegregate schools through busing.</p>

<p>"There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me," Harris said, in a moment that immediately went viral.</p>

<p>But her short-lived 2020 bid for the White House also illustrated weaknesses, as when she allowed herself to be rattled by former Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who savaged Harris over her record as a prosecutor.</p>

<p>Gabbard has switched sides and Trump has been using her in his debate prep.</p>

<p>The use of muted microphones during the Trump debate may meanwhile deprive Harris of another strength -- her ability to shut down rivals when they try to interrupt.</p>

<p>Harris deployed this to full effect when Mike Pence tried to cut her off during their 2020 vice-presidential debate and she stopped him dead with an ice-cold, "Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A Telegram channel with more than 220,000 participants was reportedly being used to create and share these artificial intelligence-generated pornographic images, serving as a global reminder of the darker consequences from the widespread rush of AI.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korea has been rocked by a wave of sexually explicit deepfake images being created and shared online, indiscriminately targeting women and girls using their school photos, social media selfies and even military headshots. A Telegram channel with more than 220,000 participants was reportedly being used to create and share these artificial intelligence-generated pornographic images, serving as a global reminder of the darker consequences from the widespread rush for this technology.</p>

<p>Users could upload photos and in a matter of seconds create explicit content with the faces of their friends, classmates or romantic partners. The initial reporting from local news outlets prompted more women to come forward as victims and more Telegram channels being exposed, revealing the true scale of the issue. Many of the victims involved are minors. Protesters wearing white masks over their eyes gathered in Seoul calling for justice late last month.</p>

<p>As outrage mounted, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol called on his government to crack down on the digital abuse, and authorities said they would form a task force to tackle the issue. While police investigated, another disturbing trend emerged. Preliminary data indicate a vast majority of the suspected perpetrators from the recent wave of cases were in their teens.</p>

<p>"Some may dismiss it as a mere prank, but it is clearly a criminal act that exploits technology under the shield of anonymity," Yoon said during a cabinet meeting late last month, acknowledging that many of both the victims and perpetrators were minors.</p>

<p>Yoon is right. This isn't just a prank, and the impact of this type of digital sexual violence can be devastating for victims. A lot of the blame is rightly being placed on Telegram, especially as the scandal is coming to a head at the same time as the platform's Chief Executive Officer Pavel Durov has been arrested and charged in France for alleged complicity in crimes, including the sharing of child pornography, committed on his app. Korean authorities said Telegram is cooperating with the investigation and requests to remove content.</p>

<p>But Yoon's words will ring hollow for some, given he came to power in 2022 courting young male voters with proposals to scrap the gender equality ministry, which he accused of treating men like "potential sex criminals." He also claimed that systemic gender discrimination does not exist in South Korea, and implied feminism was to blame for the country's low birth rate. Meanwhile, women earn some 30% less than their male counterparts, marking the highest gender wage gap in the developed world. Even in dual-income households, women bear the brunt of housework and childcare responsibilities.</p>

<p>And before the recent crop of AI tools made generating deepfake explicit images much easier, advocacy groups had been drawing attention to a rash of digital sex crimes, usually involving non-consensual intimate images or hidden cameras.</p>

<p>There is a host of reasons that South Korean women, like their counterparts across the developed world, are choosing not to have children, including rising participation in the labor force and the uneven toll of raising children. Rather than blame feminism, it might be more useful to look at this mountain of deeply troubling data. Ironically, one of the main Telegram groups spreading these images reportedly had some 227,000 members - that's roughly on par with the number of babies born last year.</p>

<p>South Korean women are boldly bringing this issue to light with protests and activism, the first step in enacting change for a crisis that is impacting people around the globe. Compared to other jurisdictions, the nation is also ahead of the curve when it comes to regulating deepfake porn. It actually has laws in place, including punishments of up to five years in prison and fines for people convicted of creating images with the intent to distribute. In the US, federal legislation has garnered bipartisan support among lawmakers but is still making its way at a snail's pace through Congress.</p>

<p>Regulation is important, but the cases in Korea also expose how difficult enforcement can be for such a widespread problem, as well as how easy it is for this content to be created and shared in the first place. Expanding laws to make it illegal to possess such material could help. But this still puts a lot of responsibility on victims to digitally trace back who created the content that upended their lives.</p>

<p>The Telegram CEO's recent arrest shows there's increased global momentum to hold tech companies accountable for their role in harms taking place on their platforms. This is a step in the right direction; as more regulators shift responsibility to these powerful companies, more industry-led solutions would be welcome. Universities and research centers are developing some promising tools to protect images from AI manipulation. But not enough resources are being devoted to ensuring the responsible rollout of AI from the industry creating it.</p>

<p>More onus must be put on tech companies to come up with proactive solutions. Many tech giants have pulled back on ethical and responsible AI teams in recent years amid broader cost-cutting. But the dignity of women and girls isn't something that should be sacrificed in favor of profit.</p>

<p>South Korea is the current epicenter of this crisis. But it is a global issue that can impact anyone from celebrities like Taylor Swift to middle school girls from Seoul to New Jersey. The tech sector cannot keep skirting responsibility much longer.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Two British women have accused controversial social media influencer Andrew Tate of "rape" and "strangulation", the BBC reported.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two British women have accused controversial social media influencer Andrew Tate of “rape” and “strangulation”, the BBC reported. Andrew Tate and his brother, Tristan, are facing charges of human trafficking and sexual exploitation in Romania. If convicted, the brothers could face jail for over 10 years. Both of them deny the charges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Andrew Tate, currently under house arrest in Romania, is already under investigation for multiple charges, including sex with a minor and human trafficking of underage individuals. New allegations, including testimonies from British women who claim they were attacked by the Tate brothers in the UK before the Romania case began, have also emerged.</p>

<p>“Anna,” not her real name, says she dated Andrew Tate in 2013. She recalls him threatening her before raping and strangling her. “He just looked at me and said, ‘I'm debating whether I should rape you or not,'” she told the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyje823er4o ">BBC</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tate later sent her disturbing messages about enjoying the violence he inflicted. “The more you didn't like it, the more I enjoyed it,” he said in a voice note to the victim. He also wrote in a text message, “I love raping you.”</p>

<p>Another woman, “Sienna,” says she met Tate in 2014 and was strangled to unconsciousness during sex. “I was absolutely terrified,” she told BBC. “I just remember gasping for air... It was rape.” He kept raping her even after she regained consciousness, she said.</p>

<p>She woke up with a bloodshot eye the next day, a common symptom of strangulation in domestic abuse cases. A friend of Sienna's corroborated her account, stating she told him about the incident at the time and he saw her eye injury.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The two women's allegations follow a series of other similar claims. Many women say Tate used manipulation and control to trap them in abusive situations.</p>

<p>The Tate brothers have faced growing legal challenges, including trafficking and exploitation charges in Romania, where prosecutors say women were transported from the UK for sexual exploitation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite numerous accusations, Andrew Tate denies ever hurting anyone, claiming in a 2023 BBC interview that he never engaged in non-consensual acts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Night owls -- a person who is habitually active or wakeful at night -- tend to have a higher body mass index (BMI), larger waists, and more hidden body fat and thus are almost 50 per cent more likely to develop type 2 diabetes (T2D).]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Night owls -- a person who is habitually active or wakeful at night -- tend to have a higher body mass index (BMI), larger waists, and more hidden body fat and thus are almost 50 per cent more likely to develop type 2 diabetes (T2D) than those who go to bed earlier, shows new research on Monday.</p>

<p>Previous studies have indicated that late chronotype -- people who prefer to go to bed late and wake up late -- live an unhealthy lifestyle, and are at higher risk of obesity and metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes.</p>

<p>The new study showed that a late chronotype had a 46 per cent higher risk of developing diabetes, which suggests that the increased risk of T2D can't be explained by lifestyle alone.</p>

<p>"We believe that other mechanisms are also at play," said lead researcher Dr. Jeroen van der Velde, from Leiden University Medical Centre, in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>"A likely explanation is that the circadian rhythm or body clock in late chronotypes is out of sync with the work and social schedules followed by society. This can lead to circadian misalignment, which we know can lead to metabolic disturbances and ultimately type 2 diabetes," van der Velde added.</p>

<p>To explore, the team studied the association between sleep timing, diabetes, and body fat distribution in more than 5,000 individuals who were divided into three groups: early chronotype (20 per cent), late chronotype (20 per cent), and intermediate chronotype (60 per cent).</p>

<p>The team measured all participants' BMI and waist circumference, while visceral fat and liver fat were measured in 1,526 participants, using MRI scans and MR spectroscopy, respectively.</p>

<p>About 225 were diagnosed with diabetes after a follow-up of 6.6 years.</p>

<p>Late chronotypes were found to be at higher risk of developing diabetes, had a 0.7 kg/m2 higher BMI, 1.9 cm larger waist circumference, 7 cm2 more visceral fat, and 14 per cent higher liver fat content, compared with those with an intermediate chronotype.</p>

<p>More visceral fat and liver fat were responsible for making people with a late chronotype to be at greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes, van der Velde said.</p>

<p>The findings will be presented at the Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) in Madrid, Spain (September 9-13).</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Forget the polls, ditch the data and stop sending journalists to swing-state diners to interview undecided voters: historian Allan Lichtman already knows who is going to win the US presidential election.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Forget the polls, ditch the data and stop sending journalists to swing-state diners to interview undecided voters: historian Allan Lichtman already knows who is going to win the US presidential election. "Harris will win," Lichtman confidently announced to AFP.</p>

<p>He was speaking at his home in the leafy Washington suburb of Bethesda shortly after unveiling his much-discussed, once-every-four-years White House prediction, based on what he calls the "13 keys" method.</p>

<p>It can be easy to dismiss Lichtman's signature methodology as just another gimmick in the endless, drawn-out "horse race" style coverage of US elections -- where journalists, pollsters and pundits are constantly trying to see who is up and who is down.</p>

<p>But the American University history professor has answers for his critics -- and a track record that's hard to beat, having correctly called all but one election since 1984.</p>

<p>Lichtman pays no attention to opinion polls.</p>

<p>Instead, his predictions are based on a series of true-or-false propositions applied to the current presidential administration. If six or more of these "keys" are false, the election will go to the out-of-power challenger -- in this case, Republican candidate Donald Trump.</p>

<h2><strong>Sage of Bethesda?</strong></h2>

<p>One of the keys, for example, posits that the president's party won seats in the most recent midterm elections. The Democrats actually lost control of the House in the 2022 midterms, meaning this particular key is termed "false," tipping the scales toward Trump.</p>

<p>A few more keys break Trump's way: President Joe Biden stepped down, meaning Democrats lost the key which determines the "incumbency," a vital advantage.</p>

<p>Biden's vice president and replacement as nominee, Kamala Harris, is surging on optimism among party faithful. But Lichtman rules that she does not qualify for another of the keys, which is being a charismatic, "once-in-a-generation" candidate in the style of Ronald Reagan or Franklin Roosevelt.</p>

<p>More points to Trump, yes. But after that the keys start breaking in rapid succession for Harris.</p>

<p>For example, the Biden administration's massive environment and infrastructure legislation ticks the box for the key requiring a "major policy change" by the current White House.</p>

<p>Another key for Harris is the exit of fringe independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>

<p>She also satisfies the key demanding lack of major scandal.</p>

<p>Do the math and it turns out that only three keys are falling for Trump. But to be declared the presumptive winner, he would have needed six.</p>

<p>And there's another key which could go Harris's way, if the administration reaches a ceasefire and hostage release in Gaza.</p>

<p>It's a move that would likely require Democrats to push harder against the Israeli government -- sure to cause strain among poll-obsessed advisors in a party trying to straddle a base that is heavily divided over the issue. Yet, a ceasefire would mean the Democrats actually delivered a policy achievement, Lichtman argues, and deliver one of the keys on foreign policy.</p>

<p>"I don't like to speculate, because the devil is in the details, but that could be seen as a big success," he said.</p>

<h2><strong>Forget the 'noise'</strong></h2>

<p>Critics of the "13 keys" home in on the speculative nature of some of the true-false propositions. What is a charismatic leader, for example?</p>

<p>Yet the sage of Bethesda, as some have dubbed him, is well-versed in arguing his case.</p>

<p>"I've been doing this for 40 years. I think I've heard every conceivable question," he said. "'Aren't your keys subjective?' I obviously have an answer to that -- they're not subjective, they're judgmental.</p>

<p>"We're dealing with human beings. Historians make judgments all the time, and the judgments are very tightly constrained."</p>

<p>Amid the "noise" of national political punditry, Lichtman argues, presidential elections are a simple "vote up or down on the strength and performance of the White House party."</p>

<p>In that way, his method is anti-horse race -- focused on good governance rather than campaigns, since in reality "we forget virtually anything a candidate has to say."</p>

<p>The one election where Lichtman's calculations did not predict the president was the 2000 victory of George W. Bush. Lichtman can defend his record by pointing out that this was a legally complicated nail-biter in which Democrat Al Gore won the popular vote but Bush took victory courtesy of a Supreme Court decision.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Manager Alex Middleton told the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2ndnn6zzno"><em>BBC </em></a>that the policy was about finding a "balance", where it "doesn't compromise us losing money".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Milk and Bean owner Chris Chaplin told the BBC, "Having [people using] laptops isn't really ideal - it does mean a lower turnover and quite a low spend compared to people that aren't on laptops.</p>

<p>"It also brings the vibe of the place down with people on laptops.</p>

<p>"On one hand, we rely on them for revenue, but on the other hand, they've got to be reasonable and have some self-awareness."</p>

<p>Mr Middleton echoed the sentiments: "We are a small independent business, so we need to keep those tables busy and turned around - we can't have people hogging the table and we don't want to disrespect people that come in with laptops either."</p>

<p>He said that people coming in with laptops often had "quite a low spend", but would sit at tables for "quite a long time".</p>

<p>While remote workers contribute to revenue, their extended stays and lower spending can negatively affect a coffee shop's profitability. By implementing these measures, the establishments aim to strike a balance between accommodating customers and ensuring the sustainability of their businesses.</p>

<p>The policies have garnered mixed reactions from patrons, with some expressing support and others expressing concerns. Despite the potential for negative feedback, the coffee shop owners believe that the restrictions are necessary to optimize operations and provide a more equitable environment for all customers.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Many AI builders say this tech promises a path to utopia. Others say it could bring about the collapse of our civilization. In reality, the science-fiction scenarios have distracted us from the more insidious ways AI is threatening to harm society.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After clicking the link to this article and reading these first few words, you might be half-wondering if a human wrote them. Don't worry, I'm not offended. Two years ago, the thought wouldn't have even crossed your mind. But today, machines are generating articles, books, illustrations and computer code that seem indistinguishable from the content created by people.</p>

<p>Remember the "novel-writing machine" in the dystopian future of George Orwell's 1984 and his "versificator" that wrote popular music? Those things exist now, and the change happened so fast that it's given the public whiplash, leaving us wondering whether some of today's office workers will have jobs in the next five to 10 years. Millions of white-collar professionals suddenly look vulnerable. Talented young illustrators are wondering if they should bother going to art school.</p>

<p>What's remarkable is how quickly this has all come to pass. In the 15 years that I've written about the technology industry, I've never seen a field move as quickly as artificial intelligence has in just the last two years. The release of ChatGPT in November 2022 sparked a race to create a whole new kind of AI that didn't just process information but generated it. Back then, AI tools could produce wonky images of dogs. Now they are churning out photorealistic pictures of Donald Trump with pores and skin texture that look lifelike.</p>

<p>Many AI builders say this technology promises a path to utopia. Others say it could bring about the collapse of our civilization. In reality, the science-fiction scenarios have distracted us from the more insidious ways AI is threatening to harm society by perpetuating deep-seated biases, threatening entire creative industries, and more.</p>

<p>Behind this invisible force are companies that have grabbed control of AI's development and raced to make it more powerful. Driven by an insatiable hunger to grow, they've cut corners and misled the public about their products, putting themselves on course to become highly questionable stewards of AI.</p>

<p>No other organizations in history have amassed so much power or touched so many people as today's technology juggernauts. Alphabet Inc.'s Google conducts web searches for 90% of Earth's internet users, and Microsoft Corp. software is used by 70% of humans with a computer. The release of ChatGPT sparked a new AI boom, one that since November 2022 has added a staggering $6.7 trillion to the market valuations of the six Big Tech firms - Alphabet, Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft and most recently, Nvidia Corp.</p>

<p>Yet none of these companies are satisfied. Microsoft has vied for a chunk of Google's $150 billion search business, and Google wants Microsoft's $110 billion cloud business. To fight their war, each company has grabbed the ideas of others. Dig into this a bit deeper, and you'll find that AI's present reality has really been written by two men: Sam Altman and Demis Hassabis.</p>

<p>One is a scrawny and placid entrepreneur in his late 30s who wears sneakers to the office. The latter is a former chess champion in his late 40s who's obsessed with games. Both are fiercely intelligent, charming leaders who sketched out visions of AI so inspiring that people followed them with cult-like devotion. Both got here because they were obsessed with winning. Altman was the reason the world got ChatGPT. Hassabis was the reason we got it so quickly. Their journey has not only defined today's race but also the challenges coming our way, including a daunting struggle to steer AI's ethical future when it is under the control of so few incumbents.</p>

<p>Hassabis risked scientific ridicule when he established DeepMind in 2010, the first company in the world intent on building AI that was as smart as a human being. He wanted to make scientific discoveries about the origins of life, the nature of reality and cures for disease. "Solve intelligence, and then solve everything else," he said.</p>

<p>A few years later, Altman started OpenAI to try to build the same thing but with a greater focus on bringing economic abundance to humanity, increasing material wealth, and helping "us all live better lives," he tells me. "This can be the greatest tool humans have yet created, and let each of us do things far outside the realm of the possible."</p>

<p>Their plans were more ambitious than even the zealous Silicon Valley visionaries. They planned to build AI that was so powerful it could transform society and make the fields of economics and finance obsolete. And Altman and Hassabis alone would be the purveyors of its gifts.</p>

<p>In their quest to build what could become humankind's last invention, both men grappled with how such transformative technology should be controlled. At first they believed that tech monoliths like Google and Microsoft shouldn't steer it outright, because those firms prioritized profit over humanity's well-being. So for years and on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean, they both fumbled for novel ways to structure their research labs to protect AI and make benevolence its priority. They promised to be AI's careful custodians.</p>

<p>But both also wanted to be first. To build the most powerful software in history, they needed money and computing power, and their best source was Silicon Valley. Over time, both Altman and Hassabis decided they needed the tech giants after all. As their efforts to create superintelligent AI became more successful and as strange new ideologies buffeted them from different directions, they compromised on their noble goals. They handed over control to companies that rushed to sell AI tools to the public with virtually no oversight from regulators, and with far-reaching consequences.</p>

<p>This concentration of power in AI threatened to reduce competition and herald new intrusions into private life and new forms of racial and gender prejudice. Ask some popular AI tools to generate images of women, and they'll make them scantily clad by default; ask for photorealistic CEOs, and they'll generate images of White men. Some systems when asked for a criminal will generate images of Black men. In a ham-fisted effort to fix those stereotypes, Google released an image-generating tool in February 2024 that badly overcompensated, then shut it down. Such systems are on track to be woven into our media feeds, smartphones and justice systems, sometimes without due care for how they might shape public opinion, thanks to a relative lack of investment in ethics and safety research.</p>

<p>Altman and Hassabis' journey was not all that different from one two centuries ago, when two entrepreneurs named Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse went to war. Each had pursued a dream of creating a dominant system for delivering electricity to millions of consumers. Both were inventors-turned-entrepreneurs, and both understood that their technology would one day power the modern world. The question was this: Whose version of the technology would come out on top? In the end, Westinghouse's more efficient electrical standard became the most popular in the world. But he didn't win the so-called War of the Currents. Edison's much larger company, General Electric, did.</p>

<p>As corporate interests pushed Altman and Hassabis to unleash bigger and more powerful models, it's been the tech titans who've emerged as the winners, only this time the race was to replicate our own intelligence.</p>

<p>Now the world has been thrown into a tailspin. Generative AI promises to make people more productive and bring more useful information to our fingertips through tools like ChatGPT. But every innovation has a price to pay. Businesses and governments are adjusting to a new reality where the distinction between real and "AI-generated" is a crapshoot. Companies are throwing money at AI software to help displace their employees and boost profit margins. And devices that can conduct new levels of personal surveillance are cropping up.</p>

<p>We got here after the visions of two innovators who tried to build AI for good were eventually ground down by the forces of monopoly. Their story is one of idealism but also one of naivety and ego - and of how it can be virtually impossible to keep an ethical code in the bubbles of Big Tech and Silicon Valley. Altman and Hassabis tied themselves into knots over the stewardship of AI, knowing that the world needed to manage the technology responsibly if we were to stop it from causing irreversible harm. But they couldn't forge AI with godlike power without the resources of the world's largest tech firms. With the goal of enhancing human life, they would end up empowering those companies, leaving humanity's welfare and future caught in a battle for corporate supremacy.</p>

<p>After selling DeepMind to Google in 2014, Hassabis and his co-founders tried for years to spin out and restructure themselves as a nonprofit-style organization. They wanted to protect their increasingly powerful AI systems from being under the sole control of a tech monolith, and they worked on creating a board of independent luminaries that included former heads of state like Barack Obama to oversee its use. They even designed a new legal charter that would prioritize human well-being and the environment. Google appeared to go along with the plan at first and promised its entity billions of dollars, but its executives were stringing the founders along. In the end, Google tightened its grip on DeepMind, making the research lab that once focused on "solving intelligence" to help cure cancer or solve climate change now largely focused on developing its core AI product, Gemini.</p>

<p>Sam Altman made a similar kind of shift, having founded OpenAI on the premise of building AI for the benefit of humanity, "free from financial obligations." He has spent the last seven years twisting out of that commitment, restructuring his nonprofit as a "capped profit" company so that it could take billions of investment from Microsoft, to effectively become a product arm for the software firm. Now he is reportedly looking to restructure again in order to become more investor friendly and raise several billion more dollars. One likely outcome: He'll neuter the nonprofit board that ensures OpenAI serves humanity's best interests.</p>

<p>After the release of ChatGPT, I was struck by how these two innovators had both pivoted from their humanitarian visions. Sure, Silicon Valley's grand promises of making the world a better place often look like a ruse when its companies make addictive or mediocre services, and its founders become billionaires. But there's something more unsettling about Altman and Hassabis' shift away from their founding principles. They were both trying to build artificial general intelligence, or computers that could surpass our brainpower. The ramifications were huge. And their pivots have now brought new levels of influence and power to today's tech giants. The rest of us are set to find out the price.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk denied a report that his artificial intelligence startup xAI has held talks for a share in future Tesla revenue in return for giving Musk's electric vehicle maker access to xAI's technology and resources.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday that Tesla would license xAI's artificial-intelligence models to help power its driver-assistance software, full self-driving technology and share some of that revenue with the startup, according to the proposed arrangement as described to investors.</p>

<p>"Tesla has learned a lot from discussions with engineers at xAI that have helped accelerate achieving unsupervised FSD, but there is no need to license anything from xAI," Musk posted late on Saturday on his social media platform X, adding that the report is "not accurate."</p>

<p>The Journal, citing people familiar with the matter whom it did not identify, said xAI would support the development of other features for Tesla, including a voice assistant in its electric cars and software to power its humanoid robot Optimus.</p>

<p>The terms of any revenue-sharing agreement between xAI and Tesla would depend in part upon how extensively Tesla relied on xAI's technology as opposed to its own, the report said, adding that xAI executives have discussed an even revenue split from Tesla's FSD.</p>

<p>xAI could not be reached for a comment.</p>

<p>Musk launched xAI last year to compete with Microsoft-backed OpenAI. It sparked concerns that he might allocate some resources of the automaker to the AI company.</p>

<p>He has said xAI would be "helpful in advancing full self-driving and in building up the new Tesla data center," adding that there were opportunities to integrate xAI's chatbot, Grok, with Tesla's software.</p>

<p>In July, the billionaire CEO said he and the Tesla board would discuss a $5 billion investment in xAI.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Olympic rings will remain on the Eiffel Tower until at least 2028, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo has announced. The rings were mounted ahead of the Paris Olympics and became a popular tourist attraction. However, the mayor's decision to keep them as is has received opposition from lawmakers, residents, and conservation groups, who argue that the symbol of the International Olympic Committee does not belong to a protected historical landmark like the Eiffel Tower. Her rivals accuse her of political opportunism ahead of the 2026 mayoral election.</p>

<p>"The proposal that I have made for the rings... is a proposal that until 2028, until the Games in Los Angeles, we will leave the rings on the Eiffel Tower," she said at a press conference.</p>

<p>The Eiffel Tower was a central backdrop for several Olympic events, including the opening ceremony and beach volleyball. However the temporary structures built for the Games are supposed to be dismantled, and the city is expected to return to its original state.</p>

<p>Mayor Hidalgo claimed she wanted to preserve the "festive spirit" of the successful Games, but her opponents see it as an attempt to leave her mark on the iconic monument. David Alphand, a right-wing city councillor and ally of Ms Hidalgo's rival Rachida Dati, accused the mayor of trying to "recuperate the positive spin-offs" of the Olympics for her political gain.</p>

<p>Ms Hidalgo's camp has dismissed criticism as typical Parisian resistance to change, citing the initial opposition to the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre's pyramids. However, descendants of Gustave Eiffel (who designed the Eiffel Tower), including Olivier Berthelot-Eiffel, argue that the rings disrupt the tower's design and disrespect their ancestor's work.</p>

<p>"The rings completely break the design of the monument... it does not respect the work of our ancestor," Mr Berthelot-Eiffel, chairing an association of Eiffel's descendants, told <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eiffel-tower-olympic-rings-paris-mayor-anne-hidalgo-french-politics/ ">Politico</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While decorating the tower is not unprecedented, this is the first time the Eiffel family has publicly opposed plans related to the monument. Meanwhile, the Mayor claimed the decision was hers to make, as the tower was owned by the city of Paris. But rivals like Rachida Dati and heritage groups argue that modifications require careful consideration and approval.</p>

<p>"The Eiffel Tower is a protected monument that can only be modified under certain conditions and after an impact assessment," Ms Dati noted.</p>

<p>Julien Lacaze, president of the association "Sites &amp; Monuments," France's oldest heritage defence association, slammed Ms Hidalgo's proposal as a way to promote herself, latching onto the Eiffel Tower like a "parasite" to "take advantage of its fame... to say these are my Games."</p>

<p>The current 30-ton steel rings will have to come down as they are too heavy to remain there permanently. The Mayor said the city planned to replace them with new, lighter ones.</p>

<p>The controversy comes as Ms Hidalgo prepares to face off against Rachida Dati in the 2026 mayoral election. Ms Dati is the outgoing culture minister and current mayor of the arrondissement where the Eiffel Tower is located.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to hostile exchanges between prosecutor and felon, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are old hands. But Tuesday's high-stakes debate will be new territory for the Democratic vice president and her Republican rival, due to meet for the first time in front of a prime-time television audience of millions.</p>

<p>"The striking thing about this debate is, it's the first time in history where we'll see a prosecutor and convicted felon facing off against each other," Andrew Koneschusky, a PR expert and former press secretary for US Senate leader Chuck Schumer, told AFP.</p>

<p>"That's an incredible contrast. I wouldn't expect a lot of intricate policy discussion. I expect we'll see more style than substance."</p>

<p>Gish, who defended as literally true the Biblical account of the world's creation in six days, would overwhelm opponents with a dizzying torrent of rapid-fire falsehoods, distortions and distractions.</p>

<p>"It's very hard to debate someone who is quickly changing topics and not fully or truthfully answering the questions," said Flavio Hickel, a politics professor at Maryland liberal arts school Washington College.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But while the "Gish Gallop" may be good at putting opponents on the back foot, it is a risky strategy for someone trying to look presidential, analysts warn.</p>

<h3><strong>'Certainty and strength'</strong></h3>

<p>"As a debater, Trump brings energy, conveys certainty and strength, and never admits error, which translates for many people into presidential qualities," said Donald Nieman, a political analyst and professor at Binghamton University in New York state.</p>

<p>"Of course, they are likely to be coupled with transparent lies, wild exaggerations, unseemly ad hominem attacks and loopy digressions that have the opposite effect, especially on the few undecided voters."</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/watch-kamala-harris-campaign-gets-a-desi-touch-with-hindi-music-video-6522378">Harris</a> rose to the top of the Democratic ticket after 81-year-old President Joe Biden's dismal debate performance against Trump led to him dropping out of the race amid questions around his advanced years.</p>

<p>Analysts expect the 59-year-old Californian -- "Kamala the Cop" to her admirers -- to lean into her experience as a district attorney and press Trump on his role in the deadly 2021 insurrection at the US Capitol, as well as his multiple criminal cases.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Harris is a sharp prosecutor," said Keith Gaddie, a politics professor at Texas Christian University.</p>

<p>"She showed her chops debating Biden and others in 2020, and will likely lean into a combination of tricks used by prosecutors to control witnesses, while also cultivating 'jury sympathy.'"</p>

<p>Since Harris's ascension, Democrats' messaging has evolved from presenting Trump as a powerful and existential threat to democracy to minimizing him as "weird" and small.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Koneschusky expects to see more of this in the debate, but warned that Harris faces a balancing act between going after her opponent and using her precious airtime to make her own pitch for the Oval Office.</p>

<h3><strong>Former prosecutor</strong></h3>

<p>"On the one hand, this is a chance for Harris to define herself, and she needs to fully capitalize on that opportunity," he said.</p>

<p>"On the other hand, it's also important that Harris prosecutes the case against Trump in this debate, and she's well-equipped to do so as a former prosecutor. This is something Biden failed to do in the last debate."</p>

<p>One of Harris's standout debate moments came against Biden, ironically, in the 2019-20 Democratic presidential nominating contest, when she took her then-rival to task for his opposition to using federal funds to desegregate schools through busing.</p>

<p>"There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/weaponising-joy-how-kamala-harris-plans-to-beat-trump-at-his-own-game-6509981">Harris</a> said, in a moment that immediately went viral.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But her short-lived 2020 bid for the White House also illustrated weaknesses, as when she allowed herself to be rattled by former Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who savaged Harris over her record as a prosecutor.</p>

<p>Gabbard has switched sides and Trump has been using her in his debate prep.</p>

<p>The use of muted microphones during the Trump debate may meanwhile deprive Harris of another strength -- her ability to shut down rivals when they try to interrupt.</p>

<p>Harris deployed this to full effect when Mike Pence tried to cut her off during their 2020 vice-presidential debate and she stopped him dead with an ice-cold, "Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking."&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former war cabinet member Benny Gantz on Sunday said Israel should shift its focus toward Hezbollah and the Lebanese border, warning that "we are late on this." Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah have been trading near-daily cross-border fire, with the Lebanese group saying it is acting in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas in the ongoing war in Gaza.</p>

<p>"We have enough forces to deal with Gaza and we should concentrate on what is going on in the north," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/leaving-with-heavy-heart-israel-war-cabinet-minister-benny-gantz-quits-over-gaza-plan-5855047">Benny Gantz</a> said, speaking in Washington at a Middle East forum where he also said Iran and its proxies were "the real issue."</p>

<p>"The time of the north has come and actually I think we are late on this," the former army chief and centrist politician added.</p>

<p>Gantz said Israel had made a mistake in evacuating much of the north of the country as hostilities with Hezbollah flared following the October 7 Hamas attack that triggered the Gaza war.</p>

<p>"In Gaza, we have crossed a decisive point of the campaign," he said. "We can conduct anything we want in Gaza."</p>

<p>"We should seek to have a deal to get out our hostages but if we cannot in the coming time, a few days or few weeks, or whatever it is, we should go up north."</p>

<p>"We are capable of... hitting the state of Lebanon if needed," he said.</p>

<p>"The story of Hamas is old news," he added, saying instead that "the story of Iran and its proxies all around the area and what they are trying to do is the real issue."</p>

<p>Gantz left Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government in June over its lack of a post-war plan for Gaza.</p>

<p>The October 7 Hamas attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, including some hostages killed in captivity, official Israeli figures show. They seized 251 hostages during the attack, 97 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza has so far killed at least 40,972 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.</p>

<p>The UN human rights office says most of the dead are women and children.</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant also referred to the situation on the Lebanese border Sunday during a tour of the Netzarim Corridor in central Gaza, telling troops "we are preparing for anything that may happen in the north."</p>

<p>"The shift of the centre of gravity can happen quickly and can also involve you in a short period of time," Gallant said, according to a statement issued by his office.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[With darkness making the search difficult, authorities deployed a thermal drone to scan the dense 6-foot-tall cornfield.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A young boy who wandered into a vast cornfield at night was successfully rescued thanks to the use of thermal imaging technology. The incident occurred in Alto, Wisconsin, where deputies from the Fond du Lac County Sheriff's Office were alerted to the missing child around 8:45 p.m. on August 25th.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With darkness making the search difficult, authorities deployed a thermal drone to scan the dense 6-foot-tall cornfield. The drone's infrared camera revealed heat signatures, allowing rescuers to pinpoint the child's location within the vast expanse of stalks, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/06/us-news/drone-helps-rescue-3-year-old-boy-lost-in-dark-wisconsin-corn-field/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>New York Post</em></a> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The video begins with a drone surveying the vast expanse of a cornfield filled with 6-foot-tall stalks. In the thermal image, the rows of corn appear as a textured black-and-white pattern.</p>

<p>Around 9:30 p.m., a bright white shape suddenly moves through the corn, disrupting the uniform pattern on the screen-it's the missing toddler!</p>

<p>The footage then shows a Fond du Lac County deputy and personnel from the Alto Fire Department arriving on the scene. The rescuers, also appearing as white shapes in the thermal image, can be seen moving through the corn toward the child.</p>

<p>After approximately 15 minutes, they gather around the toddler. By detecting this heat signature, deputies were able to narrow their rescue efforts to a specific area of the cornfield.</p>

<p>The boy was safely brought out of the field and driven back to reunite with his parents.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="448" scrolling="no" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?height=448&amp;href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ffdlcosheriff%2Fvideos%2F520207617501682%2F&amp;show_text=false&amp;width=560&amp;t=0" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p>The thermal drone footage captured the dramatic rescue, showcasing the technology's invaluable role in such critical situations.</p>

<p>"This incident underscores the importance of technology and collaboration among law enforcement in our community," said the Fond du Lac County Sheriff's Office.</p>

<p>"Without the thermal imaging drone, it likely would have taken deputies and other first responders hours to search the entire cornfield, and the outcome could have been different," the statement added.</p>

<p>The Sheriff's Office also noted that the boy was found about half a mile from his home.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Inspired by the Oscar-winning track "Naatu Naatu", the song aims to mobilise South Asian voters for Indian-origin Kamala Harris in the US elections.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prominent Indian-American community leader Ajay Bhutoria has released a Hindi campaign song titled "Nacho Nacho" for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Inspired by the Oscar-winning track "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/entertainment/mm-keeravani-on-winning-oscar-for-naatu-naatu-global-recognition-came-for-a-song-thats-not-my-best-6076062" target="_blank">Naatu Naatu</a>" from the film "RRR", the song has been performed by Bollywood singer Shibani Kashyap and aims to mobilise South Asian voters for Indian-origin Kamala Harris in the November 5 election.</p>

<p>"'Nacho Nacho' isn't just a song, it's a movement. This campaign aims to connect with the diverse South Asian American community across battleground states and key districts. With over 4.4 million Indian Americans and 6 million South Asians eligible to vote, our goal is to help propel Vice President Kamala Harris to victory in 2024," Mr Bhutoria said.</p>

<p>He said the music video, which also shows Kamala Harris accepting her nomination, &nbsp;transcends language and cultural barriers, resonating with voters in Hindi, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, Gujarati, Bengali, and more.</p>

<p>"In 2020, we made history by electing the first woman of South Asian and African American descent as Vice President. Now, in 2024, it's time to make her our next President," he said.</p>

<p>She was nominated as the Democratic nominee after US President Joe Biden quit the presidential race amid mounting concerns over his age, particularly after his disastrous debate with his Republican rival Donald Trump in June.</p>

<h3><strong>What Polls Say On Kamala Harris vs Donald Trump&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>According to polls released Sunday, two days before <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-presidential-debate-donald-trump-kamala-harris-tied-in-latest-polls-ahead-of-televised-presidential-debate-6520668" target="_blank">Kamala Harris and Donald Trump</a> hold their first televised debate, the US presidential race remains neck-and-neck&nbsp;</p>

<p>A New York Times/Siena poll found that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-presidential-elections-2024-donald-trump-sounds-dark-tone-at-rally-kamala-harris-says-ready-for-debate-6514936" target="_blank">Trump</a>, 78, is leading Harris nationally by 48 to 47 percent. The poll found Harris narrowly ahead in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania and tied in four other swing states -- Nevada, Georgia, North Carolina, and Arizona.</p>

<p>A CBS News/YouGov poll put Harris ahead by one percentage point in Michigan and Wisconsin and tied in Pennsylvania.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Influential pastor Apollo Quiboloy, the self-proclaimed "owner of the universe" and "appointed son of god" who was wanted on charges of child sex trafficking, was arrested in the Philippines on Sunday.</p>

<p>Over 2,000 police were deployed for more than two weeks to search a 74-acre compound in the southern city of Davao owned by his church - the Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KOJC) - on suspicion that he was hiding there in a bunker.</p>

<p>Quiboloy's followers had blocked the gate of the compound to prevent shield-carrying police from enforcing a court order to arrest him. Police also used helicopters to circle over a cathedral, a college, and a stadium with 75,000 seats.</p>

<p>Days before Quiboloy's arrest, the police reportedly recorded the warmth and heartbeat of a human body, deep in the earth, using thermal imaging and radar technology.</p>

<h3><strong>Apollo Quiboloy Is Accused Of Sex Crimes</strong></h3>

<p>Apollo Quiboloy, a longtime friend of former Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte, is wanted on charges of child and sexual abuse and related allegations of human trafficking. He also figures on the FBI's "most wanted" list on charges of sex trafficking.</p>

<p>Quiboloy was charged by the US Justice Department in 2021 with sex trafficking of girls and women between the ages of 12 and 25 to work as personal assistants, or "pastorals", who were allegedly required to have sex with him.</p>

<p>He is also sought by authorities for bulk cash smuggling and a scheme that brought church members to the United States using fraudulently obtained visas. They were then forced to solicit donations for a bogus charity, raising funds that were instead used to finance church operations and the lavish lifestyles of its leaders.</p>

<p>The evangelist preacher, who is followed by millions of people in the Philippines, has denied wrongdoing.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India, the US and other countries in the West are facing the problem of unemployment while China isn't as it is dominating global production, Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi said, underscoring the need to focus on manufacturing in India.</p>

<p>During an interaction with students at the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-on-ai-during-interaction-in-texas-if-youre-positioned-properly-its-an-opportunit-6521837">University of Texas in Dallas</a> on Sunday, Mr Gandhi said there is no shortage of skills in India and the country could compete with China if it starts aligning itself for production.</p>

<p>He also stressed the need to encourage vocational training to bridge the gap between the business system and the education system and flagged the "ideological capture" of the latter.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-on-ai-during-interaction-in-texas-if-youre-positioned-properly-its-an-opportunit-6521837"><strong>Read: "If You're Positioned Properly, It's An Opportunity": Rahul Gandhi On AI</strong></a></p>

<p>Mr Gandhi is on a four-day unofficial trip to the US during which he will interact with the members of the Indian diaspora and youths with stops in Dallas, Texas and Washington DC. He also plans to meet lawmakers and senior officials of the US government during his visit to Washington DC beginning Monday.</p>

<p>He arrived in Dallas on Saturday night and was welcomed by dozens of members of the Indian-American community led by senior Congress leader Sam Pitroda and president of Indian National Overseas Congress, USA, Mohinder Gilzian.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bharat-jodo-yatra-introduced-the-idea-of-love-in-politics-rahul-gandhi-in-us-6521554"><strong>Read: "Bharat Jodo Yatra Introduced The Idea Of Love In Politics": Rahul Gandhi In US</strong></a></p>

<p>"The West has an employment problem. India has an employment problem... But many countries in the world don't have an employment problem. China certainly doesn't have an employment problem. Vietnam doesn't have an employment problem," Mr Gandhi said.</p>

<p>"If you look at the United States in the 1940s, 50s and 60s, they were the centre of global production. Anything that was made, (be it) cars, washing machines (or) TVs, all was made in the United States. Production moved from the United States. It went to Korea and it went to Japan. Eventually, it went to China. If you look today, China is dominating global production," he said.</p>

<p>The West, America, Europe and India have "given up on the idea of production" and they've handed it to China.</p>

<p>"The act of production creates jobs. What we do, what the Americans do, what the West does, is we organise consumption... India has to think about the act of production and organising production..."</p>

<p>"It's not acceptable that India simply says, okay, manufacturing, what you call manufacturing or production is going to be the preserve of the Chinese. It's going to be the preserve of the Vietnamese. It's going to be the preserve of Bangladesh," Mr Gandhi said.</p>

<p>He underlined the need to encourage manufacturing.</p>

<p>"Until we do that, we will face high levels of unemployment. And frankly, it's not sustainable. So, you're going to see that if we carry on down this path of forgetting about manufacturing, you're going to see massive social problems coming in India and in the United States and Europe. The polarisation of our politics is because of this..." he added.</p>

<p>According to the leader of opposition, there is no shortage of skills in India.</p>

<p>"Many people say that India has a problem with skills. I don't think India has a problem with skills. I think... India does not have respect for people who possess skills," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Gandhi said there is a need to link the education system with the business system through vocational training.</p>

<p>"Bridging that gap or linking these two systems, skills and education, through vocational training is fundamental. I think currently the huge problem with the education system is the ideological capture, where ideology is being fed through it...," he said.</p>

<p>He said he is convinced that India can take on China if it starts aligning itself for production and starts respecting skills.</p>

<p>"I'm absolutely convinced of it. States like Tamil Nadu have already shown it. It's not that Indian states have not done it. Pune has shown it. Maharashtra has shown it. So, it is being done but it's not being done at the scale and with the coordination that it needs to be done," Mr Gandhi said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

The company founded by Steve Jobs has disclosed little about what it plans to show off during a launch event, titled "Glowtime," at its headquarters in the Silicon Valley city of Cupertino.</p>

<p>It is the time of year, though, when Apple typically updates its iPhone lineup.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/offbeat/ahead-of-apples-big-launch-first-indian-ad-for-apple-goes-viral-6516353">Apple</a> has a lot riding on what would be the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.gadgets360.com/mobiles/news/iphone-16-series-a18-apple-arm-v9-chipset-financial-times-report-6513432">iPhone 16</a> and will hope that customers will be enticed to buy the latest models, attracted by new AI powers.</p>

<p>With $39 billion in sales last quarter, the iPhone counts for roughly 60 percent of Apple's revenue, and remains the main entryway to the company's services, such as the App Store or Apple TV, which are becoming a growing part of its business.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/all-about-iphone-16-series-set-to-launch-on-september-9-6489624">Apple</a> is only just coming out of a long sales slump as users increasingly stick with older models longer.</p>

<p>"The iPhone 16 will be one of the most significant iPhone introductions, not because of what's on the outside but because of what's inside -- namely, Apple Intelligence," said Forrester principal analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee.</p>

"Apple Intelligence" is a new suite of software features for all devices that was announced in June at the company's annual developers conference, where it also announced a partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.</p>

<p>In the short-term, these include AI-infused image editing, translation, and small, creative touches in messaging, but not more ambitious breakthroughs promised by other AI players, such as OpenAI or Google.</p>

<h3><strong>'Super-powered Siri'</strong></h3>

<p>Apple also said its digital assistant Siri will get an AI upgrade and now will appear as a pulsating light on the edge of a home screen.</p>

<p>"Siri will be a big part of the conversation," Creative Strategies analyst Carolina Milanesi said of Monday's event.</p>

<p>Launched more than 12 years ago, Siri has come to be seen as a dated feature, overtaken by a new generation of assistants such as GPT-4o, OpenAI's latest offering.</p>

<p>Apple watchers predict Apple will introduce iPhone 16 models with custom chips that can power these AI features, including the Siri upgrade.</p>

<p>By adding AI capabilities, Apple is looking to "shake that expectation" that iPhone launches are &nbsp;"just steady improvements in hardware and software," &nbsp;said Techsponential analyst Avi Greengart.</p>

<p>Longer term, Apple could dramatically change the iPhone experience with a "super-powered Siri" working across all the apps, Greengart said.</p>

<h3><strong>Pixel power</strong></h3>

<p>Apple's announcement closely follows Google, which last month unveiled AI-infused Pixel 9 smartphones, its challenge to the iPhone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pixels account for a tiny sliver of the global smartphone market dominated by Samsung and Apple, but Google argued its new line is a chance to answer what -- after all the hype -- AI can actually do for customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There have been so many promises, so many 'coming soons,' and not enough real world helpfulness when it comes to AI - which is why today we're getting real," Google senior vice president of devices Rick Osterloh said at the company's campus in Mountain View, California.</p>

<p>Samsung has also showcased AI across a range of its consumer electronic products as it looks to extend its leadership in global smartphone sales.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imran Khan's party, Pakistan Tehreek-E-Insaf, was issued a warning by the local administration to adhere to the rally's NOC guidelines, which mandated them to vacate the venue by 7pm, ARY News reported.</p>

<p>In the Sangjani Rally on Sunday, the district magistrate issued several reminders to vacate the venue. But the rally exceeded the permit time, which made the police and the administration take action against them, as per ARY News report.</p>

<p>The participants arriving from a different route clashed with the police as the PTI workers threw stones, leading the police to respond with tear gas at Choongi No 26 area, ARY News stated.</p>

<p>A police spokesperson told ARY News that participants deviated from the designated rally route and attacked law enforcement. Several officers, including SSP Safe City Shoaib Khan, were injured in the incident as stone pelting continued.</p>

<p>Pakistan's interior Minister, Mohsin Naqvi, took notice of the situation and sought a report from Inspector General Islamabad and instructed to provide the best medical treatment of injured police officers. In a telephonic conversation with injured SSP Shoaib Khan, Mohsin Naqvi inquired about his health and emphasized the need for top-quality treatment for all injured officers involved in the incident.</p>

<p>PTI alleged that shots were fired at its members by the police during the rally in Islamabad on Sunday, which was being held demanding the release of party founder and incarcerated former Prime Minister Imran Khan.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf shared a video where they shared visuals from the rally and stated, "You can jail a man, but not his ideas," referring to PTI's incarcerated leader and founder Imran Khan.</p>

<p>The party's official account also shared pictures of protests at Pakistani Embassy in Norway demanding the release of Imran Khan.</p>

<p>The post stated, "Protest in front of the Pakistani Embassy in Oslo Norway to show solidarity with Imran Khan and his fight for justice and democracy."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said on Monday that the Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be a good opportunity if one is positioned properly.</p>

<p>The Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha, while interacting with the students at the University of Texas at Dallas, spoke about the fears that AI is going to take jobs away.</p>

<p>He said that every new technology takes away some jobs and generates new ones.</p>

<p>"Everytime you get a new technology, the argument is made that it's going to take jobs away. When computers first came [it was feared that] it's going to take jobs away. When calculators first came [it was feared that] it's going to take jobs away. ATMs came [it was feared that] it's going to take jobs away. What happens is- it does take jobs away from some people and then transfers them to other people. I'm not of the view that jobs will vanish, but different types of jobs will be created and different types of systems will benefit more or less," Mr Gandhi said.</p>

<p>Elaborating his view, the Congress leader said, "I think, for example, the IT industry in India is going to have a real big serious problem because of AI. But I don't really think that Bajaj- making scooters is going to have such a big problem. It's going to take away some jobs, it's going to add some jobs and if you're positioned properly, it's an opportunity and if you positioned badly, you're in trouble."</p>

<p>"I remember Mr [Atal Bihari] Vajpayee gave a speech that Indians don't need computers. And somebody else gave a speech that Indians don't need English. [But] Computers created millions of jobs in India. So it depends how flexible you are and how well you're looking at the future," he added.</p>

<p>Rahul Gandhi arrived in Dallas, Texas, on Sunday for his three-day US visit. The Congress MP was welcomed at the airport by Sam Pitroda, Chairman of the Indian Overseas Congress, and members of the Indian diaspora.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

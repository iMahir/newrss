       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping urged G20 leaders Monday to support efforts to de-escalate the war in Ukraine and reach a "political solution," state media reported.</p>

<p>His remarks at the G20 summit in Brazil come shortly after Ukraine received a US green light to launch long-range missiles provided by Washington against targets inside Russia.</p>

<p>"The G20 should support the United Nations and its Security Council in playing a greater role, and support all efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of crises," Xi said, according to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV.</p>

<p>He called for leaders to avoid "spillovers" from battlefields and escalation of fighting, and to help "cool the Ukraine crisis and seek a political solution."</p>

<p>War in Ukraine continues to rage since Russia's invasion in 2022.</p>

<p>China presents itself as a neutral party in the war and says it is not sending lethal assistance to either side, unlike the United States and other Western nations.</p>

<p>But it remains a close political and economic ally of Russia. NATO members have branded Beijing a "decisive enabler" of the war, which it has never condemned.</p>

<p>Following the long-range missile policy shift by US President Joe Biden, who leaves office in January, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Monday his country was sending Ukraine 4,000 AI-guided drones.</p>

<p>Xi, in his speech Monday, also called for efforts to shore up multilateral trade systems and warned against "politicizing economic issues" without naming any specific countries.</p>

<p>His comments come before US President-elect Donald Trump reenters the White House in January, after campaigning on pledges to enact sweeping tariffs on China and others.</p>

<p>Washington also unveiled sharp tariff hikes this year on Chinese goods, notably on products like electric vehicle batteries and solar cells, as the United States tries to grow its domestic clean energy sectors.</p>

<p>"We must avoid politicizing economic issues, artificially dividing the global market, and avoid practicing protectionism in the name of green and low-carbon development," Xi said.</p>

<p>In seeking cooperation on artificial intelligence, he added that this should not become "a game of rich countries and the wealthy."</p>

<p>Xi called for "all sides to stop fighting" in Gaza as well, saying the war between Israel and Hamas has "brought heavy suffering," CCTV reported.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President-elect Donald Trump will take office on January 20 after defeating Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Here is a timeline of events between now and inauguration day:</p>

<p><strong>- December 11:</strong> States must submit certified slates of presidential electors by this date to the archivist of the United States as part of a 2022 federal law intended to avoid a repeat of the chaos after Trump's attempts to overturn his 2020 defeat.</p>

<p><strong>- December 17:</strong> Electors, who together form the Electoral College, meet in their respective states and the District of Columbia to select the president and vice president.</p>

<p><strong>- December 25: </strong>The electoral votes must be received by this date by the president of the Senate - a role held by the vice president, currently Harris - and the archivist.</p>

<p><strong>2025</strong></p>

<p><strong>- January 6:</strong> Harris presides over the Electoral College vote count at a joint session of Congress, announces the results and declares who has been elected.</p>

<p>Ahead of the count on January 6, 2021, then-President Trump lambasted his vice president, Mike Pence, for refusing to try to prevent Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's victory.</p>

<p>On that day, Trump supporters entered the US Capitol in an effort to stop the count. Biden's win was certified early the next day.</p>

<p>Congress has since passed reforms that require approval of one-fifth of the House and Senate to consider a challenge to a state's results - a much higher bar than existed before, when at least one member each in the Senate and the House of Representatives could together trigger a challenge.</p>

<p><strong>- January 20:</strong> Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance will take their respective oaths of office during a swearing-in ceremony that is due to begin at 12 p.m. ET (1700 GMT).</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met Monday with Russia's natural resources minister in Pyongyang, state media reported, as visiting delegations from Moscow highlighted deepening ties amid the Ukraine war.</p>

<p>Kim met with Russian Minister of Natural Resources and Ecology Alexander Kozlov, who is leading a delegation to an inter-governmental panel on "cooperation in trade, economy, science and technology," the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a delegation from a Russian military academy also arrived in the North Korean capital, KCNA said, without providing details on the purpose of the visit.</p>

<p>The United States and South Korea have accused the nuclear-armed North of sending more than 10,000 soldiers to help Russia fight Ukraine, with experts saying Kim was eager for Moscow's advanced technology, plus battle experience for his troops, in return.</p>

<p>North Korea recently ratified a landmark defence pact with Russia, formalising months of tightening military bonds between two nations that were Communist allies throughout the Cold War.</p>

<p>Noting the new treaty, Kim called in his meeting with Kozlov for "further promoting" trade as well as "scientific and technological exchange," according to KCNA.</p>

<p>Their meeting "proceeded in a friendly and sincere atmosphere," KCNA said.</p>

<p>In exchange for North Korea's sending troops, the West fears Russia is offering technological support that could advance Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme.</p>

<p>The reclusive state recently fired a salvo of ballistic missiles and tested a new solid-fuel ICBM, while Washington has said that North Korean troops have begun combat operations alongside Russian forces.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi met his UK counterpart Keir Starmer on the sidelines of the G20 Summit on Tuesday, during which he expressed eagerness to work closely in areas such as technology, green energy, security, innovation and technology.</p>

<p>Modi -- who arrived in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday after concluding a two-day trip to Nigeria -- has met leaders of several countries, including those from Italy, Indonesia, Norway and Portugal, on the sidelines of the summit.</p>

<p>He also met French President Emmanuel Macron and discussed ways to keep working closely in sectors such as space, energy and AI.</p>

<p>Modi said in a post on X about his meeting with Starmer, "Had an extremely productive meeting with Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Rio de Janeiro. For India, the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership with the UK is of immense priority." "In the coming years, we are eager to work closely in areas such as technology, green energy, security, innovation and technology. We also want to add strength to trade as well as cultural linkages," the prime minister added.</p>

<p>Modi also shared pictures of him greeting the UK prime minister and their meeting.</p>

<p>The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said the bilateral meeting infused "fresh impetus to the India-UK Comprehensive Strategic Partnership".</p>

<p>"Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Prime Minister Keir Starmer of UK on the sidelines of the G20 Brazil Summit in Rio. The leaders discussed various facets of the India-UK Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. They also acknowledged the need for a balanced and mutually beneficial FTA," the MEA said in its post on X.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine marked 1,000 days on Tuesday since Russia's full-scale invasion, with weary troops battling on numerous fronts, Kyiv besieged by frequent drone and missile strikes, and officials preparing for Donald Trump to reclaim the White House in January.</p>

<p>In a boost for the beleaguered country, US President Joe Biden gave the green light for US missiles to be used against targets deeper inside Russia, potentially limiting its options to launch attacks and supply the front.</p>

<p>But the dramatic shift in policy may be reversed when Trump returns to the White House in January, and military experts cautioned that it would not be enough on its own to change the course of the 33-month-old war.</p>

<p>Thousands of Ukrainian citizens have died, over 6 million live as refugees abroad and the population has fallen by a quarter since Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion by land, sea and air that began Europe's biggest conflict since World War Two.</p>

<p>Military losses have been catastrophic, although they remain closely guarded secrets. Public Western estimates based on intelligence reports vary widely, but most say hundreds of thousands have been killed or wounded on each side.</p>

<p>Tragedy has touched families in every corner of Ukraine, where military funerals are commonplace in major cities and far-flung villages, and people are exhausted by sleepless nights of air raid sirens and anguish.</p>

<p>Now the return of Trump, who has vowed to end the fighting quickly - without saying how - calls into question the future of US military aid and the united Western front against Putin, and raises the prospect of talks to end the war.</p>

<p><strong>PROSPECT OF TALKS PROMPTS ESCALATION</strong></p>

<p>With Ukraine entering uncharted territory, a sense of escalation has been palpable as Moscow and Kyiv push to improve their battlefield positions ahead of any negotiations.</p>

<p>Already boosted by Iranian attack drones and North Korean artillery shells and ballistic missiles, Russia has now deployed 11,000 North Korean troops, some of whom Kyiv says have clashed with Ukrainian forces who have seized a part of Russia's Kursk region.</p>

<p>One senior Kyiv official said Pyongyang had the capacity to send 100,000 soldiers.</p>

<p>Ukraine meanwhile has some of its best troops trying to hold that small piece of Russian territory, captured in August as a bargaining chip.</p>

<p>Kyiv says Russia has massed 50,000 troops there, while the Kremlin's forces have also been making their quickest gains in the east of Ukraine since 2022 - and stepping up pressure in the northeast and southeast too.</p>

<p>With winter setting in, Moscow on Sunday renewed its aerial assault on Ukraine's struggling power system, firing 120 missiles and 90 drones in the biggest aerial barrage since August.</p>

<p>In addition to the US authorisation to strike military targets inside Russia with American-supplied weapons, external financial and arms aid also remain vital.</p>

<p>Despite two consecutive years of moderate growth, the Ukrainian economy is still only 78% of the size it was before the invasion, which saw GDP contract by a third in 2022. Ukraine's once-giant steel and grain industries have been hammered.</p>

<p><strong>RUSSIA DEMANDS UKRAINE GIVE UP TERRITORY AND NATO AMBITION</strong></p>

<p>The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission has verified the deaths of 11,743 Ukrainian civilians, though some Kyiv officials believe the number is much higher.</p>

<p>President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said last week that Ukraine must do its best to end the war next year through diplomatic means. But he has emphatically shut down any talk of a ceasefire before proper security guarantees are provided to Ukraine.</p>

<p>The Kremlin has said its war objectives remain unchanged since Putin said in June that Ukraine must drop its ambitions to join NATO, and must retreat from four Ukrainian regions that his forces partially control, all tantamount to capitulation for Kyiv.</p>

<p>A sea of small Ukrainian flags honouring the dead now occupies a corner of Kyiv's Independence Square, once the beating heart of the mass pro-European protests that toppled Ukraine's then Moscow-backed president in 2014.</p>

<p>Russia responded to the protests by seizing Ukraine's Black Sea peninsula, Crimea, and backing a paramilitary insurgency in the east that killed 14,000 people before two series of talks, in the so-called Minsk format, halted the fighting with Kyiv.</p>

<p>After German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called Putin on Friday for the first time in nearly two years, Zelenskiy said the move reduced the Russian leader's isolation. He also spoke out against the idea of renewed Minsk-style talks.</p>

<p>"We want to warn everyone: there will be no 'Minsk 3'; what we need is real peace," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden's decision to allow Ukraine to strike Russian territory with American-supplied long-range missiles could be a "game changer" for Kyiv, the country's foreign minister, Andriy Sybiga, said Monday.</p>

<p>"It could be a game changer. The longer Ukraine can strike, the shorter the war will be," Sybiga told reporters ahead of a UN Security Council meeting to mark 1,000 days since the Russian invasion of its Eastern European neighbor.</p>

<p>He argued that Kyiv has the "full right to strike military targets on the territory of Russia."</p>

<p>"It could have very positive impact on the situation on the battlefield," Sybiga added.</p>

<p>The use of long-range missiles, long sought by Ukraine, was approved two months before Biden leaves office to be replaced by US President-elect Donald Trump, who is seen as less inclined to help Kyiv.</p>

<p>Russia on Monday accused Biden of "fueling" tensions with the move.</p>

<p>UN Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Rosemary DiCarlo, referring to the green light, said that "all parties must ensure the safety and protection of civilians, regardless of their location."</p>

<p>DiCarlo, speaking on behalf of UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, went on to mark the "1,000 days of widespread death, destruction and despair that continue unabated for millions of Ukrainians."</p>

<p>She denounced the rise in civilian casualties and raised Russia's attack on Ukraine over the weekend, involving 120 missiles and 90 drones, which caused significant damage to Ukraine's power grid.</p>

<p>"The targeted devastation of Ukraine's energy infrastructure may make the coming winter the harshest since the start of the war," she warned.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The war between Russia and Ukraine, the deadliest conflict Europe has seen since the World War II, marks its 1,000th day today.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The war between Russia and Ukraine, the deadliest conflict Europe has seen since the World War II, marks its 1,000th day today. Over one million people have reportedly either died or have been grievously injured since the beginning of the war.</p>

<p>Amid the grim reality of the deadliest war of the 21st Century, cities, towns, and villages in Ukraine have been devastated and now lie in ruin. The loss of human life and material wealth keep mounting in a never-ending series of heartbreaking stories emerging from the war-torn country.</p>

<p>Ukraine now stands more vulnerable than at any time since the beginning of the war.</p>

<p>As per a report in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wsj.com/world/one-million-are-now-dead-or-injured-in-the-russia-ukraine-war-b09d04e5" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a>, <em>"A confidential Ukrainian estimate from earlier this year put the number of dead Ukrainian troops at 80,000 and the wounded at 400,000, according to people familiar with the matter. Western intelligence estimates of Russian casualties vary, with some putting the number of dead as high as nearly 200,000 and wounded at around 400,000."</em></p>

<p>Both Russia and Ukraine have diminishing populations and have been struggling from even before the war. The staggering death count due to the war will thereby have far-reaching demographic implications for both nations.</p>

<h2><strong>CIVILIAN DEATHS</strong></h2>

<p>While the roughly million casualties account mostly for soldiers and military personnel, the civilian casualties in Ukraine as of August 31, 2024 are documented to be at least 11,743 killed and 24,614 wounded. These figures are as per the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine.</p>

<p>The United Nations and Ukrainian officials say that the real number of deaths and injuries are like to be far more, adding that it is difficult to verify the deaths and injuries, especially in areas such as Mariupol that are now in Russian hands. 589 Ukrainian children have also been killed till November 14, 2024.</p>

</div>

<p>According to a Reuters report, tens of thousands have perished in intense fighting across heavily fortified front lines under relentless artillery fire, with tanks, armoured vehicles and infantry mounting assaults on trenches. The report also states that both sides closely guard tallies of their own military losses as national security secrets, and public estimates by Western countries based on intelligence reports vary widely.</p>

<p>There are estimates that Russia has suffered great losses too in terms of military deaths, accounting for more than a 1,000 dead soldiers per day during intense periods of the war. Ukraine's President Zelensky had said in February, 2024 that more than 31,000 Ukrainian service members had been killed, which analysts believe is a very conservative estimate.</p>

<p>The war has also led to Ukraine's birthrate to fall to a third of what it used to be 2.5 years ago, before the war began. While more than four million people have been displaced within Ukraine, the war has also led to more than six million Ukrainian nationals fleeing abroad - mostly to European countries. Not only has Ukraine's mortality rate from causes other than the war surged since the conflict began, UN estimates suggest that Ukraine's population has declined by over 10 million people, which is around a quarter of its overall population, suggesting that 25 percent of the population has been wiped out.</p>

<h3><strong>TERRITORY LOST</strong></h3>

<p>Russia now occupies and claims to have annexed around a fifth of Ukraine, an area around the size of Greece, news agency Reuters reported. Moscow's forces initially stormed through northern, eastern and southern Ukraine in early 2022, reaching the outskirts of Kyiv in the north and crossing the Dnipro River in the south, it stated.</p>

<p>Moscow has even captured nearly the whole of the Donbas region in Ukraine's east, and the entire coast of the Sea of Azov in the south.</p>

<p>According to the Reuters report, many cities in the frontline area that have been captured by Moscow have been destroyed, largest among them the Azov port of Mariupol, with a population before the war of around half a million. In the past year, Russia has slowly extended its grip in intense fighting, mainly in the Donbas. Ukraine, for its part, launched its first large-scale assault on Russian territory in August and has captured a sliver of western Russia's Kursk region.</p>

<h3><strong>ECONOMIC IMPACT</strong></h3>

<p>In 2022, Ukraine's economy shrunk by nearly a third (33 per cent) of what it used to be before the war. In 2023 however, the war-torn country made a marginal comeback and managed to reduce the economic losses to roughly 22 per cent of its original size.</p>

<p>As per a Reuters report, the latest available assessment by the World Bank, European Commission, United Nations and Ukrainian government found that direct war damage in Ukraine had reached $152 billion as of December, 2023, with housing, transport, commerce and industry, energy and agriculture the worst-affected sectors.</p>

<p>The total cost of reconstruction and recovery was estimated by the World Bank and Ukrainian government at $486 billion as of the end of December last year. The figure is 2.8 times higher than Ukraine's nominal gross domestic product in 2023, according to economy ministry data.</p>

<p>Ukraine's power sector has been particularly hard hit, with Russia regularly targeting infrastructure in long range attacks. Ukraine is also one of the world's main sources of grain, and the interruption of its exports early in the war worsened a global food crisis. Exports have since largely recovered with Ukraine finding ways to circumvent a de facto Russian blockade.</p>

<p>Each day the war is costing Kyiv more than $140 million, Roksolana Pidlasa, head of Ukraine parliament's budget committee, said. The draft 2025 budget envisages that about 26% of Ukraine's GDP, or 2.2 trillion hryvnias ($53.3 billion), would go on defence. Ukraine has already received more than $100 billion from its Western partners in financial aid.</p>

<p>What we know today as Ukraine was once part of the Russian Empire and subsequently also a part of the Soviet Union till the dissolution of the USSR in 1991. Vladimir Putin has said on multiple occasions that he seeks to revert Ukraine back to the Russian Federation. President Putin has denied recognition to Ukrainian identity and statehood and claims that the people of Ukraine, who are mostly Slavic or Orthodox Christians, are in fact Russian people.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon and Hezbollah have agreed to a US proposal for a ceasefire with Israel with some comments on the content, a top Lebanese official told Reuters on Monday, describing the effort as the most serious yet to end to the fighting.</p>

<p>Ali Hassan Khalil, an aide to Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, said Lebanon had delivered its written response to the US ambassador in Lebanon on Monday, and White House envoy Amos Hochstein was travelling to Beirut to continue talks.</p>

<p>There was no immediate comment from Israel.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, a heavily armed movement backed by Iran, endorsed its long-time ally Berri to negotiate over a ceasefire.</p>

<p>"Lebanon presented its comments on the paper in a positive atmosphere," Khalil said, declining to give further details. "All the comments that we presented affirm the precise adherence to (UN) Resolution 1701 with all its provisions," he said.</p>

<p>He was referring to UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended a previous war between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006.</p>

<p>Its terms require Hezbollah to have no armed presence in the area between the Lebanese-Israeli border and the Litani River, which runs some 30 km (20 miles) north of the frontier.</p>

<p>Khalil said the success of the initiative now depended on Israel, saying if Israel did not want a solution, "it could make 100 problems".</p>

<p>Israel has long claimed that Resolution 1701 was never properly implemented, pointing to the presence of Hezbollah fighters and weapons along the border. Lebanon has accused Israel of violations including flying warplanes in its airspace.</p>

<p>Khalil said Israel was trying to negotiate "under fire", a reference to an escalation of its bombardment of Beirut and the Hezbollah-controlled southern suburbs. "This won't affect our position," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>US President Joe Biden announced a "historic" $4 billion pledge for a World Bank fund that helps the world's poorest countries, the White House said Monday, before Donald Trump takes office with a new cost-cutting agenda.</p>

<p>The outgoing leader unveiled the money for the International Development Association as he attends the G20 summit underway in Rio de Janeiro, his last time at the gathering of world leaders.</p>

<p>"The president announced today that the United States intends to pledge $4 billion over three years... which is really exciting," a senior US administration official told reporters on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>The official said the pledge would not be binding on Trump's incoming administration but said previous Republican governments had also backed top-ups for the fund.</p>

<p>US Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer earlier called the pledge "historic" and said Biden would "rally other leaders to step up their contributions."</p>

<p>The International Development Association is the concessional lending arm of the World Bank and is used for some of the poorest countries in the globe, including for projects focused on climate.</p>

<p>During a six-day tour of South America, Biden has been trying to shore up his international legacy ahead of President-elect Trump's return to the White House on January 20.</p>

<p>On Sunday he visited the Amazon rainforest in Brazil to promote his record on climate change, saying that the United States had hit its target of increasing bilateral climate financing to $11 billion a year.</p>

<p>Billionaire Trump has pledged to take a wrecking ball to many of Biden's policies and has appointed tech tycoon Elon Musk as head of a commission to target what he calls federal government waste.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has joined a growing list of former tech leaders taking roles in San Francisco's government following this month's election.</p>

<p>San Francisco Mayor-elect Daniel Lurie named Altman, the head of the artificial-intelligence company behind ChatGPT, as one of seven co-chairs of his transition team, the campaign announced on Monday. The tech industry concentrated in Silicon Valley, south of San Francisco, has increasingly moved into the city itself, creating tensions in a place once synonymous with hippies and counterculture.</p>

<p>At the same time, San Francisco's sluggish post-pandemic economic recovery and visible struggles with drugs and homelessness have fueled a shift towards centrist Democratic politics, driven by both disgruntled citizens and affluent tech executive donors.</p>

<p>Some Silicon Valley investors have backed Republican President-elect Donald Trump.</p>

<p>In San Francisco's election, WhatsApp co-founder and former CEO Jan Koum supported Lurie. Two former software entrepreneurs, Bilal Mahmood and Danny Sauter, were elected to the city's board of supervisors.</p>

<p>Lurie, a philanthropist and heir to the Levi Strauss fortune, will succeed London Breed, the city's first Black female mayor, who has led the city since 2018.</p>

<p>Upon taking office on January 8, Lurie, who has no experience at City Hall, will face the challenge of resolving San Francisco's public safety crisis, a pressing issue that has driven numerous tech leaders to relocate from the Bay Area.</p>

<p>Other tech executives embraced the chance to focus their industry's skills on San Francisco's problems.</p>

<p>"I'm excited to help the city I love, and where OpenAI was started," Altman said in a statement.</p>

<p>In an interview with Reuters, Mahmood said former business executives are experts in prioritization and metrics-driven governance, which can help the city "return to the basics".</p>

<p>"Democrats have been too focused on ideological battles rather than quality-of-life issues," he said.</p>

<p>Mahmood added that many of San Francisco's problems stem from its inefficient technical infrastructure, leading to delays in hiring and housing approvals, areas where tech executives are well-positioned to contribute.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi met leaders of several countries, including those from Italy, Indonesia, Norway and Portugal, on the sidelines of the G20 Summit and discussed ways to improve and strengthen ties.</p>

<p>PM Modi arrived in the Brazilian city on Sunday after concluding a two-day trip to Nigeria.</p>

<p>PM Modi on Monday met his Italian counterpart Giorgia Meloni and discussed ways to deepen ties in defence, security, trade and technology.</p>

<p>"Glad to have met Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on the sidelines of the Rio de Janeiro G20 Summit. Our talks centred around deepening ties in defence, security, trade and technology. We also talked about how to boost cooperation in culture, education and other such areas. India-Italy friendship can greatly contribute to a better planet," PM Modi said in a post on X.</p>

<p>The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) also posted on X about the meeting.</p>

<p>"Strategic Partnership going strong! Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy on the sidelines of the G20 Brazil Summit in Rio," it said.</p>

<p>"Both leaders welcomed the India-Italy Joint Strategic Action Plan 2025-29 to further elevate and give impetus to the longstanding India-Italy bilateral ties," the MEA added.</p>

<p>PM Modi also met Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto and discussed ways to improve ties in security, health care.</p>

<p>"Delighted to meet President Prabowo Subianto during the G20 Summit in Brazil. This year is special as we are marking 75 years of India-Indonesia diplomatic relations. Our talks focussed on improving ties in commerce, security, healthcare, pharmaceuticals and more," PM Modi said in a post on X, along with pictures of the two leaders.</p>

<p>"Commemorating 75 years of warm and friendly ties! Prime Minister Narendra Modi met President Prabowo Subianto of Indonesia on the sidelines of the G20 Brazil Summit," the MEA said on X.</p>

<p>"The prime minister congratulated President Prabowo and assured him of India's full support. Both leaders discussed ways to work together for further strengthening the India-Indonesia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, in existing domains as well as expand it to newer areas," it added.</p>

<p>The talks during PM Modi's meeting with Portugal Prime Minister Luis Montenegro focussed on adding more vigour to the economic linkages between the two countries.</p>

<p>"Had a very good meeting with Prime Minister of Portugal, Mr Luis Montenegro. India cherishes the long-standing ties with Portugal. Our talks focussed on adding more vigour to our economic linkages. Sectors like renewable energy and green hydrogen offer many opportunities for collaboration. We also talked about strong defence relations, people-to-people linkages and other such subjects," PM Modi said on X.</p>

<p>The MEA said on X, "Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Prime Minister Luis Montenegro of Portugal today on the sidelines of the G20 Brazil Summit in Rio. Both sides deliberated on further strengthening India-Portugal bilateral ties, including in areas of the economy, renewable energy, defence and people to people ties &amp; cooperation in multilateral fora." PM Modi also met his Norwegian counterpart Jonas Gahr Store on the sidelines of the summit.</p>

<p>"The meeting with Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store was excellent. Our Arctic Policy has led to further cementing of India-Norway bilateral relations. We talked about how investment linkages between our nations can improve, particularly in renewable energy, green hydrogen and the blue economy. Closer cooperation in sectors like innovation and research were also discussed," he said on X.</p>

<p>The MEA said the meeting explored "new avenues to strengthen India-Norway ties".</p>

<p>"Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store of Norway on the sidelines of G20 Brazil Summit. Discussions focused on ways to deepen India-Norway bilateral relations, particularly in trade and economic cooperation after the signing of India-EFTA-TEPA. The leaders also exchanged views on geopolitical issues," it said.</p>

<p>During the summit, International Monetary Fund (IMF) Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath also met PM Modi.</p>

<p>"Great to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the G20 Summit in Rio. He conveyed the many successes of India in reducing hunger and poverty. Numerous creative initiatives for the world to learn from," the India-born economist said on X.</p>

<p>PM Modi replied to her post, saying, "India stands committed to promoting food security and eliminating poverty. We will build on our successes and harness our collective strength and resources to ensure a brighter future for all." Earlier in the day, PM Modi met US President Joe Biden and briefly interacted with him. It is not immediately known what transpired between the two leaders.</p>

<p>Modi also interacted with several world leaders, including those from Brazil, Singapore and Spain, on the sidelines of the G20 Summit on Monday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Germany on Monday said that it was delivering 4,000 AI-guided drones to Ukraine, as Chancellor Olaf Scholz stood by a decision not to send Kyiv long-range Taurus missiles.</p>

<p>Scholz has faced renewed pressure to hand the weapons system over to Ukraine, after US President Joe Biden gave Kyiv the green light to use US missiles against military targets in Russia itself.</p>

<p>Kyiv has repeatedly urged Germany to send it Taurus missiles, which have a reach of more than 500 kilometres (310 miles) -- a plea Berlin has steadfastly refused.</p>

<p>"I have explained very clearly why I do not think it is right to supply Taurus cruise missiles," Scholz said on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Brazil.</p>

<p>Scholz said it was important to support Ukraine's defence against Russia's full-scale invasion while acting "prudently".</p>

<p>The missiles could only be used if "responsibility for targeting" was shared, Scholz said, a move he has previously stressed would risk drawing Germany directly into the war.</p>

<p>"That is something that I cannot take responsibility for," Scholz said Monday in Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<p>"We have a clear understanding that the powerful weapons we have supplied so far, the long-range artillery, the rocket launchers, cannot be used to penetrate deep into the Russian hinterland."</p>

<p>But Britain's former defence minister Ben Wallace urged Scholz to "now reconsider his rather stubborn and clumsy opposition to using Taurus, which just makes him look odd compared to the French and British".</p>

<p>The German leader "clearly doesn't understand deterrence", Wallace told Britain's Times Radio.</p>

<p>The Conservative ex-minister added many will be relieved once Germany's elections are over -- the country will go to the polls in February after Scholz's coalition collapsed, with the chancellor's party trailing in opinion surveys.</p>

<p>"Olaf Scholz is probably better suited to running a subcommittee of a planning committee in a local council than one of the biggest nations in Europe," Wallace said.</p>

<p>Berlin has been the second-biggest supplier of military aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russia's invasion and said earlier Monday it would supply Kyiv with 4,000 AI-guided drones.</p>

<p>Defence Minister Boris Pistorius told reporters at an event in the German state of Bavaria that the drones being provided could "take out the enemy's electronic drone defences".</p>

<p>The drones "can be delivered very quickly" and could be "deployed 30-40 kilometres (19-25 miles) behind the front line and hit combat posts, logistics hubs among other targets", Pistorius said.</p>

<p>Along some parts of the front line in Ukraine, such a distance would reach into Russian territory.</p>

<p>Despite the unmanned aerial vehicles being nicknamed "mini-Taurus" by the German media, the government was careful to point out they do not have the same range.</p>

<p>"These are tactical drones with a restricted range," defence ministry spokesman Natalie Jenning told reporters at a press conference on Monday.</p>

<p>"There is no connection to the Taurus (system) as has been sketched out in some of the media coverage," she added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India made a significant intervention on Monday during the '2024 Annual High-level Ministerial Roundtable on pre-2030 Ambition' at the COP29 UN Climate Change Summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, emphasising four critical aspects of global climate action.</p>

<p>India underscored the importance of addressing four key areas in global climate action: scaling up innovative actions and technology transfer, prioritising climate finance as central to implementing climate action, enhancing international cooperation, and fostering mutual trust among nations, according to a statement from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.</p>

<p>Leena Nandan, Secretary of the Environment, Forest and Climate Change Ministry and Deputy Leader of the Indian Delegation, highlighted findings from the 2024 Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) Synthesis Report. She noted that cumulative CO2 emissions between 2020 and 2030 are projected to consume 86% of the remaining carbon budget, as per the ministry's statement.</p>

<p>"Our discussions and deliberations are taking place at a crucial time when decisive action is imperative. The pre-2030 period is an opportunity to enhance global climate action," the statement read.</p>

<p>India emphasised that this ambitious, action-oriented approach depends on bold commitments from parties responsible for leading economy-wide emission reductions. Developed nations achieving net-zero targets would lay the groundwork for a sustainable and resilient world in the current and future decades.</p>

<p>The statement also stressed the importance of equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC), along with climate justice in science, policy, and practice. It highlighted the need to avoid burdening developing nations with the consequences of inadequate pre-2020 mitigation efforts and called for climate solutions that are both effective and equitable.</p>

<p>India further called for the scaling up of innovative actions through unrestricted technology transfer. "New technologies and solutions are critical for transitioning to a low-carbon economy, yet innovations in areas such as clean energy and carbon removal remain in their early stages, with significant barriers to scaling and transferring them to developing nations," the statement said.</p>

<p>The ministry also emphasised the importance of knowledge and technology transfer without Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) restrictions on green technologies, urging COP29 to deliver tangible outcomes on deploying technology in developing countries.</p>

<p>On climate finance, the statement highlighted a significant gap in funding for climate action, particularly in developing nations. "The first global stocktake of progress under the Paris Agreement shows a substantial shortfall in financing, which is essential for deploying clean energy, building disaster-resilient infrastructure, and implementing adaptation projects, requiring trillions of dollars," it stated.</p>

<p>India stressed that public climate finance from developed nations must fully cover the costs of deviations from least-cost development pathways for developing countries. "Failure to do so imposes additional burdens on people in developing nations, who already bear disproportionate impacts of climate change despite minimal contributions to the problem," the statement added.</p>

<p>India termed COP29 a "milestone" for climate finance, urging developed nations to fulfil long-standing commitments to provide substantial, equitable, and accessible financial resources.</p>

<p>On international cooperation, the statement noted that enhanced collaboration is essential for achieving measurable outcomes, including cost-effective and scalable mitigation solutions. However, it criticised the uneven nature of international cooperation, with some nations resorting to unilateral measures that transfer financial burdens to developing countries.</p>

<p>"There is a need to address the negative impacts of such unilateral trade measures on developing nations in the context of climate change," the statement said.</p>

<p>Highlighting mutual trust as a cornerstone in combating climate change, India asserted that COP29 offers developed nations a chance to build trust and achieve significant milestones in climate ambitions by 2030.</p>

<p>The ministry noted that while the 2024 NDC Synthesis Report raises concerns, it also provides hope. "195 parties have submitted their NDCs, with 180 updating them. Global greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 are estimated to be 2.6% lower than in 2019, suggesting a possible peak before 2030. With the next round of NDCs due next year, there is room for further improvement," India said at COP29.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US President Biden held a press conference in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil's Manaus but took no questions about America's decision to clear Ukraine to use its long-range missiles to strike inside Russia.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden, who is in Brazil to attend the G-20 Summit, announced a multimillion-dollar plan to "reforest the Amazon" on Sunday. Biden held a press conference in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil's Manaus, where he talked about conservation and the investments his administration has made in clean energy infrastructure. But, the US president took no questions about the United States's just-announced decision to clear Ukraine to use long-range American missiles to strike inside Russia in a major escalation of the conflict.</p>

<p>Following this, RT, the Russian state-controlled international news television network, posted a video of the US President appearing to "wander off" into the Amazon rainforest, on X (formally Twitter) and asked, "Where you going Joe?"</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Where you going Joe?<br />
<br />

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The clip showed outgoing US president Biden standing at a podium in a loose-fitting blue outdoor shirt and sunglasses. He suddenly turns, waves, and appears to walk right into the forest, rather than following the path in front of him.</p>

<p>"Biden finishes press conference, answers no questions, wanders off into the Amazon Jungle," &nbsp;the Russian state media portal said in the post on X.</p>

<p>This was the second post on RT's X handle in the last 24 hours, which seemed to be mocking Mr Biden's decision, giving the green signal to Kyiv to use American missiles against military targets inside Russia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier on Sunday, RT posted a screen grab of a media article on the Biden administration's big move. A graphics interchange format (gif) image of a smiling US President was superimposed on the article. Posting the graphic, RT wrote, "Joe Biden planning his final vacation as US president be like".&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>US Clears Kyiv To Use ATACMS Missiles</strong></h2>

<p>Acting on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's long-standing demand for authorisation to use the powerful Army Tactical Missile System-known by its initials ATACMS-the Biden administration has lifted restrictions on Kyiv's use of long-range missiles, allowing it to hit targets inside Russia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The move, which came weeks before Mr Biden left office, has angered the Kremlin. Accusing the US of "throwing oil on the fire", Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the decision would mean Washington's direct involvement in the conflict.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though there has been no official comment on the issue from the White House and incoming President Donald Trump, Mr Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, said: "The military-industrial complex seems to want to make sure they get World War III going before my father has a chance to create peace and save lives."</p>

<p>President-elect Trump, who is set to take office on January 20, repeatedly pledged during his election campaign to negotiate an end to the Ukraine war.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Delhi's hazardous air quality was a key focus at COP29, as experts warned about the health risks of air pollution and called for immediate global action.</p>

<p>Aarti Khosla, Director of Climate Trends, says that Delhi's Air Quality Index (AQI) had reached dangerous levels, with some areas recording particulate pollution above 1,000 microgram per cubic metre. "Pollution comes from many sources like black carbon, ozone, burning fossil fuels, and farm fires. We need solutions that tackle all of these," she said.</p>

<p>Khosla also explained that low wind speeds during the La Nina weather pattern are trapping pollutants in the air, making the situation worse. "While we discuss major global issues, millions of people's health is at risk. We must act fast," she said.</p>

<p>Courtney Howard, Vice-Chair of the Global Climate and Health Alliance, shared her experience from Canada, where wildfires forced the evacuation of 70 per cent of her population in 2023. "This was expensive, even for a rich country like ours. Poorer nations need financial help to deal with such disasters," she said.</p>

<p>Howard also criticised the lack of funds for health care, despite massive subsidies given to large corporations. "We are giving USD 1 trillion to corporations making huge profits, but we say there's no money for health care. We must fund health to protect everyone," she said.</p>

<p>Enkhun Byambadorj, Co-Founder of Breathe Mongolia, highlighted the serious air pollution problem in his country. "Children in cities have 40 per cent lower lung capacity compared to those in rural areas. The air we breathe is a choice we make as a society, but it's hurting our children's future," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ecuador on Monday declared a national emergency due to water shortages, drought and forest fires that have razed more than 10,000 hectares in the south of the country so far this month.</p>

<p>The state of emergency, approved by the environment ministry, will be in place for 60 days, the country's SNGR emergency management secretariat said in a statement.</p>

<p>It will allow the freeing of funds to tackle the multi-faceted crisis, including fires concentrated in the Azuay and Loja provinces, with 17 blazes reported active on Monday.</p>

<p>Eight firefighting helicopters -- three of them sent by Peru and Italy -- were combating fires, said the SNGR.</p>

<p>One of the worst fires was in the Cajas national park.</p>

<p>The South American country has been rationing electricity for months due to the worst drought it has faced in six decades.</p>

<p>Last month, scheduled rationing was lengthened from eight to 14 hours per day.</p>

<p>Low water levels have caused the reservoirs of hydroelectric plants that cover 70 percent of national demand to fall to critical levels, leaving the country to face an "unprecedented crisis," according to Energy Minister Ines Manzano.</p>

<p>According to the SNGR, between January and November, Ecuador reported more than 5,100 forest fires that claimed six lives and injured 45 people.</p>

<p>Fires have consumed some 40,000 hectares of crops and killed more than 44,000 farm animals, according to the government.</p>

<p>Authorities suspect arson in some of the fires, with several suspects identified to date, Cristian Zamora, the mayor of the Azuay capital, Cuenca, told the Ecuavisa broadcaster.</p>

<p>He said the fires may have been set to clear forest area for agriculture.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Russian missile attack killed 10 people and wounded 44 in Ukraine's Black Sea port of Odesa on Monday, local governor Oleh Kiper and national police said.</p>

<p>Four children were among the wounded while three people were in serious condition, Kiper said on the Telegram messenger.</p>

<p>President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Telegram that a Russian ballistic missile had hit a residential neighbourhood, and that an apartment building, a university building and an administrative building had been damaged.</p>

<p>"These are not random strikes - these are show strikes. After calls and meetings with Putin, after all the false gossip in the media about supposedly 'refraining' from strikes. Russia is showing what it is really interested in: only war," he said.</p>

<p>National police said that seven police officers, a medic and two residents had been killed, and 14 police officers were among the wounded.</p>

<p>Russia unleashed its largest overnight missile attack on Ukraine in almost three months on Sunday, killing seven people and further hobbling an already damaged energy system.</p>

<p>Later on, a Russian missile hit a residential building in the Sumy region, killing 11 including two children and wounding 89.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President-elect Donald Trump confirmed Monday that he plans to declare a national emergency on border security and use the US military to carry out a mass deportation of undocumented migrants.</p>

<p>Immigration was a top issue in the election campaign, and Trump has promised to deport millions and stabilize the border with Mexico after record numbers of migrants crossed illegally during President Joe Biden's administration.</p>

<p>On his social media platform Truth Social, Trump amplified a recent post by a conservative activist that said the president-elect was "prepared to declare a national emergency and will use military assets to reverse the Biden invasion through a mass deportation program."</p>

<p>Alongside the repost, Trump commented, "True!"</p>

<p>Trump sealed a remarkable comeback to the presidency in his November 5 defeat of Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>He has been announcing a cabinet featuring immigration hardliners, naming former Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting chief Tom Homan as his "border czar."</p>

<p>Homan appeared at the Republican National Convention in July, telling supporters: "I got a message to the millions of illegal immigrants that Joe Biden's released in our country: You better start packing now."</p>

<p>Authorities estimate that some 11 million people are living in the United States illegally. Trump's deportation plan is expected directly to impact around 20 million families.</p>

<p>While the US government has struggled for years to manage its southern border with Mexico, Trump has super-charged concerns by claiming an "invasion" is underway by migrants he says will rape and murder Americans.</p>

<p>During his campaign, Trump repeatedly railed against undocumented immigrants, employing incendiary rhetoric about foreigners who "poison the blood" of the United States and misleading his audiences about immigration statistics and policy.</p>

<p>Trump has not elaborated on his immigration crackdown in any detail but during his election campaign repeatedly vowed to invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to speed up deportations.</p>

<p>Critics say the law is outdated and point to its most recent use during World War II to hold Japanese-Americans in internment camps without due process.</p>

<p>The number of US border patrol encounters with migrants crossing from Mexico illegally is now about the same as in 2020, the last year of Trump's first term, after peaking at a record 250,000 for the month of December 2023.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The countries of the Global South are most adversely impacted by the food, fuel and fertilizer crisis caused by global conflicts, and G20 must focus on addressing the challenges, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday.</p>

<p>In an address on the first day of the G20 summit, PM Modi said India's G20 theme of "One Earth, One Family, One Future" is as relevant at the ongoing summit as it was last year.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden, PM Modi, Chinese President Xi Jinping and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer are among the leaders attending the two-day summit at Rio de Janeiro's Modern Art Museum.</p>

<p>The people-centric decisions taken at the G20 Summit in New Delhi last year have been taken forward during Brazil's presidency of the bloc, PM Modi said.</p>

<p>"I would like to say that countries of the Global South are most adversely impacted by the food, fuel and fertilizer crisis caused by global conflicts," he said.</p>

<p>"So our discussions can only be successful when we keep in mind the challenges and priorities of the Global South," he added.</p>

<p>The prime minister made the remarks at the G20 session on 'Social Inclusion and the Fight Against Hunger and Poverty'.</p>

<p>The opening day's highlight was the launch of a global alliance to combat poverty and hunger that has been supported by at least 80 nations.</p>

<p>In his comments, PM Modi also called for reform of the institutions of global governance.</p>

<p>"And just as we amplified the voice of the Global South by granting permanent membership of G20 to the African Union during the New Delhi summit, we will reform institutions of global governance," he said.</p>

<p>The prime minister said India supports Brazil's initiative for a 'global alliance against hunger and poverty'.</p>

<p>"The people-centric decisions taken at the G20 Summit in New Delhi have been taken forward during Brazil's Presidency," he said.</p>

<p>"It is a matter of great satisfaction that we prioritised SDG (sustainable development goals). We focused on inclusive development, women-led development, and youth power," he said.</p>

<p>"And gave wings to the hopes and aspirations of the Global South. It is clear that One Earth One Family One Future is as relevant at this summit as it was last year," he added.</p>

<p>The theme of India's G20 presidency is drawn from the ancient Sanskrit text of Maha Upanishad.</p>

<p>"Over the last 10 years, we have lifted 250 million people out of poverty," PM Modi said.</p>

<p>In line with the theme of the session, PM Modi also gave an overview of India's success in addressing hunger and poverty.</p>

<p>"Over 800 million people are being given food grains free of cost. 550 million people are benefiting from the world's biggest health insurance scheme," he said.</p>

<p>"Now, 60 million senior citizens, over the age of 70, will also be able to benefit from free health insurance," he said.</p>

<p>"Maintaining our focus on women-led development and social inclusion, over 300 million women micro-entrepreneurs have been linked to banks and given access to credit," PM Modi added.</p>

<p>The prime minister also spoke about India's crop insurance scheme.</p>

<p>"Under the world's largest crop insurance scheme, over 40 million farmers have received benefits worth 20 billion US dollars," he said.</p>

<p>"Under the farmers' scheme, assistance worth over 40 billion dollars has been given to 110 million farmers. Institutional credit worth 300 billion US dollars is being given to farmers," he said.</p>

<p>PM Modi said India is not only ensuring food security but also focusing on nutrition. He said New Delhi is also contributing to global food security by sending food items to various countries.</p>

<p>"The main reason for our success is our approach: 'back to basics' and 'march to the future'," he said.</p>

<p>"We have focused not only on natural farming and organic farming but also on new technologies. We have focused on sustainable agriculture, protection of the environment, nutrition and food security by promoting Sri Ann or millets," he said.</p>

<p>The prime minister said India has developed over 2000 climate-resilient crop varieties and has started the 'Digital Agriculture Mission'.</p>

<p>"India's digital public Infrastructure enabled social and financial inclusion. With the aspirational districts and blocks project, we created a new model for inclusive development that strengthens the weakest link," he said.</p>

<p>PM Modi began his visit to Brazil after concluding a two-day trip to Nigeria.<br />

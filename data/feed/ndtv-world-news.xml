       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 19-year-old has been detained in Austria for allegedly plotting to kill people outside a stadium at a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/austrian-police-disrupts-taylor-swift-concert-attack-plot-seizes-chemicals-6291225" target="_blank">Taylor Swift concert</a>, prompting the cancellation of the pop superstar's three shows in Vienna this week.</p>

<p>Two other teenagers have been identified as suspects.</p>

<p>Here is what security officials have said about the three.</p>

<h3><strong>THE 19-YEAR-OLD</strong></h3>

<p>The Austrian national with North Macedonian roots was arrested in the early hours of Wednesday during a police operation at his home in Ternitz, a town near the Hungarian border.</p>

<p>The teen, who had posted a video online confessing to the plot, quit his job on July 25, telling people that he "had big plans", public security chief Franz Ruf told reporters on Thursday.</p>

<p>The suspect had recently changed his appearance and had been consuming and sharing Islamist propaganda online, security officials said, adding that he had pledged allegiance to Islamic State but also held sympathies for Al Qaeda.</p>

<p>A neighbour told Austrian broadcaster Puls24 that the young man kept himself to himself and that he had grown a "Taliban beard".</p>

<p>During a search of his home, law enforcement authorities secured various substances and tools used for building bombs, as well as Islamic State propaganda, 21,000 euros ($23,000) in counterfeit money, machetes, knives and blank ammunition.</p>

<p>The Kurier newspaper, citing sources familiar with the situation, reported that the suspect had stolen the chemicals from his former workplace, a metal processing company also in Ternitz. Officials did not comment on where he got the chemicals from, adding that this was a focus of their investigation.</p>

<h3><strong>THE 17-YEAR-OLD</strong></h3>

<p>After initially being tipped off to a single suspect, Austrian investigators came across the other two, including a 17-year-old Austrian national with Turkish-Croatian roots who was arrested in Vienna on Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>He had been acting conspicuously in the area of the Ernst Happel Stadium, where Swift's stadium shows had been due to take place on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.</p>

<p>The 17-year-old had been given a job with a company a few days ago that was providing services at the stadium.</p>

<p>The boy, who also appears to have been radicalised and was already known to authorities, had recently broken up with his girlfriend, Ruf said.</p>

<p>He is still to make a statement to police so his exact role in the plot is unclear, but he had extensive contact with the main suspect, officials said.</p>

<h3><strong>THE 15-YEAR-OLD</strong></h3>

<p>The third and final suspect is an Austrian national with Turkish heritage.</p>

<p>During questioning, the youngster said the main suspect had changed considerably in recent months and had also regularly enquired about devices to ignite explosives, officials said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Chinese-American scholar, who projected himself as a pro-democracy activist, has been convicted by a US court of using his reputation to gather information on dissidents and sharing it with the Chinese government.</p>

<p>lwithout notifying the US attorney general. A federal jury in New York delivered the verdict on Tuesday, The Guardian reported.</p>

<p>The 75-year-old lived a double life for over a decade at the behest of China's main intelligence agency, the Ministry of State Security, the prosecutors said.</p>

<p>In an opening statement last month, US attorney Ellen Sise said that Wang pretended to be opposed to the Chinese government to "get close to people who were actually opposed to the Chinese government”.</p>

<p>“And then, the defendant betrayed those people, people who trusted him, by reporting information on them to China," Sise noted.<br />
<br />
<strong>'Plot of a spy novel'</strong></p>

<p>Wang was convicted of providing the contact information of prominent dissidents to the intelligence agency in his homeland. He further lied to federal law enforcement officers about the scheme. The jury found him guilty on four counts following the week-long trial in the Brooklyn federal court, Reuters reported.</p>

<p>“The indictment could have been the plot of a spy novel, but the evidence is shockingly real,” Breon Peace, the US attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a statement on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Wang was willing to betray those who respected and trusted him," Peace noted.<br />
<br />
Wang faces up to 25 years in prison, when he is to be sentenced on January 9 next year.<br />
<br />
<strong>Who is Shujun Wang?</strong><br />
<br />
Wang, an American citizen, has been settled in New York since the 1990s after his stint as a visiting university scholar of East Asian studies, The New York Times reported.</p>

<p>To commemorate figures linked to the 1989 Tiananmen Square uprising, he helped found a pro-democracy group in 2006 in the Flushing neighbourhood of Queens.</p>

<p>Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang Memorial Foundation is named for two leaders of the Chinese Communist Party in the 1980s. As per its official website, the group's mission is to promote China's "constitutional transformation.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, prosecutors said that Wang used his position and status among the Chinese community to act as a “covert intelligence asset in his own community,” since at least 2006.</p>

<p>Wang, according to the prosecutors, was ordered to collect information about topics and people the Chinese government deemed undesirable. Later, he passed on this information to his handlers via in-person meetings as well as written correspondence, including “diaries,” describing his interactions with prominent activists</p>

<p>Ellen Sise, in the opening statements, noted that Wang led a "double life".&nbsp;</p>

<p>“He portrayed himself as an academic and a pro-democratic activist... Appearances can be deceiving,” she said.</p>

<p>Wang emigrated to the US in 1994. He was arrested by officials in March 2022.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian prosecutors have requested a 15-year prison sentence for a dual US-Russian national charged with "treason" for making a donation to a pro-Ukraine organisation.</p>

<p>The FSB security service said in February it had arrested ballerina Ksenia Karelina, who lives in the United States and was visiting family in Russia, accusing her of providing financial assistance to the Ukrainian army.</p>

<p>"The state prosecutor asked the court to sentence Karelina to 15 years in prison," the Sverdlovsk Regional Court in the Urals city of Ekaterinburg said in a statement Thursday.</p>

<p>Her lawyer, Mikhail Mushailov, also confirmed the 15-year request in a post on his Instagram account.</p>

<p>Karelina donated around $50 to a US-based pro-Ukraine charity after Russia launched its full-scale military offensive in 2022, US media reported, citing her family and employer.</p>

<p>Russia's FSB security service accused her of collecting money that was "used to purchase tactical medical supplies, equipment, weapons and ammunition for the Ukrainian armed forces."</p>

<p>"The defendant pleaded guilty," the court said in its statement.</p>

<p>The verdict will be delivered next Thursday.</p>

<p>Russian courts almost always side with the prosecution, and acquittals in treason cases are almost unheard of.</p>

<p>Moscow has launched dozens of criminal cases against Russian citizens it accuses of supporting or collaborating with Kyiv.</p>

<p>Karelina, who is in her early 30s and worked in Los Angeles, is just one of a string of US citizens and dual nationals that have also been targeted.</p>

<p>Last week Russia released three of them -- journalists Evan Gershkovich and Alsu Kurmasheva, as well as ex-marine Paul Whelan -- in the largest East-West prisoner swap since the Cold War.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel committed a costly "strategic mistake" with its killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last week, Iran's acting foreign minister told AFP in an interview on Thursday.</p>

<p>"The act that the Zionists carried out in Tehran was a strategic mistake because it will cost them gravely," Ali Bagheri said one day after attending an extraordinary session of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in the Saudi coastal city of Jeddah.</p>

<p>Although Israel has not commented on Haniyeh's death, Iran has vowed to retaliate, setting the region on edge.</p>

<p>Bagheri accused Israel of wanting "to expand tension, war and conflict to other countries," while asserting it was not in a position to fight Iran.</p>

<p>"The Zionists are in no position to start a war against the Islamic Republic of Iran," he said.</p>

<p>"They neither have the capacity nor the strength."</p>

<p>The meeting on Wednesday of foreign ministers from the 57-member OIC produced a declaration holding Israel "fully responsible" for the "heinous" killing of Haniyeh, who lived in Qatar and was a major player in talks to end the war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>The war began with Hamas's October 7 attacks on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Palestinian militants seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 39 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,699 people, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.</p>

<p>Hamas's Lebanese ally Hezbollah has also pledged to retaliate for Haniyeh's killing and that of its military commander Fuad Shukr in an Israeli strike in Beirut hours earlier.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China's anti-doping agency on Thursday called for an independent probe into its US counterpart after a media investigation found that American authorities allowed athletes who failed drug tests to continue to compete.</p>

<p>The report by the Reuters news agency on Wednesday said the global and US anti-doping authorities were in disagreement over the American side's tactic of allowing athletes who tested positive for banned substances to avoid prosecution in return for giving undercover information on other drug cheats.</p>

<p>The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) said the strategy by the US authority (USADA) was "in direct contravention of the World Anti-Doping Code" and "threatened the integrity of sporting competition".</p>

<p>The China Anti-Doping Agency (CHINADA) said Thursday that it "strongly calls for an independent investigation into USADA's cover-up of serious violations" of the code designed to prevent athletes from taking illicit substances that improve performance.</p>

<p>"USADA's practice... seriously damaged fair competition in sports and the rights and interests of clean athletes, and showed that its anti-doping work lacked transparency," CHINADA said.</p>

<p>It added that the revelations showed the US exercised "double standards" in criticising alleged doping by other countries while "turning a blind eye" to its own issues.</p>

<p>Chinese and American sports authorities have traded barbs since a separate media investigation in April found 23 Chinese swimmers tested positive for a banned substance before the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 but were still allowed to compete.</p>

<p>They were not punished because WADA accepted the argument of Chinese authorities that the positive results were caused by contaminated food.</p>

<p>The disclosures brought widespread criticism of WADA, particularly from the US, which infuriated China by accusing the global governing body of a cover-up.</p>

<p>CHINADA said in a separate statement earlier Thursday that US track and field athletes were plagued by "systemic" doping abuses.</p>

<p>It cited the case of American sprinter Erriyon Knighton, who tested positive for a banned substance in March but was cleared to compete in Paris after an independent arbitrator ruled that the result likely came from contaminated meat.</p>

<p>Knighton has qualified for Thursday's Olympic 200m final in Paris.</p>

<p>CHINADA called for more tests on American track and field athletes, alleging "deep-rooted stains in... US athletics and USADA's repeated disregard for procedures and standards".</p>

<p>CHINADA provided no evidence that American athletes currently at the Games had failed doping tests.</p>

<p>The US tops the Olympics medals table with 27 golds, just ahead of China on 25.</p>

<p>China named 11 of the swimmers implicated in the doping scandal in their Paris Olympics team. China's swimmers finished with 12 medals -- two gold, three silver and seven bronze.</p>

<p>CHINADA said in June that it would "never" agree to a US demand to release details of its investigation into the 23 swimmers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is "increasingly likely" 2024 will be the hottest year on record, despite July ending a 13-month streak of monthly temperature records, the EU's climate monitor said Thursday.</p>

<p>The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said last month was the second warmest on record books going back to 1940, only slightly cooler than July 2023.</p>

<p>Between June 2023 and June 2024, each month eclipsed its own temperature record for the time of year.</p>

<p>"The streak of record-breaking months has come to an end, but only by a whisker," said Samantha Burgess, deputy director of C3S.</p>

<p>Last month the global average temperature was 16.91 degrees Celsius, only 0.04C below July 2023, according to C3S's monthly bulletin.</p>

<p>But "the overall context hasn't changed, our climate continues to warm," said Burgess.</p>

<p>"The devastating effects of climate change started well before 2023 and will continue until global greenhouse gas emissions reach net zero," she said.</p>

<p>From January to July global temperatures were 0.70C above the 1991-2020 average.</p>

<p>This anomaly would need to drop significantly over the rest of this year for 2024 not to be hotter than 2023 -- "making it increasingly likely that 2024 is going to be the warmest year on record", said C3S.</p>

<p><strong>'Too hot to handle'</strong></p>

<p>July 2024 was 1.48C warmer than the estimated average temperatures for the month during the period 1850-1900, before the world started to rapidly burn fossil fuels.</p>

<p>This has translated into punishing heat for hundreds of millions of people.</p>

<p>The Earth experienced its two hottest days on record with global average temperatures at a virtual tie on July 22 and 23 reaching 17.6C, C3S said.</p>

<p>The Mediterranean was gripped by a heatwave scientists said would have been "virtually impossible" without global warming as China and Japan sweated through their hottest July on record.</p>

<p>Record-breaking rainfall pummelled Pakistan, wildfires ravaged western US states and Hurricane Beryl left a trail of destruction as it swept from the Caribbean to the southeast of the United States.</p>

<p>"The end of record-breaking monthly temperatures is not cause for celebration," said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at London's Imperial College.</p>

<p>Otto described the heat-related deaths of 21 people in a single day in Morocco in July as "a shocking illustration of just how deadly extreme heat can be".</p>

<p>"To stop climate change, we need to stop burning fossil fuels, stop deforestation and replace them with renewable energy. We have all the technology and know-how to do that... We just lack the political will," she said.</p>

<p>Temperatures for the oceans, which absorb 90 percent of the excess heat caused by human activities, were also the second warmest on record for the month of July.</p>

<p>Average sea surface temperatures were 20.88C last month, only 0.01C below July 2023.</p>

<p>This marked the end of a 15-month period of tumbling heat records for the oceans.</p>

<p>However, scientists at C3S noted that "air temperatures over the ocean remained unusually high over many regions" despite a swing from the El Nino weather pattern that helped fuel a spike in global temperatures to its opposite La Nina, which has a cooling effect.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General Celeste Saulo reflected on a year of "widespread, intense and extended heatwaves".</p>

<p>"This is becoming too hot to handle," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the hills of the Contessa Entellina vineyard in western Sicily, the harvest is already well underway, the grapes ripening earlier than usual because of drought and high temperatures.</p>

<p>The prestigious Donnafugata vineyards, which span the Italian island from the slopes of Marsala to the mantle of Mount Etna, began their harvest on July 22, an unprecedented two weeks early.</p>

<p>At Contessa Entellina, the company's main estate in the province of Agrigento, there has been almost no rain since May.</p>

<p>"Between October and the end of July, there has been 35 percent less rain," said Antonino Santoro, the estate's technical director and oenologist.</p>

<p>In 2022, the harvest had already begun on July 29.</p>

<p>The Sicily of myth is a fertile orchard blessed with rivers of pure water, but the modern day Mediterranean island suffers more and more from global warming.</p>

<p>Since the end of spring, water has stopped flowing, the soil and the springs parched.</p>

<p>Farmers here are used to the naturally arid territory, but they are being tested.</p>

<p>Even citrus fruits and olive trees are suffering from the drought and scorching temperatures which in 2021 set the European record of 48.8 degrees Centigrade (119.8 Fahrenheit).</p>

<h3><strong>Drop by drop</strong></h3>

<p>With 460 hectares of vines and 3.6 million bottles per year across all its territories, the Donnafugata company has the financial resources to adapt.</p>

<p>"Before, irrigation was useful, today it is essential," Santoro said.</p>

<p>Around Contessa Entellina the estate has installed several retention basins which meet around 75 percent of its irrigation needs, the rest covered by public reserves.</p>

<p>During June and July, it irrigates the vines using a micro-sprinkler system, which provides water at a rate of four litres per hour per vine.</p>

<p>"The aim is to optimise water use," said Giuseppe Milano, the estate's head of cultivation.</p>

<p>Irrigation is not cheap, costing between 4,000 and 6,000 euros per hectare per year. The average size of an Italian vineyard is 11 hectares.</p>

<p>At the end of July, the Italian government recognised Sicily was facing "force majeure conditions and exceptional circumstances" due to the drought, according to Sicilian authorities.</p>

<p>This eases some EU rules on agriculture and allows farmers to defer payments and charges, the region said, in response to a year-long drought it said was "one of the most serious in the last 50 years".</p>

<h3><strong>Quantity and quality</strong></h3>

<p>Donnafugata takes its name from the fictional town in "The Leopard", the novel by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa set in the area during the unification of Italy in the late 19th century.</p>

<p>Back then, the grape harvest did not begin before September.</p>

<p>As well as irrigation, Contessa Entellina adapts by growing its vines taller, up to 1.5 metres, so the upper foliage serves as a canopy to screen the grapes from the sun.</p>

<p>There is no such shade for the grape pickers, who use pruning shears to harvest the grapes under a blazing sun.</p>

<p>They started at dawn, and by 10:00am it is already 29 degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>For the first time, regional authorities have banned working in the fields during the hottest hours of the day, between 12:30 pm. and 4:00 pm.</p>

<p>They are now picking the Merlot grapes for red wine. The white Chardonnay ones were picked in July.</p>

<p>Depending on the varieties and the terroir, the grape harvest in Sicily this year will be spread out over three or four months -- "a unique situation in Europe", according to national agricultural association Coldiretti.</p>

<p>Contessa Entellina's harvest will be smaller than last year, with smaller grapes.</p>

<p>But Milano insisted that what it lacks in quantity is made up in quality.</p>

<p>Today, Donnafugata is involved in research projects to help prepare the vines for the evolving conditions.</p>

<p>"I am optimistic," said Santoro. "The vine adapts better than other crops."</p>

<p>It is not just heat that is affecting the harvest.</p>

<p>Last year, a combination of frost and floods in the north and mildew in the south cost the Italian wine industry a quarter of its production -- allowing France to take the title of the world's leading wine producer.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A 19-year-old IS sympathiser arrested in Austria was planning a suicide attack at a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna designed to kill many people, the intelligence agency said on Thursday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 19-year-old Islamic State sympathiser planned a suicide attack at a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna designed to kill many people, the country's intelligence agency said on Thursday.</p>

<p>Austrian authorities detained two suspects Wednesdsay for allegedly plotting to attack this week's Vienna concerts by the US star, which organisers cancelled at the last minute.</p>

<p>The 19-year-old main suspect had confessed, saying he "intended to carry out an attack using explosives and knives," domestic intelligence agency (DSN) head Omar Haijawi-Pirchner told a news conference.</p>

<p>"His aim was to kill himself and a large number of people during the concert... either today or tomorrow," he added. The concerts were to run from Thursday to Saturday.</p>

<p>The second suspect, a 17-year-old Austrian, was employed at a facility management company which would have "provided services" at the Ernst Happel Stadium where Swift was to perform, said Haijawi-Pirchner.</p>

<p>The younger suspect, who has so far refused to talk to authorities, was "in the area" of the stadium where he was detained, said Haijawi-Pirchner.</p>

<p>According to Interior Minister Gerhard Karner, a "tragedy was averted". "The situation was very serious", he added, particularly in view of a recent attack at a Taylor Swift themed event in Britain, where three girls were killed in Great Britain.</p>

<p>Explosives and detonators were found in a search of the main suspect's apartment, authorities said.</p>

<p><strong>Disappointed Swifties</strong></p>

<p>Austria's top security chief Franz Ruf told reporters the two suspects had recently made changes in their private lives,</p>

<p>The main suspect, an Austrian with Northern Macedonian roots, had changed "his appearance and adapted it to Islamic State propaganda", while the second, an Austrian of Turkish or Croatian origin, had broken up with his girlfriend, he said.</p>

<p>Ruf earlier confirmed that authorities had received information "from foreign partners" which led to the arrests, but he declined to specify.</p>

<p>Police had promised to ramp up security for the concerts while having minimised any concrete danger, but organisers still cancelled Swift's shows. About 65,000 people were expected at each show.</p>

<p>Swift did not immediately comment on the decision to cancel the Vienna shows but after the British attack said she was "completely in shock". Three girls were killed and five people seriously wounded in the mass stabbing at a dance class in Southport inspired by the American singer.</p>

<p>According to Ruf, police "did everything humanly possible to ensure" that the Vienna concerts "could go ahead", but the cancellation decision was taken by the organisers.</p>

<p>The 34-year-old star was to bring her record-breaking "Eras" Tour, which began its European leg in Paris in May, to Vienna on Thursday.</p>

<p>Following France, the tour stopped in Sweden, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Germany and Poland.</p>

<p>In Austria, more than 170,000 spectators were expected to attend the shows, bringing in some 100 million euros, according to estimates by the news agency APA.</p>

<p>By the end of the year, "Eras" had already become the first tour to sell more than $1 billion in tickets and it is on track to more than double that by the time it concludes in Vancouver in December.</p>

<p>Austria experienced its first deadly jihadist attack in November 2020, when a convicted IS sympathiser went on a shooting rampage in Vienna, killing four people and wounding 23 before police shot him dead.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Protests and bloodshed have toppled Sheikh Hasina's regime, but the way forward is far from certain. Here are four possible scenarios.</p>

<p>The uprising in Bangladesh has been a political earthquake. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in power for the last 15 years, has fled, and leaders of the ruling Awami League are in hiding or have also absconded.</p>

<p>Economist and Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus was picked by Bangladesh President Mohammed Shahabuddin to lead a new interim government. For the moment, a feeling of hope and elation has swept across much of the country.</p>

<p>But as with an earthquake, once the dust has settled, the foundations will remain largely the same as before.</p>

<p>To gauge where the country might move in the immediate and not-so-immediate future, there are a few fundamentals that need to be recognised.</p>

<p>The people who rose up consisted of students and some teachers, large groups of other young people, urban poor and political opposition groups. They represented widespread sentiments.</p>

<p>Dictatorial, violent and smug, Sheikh Hasina's regime was no longer able to deliver on its promise of economic development and criticism of her gross human rights violations became increasingly public and bold.</p>

<p>The popularity of the protests against Sheikh Hasina should not, however, obscure the fact that "the people" are not of one mind. The protests were driven by frustration and anger, not by any explicit alternative political vision.</p>

<p>There is also no formal organisation behind the uprising. It was an extremely powerful and driven movement, which may prove to be too exhausting to hold up in the long term.</p>

<p>All of this did happen suddenly, but in another sense it was building for a long time.</p>

<p>The country has seen several popular protest movements over the last decade - Shahbagh, Hefazat, road safety, no VAT on education, and the quota movement in 2018.</p>

<p>In addition, the low turnout in elections, low tax compliance and various other forms of foot-dragging and reluctance indicated that Sheikh Hasina's regime lacked widespread legitimacy.</p>

<p>Surveys have shown that an overwhelming majority of Bangladeshis want democracy, human rights and to be able to vote for their representatives - and to criticise them when called for. These are fundamental facts of the country.</p>

<p><strong>Who's who</strong></p>

<p>Politically, the Awami League is wounded but still alive.The opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party is a resilient organisation that has survived 18 years in oblivion and is now likely to win overwhelmingly in any free and fair election.</p>

<p>Similarly, because the centre ground of politics is still divided between BNP and the Awami League, there is little chance the Awami League will somehow just go away. Though its autocratic leader may have abandoned them, the party remains a network of people who will not cease to seek power.</p>

<p>But there is one big difference between the two parties - leadership.</p>

<p>BNP's exiled leader Tareque Rahman is still the legitimate heir and boss of the party, oddly reminiscent of 16th-century Mughal Emperor Humayun, who retained his claim to the throne during 15 years of exile.</p>

<p>The Awami League, on the other hand, has no apparent successor to Sheikh Hasina, who actively prevented any heir from emerging. It will take time for the party to rebuild.</p>

<p>There is one last (and perhaps most important) fundamental: all the other political forces are still there. First, Jamaat, Hefazat, the leftists and the voices of civil society. Although they all seek power and some are radical, few of them are strong. But they may provide a plank for Awami League members to abandon ship.</p>

<p>And there are the business leaders, top brass officials, military officers and judges - many of whom were appointed by Sheikh Hasina or benefitted from her regime. All will have interests to protect and changes in mind, but moderate ones.</p>

<p>If there is any lesson to be had from similar popular mobilisations in Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia or the Middle East, it is that those entrenched forces may prove to be much stronger and durable than street mobilisations, however much the demand persists for fundamental reform.</p>

<p><strong>Four future scenarios</strong></p>

<p>First is that sufficient power has been generated by the uprising for Yunus to ensure comprehensive reforms.</p>

<p>This would include the establishment of constitutional guarantees for free and fair elections. The first election will possibly be held in the coming months - under the watchful eyes of the military, a mobilised populace and civil society, as well as foreign allies.</p>

<p>The challenge is to ensure that the government that follows will not re-enact the Sheikh Hasina regime and prevent rivals from mounting an effective organisation and campaign.</p>

<p>In effect, the country will need a new caretaker government, as BNP and the opposition has demanded. This will likely benefit a reconstituted Awami League in the long run and be their best bet.</p>

<p>A second scenario is that Yunus proves to be politically naive and the power generated by the popular uprising dampens. Then the stage would be set for the seasoned warhorses of Bangladeshi politics and opportunistic generals and officials to run the show.</p>

<p>A third scenario is that there is no agreement on basic issues, the economy suffers, protests erupt in the streets and eventually Yunus is driven to resign. The generals would then take over for a while before they quickly organise an election, negotiate an agreement and effectively hand power to Rahman and BNP.</p>

<p>A final scenario is that the students form a political party and bring people from both BNP and Awami League and emerge as a potent political force by disrupting Bangladesh's traditional two-party structure.</p>

<p>The odds are perhaps stacked against them, but this would bode well for a long-lasting democratic transition for Bangladesh.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna today said former Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina's ouster from her country was "good" but the "violence now targeting Hindus was wrong".</p>

<p>"Bangladeshi students had just human rights concerns against PM Hasina. It's good she is gone. But the violence now targeting Hindus is wrong. PM Yunus must uphold the rule of law &amp; prevent the targeting of temples or people of any political party or faith from violence," Ro Khanna wrote in a post on X today.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina, 76, was forced to resign as Prime Minister on Monday after a month-long anti-government protest over a government jobs quota killed over 400.</p>

<p>Ms Hasina left Bangladesh capital Dhaka in a military aircraft for India post her resignation. Foreign Minister S Jaishankar yesterday said the government is giving time to Sheikh Hasina to "recover" and let them know about her next move.</p>

<p>Sources had earlier mentioned she wanted to leave for London and claim asylum, but this claim was dismissed by her son Sajeeb Wazed.</p>

<p>The Bangladesh Army formed an interim government in the country on Thursday, with Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus as its chief advisor.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[There is no update, yet, on Sheikh Hasina's future plans, the External Affairs Ministry said Thursday, days after the ousted Bangladeshi leader fled her country amid violent protests against her rule.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is no update, yet, on <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/sheikh-hasina" target="_blank">Sheikh Hasina</a>'s future plans, the External Affairs Ministry said Thursday, days after the Bangladeshi leader fled her country amid violent protests against her rule. "We do not have any update on her plan..." a ministry spokesperson said when asked when she will leave India.</p>

<p>The Ministry also said it continues to monitor all developments and hopes for an early end to the crisis in Bangladesh.&nbsp;The situation in that country is still evolving, the Ministry said.</p>

<p>Mrs Hasina - who resigned and left Dhaka hours before the Prime Minister's residence was overrun - was evacuated in a military aircraft and flown to an IAF base in Uttar Pradesh. She was expected to proceed onwards to claim political asylum in the United Kingdom, but there has been no news since.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bangladesh-violence-no-provision-for-what-uk-said-on-sheikh-hasina-asylum-reports-6275013#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll" target="_blank">British Home Office sources told NDTV</a> its rules do not allow people to travel to that country to seek asylum or temporary refuge. For now, Mrs Hasina is believed to be in the custody of Indian intelligence.</p>

<p>On Wednesday night Mrs Hasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed, told NDTV his mother had not made formal requests for asylum in any country, including India. "Reports about her requesting asylum are incorrect. She has not requested anywhere. So question of UK or US not responding yet is not true."</p>

<p><strong>READ |&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/sheikh-hasina-hasnt-sought-asylum-anywhere-her-son-tells-ndtv-6278880" target="_blank">Sheikh Hasina Hasn't Sought Asylum Anywhere, Her Son Tells NDTV</a></p>

<p>Mr Wazed is based in Washington, D.C. in the United States. Mrs Hasina left Bangladesh with her sister Sheikh Rehana, who is a UK citizen and whose daughter, Tulip Siddiqui is a Labour MP.</p>

<p>Mrs Hasina's daughter, Saima Wazed, is a Delhi-based senior World Health Organisation officer but a Twitter post suggests <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/sheikh-hasinas-resignation-heartbroken-that-i-cant-see-hug-her-sheikh-hasinas-daughter-6289024" target="_blank">she has not met her mother since her escape from Dhaka</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>Asylum In UK, US?</strong></h3>

<p>The UK has a record of giving refuge to prominent (and fleeing) political figures from the subcontinent, including Pakistani leaders Pervez Musharraf and Nawaz Sharif. It was not surprising, then to see Mrs Hasina linked to that country. But a Home Office spokesperson seemed to dismiss any such plan, saying individuals seeking asylum must do so "in the first safe country they reach".</p>

<p>The External Affairs Ministry did confirm that the minister and his British counterpart, David Lammy, "spoke about developments in Bangladesh and West Asia...", but would not offer details.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mrs Hasina's son may be US-based but the chances of her moving there are slim after Washington-Dhaka ties nosedived during her tenure. In fact, earlier this year, when her Awami League won the election, the State Department had said, "The United States remains concerned by the arrests of thousands of political opposition members and by reports of irregularities on elections day."</p>

<p>There are also reports Mrs Hasina's US visa has been cancelled.</p>

<h3><strong>Asylum In India?</strong></h3>

<p>Delhi also faces a diplomatic dilemma.</p>

<p>It does not want to be seen as backing Mrs Hasina because that could complicate ties with the incoming government of a strategic geopolitical partner. But her history with India must also be noted.</p>

<p>Long before she became PM, the Indira Gandhi government gave Mrs Hasina refuge after her whole family, including father Mujibur Rahaman, was assassinated during the 1975 unrest in Bangladesh.</p>

<h3><strong>Sheikh Hasina Retirement?</strong></h3>

<p>The former PM's son also told NDTV his mother is contemplating retirement after a political career spanning five terms as the head of Bangladesh's government. "She is done with politics in Bangladesh... my mother was planning to retire anyway, this was going to be her last term," he said.</p>

<p>The family, he added, is now planning to spend time together - where and how is yet to be worked out. "I am in Washington, my aunt is in London, my sister lives in Delhi... so we don't know, she might travel between the places," he said.</p>

<h3><strong>"Sheikh Hasina Arrived At Short Notice"</strong></h3>

<p>On Tuesday External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar made a brief statement in Parliament, in which he said the government had received, "at very short notice", Mrs Hasina's request to come to India.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar also told opposition MPs (at an all-party meet) the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/centre-calls-for-all-party-meet-over-bangladesh-s-jaishankar-to-attend-6273367" target="_blank">government is prepared to give Mrs Hasina more time</a> to work out her future.&nbsp;"The government will take appropriate action..." he said.</p>

<h3><strong>Bangladesh Interim Government</strong></h3>

<p>A 15-member interim government headed by Nobel Peace Prize winner Md Yunus will be sworn in later today. Mr Yunus, who flew to Dhaka from Europe last night, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/muhammad-yunus-ahead-of-oath-ceremony-bangladesh-got-second-independence-6291591" target="_blank">has claimed a&nbsp;"second independence"</a> for his country and called for restoration of order after weeks of violence that left at least 455 people dead.</p>

<p>The composition of the new government is unclear, but it is significant that Bangladesh President Mohammed Shahabuddin <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bangladesh-violence-bangladesh-ex-pm-khaleda-zia-freed-day-after-rival-sheikh-hasinas-ouster-6276150" target="_blank">ordered the release of Khaleda Zia</a>, her arch-rival and two-time former PM.</p>

<p>The Indian High Commissioner in Dhaka is likely to attend the swearing-in ceremony.</p>

<p>"I saw reports the swearing-in ceremony is to be held this evening. I don't know the exact time... Diplomatic community has been invited (and) it is likely that High Commissioner will participate."</p>

The 20-year-old, who failed to advance from the women's 100m butterfly heats on July 27, was reportedly asked to leave the athletes' village due to "inappropriate behaviour".</p>

<p>Alonso, who announced her retirement from swimming just a day after missing the semifinal qualification by 0.24 seconds - and weeks after getting a tattoo of the Olympic rings - allegedly left the village to visit Disneyland Paris instead of supporting her teammates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She faced additional criticism for allegedly "distracting" fellow competitors by socialising with other teams and wearing "revealing and skimpy" clothing in the village, rather than the official Paraguayan team attire.

<p>Larissa Schaerer, head of the Paraguayan Olympic Committee, confirmed Alonso was instructed to leave the premises, citing her behaviour as the reason for the decision. She stated that Alonso's presence was "creating an inappropriate atmosphere" within the Paraguay team. "We thank her for proceeding as instructed, as it was of her own free will that she did not spend the night in the Athletes' Village," the Committee boss said.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-is-luana-alonso-swimmer-kicked-out-of-olympic-village-for-inappropriate-conduct-6290596">Luana Alonso</a>, however, posted on Instagram that she was never removed or expelled from anywhere, urging people to "stop spreading false information."</p>

<p>"I don't want to give any statement but I'm not going to let lies affect me either."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beyond her Olympic endeavours, Alonso is a student at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas, where she is a member of the women's swimming and diving team. Previously, she spent a semester at Virginia Tech. Alonso first gained international recognition at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, where she represented Paraguay at just 17 years old and finished 28th. Following a narrow miss of semifinal qualification by 0.24 seconds at the Paris Olympics, Alonso announced her surprise retirement from competitive swimming.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a social media video, she slammed the Paraguayan Olympic Committee's treatment of athletes, claiming they aimed to "humiliate her".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"They threaten me that they are going to publish a statement that I am going to leave because of universality. They want to humiliate me and say it is not a big deal that you are leaving because of universality," Alonso said, referencing the system designed to increase the diversity of participating nations at the Olympics. "It's not a pleasure to represent Paraguay, and if it were up to me, I would go back to college."</p>

<p>Committee President Camilo Perez responded, stating that Alonso's times wouldn't qualify her for the Olympics as a member of Team USA. "She has to train a lot more to represent the USA; her times have to be much better," Perez stated.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A renowned British crocodile expert has been sentenced to 10 years and five months in prison for raping, torturing, and killing numerous dogs. Adam Britton, a zoologist based in Darwin, Australia, admitted to 56 charges of bestiality and animal cruelty in the Northern Territory (NT) Supreme Court last September. He also pleaded guilty to four counts of accessing and distributing child abuse material, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c33nv8x64mlo"><em>BBC</em></a> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Britton, 52, whose sentencing had faced multiple delays, was additionally banned for life from owning or purchasing animals, according to Australian media reports. His crimes involved the torture and exploitation of 42 dogs, resulting in the deaths of 39, which he recorded inside a shipping container on his property.</p>

<p>Britton will not be eligible for parole for six years, as reported by <em>ABC</em>. Chief Justice Michael Grant, who described Britton's crimes as "grotesque" and "unspeakable," excused court officers during the sentencing and warned the gallery that the details of the offences could cause "nervous shock or other adverse psychological reactions."</p>

<p>Despite his reluctance, the judge stated it was necessary to provide a representative overview of Britton's actions for sentencing purposes. The court previously heard that Britton had a "sadistic sexual interest" in animals, particularly dogs. In addition to torturing his own pets, he also acquired animals from unsuspecting pet owners in the Darwin region.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Marty Aust told the court that Britton often developed a rapport with dog owners, many of whom were reluctantly forced to rehome their pets due to travel or work commitments.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A little over two weeks ago, Donald Trump's presidential campaign had visions of an expansive national strategy that would result in a landslide victory in November.</p>

<p>Now, as they struggle to blunt a surging Kamala Harris, who swiftly replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic Party's presidential candidate last month, campaign advisers say they are recalibrating to protect states once thought of as safe and narrowing ambitions for the electoral map.</p>

<p>While top Trump advisers once saw a chance for an electoral blowout - with Democratic-leaning states like Minnesota and Virginia in play - the elevation of Harris has prompted Republicans to refocus on a narrower path to victory that runs through traditional battleground states like Pennsylvania and Georgia.</p>

<p>"The race has changed," Corey Lewandowski, a longtime adviser to the former president, told Reuters, though he said the race still favors Trump. "There's a lot of us that wanted to very actively run against Joe Biden. We felt very good about our race."</p>

<p>Publicly, Trump and his allies have tried vigorously to cast Harris, a Californian, as an out-of-touch liberal and link her to unpopular Biden policies on immigration and inflation. They say it matters little whether they are facing Biden or Harris.</p>

<p>Internally, nine sources told Reuters they see Harris as a far tougher opponent than Biden, who had been struggling for months in the face of doubts about his mental acuity and weakening poll numbers.</p>

<p>"It doesn't change the map as much as shrink it. Now there's no reason to talk about places like New Jersey anymore," said a member of the Trump campaign, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal campaign matters.</p>

<p>Reuters interviewed 12 campaign staff, advisers and donors who described a campaign that is grasping for a fresh strategy as it confronts a younger, more dynamic Democratic candidate who has energized the Democratic base and raised hundreds of millions of dollars in a matter of days.</p>

<p>"It's clear to everyone she could win," said one senior Trump adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to more freely discuss internal deliberations.</p>

<p>When asked about the prospects of a shrinking battleground map, the Trump team said its strategy hadn't changed since Harris became the Democratic candidate.</p>

<p>"Team Trump has ads in every battleground state, we have expanded the political map to include traditional 'blue states' like Minnesota and Virginia with staff on the ground," Republican Party spokesperson Anna Kelly said.</p>

<p>Ammar Moussa, a Harris campaign spokesman, said Trump and Vance were taking the country backwards, while Harris was taking the country forwards. He did not address the electoral map.</p>

<p>The Trump sources Reuters spoke to pointed to three issues: delays in rolling out attack ads against Harris, which are seen as key for pointing out an opponent's perceived weaknesses; doubts among some Republican leaders and donors over the selection of Senator JD Vance as running mate; and concerns over Trump himself as he tramples over his advisers' efforts to define Harris based on her policy positions.</p>

<p>One source said the anti-Harris ads had been slow to air in part because the material had to be run by focus groups first.</p>

<p>The campaign also wanted to see who Harris would pick as her running mate, according to the source briefed on the plans.</p>

<p>Harris this week announced Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a plain-speaking midwesterner, as her vice presidential candidate.</p>

<p><strong>MAY MEMO</strong></p>

<p>By late May, the Trump campaign had started gaming out the possibility that Harris or another Democrat could replace Biden at the top of the ticket, according to an internal memo from campaign staffer Austin McCubbin shared with senior advisers.</p>

<p>The 12-page memo, which was reviewed by Reuters, outlined the Democratic Party's rules for replacing a presidential candidate and possible scenarios, including Biden stepping down voluntarily and an "insider rebellion."</p>

<p>The memo did not detail how to respond to a Harris candidacy.</p>

<p>Tony Fabrizio, a Trump campaign pollster, predicted in a memo released to the press last month that Harris would enjoy a short-term polling boost, but that the race would then settle down. "Harris' 'honeymoon' will end and voters will refocus on her role as Biden's partner and co-pilot," he wrote in the memo.</p>

<p>In the lead-up to Biden's exit, the Trump-aligned MAGA Inc super PAC readied a TV ad accusing Harris of covering up Biden's infirmity. It began airing in four swing states on July 21, the day Biden announced that he was ending his reelection campaign.</p>

<p>At the same time, the campaign found itself on the defensive over Trump's selection of Vance as his running mate.</p>

<p>Vance has faced a wave of negative press over past comments referring to some Democrats, including Harris, as "a bunch of childless cat ladies," an insult seen as misogynistic and dismissive of people without children.</p>

<p>The Republican National Committee and the campaign have been fielding calls from some donors who fear Vance has become a distraction and is dragging the ticket down, according to two sources aware of the calls.</p>

<p>As the campaign focuses on a smaller map, Vance is expected to spend more time in relatively conservative and rural places, particularly in Rust Belt states, like Michigan and Pennsylvania, where his rural roots and concerns about industrial decay are more likely to resonate with voters, according to four sources close to the campaign or vice presidential candidate.</p>

<p>This week, Vance has held press conferences near Harris-Walz campaign events in Wisconsin and Michigan.</p>

<p><strong>TRUMP ATTACKS HARRIS - AND HIS ALLIES</strong></p>

<p>And then there is Trump's resort to name-calling instead of focusing on Harris' policy positions. Trump has cycled furiously through a series of personal insults against Harris. Those efforts have generated negative headlines - about Trump, rather than Harris.</p>

<p>At an event for the National Association of Black Journalists last week, Trump questioned whether Harris - whose mother was born in India and whose father was born in Jamaica - was actually Black. That left donors and aides baffled and alarmed, according to a Republican donor, an operative at a pro-Trump super PAC spending group, and a Trump-supporting union leader.</p>

<p>Three days later, Trump attacked Georgia's Republican governor, Brian Kemp, at a rally, possibly alienating a popular figure in a battleground state where Trump could need help mobilizing voters to the polls.</p>

<p>Trump has also been firing off multiple, convoluted missives on his Truth Social app, including one on Tuesday in which he mused about Biden returning to the top of the ticket.</p>

<p>In the spring and earlier this summer, as public opinion polls showed Trump expanding his lead over Biden in battleground states, the former president did events in what had been considered safe Democratic areas - Minnesota, Virginia, even New York City - in a bid to expand the electoral map.</p>

<p>By last Saturday, Trump was back to basics: campaigning in Georgia, where polls showed the race had tightened after Harris' entry.</p>

<p>The state is going to be fiercely competitive, with Trump clinging to a slight edge thanks to support from some Black voters, said Mark Rountree, a Georgia pollster who is not affiliated with either campaign.</p>

<p>And Trump is getting outspent on campaign ads in battleground states, according to AdImpact, a firm that tracks campaign ad spending.</p>

<p>Harris and affiliated committees have outspent Trump and his allies $112 million to $70.1 million on ads since July 22, according to AdImpact data, although Trump has matched Harris' outlays in Pennsylvania, perhaps the most crucial state for each side.</p>

<p>In terms of future reservations of TV air time, Harris and her allies are swamping Trump $172.4 million to $71.8 million as of this week, the firm said, although those figures are likely to change in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Perhaps most telling was the Trump campaign's significant new ad buy in North Carolina, which had looked likely to remain Republican until Harris' ascension energized Black and young voters.</p>

<p>"They're putting money in there now in the hope she decides to leave it alone," said Justin Sayfie, a Republican lobbyist and Trump fundraiser.</p>

<p>However, the Harris campaign is already up on the air in the state.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian internet monitoring services reported thousands of glitches in the availability of video hosting site YouTube on Thursday, amid escalating criticism of the platform by the Russian authorities.</p>

<p>Russian internet monitoring service Sboi.rf said that there had been thousands of glitches reported about YouTube in Russia. Users said they could only access YouTube via virtual private networks (VPNs).</p>

<p>"YouTube is not working," one anonymous user said in comments on the site.</p>

<p>Reuters reporters in Russia were unable to access YouTube. The website remained available via some mobile devices.</p>

<p>YouTube download speeds have notably slowed in recent weeks, for which Russian lawmakers have blamed YouTube owner Alphabet's Google, something the company disputes.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus returned to Bangladesh Thursday to lead a caretaker government after a student-led uprising ended the 15-year rule of Sheikh Hasina.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus returned to Bangladesh Thursday to lead a caretaker government after a student-led uprising ended the 15-year rule of Sheikh Hasina.</p>

<p>Yunus touched down in Dhaka on a flight from Paris via Dubai shortly after 2:00 pm (0800 GMT) and could be sworn in as the country's new leader as soon as Thursday evening to begin what the army chief has vowed will be a "beautiful democratic process".</p>

<p>The prospect of Yunus, 84, standing alongside military leaders was almost unimaginable a week ago when security forces fired deadly rounds at protesters who took to the streets demanding that Hasina resign.</p>

<p>But the military turned on Hasina at the weekend and she was forced to flee to neighbouring India -- as millions of Bangladeshis celebrated her demise.</p>

<p>The military then agreed to student demands that Yunus -- who won the Nobel in 2006 for his pioneering microfinancing work -- lead an interim government.</p>

<p>"I'm looking forward to going back home, see what's happening and how we can organise ourselves to get out of the trouble we are in," Yunus told reporters in Paris as he left for Dhaka.</p>

<h3><strong>'Get ready'</strong></h3>

<p>The veteran academic had travelled abroad this year while on bail after being sentenced to six months in jail on a charge condemned as politically motivated, and which a Dhaka court on Wednesday acquitted him of.</p>

<p>Yunus was hit with more than 100 criminal cases and a smear campaign by a state-led Islamic agency that accused him of promoting homosexuality, with courts accused of rubber-stamping decisions by ousted Hasina's government.</p>

<p>Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman said he backed Yunus and hoped he would be sworn in to lead the interim government on Thursday evening.</p>

<p>"I am certain that he will be able to take us through a beautiful democratic process," Waker said.</p>

<p>Yunus said he wanted to hold elections "within a few" months.</p>

<h3><strong>'Seismic moment'</strong></h3>

<p>Few other details about the planned government have been released, including the role of the military.</p>

<p>But Bangladeshis voiced hope as they joined a rally in Dhaka on Wednesday for the former opposition Bangladesh National Party (BNP).</p>

<p>"I expect that a national government will be formed with everyone's consent in a beautiful way," Moynul Islam Pintu told AFP.</p>

<p>"I expect that the country is run in a nice way, and the police force is reformed so that they can't harass people."</p>

<p>Hasina, 76, who had been in power since 2009, quit on Monday as hundreds of thousands of people flooded the streets of Dhaka.</p>

<p>Jubilant crowds later looted her palace.</p>

<p>Monday's events were the culmination of more than a month of unrest, which began as protests against a plan for quotas in government jobs but morphed into an anti-Hasina movement.</p>

<p>Hasina, who was accused of rigging the January elections and widespread human rights abuses, deployed security forces to quash the protests.</p>

<p>At least 455 people were killed in the unrest, according to an AFP tally based on police, government officials and hospital doctors.</p>

<p>"The protests are a seismic moment in Bangladesh history," said International Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean.</p>

<p>"The country really had been at risk of becoming a one-party state, and through a peaceful street-based movement led by, Gen Z students in their 20s, they've managed to force her from power."</p>

<h3><strong>Military move</strong></h3>

<p>The military's switching of allegiance was the decisive factor in her demise.</p>

<p>It has since acceded to a range of other demands from the student leaders.</p>

<p>The president dissolved parliament on Tuesday, a key demand of the students and the BNP.</p>

<p>The head of the police force, which protesters have blamed for leading Hasina's crackdown, was sacked on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The new chief, Mainul Islam, offered an apology on Wednesday for the conduct of officers and vowed a "fair and impartial investigation" into the killings of "students, common people and the police".</p>

<p>Ex-prime minister and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, 78, was also released from years of house arrest, while some political prisoners were freed.</p>

<p>The military has demoted some generals seen as close to Hasina and sacked Ziaul Ahsan, a commander of the feared Rapid Action Battalion paramilitary force.</p>

<p>Police said mobs had launched revenge attacks on officers and Hasina's allies, and also freed more than 500 inmates from a prison.</p>

<p>Protesters broke into parliament and torched TV stations. Others smashed statues of Hasina's father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country's independence hero.</p>

<p>Since Tuesday, however, streets in the capital have been largely peaceful.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus on Thursday paid tribute to those killed in Bangladesh's deadly protests that toppled Sheikh Hasina's government, saying their sacrifices had brought the nation a "second independence".</p>

<p>"Today is a glorious day for us," he told reporters at the airport in Dhaka shortly after returning to the country to lead a caretaker government.</p>

<p>"Bangladesh has created a new victory day. Bangladesh has got a second independence."</p>

<p>Yunus called for the restoration of order after weeks of violence that left at least 455 people dead, calling on citizens to guard each other, including minorities who came under attack.</p>

<p>"Law and order is our first task... We cannot take a step forward unless we fix the law and order situation," he said.</p>

<p>"My call to the people is; if you have trust in me, then make sure there will be no attacks against anyone, anywhere in the country."</p>

<p>Yunus, 84, could be sworn in as the country's new leader as soon as Thursday evening.</p>

<p>"Every person is our brother... our task is to protect them," he said, adding that "the whole of Bangladesh is one big family".</p>

<p>He choked with emotion as he recalled the killing of student activist Abu Sayeed, shot dead in July by police from close range.</p>

<p>He paid tribute to the youth who sparked the protest movement and those who risked all for their desire for change.</p>

<p>"They protected the nation and gave it a new life", he said. "Because of them, Bangladesh has got a second independence."</p>

<p>The prospect of Yunus standing alongside military leaders was almost unimaginable a week ago, when security forces fired deadly rounds at protesters who took to the streets demanding Hasina step down.</p>

<p>The veteran economist also said it must be the young generation who build the nation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Bangladesh can be a beautiful country, but we destroyed the possibilities," he said.</p>

<p>"Now we have to build a seedbed again -- the new seedbed will be built by them," he said, gesturing to the young student supporters surrounding him at the podium as he spoke.</p>

<p>"We can move forward in building a new Bangladesh very quickly", he said, dressed in a knee-length purple kurta shirt and white waistcoat, adding with a smile: "We have started today."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Tens of thousands of North Koreans have fled to South Korea since the peninsula was divided by war in the 1950s, with most going overland to neighbouring China first, then entering a third country such as Thailand before entering South Korea.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A North Korean has defected to the South across the de facto maritime border known as the Northern Limit Line, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported Thursday.</p>

<p>"1 N. Korean defects across maritime border in Yellow Sea: military," the agency said in a one-line report.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of North Koreans have fled to South Korea since the peninsula was divided by war in the 1950s, with most going overland to neighbouring China first, then entering a third country such as Thailand before finally making it to the South.</p>

<p>The number of successful escapes dropped significantly from 2020 after the North sealed its borders -- purportedly with shoot-on-sight orders along the land frontier with China -- to prevent the spread of Covid-19.</p>

<p>But the number of defectors making it to the South tripled last year to 196, Seoul said in January, with more elite diplomats and students seeking to escape, up from 67 in 2022.</p>

<p>South Korean local media reported Thursday that two North Koreans attempted to defect to the South through the border island of Gyodong, less than five kilometres (3.1 miles) from North Korea, and the South Korean military has only secured one of them.</p>

<p>The report comes days after North Korean state media said the country had deployed 250 ballistic missile launchers to its southern border, with leader Kim Jong Un describing the weapons as a "powerful treasured sword" to defend its sovereignty.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Pyongyang conducted live-fire artillery drills near South Korea's Yeonpyeong and another border island, prompting counter-drills, heightened security and evacuation orders for residents.</p>

<p>Relations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, with the North ramping up weapons testing and bombarding the South with trash-carrying balloons.</p>

<p>South Korea has responded by resuming propaganda broadcasts along the border, suspending a tension-reducing military deal and restarting live-fire drills near the border.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian prosecutors have requested a 15-year prison sentence for a dual US-Russian national charged with "treason" for making a donation to a pro-Ukraine organisation.</p>

<p>Ksenia Karelina, who lives in the United States, was arrested in February while visiting family in Russia, accused of providing financial assistance to the Ukrainian army.</p>

<p>"The prosecution requested a sentence of 15 years imprisonment in a general regime penal colony," Russian state-run news agencies quoted Karelina's lawyer, Mikhail Mushailov, as saying Thursday.</p>

<p>She donated around $50 to a US-based pro-Ukraine charity after Russia launched its full-scale military offensive in 2022, US media reported, citing her family and employer.</p>

<p>Russia's FSB security service accused her of collecting money that was "used to purchase tactical medical supplies, equipment, weapons and ammunition for the Ukrainian armed forces."</p>

<p>Russian state media reported she pleaded guilty in a court hearing in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The verdict will be delivered next Thursday, the court's press service told AFP.</p>

<p>Moscow has launched dozens of criminal cases against Russian citizens it accuses of supporting or collaborating with Kyiv.</p>

<p>Karelina, in her early 30s, is just one of a string of US citizens and dual nationals that have also been targeted.</p>

<p>Last week Russia released three of them -- journalists Evan Gershkovich and Alsu Kurmasheva, as well as ex-marine Paul Whelan -- in the largest East-West prisoner swap since the Cold War.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 19-year-old Austrian terrorism suspect had taken concrete steps in planning an attack on a Taylor Swift concert, with chemical substances found during a search of his residence, Austria's general director for public security said.</p>

<p>The teenager, with North Macedonian roots, is considered the main suspect, working closely with a 17-year-old Austrian, general director for public security Frankz Ruf told ORF radio.</p>

<p>The two males are part of a small group police are looking into, said Ruf, adding that the 19-year-old had pledged allegiance to the radical Islamic State group.</p>

<p>"We are of course investigating their wider surroundings," said Ruf, adding that the threat was minimized with the arrests.</p>

<p>Swift's three concerts in Vienna, expected to draw 195,000 people, were cancelled late on Wednesday after the government flagged a planned attack. Police had detained three people suspected of plotting attacks on concerts.</p>

<p>Searches of the main suspect's house in the town of Ternitz near the Hungarian border showed "concrete preparatory actions," said Ruf, with chemical substances and technical devices seized.</p>

<p>The Kurier newspaper, citing sources familiar with the situation, reported that the suspect had stolen the chemicals from his workplace and had built a bomb.</p>

<p>The newspaper reported that the 19-year-old had planned to drive a car into the crowd expected to gather outside the stadium, and had also considered using machetes and knives.</p>

<p>Austria's interior ministry and intelligence service were not immediately available for comment on the report's details.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

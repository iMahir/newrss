       <description><![CDATA[55 small, rural escapes around the world, earned a spot in the 2024 edition of UN Tourisms "Best Tourism Villages."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a year of travel that was marked largely by overtourism protests in Barcelona, Oaxaca and Venice draws to a close, the appeal of offbeat vacations continues to grow.</p>

<p>To wit, consider these spots you've likely never heard of: secluded Graciosa Island on the Azores, the remote fishing village Roches Noires in northeastern Mauritius, or mountainous Wukirsari, Indonesia, 270 miles east of Jakarta. They're among the 55 small, rural escapes around the world that earned a spot in the 2024 edition of UN Tourism's “Best Tourism Villages.” The list of winning destinations, previewed exclusively by Bloomberg News, was released on Nov. 14 at the organization's Executive Council meeting in Cartagena, Colombia.</p>

<p>The initiative, started in 2021, aims to raise awareness of lesser-known places worth visiting—and also reward responsible tourism management. Put simply, these destinations are using visitation funds in a way that boosts their cultural practices, preserves biodiversity and improves quality of life for locals. Each village also counts fewer than 15,000 inhabitants and maintains traditional activities such as agriculture and fishing.</p>

<p>“The Best Tourism Villages initiative not only recognizes the remarkable achievements of these villages but also highlights the transformative power of tourism,” says UN Tourism Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili.</p>

<p>Among this year's worthy escapes are rural villages in Panama and Guatemala, two countries appearing on the list for the first time. Panama's historic northern port of Portobelo, for example, draws smaller crowds despite its tranquil Caribbean beaches and significant colonial past. But it also stood out because tourism there helps fund cultural heritage preservation activities for youth through the Bahía de Portobelo Foundation, as well as coral reef restoration projects.</p>

<p>Appearing on this coveted list can lead to increased visitation from higher-spending travelers, too. For instance, in Aragon, Spain, the village of Alquezar's mountain trekking, canyoning and hiking used to draw mostly visitors from France and Spain, but since its win in 2022, international visitors from Japan and China have vacationed there, according to Alquezar Mayor Ana Blasco Castillo. Sandra Carvao, who helps develop rural tourism as a director at UN Tourism, sees this as one of the major pluses of the Best Tourism Villages initiative, in addition to diverting travelers from major hot spots. “It's really to make sure that the sector can benefit places which wouldn't necessarily be top of your mind,” she says.</p>

<p>This year's winners were selected from 260 nominations that UN Tourism received from more than 60 member countries. We highlighted five that are easily accessible.</p>

<p><strong>Splugen, Switzerland</strong></p>

<p>Splugen, in the Swiss Alps near the Italian border, is smaller in size as a ski getaway than, say, the busier and glitzy St. Moritz just an hour-and-a-half scenic drive east. But that's exactly the draw: It's a quieter winter sports vacation destination that doubles as an under-the-radar spot in the spring and summer, with access to crystal clear lakes and Beverin Regional Nature Park. Splügen became part of this protected area in 2020, joining more than 10 communities living here who've committed to play a part in preserving it. Next year boutique property Speluca Brewery Hotel is set to open; its design makes use of formerly abandoned spaces on the village's outskirts, including an old barn and a former hotel from the 1960s, plus new structures that will reflect the village's traditional timber aesthetic. Splügen's communities want to attract more year-round visitors as well, whom they expect once the future Rheinwald Resort AG project is completed, featuring a mix of rooms and a campsite for long-term stays.</p>

<p><strong>San Rafael de la Laguna, Ecuador</strong></p>

<p>San Rafael de la Laguna serves as a reminder of Ecuador's outsize natural riches—sitting in the foothills of the Andes, just under a two-hour drive north of Quito. It's close to Imbakucha, or the lake of the gods, also commonly known as Lago San Pablo. You can hop on guided tours to spot herons and ducks from traditional boats made from totora reeds, a local aquatic plant growing abundantly in the area. Cycling enthusiasts will find routes that traverse the Otavalo Valley, and the village also celebrates vibrant Indigenous rooted festivals. The Pawkar Raymi marks the start of the agricultural season in early March, in alignment with the spring equinox, and the Inti Raymi celebrates the winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere. Expect plenty of community events for both, including traditional Andean music and dance. If you're more into hands-on experiences, craft workshops teach you to make baskets, trays and hats out of totora reeds.</p>

<p><strong>Gharb Suhayl, Egypt</strong></p>

<p>If you're set on visiting the Grand Egyptian Museum in 2025, it would be worth including a stop in Aswan, south of Giza. From there, hop on a 30-minute boat ride south to reach the peaceful, ancient Nubian village of Gharb Suhayl, set on the banks of the Nile. Beyond its brightly painted homes in blue, yellow and ocher, you'll find striking art murals, said to give the area the feel of a living outdoor museum. You're likely to be invited into a Nubian family's home to learn about the way of life, and you could also spend time shopping in souks for crafts, jewelry and spices. A handful of luxury tour operators, such as Black Tomato, offer stops in Aswan, continuing down the Nile to Abu Simbel.</p>

<p><strong>Pissouri, Cyprus</strong></p>

<p>On Cyprus' rugged southwestern coast, Pissouri offers a quieter alternative to resort town Limassol, which lies just a 30-minute drive east. You'll have your pick of outdoor activities in Pissouri, including the Cape Astrot hiking trail, tucked along gigantic rock formations, for jaw-dropping vistas over a turquoise bay and its pebble sand beach. The agricultural village's cobblestoned square is lined with local tavernas where you can dine on Cypriot meze—small plates of local cheeses, olives, seafood and grilled meats, as well as dips. For a deeper dive into Pissouri's heritage, get a guided tour at G Theophamous Winery on the history of Pissouri's Sultanina grape and winemaking traditions. To draw more visitors in the future, this small agricultural village is working on an accessible hiking trail for disabled travelers, as well as a House of Halloumi Museum— named after Cyprus' signature cheese—that will showcase this region's dairy products.</p>

<p><strong>Uaxactún, Guatemala</strong></p>

<p>Most people head to Tikal National Park and unknowingly bypass Uaxactún, an ancient Mayan historical site located just a 30-minute drive north. But it counts uncrowded forest trails where you can observe the area's temples, including a ceremonial complex, stelae and an astronomy observatory that the Maya once used to mark celestial events. Uaxactún was at its peak from 600 A.D. to 900 A.D., when it was an important center for art and astronomy. In March the eponymous village celebrates the spring equinox festival through sacred ceremonies at the site that include chants, fires and drumming. Inquire about a craftmaking workshop with local women's group Brisas de la Selva Maya, where you'll learn to make necklaces and bracelets from forest-sourced elements such as seeds, mushrooms and flowers.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Passengers will experience two sunrises on this record-breaking journey, made possible by specially designed Airbus A350 aircraft.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Long-haul flights have become a common feature of contemporary travel, with trips lasting ten to fifteen hours now being accepted as normal. The 17-hour journey from Perth to London and well-known destinations like Dubai or New York for city vacations no longer seem unusual.</p>

<p>However, Australian airline Qantas, one of the leading airlines in the world, is trying to revolutionise long-haul air travel with its bold Project Sunrise, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/11/14/longest-flight-world-passengers-see-two-sunrises-set-take-off-2026-21992081/"><em>The Metro</em></a>. The airline plans to introduce nonstop flights from Sydney to London and New York, which will cover 19 to 22 hours of distance. These ultra-long-haul flights aim to reduce travel time by up to four hours compared to current options.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.qantas.com/au/en/about-us/our-company/fleet/new-fleet/project-sunrise.html">project </a>is named after the kind of experience that its passengers will have to undergo: that of seeing two sunrises in a row, breaking the world record of the longest commercial flight currently held by Singapore Airlines. It is this route from Singapore to New York, which was not met 18 hours long.</p>

<p>While saving time is appealing, spending nearly a full day in the air presents a significant challenge for travelers. Qantas initiated <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.qantas.com/au/en/about-us/our-company/fleet/new-fleet/project-sunrise.html">Project Sunrise</a> discussions in 2017, collaborating with Boeing and Airbus to develop ultra-long-range versions of their widebody aircraft.</p>

<p>Despite the challenges faced by the aviation industry in recent years, Qantas remains committed to pushing the boundaries of air travel. The first flights under Project Sunrise are expected to take off in 2026, marking a new milestone in aviation history.</p>

<p>According to<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelgoldstein/2024/10/29/inside-project-sunrise-bold-qantas-plan-to-bring-australia-closer/"><em> Forbes,</em></a> Vanessa Hudson, who took over as Qantas CEO last fall, spoke at an event in a hangar at LAX to celebrate Qantas and the upcoming Project Sunrise non-stop flights from Sydney to London and New York. She said that the project speaks to 'Australians hunger to fly point to point.' The upcoming long flights, she said, "are a great way for Australians to break out and see the world on the A350."</p>

<p>As a Qantas website put it, "Our fleet of specially designed Airbus A350s [will]overcome the tyranny of distance, with the ability to travel between Australia and almost any city in the world." Qantas is assuring potential flyers that research and design will make the flights comfortable and safe.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Three women formerly employed by Harrods have accused the brother of its late boss Mohamed Al-Fayed of sexual violence.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three women formerly employed by Harrods have accused the brother of its late boss Mohamed Al-Fayed of sexual violence, following hundreds of similar claims against the former owner of the luxury London store, the BBC reported Thursday.</p>

<p>They say the late Salah Fayed assaulted them during the period when he jointly owned the department store with his brother, the broadcaster said.</p>

<p>The women alleged they were abused in London, the south of France and Monaco between 1989 and 1997.</p>

<p>The report follows a slew of claims in recent weeks by hundreds of women against the Egyptian former Harrods and Fulham Football Club owner Mohamed Al-Fayed of sexual assault including rape.</p>

<p>Salah Fayed died in 2010 and Mohamed Al-Fayed died last year aged 94.</p>

<p>One of the three women behind the most recent accusations, named Helen, who waived her right to anonymity, told the BBC that she had been working for the retailer for two years when Mohamed Al-Fayed raped her in 1989 during a business trip in Dubai.</p>

<p>He then offered her a personal assistant job with his brother Salah, who she said went on to drug her and rape her while she was unconscious.</p>

<p>Mohamed Al-Fayed "shared me with his brother," she said.</p>

<p>She said he had stayed silent about the experience, having signed a non-disclosure agreement, a document the BBC reported having seen.</p>

<p>The second woman said Salah Fayed abused her during a trip to Monaco, while the third woman, who was hired at the age of 19 in 1997, said she was sexually assaulted in his Monaco apartment.</p>

<p>Contacted by AFP, Harrods said it "supports the bravery of these women in coming forward" and encourages survivors "to come forward and make their claims" to the company, which is offering compensation and counselling support.</p>

<p>"We also hope that they are looking at every appropriate avenue to them in their pursuit of justice, whether that be Harrods, the police or the Fayed family and estate," the company said.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the New York Times published the claims of a victim accusing another brother of Mohamed Al-Fayed, Ali, aged 80, of knowing about the "trafficking" of women.</p>

<p>Allegations have mounted since the airing of a BBC documentary in September that detailed multiple claims of rape and sexual assault by Mohamed Al-Fayed.</p>

<p>The Justice for Harrods Survivors group said it had received more than 420 inquiries, mainly related to the store but also regarding Fulham Football Club, the Ritz Hotel in Paris and other Fayed entities.</p>

<p>London's Metropolitan Police said earlier this month that it was "actively reviewing 21 allegations reported to the Metropolitan Police prior to Mohamed Al-Fayed's passing... to determine if any additional investigative steps are available or there are things we could have done better."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US overweight and obese population will rise significantly in the next quarter century if current trends continue, and new weight-loss treatments won't be sufficient to stem the tide, researchers said.</p>

<p>Nearly 260 million Americans will be overweight or obese by 2050, straining the health-care system and boosting medical costs, according to a study published Thursday in The Lancet medical journal. Rates among adult men will rise to 81% from 76% in 2021, and to 82% from 73% among women.</p>

<p>While medical institutions have been slow to recognize obesity as a disease, it raises the risk for a variety of dangerous, pervasive health outcomes, including diabetes, heart disease and cancer. The success of weight-loss drugs shouldn't be allowed to overshadow the need for measures — such as promotion of healthy diet and exercise — that are crucial to slowing the growth of the crisis, said Marie Ng, a co-author of the study.</p>

<p>“All of these factors combined have contributed to the continuous rise in obesity prevalence over the past three decades,” said Ng, who's an affiliate associate professor at the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle. “If these drivers persist, the obesity crisis will likely continue to worsen.”</p>

<p>Obesity and overweight are both defined by body-mass index, a measure calculated using both height and weight. People with obesity are more severely affected than overweight people.</p>

<p>GLP-1 drugs like Novo Nordisk A/S's Wegovy and Eli Lilly &amp; Co.'s Zepbound have been shown to help patients safely shed pounds while decreasing some associated health risks. Use of the drugs has been hampered by insufficient supplies and spotty insurance coverage, along with costs of about $1,000 a month for the injections.</p>

<p>“Equitable access is very important if we're to leverage this medication,” Ng said in an interview. Uncertainty remains about the implications of long-term use of the drugs in large populations, she said.</p>

<p>US obesity rates doubled over the three decades ending in 2021, fueled by factors such as growing availability of high-calorie foods, sedentary lifestyles and decreasing access to healthy foods, particularly in lower-income communities, Ng said. About one in five children and at least one in three adolescents are expected to be living with obesity in 2050, according to the study.</p>

<p>While Southern states are expected to remain among those most affected, the biggest gains in men by 2050 are expected in Colorado and New Mexico, and in Kansas and Colorado for women, according to the study. No particular region is exempt from the anticipated increases, Ng said.</p>

<p>Obesity is “an issue not just for one particular state,” she said, “but the whole nation.”</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's vision for education revolves around a single goal: to rid America's schools of perceived "wokeness" and "left-wing indoctrination".</p>

<p>The president-elect wants to keep transgender athletes out of girls' sports. He wants to forbid classroom lessons on gender identity and structural racism. He wants to abolish diversity and inclusion offices.</p>

<p>Throughout his campaign, the Republican depicted schools as a political battleground to be won back from the left. Now that he's won the White House, he plans to use federal money as leverage to advance his vision of education across the nation.</p>

<p>Trump's education plan pledges to cut funding for schools that defy him on a multitude of issues.</p>

<p>On his first day in office, Trump has repeatedly said he will cut money to "any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content on our children".</p>

<p>On the campaign trail, Trump said he would "not give one penny" to schools with vaccine or mask requirements.</p>

<p>He said it would be done through executive action, though even some of his supporters say he lacks the authority to make such swift and sweeping changes.</p>

<p>Trump's opponents say his vision of America's schools is warped by politics - that the type of liberal indoctrination he rails against is a fiction. They say his proposals will undermine public education and hurt the students who need schools' services the most.</p>

<p>"It's fear-based, non-factual information, and I would call it propaganda," said Wil Del Pilar, senior vice president for Education Trust, a research and advocacy organization. "There is no evidence that students are being taught to question their sexuality in schools. There is no evidence that our American education system is full of maniacs."</p>

<p>Trump's platform calls for "massive funding preferences" for states and schools that end teacher tenure, enact universal school choice programmes and allow parents to elect school principals.</p>

<p>Perhaps his most ambitious promise is to shut down the US Education Department entirely, a goal of conservative politicians for decades, saying it has been infiltrated by "radicals".</p>

<p>America's public K-12 schools get about 14 per cent of their revenue from the federal government, mainly from programs targeting low-income students and special education. The vast majority of schools' money comes from local taxes and state governments.</p>

<p>Colleges rely more heavily on federal money, especially the grants and loans the government gives students to pay for tuition.</p>

<p>Trump's strongest tool to put schools' money on the line is his authority to enforce civil rights - the Education Department has the power to cut federal funding to schools and colleges that fail to follow civil rights laws.</p>

<p>The president can't immediately revoke money from large numbers of districts, but if he targets a few through civil rights inquiries, others are likely to fall in line, said Bob Eitel, president of the conservative Defence of Freedom Institute and an education official during Trump's first term.</p>

<p>That authority could be used to go after schools and colleges that have diversity and inclusion offices or those accused of antisemitism, Eitel said.</p>

<p>"This is not a Day One loss of funding," Eitel said, referencing Trump's campaign promise. "But at the end of the day, the president will get his way on this issue, because I do think that there are some real legal issues."</p>

<p>Trump also has hinted at potential legislation to deliver some of his promises, including fining universities over diversity initiatives.</p>

<p>To get colleges to shutter diversity programs - which Trump says amount to discrimination - he said he "will advance a measure to have them fined up to the entire amount of their endowment".</p>

<p>His platform also calls for a new, free online university called the American Academy, to be paid for by "taxing, fining and suing excessively large private university endowments".</p>

<p>During his first term, Trump occasionally threatened to cut money from schools that defied him, including those slow to reopen during the COVID-19 pandemic and colleges he accused of curbing free speech.</p>

<p>Most of the threats came to nothing, though he succeeded in getting Congress to add a tax on wealthy university endowments, and his Education Department made sweeping changes to rules around campus sexual assault.</p>

<p>Universities hope their relationship with the administration won't be as antagonistic as Trump's rhetoric suggests.</p>

<p>"Education has been an easy target during the campaign season," said Peter McDonough, general counsel for the American Council on Education, an association of university presidents. "But a partnership between higher education and the administration is going to be better for the country than an attack on education."</p>

<p>Trump's threats of severe penalties seem to contradict another of his education pillars - the extraction of the federal government from schools. In closing the Education Department, Trump said he would return "all education work and needs back to the states".</p>

<p>"We're going to end education coming out of Washington, DC," Trump said on his website last year. In his platform, he pledged to ensure schools are "free from political meddling".</p>

<p>Rather than letting states and schools decide their stance on polarising issues, Trump is proposing blanket bans that align with his vision.</p>

<p>Taking a neutral stance and letting states decide wouldn't deliver Trump's campaign promises, said Max Eden, a senior fellow at AEI, a conservative think tank. For example, Trump plans to rescind guidance from President Joe Biden's administration that extended Title IX protections to LGBTQ+ students. And Trump would go further, promising a nationwide ban on transgender women in women's sports.</p>

<p>"Trump ran on getting boys out of girls' sports. He didn't run on letting boys play in girls' sports in blue states if they want to," Eden said.</p>

<p>Trump also wants a say in school curriculum, vowing to fight for "patriotic" education. He promised to reinstate his 1776 Commission, which he created in 2021 to promote patriotic education. The panel created a report that called progressivism a "challenge to American principles" alongside fascism.</p>

<p>Adding to that effort, Trump is proposing a new credentialing body to certify teachers "who embrace patriotic values".</p>

<p>Few of his biggest education goals can be accomplished quickly, and many would require new action from Congress or federal processes that usually take months.</p>

<p>More immediately, he plans to nullify executive orders issued by Biden, including one promoting racial equity across the federal government. He's also expected to work quickly to revoke or rewrite Biden's Title IX rules, though finalizing those changes would require a lengthier rulemaking process.</p>

<p>Trump hasn't detailed his plans for student loans, though he has called Biden's cancellation proposals illegal and unfair.</p>

<p>Most of Biden's signature education initiatives have been paused by courts amid legal challenges, including a proposal for widespread loan cancellation and a more generous loan repayment plan. Those plans could be revoked or rewritten once Trump takes office.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US space agency NASA has partnered with Microsoft to develop an easier-to-access and user-friendly Artificial Intelligence-based chatbot that can help people decode scientific data about Earth.</p>

<p>The new Earth Copilot can answer people “through plain language queries” ranging from monitoring wildfires to tracking climate change -- transforming how people interact with Earth's data.</p>

<p>NASA IMPACT worked with Microsoft to Earth Copilot to simplify access to data and encourage a wider range of users to interact with its Earth Science data.</p>

<p>The AI model leverages Microsoft's Azure cloud platform and comes with advanced AI capabilities that will transform how people can search, discover and analyse NASA's complex geospatial data, which so far has been accessible only to a limited number of researchers and scientists.</p>

<p>“NASA's repository of geospatial data contains key insights on everything from climate and air quality to urban planning and disaster response -- but its scale and complexity make it difficult to parse. With Earth Copilot, they're making it easier than ever for anyone to access that data,” said Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO at Microsoft, in a post on X.</p>

<p>Earth Copilot also democratises access to space-borne data, enabling users -- from researchers to climate scientists to teachers to policymakers -- to engage with NASA's science data.</p>

<p>Researchers can now spend less time on data retrieval and more on analysis and discovery. It can help climate scientists quickly access historical data to study trends, while agricultural experts can gain insights into soil moisture levels to improve crop management.</p>

<p>Educators and teachers can use real-world examples to engage students in Earth Science, and policymakers can leverage the data to make informed decisions on critical issues like climate change, urban development, and disaster preparedness.</p>

<p>“We've designed the system to handle complex queries and large datasets efficiently, ensuring that users can quickly find the information they need without getting bogged down by technical complexities,” said Juan Carlos Lopez, former NASA engineer and current Azure Specialist at Microsoft.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US vice president Al Gore believes a second Donald Trump term in the White House may have little impact on the "momentum" of the world's fight against climate change.</p>

<p>The return of Trump, who has pledged to pull the United States from the Paris agreement for a second time, has cast a pall over UN COP29 climate talks in Baku this week.</p>

<p>But Gore echoed statements from President Joe Biden's climate team who sought to remind other countries that global action survived Trump's first presidency.</p>

<p>"We've been through this before," Gore told reporters Thursday ahead of Friday's release of the latest data findings from Climate TRACE, an independent tracker of global emissions he co-founded.</p>

<p>"He tried one time before and the world continued to reduce emissions even during his four years as president the last time," he said.</p>

<p>"There is so much more momentum that even a new Trump administration is not going to be able to slow it down much. I hope I'm right about that," he said.</p>

<p>The Nobel Peace Prize laureate said market forces were "giving us a tailwind", with renewable energy getting cheaper and increasingly used to generate electricity.</p>

<p>"Many people around the world are not simply waiting with bated breath to see what the United States is going to do, they're moving on their own," he said.</p>

<p>While a US retreat from its commitments "would not be a good thing", Gore said, "I think the progress is likely to continue, regardless."</p>

<p>Climate TRACE's new data showed Friday that greenhouse gas emissions rose 0.7 percent in 2023 and will likely increase by 0.48 percent this year.</p>

<p>The group, which uses artificial intelligence to analyse satellite images from around the planet, said it now has inventories for every state and province in the world as well as over 9,000 urban areas.</p>

<p><strong>'Petrostates have seized control'</strong></p>

<p>The former US vice president had singled out the emissions of the United Arab Emirates when he presented Climate TRACE data at last year's COP28 conference hosted by the oil power.</p>

<p>This year, Gore showed slides of the 200 largest emissions sites in COP29 host Azerbaijan, a country whose economy is highly dependent on oil and gas production and exports.</p>

<p>Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev hailed oil and gas as a "gift of God" when he addressed fellow leaders at COP29 on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"It's unfortunate that the fossil fuel industry and the petrostates have seized control of the COP process to an unhealthy degree," Gore said Thursday.</p>

<p>While the Dubai summit produced a global agreement on "transitioning away" from fossil fuels, the follow-up commitment "has been very weak" and the issue "is hardly even mentioned" at COP29, he said.</p>

<p>"I have to think that one of the reasons for that is that the petrostates have too much control over the process," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Defence Minister Rajnath Singh will meet Chinese counterpart Dong Jun - the first ministerial-level meeting since the two militaries disengaged in eastern Ladakh last month and India resumed patrolling in Depsang last week.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Defence Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/rajnath-singh" target="_blank">Rajnath Singh</a> will meet Chinese counterpart Dong Jun - the first ministerial-level meeting since the two militaries completed <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/india-china-ladakh-disengagement" target="_blank">disengagement in eastern Ladakh</a> last month and the India resumed patrolling in the Depsang region last week - sources told NDTV Friday.</p>

<p>Mr Singh and Mr Dong, a former naval Commander appointed in December last year, will meet on the sidelines of a two-day, 10-nation ASEAN summit in Laos that begins November 20.</p>

<p>This will also be the first time the Defence Ministers have met since April last year, when China's Li Shangfu travelled to Delhi for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit.</p>

<p>The meeting is being seen as a key confidence-building measure as Delhi and Beijing rebuild bridges burnt after violence in the Galwan and Pangong Lake areas in May and June 2020, in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed in action and both sides ramped up military deployment.</p>

<p>This is the second in a series of planned high-level meetings - after <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pm-modi-chinas-xi-jinping-bilateral-starts-in-russia-first-since-2020-6856030" target="_blank">Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping met</a> in Russia last month - NDTV has learned, each of which will be seen as another step in what will be an extended deepening of India-China engagement.</p>

<p><strong>NDTV Explains |</strong>&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/explained-india-china-border-patrol-agreement-and-why-it-is-important-6844560" target="_blank">India-China Border Patrol Deal: What Is It, Why Is It Important</a></p>

<p>At this time, it is unclear what the next steps will be or if there will be subsequent meetings - either between the Defence Ministers or similar high-level sit-downs - to push for a deeper disengagement from both sides that will allow soldiers to withdraw to pre-2020 positions.</p>

<p>The two militaries, however, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indian-chinese-troops-exchange-diwali-sweets-after-border-disengagement-6913668" target="_blank">exchanged sweets during Diwali for the first time in years</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>A key point here is the scale of military build-up over the past four years; the Chinese put in a lot of work to set up new bases and infrastructure, such as bridges to hasten deployment of troops and equipment. And the sizes of some of these bases had not gone unnoticed.</p>

<p>Last month senior Indian military sources who analysed satellite imagery of a new base on the northern bank of the Pangong Lake said it was "unlike any other" on the Chinese side of the LAC.</p>

<p><strong>NDTV Exclusive |&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/satellite-pics-chinas-new-base-near-pangong-lake-unlike-any-other-site-6787676" target="_blank">China's New Base Near Pangong Lake "Unlike Any Other Site"</a></p>

<p>That camp lay 15km east of a new bridge across the high-altitude Pangong Lake that Beijing built to step up pressure in areas near the LAC that were previously unoccupied.</p>

<p>In July NDTV reported on fortified sites to the north, including a surface-to-air missile battery.</p>

<p>However, following the agreement, China began walking back.</p>

<p><strong>NDTV Exclusive |&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ndtv-exclusive-1st-images-of-chinese-troops-disengagement-in-ladakh-6874634" target="_blank">1st Images Of Chinese Troops' Disengagement In Ladakh</a></p>

<p>Days after the deal, NDTV accessed satellite images showing withdrawal in the Depsang and Demchok regions. And, ten days ago, India said it had completed patrolling to a point in Depsang.</p>

<p>Last month, after multiple rounds of military- and government-level talks, the two countries announced a patrolling agreement that has seen both withdraw to pre-April 2020 positions.</p>

<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, speaking exclusively to NDTV, confirmed the agreement and, a day later, Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi said the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/india-china-patrolling-agreement-ladakh-galwan-valley-clashes-trying-to-restore-trust-army-chief-on-india-china-patrolling-deal-6845928" target="_blank">Indian military is "trying to trust"</a>&nbsp;China again.</p>

<p>But perhaps the biggest signal India-China relations are moving towards some normalcy came after Prime Minister Modi met President Xi at the BRICS Summit in Russia last month.</p>

<p>Disenagement and patrolling in Depsang and Demchok follows similar positive actions on the north and south banks of the Pangong Lake in 2021, and in the contentious Gogra-Hot Springs area in September a year later. In each case the two sides withdrew to pre-April 2020 positions.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Cancer diagnoses during pregnancy and in the year following the birth are rare. But such cases are becoming more common in parts of the world.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former winner of TV show Alone Australia Gina Chick was diagnosed with breast cancer just days after finding out she was pregnant.</p>

<p>She describes in her recent book her experience with chemotherapy and what followed.</p>

<p>Thankfully, cancer diagnoses during pregnancy and in the year following the birth are rare. But such cases are becoming more common in parts of the world, including Australia. Researchers aren't exactly sure why.</p>

<p>Here's what researchers know so far, and the options for treatment.</p>

<h2><br />
<strong>How rare is it?</strong></h2>

<p>A New South Wales study found that in 1994 there were about 94 cancer diagnoses during pregnancy or within one year of birth per 100,000 women giving birth. That rose to about 163 per 100,000 in 2013. Although these statistics are more than ten years old, these are the most recent and rigorous data available in Australia.</p>

<p>A 2023 Swedish study of pregnancies in 1973-2017 had similar findings.</p>

<p>Both studies found about one-quarter of pregnancy-associated cancers are diagnosed before birth, with the rest diagnosed in the year after birth.</p>

<h3><br />
<strong>What type of cancers are we talking about?</strong></h3>

<p>The United Kingdom's first comprehensive assessment of cancer during pregnancy looked at diagnoses in 2016-2020.</p>

<p>This study, the NSW study, and others, have found breast and skin cancers (often melanoma) were the most common pregnancy-associated cancers. There were also high rates of thyroid, gynaecological (particularly cervical and ovarian) and blood cancers in this group.</p>

<p>The UK study found about 92 per cent of cancers were new diagnoses and about 82 per cent had symptoms. The majority (81 per cent) were treated with the aim to cure and about 82 per cent of pregnancies associated with a cancer diagnosis resulted in a live birth.</p>

<p>However, 20 per cent of mothers died by the end of the five year study period. Gastrointestinal (gut) cancers were particularly concerning. They had the highest mortality rate at about 46 per cent and were associated with diagnosis at a more advanced stage of cancer.</p>

<p>This may be because many symptoms of gastrointestinal cancers such as abdominal pain, fatigue and acid reflux overlap with those of pregnancy. In other words, some cancer symptoms can be mistaken for pregnancy symptoms, "masking" or delaying a cancer diagnosis.</p>

<h3><br />
<strong>Why are cases like this rising?</strong></h3>

<p>The broad range of cancers presenting during and after pregnancy suggests a variety of contributing factors.</p>

<p>In high socioeconomic countries women are having children later in life and the biggest risk factor for many cancers is increasing age. However, the evidence for age being a major factor in pregnancy-related cancer is inconclusive. This may account for some but not all cases.</p>

<p>Another factor may be the rising use of prenatal genetic screening tests in early pregnancy. These analyse DNA derived from the mother's blood to detect chromosomal abnormalities in the developing fetus. But these tests can also give information about the mother's chromosomes. This has led to diagnoses of Hodgkin disease, breast and colorectal cancer in pregnant women without symptoms.</p>

<p>Oestrogen and progesterone are two hormones important for growth and development of breast tissue and to support other aspects of a healthy pregnancy.</p>

<p>These may also contribute to cancer development, particularly breast cancer. However, it's not clear whether this is linked to rising rates of pregnancy associated cancers.</p>

<p>Other cancers, such as skin cancer, are associated with environmental factors such as UV exposure. Notably, melanoma was the leading pregnancy-associated cancer in the NSW study, reflecting the high rate of skin cancer in the local population.</p>

<p>Other environmental factors, such as smoking and human papillomavirus, are associated with cervical cancer. Again we're not sure whether such factors are linked with rising rates of pregnancy associated cancers.</p>

<h3><br />
<strong>What happens after a diagnosis?</strong></h3>

<p>Pregnancy complicates a cancer diagnosis, as any potential treatment for the mother may risk the health and viability of the fetus. So some aspects of treatment may need to be adjusted.</p>

<p>Surgery can usually be undertaken during any trimester depending on where the cancer is located.</p>

<p>Radiotherapy needs careful planning because the impact of radiation on the fetus depends on the developmental stage, where the radiation is applied to the body, and the dose.</p>

<p>Chemotherapy should be avoided in the first trimester due to potential toxic effects on the fetus. But it can usually be given in the second and third trimester.</p>

<p>Chemotherapy should be avoided within three weeks of the birth to reduce the chance of bleeding and infection in the newborn, who may also have a weakened immune system from the chemo.</p>

<p>More targeted immunotherapies are generally given to the mother after she's given birth. Depending on the treatment, she may be advised not breastfeed. That's because the medicine can pass from the mother via breastmilk to the baby.</p>

<h3><strong>What happens to the babies?</strong></h3>

<p>Reassuringly, the NSW data found no increase in the rate of babies dying around the time of birth if they were born to mothers with a pregnancy-associated cancer.</p>

<p>However, there were more planned preterm births. This is because women are offered an induction of labour and/or a caesarean to facilitate cancer treatment for the mother, while reducing treatment-related risks to the unborn child.</p>

<p>There were also higher rates of babies born with a low birth weight and low Apgar scores (indicators of a baby's condition shortly after birth) - possibly related to being born pre-term.</p>

<h3><strong>What do researchers want to know?</strong></h3>

<p>We have much to learn about what's behind the increasing rates of pregnancy-associated cancers, and what women diagnosed with these cancers can expect.</p>

<p>We also need to combine cancer and obstetric data in national databases. This would allow us to see which areas to prioritise for further research, inform clinical guidelines to screen for cancers during and after pregnancy, and would help evaluate responses to screening programs or therapies in the future.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The G20 summit is set to be dominated by differences over wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, and the implications of Donald Trump's White House return.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>G20 leaders gather in Brazil on Monday for a G20 summit set to be dominated by differences over wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, and implications of Donald Trump's White House return.</p>

<p>Security considerations -- always high at such meetings -- were elevated further after a failed bomb attack late Wednesday outside Brazil's Supreme Court in Brasilia.</p>

<p>Police were probing the two blasts as a possible "terrorist act" committed by a Brazilian perpetrator, whose death was the sole casualty.</p>

<p>The summit venue is in Rio de Janeiro, in the city's stunning bayside museum of modern art, which is the epicenter of a massive police deployment designed to keep the public well away.</p>

<p>Brazil's leftwing President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will be using the opportunity to highlight his position as a leader championing Global South issues while also being courted by the West.</p>

<p>That role will be tested in the months and years ahead as Latin America and other regions navigate "America First" policies promised by Donald Trump when he becomes US president in January.</p>

<p>At this G20, it will be outgoing President Joe Biden who will represent the world's biggest economy, but as a lame duck the other leaders will be looking beyond.</p>

<p>Just before the Rio summit, on Sunday, Biden will make a stop in Brazil's Amazon to underline the fight against climate change -- another issue that Trump is hostile towards.</p>

<p><strong>Putin absent</strong></p>

<p>The G20 meet is happening at the same time as the UN's COP29 climate conference in Azerbaijan -- and as the world experiences dramatic climate phenomena, including in Brazil where flooding, drought and forest fires have taken heavy tolls.</p>

<p>At the last G20, in India, the leaders called for a tripling of renewable energy sources by the end of the decade, but without explicitly calling for an end to the use of fossil fuels.</p>

<p>One invited leader who declined to come to Rio is Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said his presence could "wreck" the gathering.</p>

<p>Putin denied an International Criminal Court warrant out against him, for Russia's actions in Ukraine, was a factor in his decision. His foreign minister will represent Russia in Rio.</p>

<p>China's President Xi Jinping, however, will be attending, and will even extend his stay after the summit to make an official visit to Brasilia on Wednesday.</p>

<p>China is Brazil's biggest trading partner, and the two countries have been touting themselves as mediators to help end Russia's war in Ukraine, so far without success.</p>

<p>That conflict, along with Israel's offensives in Gaza and Lebanon, will loom large at the summit.</p>

<p>"We are negotiating with all the countries on the final declaration's passages about geopolitics... so that we can reach consensual language on those two issues," Brazil's chief diplomatic official for the G20, Mauricio Lyrio, said.</p>

<p>Those conflicts will be "the elephant in the room," Flavia Loss, international relations specialist at the School of Sociology and Politics of Sao Paulo (FESPSP), told AFP.</p>

<p>But that should not prevent Brazil from finding consensus on issues that it has made priorities under its G20 presidency, she said, such as the fight against hunger or taxing the world's super-rich.</p>

<p>Lula, heading up Latin America's biggest economy, set out his line in May when he said: "A lot of people insist on dividing the world between friends and enemies. But the more vulnerable are not interested in simplist dichotomies."</p>

<p><strong>Tax on billionaires</strong></p>

<p>The Rio G20 summit will open on Monday with Lula officially launching a "Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty".</p>

<p>The initiative aims to rally nations and international bodies to free up financing for that campaign, or to replicate programs that have previously had success.</p>

<p>And on the issue of taxing billionaires, the G20 countries already declared a desire to cooperate to bring that about, as set out by their finance ministers who met in Rio in June.</p>

<p>It remained to be seen, though, whether the leaders at the summit would pursue that goal, and on what terms.</p>

<p>Following the summit, Brazil hands over the G20 presidency to South Africa.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump returns to the White House shielded with presidential immunity by the Supreme Court and with the prospect of cementing a conservative majority on the bench for at least a generation.</p>

<p>The Republican President-elect appointed three right-wing justices to the top court during his first term and may have the opportunity to name more during his second stint in the Oval Office.</p>

<p>Archconservatives Clarence Thomas, 76, and Samuel Alito, 74, who wrote the opinion overturning the nationwide right to abortion, are the two oldest justices on the court and they could choose to step down knowing their replacements would be nominated by Trump.</p>

<p>"It certainly presents the opportunity for them to retire with some assurance that their successor would continue their philosophy," said Christopher Peters, a law professor at the University of Akron. "And I certainly wouldn't be surprised if that happened."</p>

<p>Steven Schwinn, a law professor at the University of Illinois Chicago, said if Thomas or Alito have any inclination to quit he expects it to happen "fairly quickly" -- before the 2026 midterm elections, when Republicans could potentially lose control of the Senate.</p>

<p>Supreme Court justices are appointed by the president for life but are subject to confirmation by the Senate.</p>

<p>Trump, the only former US president to be convicted of a crime -- falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star -- will take office in January emboldened by the top court's ruling in July that an ex-president has broad immunity from criminal prosecution, Schwinn said.</p>

<p>Trump was charged by Special Counsel Jack Smith with conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election but a trial was delayed by appeals that eventually landed in the Supreme Court, where conservatives enjoy a 6-3 majority.</p>

<p>In an opinion penned by Chief Justice John Roberts, the court ruled that a former president has broad immunity from prosecution for official acts taken while in office, but can be pursued for unofficial acts.</p>

<p>Smith, the special counsel, is winding down the election interference case against Trump in light of the long-standing Justice Department policy that a sitting US president cannot be indicted or criminally prosecuted.</p>

<p><strong>'King above the law'</strong></p>

<p>Schwinn said the immunity ruling "not only allows, but affirmatively invites, a president to engage in illegal behavior and provides a kind of roadmap for doing that while also immunizing themselves.</p>

<p>"And then the question is, 'Is a particular president willing to abuse that power or not?'" he said. "And you know, for my money, I guess a President Trump seems more likely to do that."</p>

<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor, one of the three liberals on the court, warned in her blistering dissent to the immunity ruling that it makes the president a "king above the law."</p>

<p>Steve Vladeck, a law professor at Georgetown University, noted that the Supreme Court did check Trump on a number of occasions during his first term in the White House.</p>

<p>The court initially blocked his Muslim travel ban, protected the young undocumented immigrants known as "Dreamers," and declined to be dragged into lawsuits filed by Trump surrogates falsely claiming he had won the 2020 election.</p>

<p>With Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress this time, the Supreme Court will be "the last institution standing between Mr Trump and whatever he wants to do," Vladeck said in a New York Times essay.</p>

<p>But the court, Vladeck noted, has its own problems with approval ratings at near record lows and perceived ethics questions surrounding luxury vacations taken by Thomas and Alito that were paid for by powerful Republican billionaires.</p>

<p>"Without that public support, what would happen if Mr Trump simply ignored a decision by the nation's highest court that he doesn't like?" Vladeck asked.</p>

<p>"If the court rules against Mr Trump and he tells the justices to pound sand, what will happen then?"</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Between May 1, 2023, and June 1, the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) received 757 reports of UFO sightings.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over 20 reports of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), commonly referred to as UFOs, remain unexplained, the US Defence Department's annual UAP program report has revealed. Between May 1, 2023, and June 1, the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) received 757 reports of UFO sightings, with 485 being new and the rest occurring between 2021 and 2022, <a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-politics/ap-new-pentagon-report-on-ufos-includes-hundreds-of-new-incidents-but-no-evidence-of-aliens/ " rel="nofollow,noindex">Newsnation</a> reported.</p>

<p>Among these reports, AARO director Jon Kosloski shed light on 21 that warrant further investigation, some of which he described as “true anomalies.” While the majority of sightings were in the air, at least 49 reportedly took place in space. However, none of the space domain reports originated from space-based sensors, it noted. Instead, they came from military or commercial pilots and ground observers, with UAPs reported at altitudes of about 100 km, in line with US Space Command's area of responsibility.</p>

<p>“AARO notes that none of the space domain reports originated from space-based sensors or assets; rather, all of these reports originated from military or commercial pilots or ground observers who reported UAP located at altitudes estimated at 100 kilometres [about 62 miles] or higher, consistent with US [sic] Space Command's astrographic area of responsibility,” the report <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/14/us-news/pentagon-says-nearly-two-dozen-ufo-sightings-cant-be-explained-true-anomalies/ " rel="nofollow,noindex">said</a>.</p>

<p>While the data continues to roll in, the report also acknowledged that no verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology has been noted. “AARO has discovered no verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology,” Mr Kosloski told reporters on Thursday.</p>

<p>None of the sightings substantiated concerns about advanced foreign adversarial capabilities or breakthrough aerospace technologies, which some defence experts had speculated, it revealed.</p>

<p>Despite a surge in reported sightings, AARO has struggled to resolve the cases. Of the 757 reports, just 118 were resolved, with the objects identified as “various types of balloons, birds, and drones.” Another 174 cases, suspected to involve more routine explanations, are pending.</p>

<p>However, a significant number of reports remain unresolved. Currently, AARO is investigating 444 cases.</p>

<p>“AARO's ability to resolve cases remains constrained by a lack of timely and actionable sensor data,” the report acknowledged. “AARO continues to address this challenge by working with military and technical partners to optimize sensor requirements, information-sharing processes, and the content of UAP reporting.”</p>

<p>In an effort to address these ongoing investigations, AARO is working with international partners to improve information sharing and best practices for resolving UAP cases.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Right-wing falsehoods about voter fraud fell off a cliff after Donald Trump's victory in the US election, but American liberals took a page from their playbook to push wild conspiracy theories that have fueled doubt about the democratic process.</p>

<p>The left-wing warping of reality underscores how disinformation is peddled across both sides of the political aisle, feeding information chaos on increasingly unmoderated social media platforms that has made it harder for users to decipher fact from fiction.</p>

<p>The falsehoods promoted on sites including the Elon Musk-owned X and Meta's Threads range from unfounded claims about fraudulent vote tallies in key swing states to allegations that Trump "cheated" to win against his Democratic rival Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Left-leaning social media users also spread the unfounded theory that Musk -- the world's richest man and a vociferous Trump backer –- used his Starlink satellite internet company to rig the election by manipulating the vote count, AFP's fact-checkers reported.</p>

<p>"What we're seeing now is an uptick in election fraud claims from the left, particularly in the days following Election Day -- and these narratives are being amplified by bot networks," Dan Brahmy, chief executive of the disinformation security company Cyabra, told AFP.</p>

<p>"It's a reminder that disinformation and exploitation tactics don't belong to one political ideology -- they're weaponized across the board to influence public perception."</p>

<p><strong>'Shared vulnerability'</strong></p>

<p>The Democratic leadership has not questioned the election's outcome, with both Biden and Harris conceding the loss and deeming the November 5 election free and fair.</p>

<p>But just hours after the election, X was flooded with over 30,000 mentions of the hashtag "Do Not Concede Kamala" alongside the words "rigged," "fraud," or "stolen," according to the misinformation watchdog NewsGuard.</p>

<p>Some pro-Harris influencers implored her to "demand a recount" in posts that garnered millions of views.</p>

<p>Cyabra said it uncovered a "highly coordinated disinformation campaign" on X promoting the false notion that the election was "stolen," a narrative that initially gained traction through a network of fake profiles and was later amplified by real influencers.</p>

<p>Some users deployed a deliberate tactic, misspelling the vice president's name in their hashtags as "Kamila" to evade detection while amassing engagement.</p>

<p>The misspelling tactic, Cyabra said, was used to circumvent platform moderation as it "reduces the likelihood of automated content takedowns."</p>

<p>"The recent shift in election fraud claims reveals a deeper, shared vulnerability" on both sides of the political divide," Brahmy said.</p>

<p>"Narratives that may start as fringe beliefs can, under the right conditions, permeate mainstream discourse, regardless of political alignment."</p>

<p><strong>'Information warfare'</strong></p>

<p>Left-leaning social media users picked up what researchers call the misinformation baton from Trump's right-wing supporters, who vigorously pushed unfounded claims of voter fraud since the Republican's 2020 election defeat.</p>

<p>This time around, right-wing claims flooded social media platforms right up to Election Day, but began tapering off as Trump's decisive victory took shape.</p>

<p>"You could call it a role-reversal," said Sam Howard, NewsGuard's political editor.</p>

<p>"As Trump's win became more apparent, there were fewer fraud claims from the right. But now there is a disbelief on the left that Harris's defeat was legitimate."</p>

<p>Such claims have spread unchecked as many platforms have gutted trust and safety teams and scaled back content moderation efforts once used to tame misinformation.</p>

<p>"Right-wing election deniers were largely placated by the results of the election, but it's not so much that disinformation is no longer a problem or that it has suddenly, miraculously, disappeared," Nora Benavidez, senior counsel at the nonprofit watchdog Free Press, told AFP.</p>

<p>"Information warfare is only becoming more pernicious and, when given time to take root, serves as a critical building block to advance authoritarianism and bigotry," she added.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Skygazers across the world better be ready to catch this week's supermoon. The next one won't come around for a bit. But on Thursday, the fourth and last supermoon of the year will pass within roughly 225,000 miles of Earth, appearing larger and brighter than usual. It will take until Friday to attain its full lunar phase. While seeing a supermoon in itself is a delight, the Leonid meteor shower could make for a dazzling bonus as it reaches its peak on Saturday night and into early Sunday, reported <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/14/science/full-beaver-moon-leonids-meteor-shower/index.html">CNN </a>quoting the American Meteor Society.</p>

<p>The full moon in November is referred to as "the beaver moon," a reference to the start of the animal's hibernating season. The upcoming full moon will reach the summit of its full phase on Friday at 4:29 pm Eastern Time. However, it will be visible to the naked eye as full one day prior to and after its peak, said Noah Petro, chief of NASA's Planetary Geology, Geophysics and Geochemistry Laboratory.</p>

<p>Petro said, “There is a moment in time when the moon is at its fullest, but if it's cloudy or you're busy, going out any other time either a day before, later in the evening or the following day you will still see the beauty that is the full moon.”</p>

<p>A supermoon, more of a popular word than a scientific one, happens when a full lunar phase coincides with an exceptionally close orbit around the Earth. This phenomenon occurs only three or four times a year and consecutively because of the moon's ever-changing oval orbit.</p>

<p>The full moon in November will be a little further away than the one in October, which was the closest moon of 2024 and was photographed worldwide.</p>

<p>If local weather conditions allow, the beaver moon will be visible to those in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. They may even be able to witness a Leonid meteor burning brightly in the night sky.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the pantheon of global gatherings, the G20 is the main forum for economic and financial cooperation -- areas increasingly tested by today's shifting geopolitics.</p>

<p>The Group of Twenty brings together the world's biggest economies. It is made up of 19 nations, including the United States and China, and two regional organizations: the European Union and African Union.</p>

<p>Here is a primer on the G20 and what it does:</p>

<p><strong>Who is in the G20?</strong></p>

<p>Despite its name, the G20 today counts 21 members.</p>

<p>The 19 countries in it are: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Britain, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, and the United States.</p>

<p>Together, they account for 85 percent of global GDP and three-quarters of global trade.</p>

<p>The European Union has also long been a member, with the African Union admitted last year.</p>

<p><strong>How did it come about?</strong></p>

<p>The G20 was conceived in 1999, in response to the Asian financial crisis two years prior that shook the global system. It was originally designed as a coordination space for finance ministers and central bank chiefs.</p>

<p>It was elevated to leader-level in 2008 -- after another global financial crisis -- so heads of state and government could meet annually on international economic issues.</p>

<p>The gathering also encompasses side forums where representatives discuss topics such as health, culture, social justice, agriculture, tourism and fighting corruption.</p>

<p><strong>What's happening this G20?</strong></p>

<p>Brazil holds the rotating G20 presidency this year and has made fighting hunger, poverty and inequality its priorities, along with sustainable development and reforming global governance.</p>

<p>To back that up, it is holding a G20 Social forum days before the main November 18-19 event, designed to boost civil society's voice in the governments' discussions.</p>

<p>The G20 summit is taking place in Rio de Janeiro and will see US President Joe Biden attend alongside China's Xi Jinping and other leaders.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin announced last month he would not be traveling to Brazil.</p>

<p>He said his presence would "wreck" the summit, but insisted an International Criminal Court arrest warrant out against him for Russia's actions in Ukraine was not a factor in his decision. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is going in his place.</p>

<p><strong>Past frictions</strong></p>

<p>Recent G20s demonstrated discord between participating countries over Russia's war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>The last two summits, in Bali in 2022 and Delhi in 2023, had to ditch the traditional "family photo" of the leaders standing together in a symbol of unity because of different stances toward Moscow and how to characterize the war.</p>

<p>Xi also upbraided Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the Bali summit after details of talks they held were leaked to the media.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan's growth slowed in the third quarter after warnings of a major earthquake hit activity, official data showed Friday, as Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba seeks to jumpstart the world's fourth-largest economy.</p>

<p>A "megaquake" alert in August and one of the fiercest typhoons in decades resulted in gross domestic product (GDP) expanding just 0.2 percent between July and September from the previous quarter, according to preliminary government data.</p>

<p>The data met market expectations, but marked a slowdown from a revised 0.5 percent in the previous three months.</p>

<p>On an annualised basis, GDP grew 0.9 percent, much slower than the revised 2.2 percent growth in April-June.</p>

<p>The government is expecting a "gradual recovery" of the economy -- beset for decades by stagnation and harmful deflation -- chief cabinet secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said on Friday.</p>

<p>"Our country is at an important crossroads as it's about to transition into a growth-based economy driven by wage hikes and investment," he told a regular briefing.</p>

<p>"To realise that, we will implement all possible economic and fiscal policies, including a package currently under consideration."</p>

<p>Ishiba kept his job in a parliamentary vote on Monday, despite last month leading the ruling coalition to its worst general election result in 15 years.</p>

<p>The 67-year-old has unveiled plans for the government to support the AI and semiconductor sectors with more than 10 trillion yen ($64 billion) by 2030.</p>

<p>He also hopes to win over opposition parties this month to pass a draft supplementary budget for a new stimulus package -- reportedly to include cash handouts for low-income households and families.</p>

<p>Higher spending on cars, as production resumed after disruption related to a domestic testing scandal, helped boost output during the quarter, analysts said.</p>

<p>Wage hikes and temporary income tax cuts were also positive factors.</p>

<p>But this was tempered by Typhoon Shanshan and the "megaquake" alert, issued -- and later lifted -- by the weather agency in August for the first time under a new warning system.</p>

<p>This prompted consumers to stock up on emergency supplies, leading to shortages of rice in supermarkets, while thousands cancelled hotel bookings in one of Japan's biggest holiday periods.</p>

<p>Factory production was also hit when Typhoon Shanshan hit in the same month, forcing the cancellation of trains and flights.</p>

<p>Stefan Angrick, Moody's Analytics economist, called the challenges facing Japan "substantial", especially with Donald Trump's return as US president presaging a "tumultuous" time for global trade.</p>

<p>"Wage growth is improving but is not yet strong enough to keep up with inflation, stretching household finances. Weak external demand and domestic production issues will weigh down exports," Angrick said.</p>

<p>A further slide in the yen against the dollar might prompt the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates before year's end despite the poor run of data, he added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A technical glitch caused chaos for seven lakh air travellers in the United Kingdom during a bank holiday weekend in August last year. The issue started when the corrupted file caused a breakdown in flight processing systems. This led to widespread flight cancellations, leaving travellers stuck at airports for hours, the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/14/world-news/british-air-traffic-employees-work-from-home-day-exacerbated-nightmare-delays-for-70k-travelers-report/ " rel="nofollow,noindex">NY Post</a> reported. The problem grew, as some engineers were working from home that day, and were unable to address the issue remotely on time. An investigation revealed that a critical delay in resolving the issue was caused by difficulties in authenticating a remote engineer's password credentials.</p>

<p>The glitch began early on August 28, 2023, and grounded flights nationwide. National Air Traffic Services (NATS) had arranged for a Level 2 engineer to be available on call, but not on-site, despite it being an exceptionally busy travel day. A Level 1 engineer, who was present at NATS' Swanwick facility in Hampshire, immediately began diagnostic procedures after the systems failed at 8:32 AM. However, the engineer struggled to resolve the issue because the senior technical support engineer was working remotely.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The remote engineer's attempts to log in and fix the issue were delayed after password authentication issues prevented timely access to the system. It took an hour and a half for the engineers to arrive at the airport, but they still couldn't resolve the problem right away. The glitch wasn't fully fixed until four hours after it was first detected but not before causing disruptions to flight schedules that stretched for several days.</p>

<p>The ripple effect of the disruption forced airlines to pay out over $126 million in compensation to affected travellers. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which conducted the inquiry, has recommended 48 new policy measures, including the need for senior engineers to be available on-site during critical times, even when remote work is an option.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After nearly 25 years, tech tycoon Greg Carr is bidding farewell to his opulent New York penthouse. Situated atop the lesser-known structure, next to New York City's iconic Flatiron Building, the penthouse is notable for its extravagant gold dome. The 5,777-square-foot apartment is now on sale for $25 million, reported <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/14/style/gold-dome-penthouse-new-york-flatiron/index.html" rel="nofollow,noindex">CNN</a>.</p>

<p>The house, with five bedrooms and five bathrooms, is located at 170 Fifth Avenue, constructed in 1898. Originally housing the manufacturing company that successfully introduced the first baby grand pianos to the market in the 1880s, it is also called the Sohmer Piano Building.</p>

<p>"It's really buying a true old New York piece of property," Sotheby's listing agent, Lawrence Treglia, told CNN. "The cupola is iconic. Whenever you see the Flatiron building (in photographs), it's always shown on the right-hand side."</p>

<p>Designed by great architect Robert Maynicke in the late 1890s, the penthouse is a modernised living space with high ceilings and expansive glass throughout. The two-story octagonal room complete with a gold-leaf cupola offers lovely views of Madison Square Park, the Empire State and Flatiron buildings. It also has a private roof terrace with a fire pit.</p>

<p>Other attractions include a baronial limestone staircase with a long row of skylights on top and banks of elevators that open onto two foyers. The formal dining room has a wall of cabinets to store china, the kitchen has high-end stainless equipment and a breakfast nook with a built-in bench, and the living room is warmed by a fireplace.</p>

<p>There is a gym with a bathroom attached behind the kitchen. The large corner principal suite on the bottom floor has three exposures, a dressing room with lots of storage space, and a marble bathroom with a copper soaking tub and rainfall shower. A substantial $6,374 monthly maintenance fee rounds it all off, covering the building's doorman, security guard, and concierge services.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Kennedy, known for his controversial vaccine stances, has made several conspiracy theories over the years. The bizarre theories on Covid-19 during the pandemic have made headlines across the world.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robert F Kennedy Jr, the eccentric scion of America's most prominent political dynasty, has been named the head of the US Health Department by President-elect Donald Trump. Trump said that Robert Kennedy would restore agencies like the Health and Human Services to the traditions of gold-standard scientific research and end the chronic disease epidemic.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/people/robert-f-kennedy-jr-anti-vaccine-activist-who-is-now-us-health-secretary-7023554">Robert Kennedy Jr</a>, an anti-vaxxer known for his controversial views on vaccines, has been in the news for a string of conspiracy theories and bizarre statements over the years. If approved by the Senate, which Trump's Republican Party controls, the 70-year-old Kennedy Jr will have authority over 13 agencies that come under the Health and Human Services - which include the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which also has an international role; the National Institutes of Health that do cutting edge research; and Medicare, the government's health insurance for seniors. This may even give Kennedy Jr the power to subvert the entire US health system.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at some of RJK Jr's conspiracy theories:</p>

<h3><strong>Covid-19 Targets Certain Races</strong></h3>

<p>Robert Kennedy Jr had bizarrely suggested during the peak COVID-19 pandemic that the disease targets certain races while skipping others. According to him, Covid "ethnically targeted" white and black people and "spared" the Jewish and Chinese people.</p>

<p>Another theory he propagated was that Covid was genetically engineered and was a bioweapons problem.</p>

<p>He also promoted the use of unapproved treatment and prevention of Covid - &nbsp;ivermectin (an antiparasitic drug that studies have shown does not effectively treat or prevent Covid).</p>

<h3><strong>Vaccine Can Cause Autism&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>According to RFK Jr, vaccinations can cause autism - a neurological and developmental disorder. In a 2006 Rolling Stone article, the 70-year-old had said modern vaccine formulas are leading to a rise in autism, adding that the US government knew about it but was allowing the pharmaceutical industry to "poison" Americans, reported Forbes.</p>

<h3><strong>CIA Helped In John F Kennedy's Assassination&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Robert F <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr-quits-white-house-race-a-look-at-his-bizarre-campaign-6406892">Kennedy</a> Jr claimed that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was involved in the 1963 assassination of former US President John F Kennedy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>RFK Jr is the nephew of John F Kennedy and the son of his brother, Robert, a Senator and former Attorney General - who was also assassinated in 1968.</p>

<h3><strong>Voter Fraud In 2004 Presidential Election&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>According to the longtime environment and health campaigner, voter fraud allowed George W Bush to win the 2004 US Presidential election against Democratic leader John Kerry.</p>

<h3><strong>Prescription Drugs Lead To Mass Shootings&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>During a Twitter Spaces discussion with Elon Musk a few years ago, RFK Jr linked prescription drugs to the mass shootings in the US. According to him, drugs like Prozac lead to the shootings.</p>

<p>"Before the antidepressants, there were no shooting incidents," he told Musk.</p>

<h3><strong>Parasitic Worm Ate His Brain&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Robert F Kennedy Jr also shares strange stories from his personal life. He had once said a parasitic worm entered his brain, ate a portion of it, and then died.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump is handing top roles for his future White House to a mix of political allies, firebrands and a few relatively conventional figures.</p>

<p>These are the key nominations, some requiring potentially difficult Senate confirmations -- unless Trump can circumvent scrutiny through a process called recess appointments.</p>

<p><strong>Health Secretary: RFK Jr.</strong></p>

</div>

<p>F. Kennedy Jr. is a longtime health and environmental campaigner, who at 70 proudly shows off his muscular body.</p>

<p>But the scion of the famous US political dynasty is also a leading anti-vaccine activist and conspiracy theorist who has promoted the disproven idea that childhood vaccines cause autism and claimed that Covid vaccines were deadly.</p>

<p><strong>'Government Efficiency': Elon Musk</strong></p>

</div>

<p>Musk, the world's richest man, was tapped to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency, along with another wealthy Trump ally, Vivek Ramaswamy.</p>

<p>Musk says he is targeting $2 trillion in cuts from the federal government's $7 trillion budget, without explaining how.</p>

<p>There has been no explanation of how the Tesla, SpaceX and Starlink boss would navigate conflicts of interest as a major US government contractor.</p>

<p><strong>Secretary of State: Marco Rubio</strong></p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/4dcjqha_marco-rubio_625x300_14_November_24.jpeg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Trump tapped the Florida senator to be top diplomat, with an eye to intensifying the US power struggle with China.</p>

<p>Rubio, a relatively traditional conservative hawk, has said China seeks "to reorient the world."</p>

<p>The son of Cuban immigrants is a fervent supporter of Israel and longtime critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p><strong>Defense Secretary: Pete Hegseth</strong></p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/i67anblg_pete-hegseth_625x300_13_November_24.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Fox News host and National Guard veteran Hegseth was nominated to lead the world's most powerful military, despite a slim CV.</p>

<p>Hegseth joined Fox News -- Trump's favorite network -- in 2014 and hosts a weekend program. The Pentagon employs some 2.9 million people.</p>

<p><strong>National Security Advisor: Mike Waltz</strong></p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/bgettsik_mike-waltz-michael-waltz-reuters_625x300_13_November_24.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Congressman and former special forces officer Waltz has been tapped as Trump's top White House foreign policy advisor.</p>

<p>Waltz is critical of both China and Russia, but backs winding down support for Ukraine.</p>

<p><strong>CIA Director: John Ratcliffe</strong></p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2019-08/hd0m43v8_john-ratcliffe-afp_625x300_03_August_19.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Ratcliffe, who was director of national intelligence at the tumultuous end of Trump's first term, has been tapped to lead the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>

<p>He defended Trump during his first impeachment trial for allegedly blackmailing Ukraine's president. But he is seen as somewhat of an institutionalist and a relatively safe pair of hands.</p>

<p><strong>Director of National Intelligence: Tulsi Gabbard</strong></p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/s7vp5rvg_tulsi-gabbard-reuters_625x300_14_November_24.jpeg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>

</div>

<p>Gabbard, a former Hawaii congresswoman, switched sides from the Democrats to back Trump's reelection. She has stood out for echoing Kremlin talking points about the invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>As director of national intelligence, she'd oversee coordination of the 18 intelligence agencies.</p>

<p><strong>Attorney General: Matt Gaetz</strong></p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/bu592dr8_matt-gaetz-reuters_625x300_14_November_24.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><span class="ins_instory_span_credit">Photo Credit: Reuters</span></p>
</div>

<p>A pro-Trump firebrand in Congress, Gaetz was subject to a House ethics probe into alleged sex trafficking.</p>

<p>The Justice Department, which he would head, announced last year that it would not bring charges in the same case, after a lengthy inquiry. The department is also expected to drop a string of criminal cases against Trump.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Trump named his personal attorneys Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, who defended him during his trial this year over hush money payments to former porn star Stormy Daniels, as deputies to Gaetz.</p>

<p>John Sauer, who represented Trump during his successful presidential immunity case before the Supreme Court, was also tapped as solicitor general.</p>

<p><strong>Homeland Security Secretary: Kristi Noem</strong></p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/7tq94hrk_kristi-noem-afp_625x300_13_November_24.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>South Dakota Governor Noem, a longtime Trump loyalist, would play a key role in any Trump effort to restrict immigration and deport undocumented migrants.</p>

<p>Noem became famous for admitting that she shot an "untrainable" pet dog, saying it showed her ability to make tough choices.</p>

<p>Veteran immigration official Tom Homan is set to be the country's "border czar."</p>

<p><strong>Secretary of the Interior: Doug Burgum</strong></p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/jdtago4o_doug-burgum_625x300_15_November_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, a billionaire businessman-turned-politician like Trump, was picked to lead the Department of the Interior, which oversees federal lands, including their oil and gas production.</p>

<p>Burgum ran against Trump in the 2024 Republican primary and was on the shortlist of his potential vice presidential picks.</p>

<p><strong>UN Ambassador: Elise Stefanik</strong></p>

<p>New York congresswoman Stefanik is a vocal Trump ally and pro-Israel stalwart. She was among the first to be nominated as the president-elect rolled out his choices.</p>

<p><strong>Ambassador to Israel: Mike Huckabee</strong></p>

<p>Trump says the former Arkansas governor, a Christian pastor-turned-politician, "loves Israel, and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him."</p>

<p><strong>Others</strong></p>

<p>Environmental Protection Agency: Former congressman Lee Zeldin.</p>

<p>White House Chief of Staff: Trump campaign manager Susie Wiles.</p>

<p>Veterans Affairs secretary: Iraq war veteran and former Georgia congressman Doug Collins.</p>

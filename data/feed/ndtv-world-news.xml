       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire Elon Musk promised on Saturday to give away $1 million each day until November's election to someone who signs his online petition supporting the U.S. Constitution. And he wasted no time, awarding a $1 million check to an attendee of his event in Pennsylvania aimed at rallying supporters behind Republican Donald Trump. The winner was a man named John Dreher, according to event staff.</p>

<p>"By the way, John had no idea. So anyway, you're welcome," the Tesla founder said as he handed Dreher the check.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Link to the petition:<a href="https://t.co/Wb3hUCxGvl">https://t.co/Wb3hUCxGvl</a></p>
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1847860746627023143?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>The money is the latest example of Musk using his extraordinary wealth to influence the tightly-contested presidential race between Trump and his Democratic rival Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Musk started America PAC, a political action organization he founded in support of Trump's presidential campaign. The group is helping mobilize and register voters in battleground states, but there are signs it is having trouble meeting its goals.</p>

<p>The Harrisburg event is the third in as many days in Pennsylvania, where Musk is painting November's election in stark terms and encouraging supporters to vote early and get others to do the same.</p>

<p>He said on Saturday that if Harris wins, it will be "the last election," suggesting the US will no longer exist.</p>

<p>He also said the two assassination attempts against Trump prove he is ruffling feathers and upending the status quo in ways Harris won't. He said that's why no one is trying to kill Harris.</p>

<p>"Assassinating a puppet is worthless," Musk said, reiterating an argument he has made in a social media post.</p>

<p>The petition Musk is asking people to sign reads: "The First and Second Amendments guarantee freedom of speech and the right to bear arms. By signing below, I am pledging my support for the First and Second Amendments."</p>

<p>Attendees of Saturday's event had to sign the petition, which allows America PAC to garner contact details for more potential voters that it can work to get to the polls for Trump.</p>

<p>Musk, ranked by Forbes as the world's richest person, so far has supplied at least $75 million to America PAC, according to federal disclosures, making the group a crucial part of Trump's bid to regain the White House.</p>

<p>The entrepreneur behind carmaker Tesla and rocket and satellite venture SpaceX has increasingly supported Republican causes and this year became an outspoken Trump supporter.</p>

<p>Trump in turn has said if elected he would appoint Musk to head a government efficiency commission.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Nikita Twitchen, a former admin assistant at First Grade Projects, launched an unfair dismissal claim, alleging her pregnancy was the reason for her termination.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman in the UK who was fired from her job when she came back from maternity leave pregnant again, has been awarded 28,000 pounds by an employment tribunal.&nbsp;Nikita Twitchen, a former admin assistant at First Grade Projects in Pontypridd launched an unfair dismissal claim, alleging her pregnancy was the reason for her termination, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/10/19/mum-sacked-coming-back-maternity-leave-pregnant-21826305/#:~:text=A%20mum%20who%20lost%20her,Grade%20Projects%20in%20April%202022.">Metro</a></em> reported.&nbsp;During her back-to-work meeting with Managing Director Jeremy Morgan in early 2022, Ms Twitchen revealed she was expecting another child, which she claims caught her boss off guard.</p>

<p>Initially, the meeting seemed positive, with Mr Morgan expressing enthusiasm for her return. However, Ms Twitchen testified that the tone shifted dramatically upon disclosing her pregnancy, leading her to believe her job loss was directly linked to her pregnancy.</p>

<p>The woman said that when her maternity leave ended in March 2022, her company didn't reach out to discuss her return. She then emailed her boss on April 4 about holiday entitlement, but he didn't respond, which was unusual. Ms Twitchen followed up on April 11 and 18. Later that day, Mr Morgan called her to say she was being made redundant due to financial struggles&nbsp;and delays in some payments to the business.</p>

<p>He later claimed new software was being installed which meant her role ''would no longer exist.''</p>

<p>However, the tribunal ruled in Ms Twitchen's favour, finding First Grade Projects liable for unfair dismissal and awarding her 28,000 pounds in compensation.&nbsp;Judge Robin Harvard pointed out a significant inconsistency in Jeremy Morgan's reasoning for making her redundant. During their February meeting, Mr Morgan had claimed the business was doing well and made no mention of financial difficulties. He also didn't mention the new software that supposedly made Ms Twitchen's role obsolete, even during their April phone call.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The judge criticised First Grade's failure to ''produce any evidence of the alleged financial difficulties or the new software'' during the court case. He also pointed out that at no stage did Ms Twitchen receive a written statement setting out the reasons for her dismissal.&nbsp;Judge Havard ruled that Ms Twitchen was dismissed because she was pregnant.</p>

<p>He said that her dismissal was "unfair, discriminatory, and caused significant emotional distress." He emphasised that being fired while pregnant and losing financial stability had a profound impact on her, particularly given her family responsibilities.</p>

<p>First Grade Projects told <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/boss-laid-member-staff-because-30174272" rel="nofollow, noindex">WalesOnline</a></em> in a statement: "We are extremely disappointed with the outcome of the tribunal. We are actively reviewing all relevant information and considering all available options. At this point in time we are unable to provide any further comment."</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Fawzia Sido recounted how, at the age of nine, she was captured along with her brothers and starved for three days. She was rescued by Israel from Gaza earlier this month.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two weeks after her rescue by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) from Gaza, Yazidi survivor Fawzia Amin Sido has recounted the harrowing atrocities she endured during her time in captivity under ISIS. Ms Sido recounted how, at the age of nine, she was captured along with her brothers and forced to march from Sinjar to Tal Afar. The group was starved for three days before being fed rice and meat, which they later discovered was the flesh of Yazidi babies.</p>

<p>“They made rice and gave us meat to eat with it. The meat had a weird taste, and some of us had stomach aches afterwards,” Ms Sido recalled, as per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-825066" rel="nofollow,noindex">Jerusalem Post</a>.</p>

<p>“When we were done, they told us that this was the meat of Yazidi babies. They showed us pictures of beheaded babies and said, ‘these are the kids that you ate now.'”</p>

<p>“One woman suffered heart failure and died shortly after,” Ms Sido said, adding that one mother even recognised her own child because of the baby's hands. “They forced us. But it's very hard to know that it happened. But it was not in our hands,” she said.</p>

<p>Fawzia Sido was one of many Yazidi women enslaved by ISIS in 2014 during the group's reign of terror. The Yazidis, a religious minority in northern Iraq, were subjected to unimaginable horrors.</p>

<p>Ms Sido's revelation follows previous accusations that ISIS fed human meat to their captives. Yazidi parliamentarian Vian Dakhil first brought this practice to light in 2017, but Ms Sido's firsthand account is one of the clearest confirmations of this depravity.</p>

<p>Fawzia Sido's ordeal did not end with the forced consumption of human flesh. She was held captive for nine months in an underground prison alongside 200 other Yazidi women and children. Some of the children died due to contaminated water. Ms Sido was also sold to multiple jihadi fighters, including Abu Amar al-Makdisi, with whom she had two children.</p>

<p>After years of captivity, she was rescued by the IDF in a joint operation with the US Embassy and returned to her family in Iraq. However, her children remain in Gaza with her captor's family, where they are being raised as Arab Muslims.</p>

<p>She said, “Until I got back to Iraq, I was all the time a ‘sabaya,' also in Gaza,” using the Arabic term for a young woman held captive and exploited sexually.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A drone this week helped Ukrainian troops attack a military training facility of Russian troops in Zaporizhzhia Oblast in Russian-occupied southern Ukraine.</p>

<p>At the time of the attack on October 15, there were about 24 soldiers in the area, Ukraine's Southern Defense Forces said in a statement on Facebook without specifying the number of casualties.</p>

<p>They also tagged a video that showed the drone footage of an initial explosion at the facility followed by a number of additional blasts in the area.</p>

<p>According to reports, there have been about seven attacks on Russian trainees all along the 700-mile front line since February.</p>

<p>Ukraine claims it has <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ukraine-says-downed-69-drones-2-missiles-in-overnight-russian-attack-6668506" target="_blank">killed about 6.7 lakh Russian troops</a> since the war began in 2022. The Ukrainian Defence Forces said on Saturday that they have destroyed 144 Russian artillery brigades, equivalent to $ 8 billion, this year.</p>

<p>Earlier today, regional officials said that Ukraine launched a series of drones targeting Moscow and western Russia.</p>

<p>Russia's air-defence units destroyed at least one drone flying towards Moscow, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergei Sobyanin said.</p>

<p>According to preliminary information, there was no damage or casualties where debris fell in the Ramensky district of the Moscow region.</p>

<p>Drone debris sparked several short-lived fires in the Lipetsk region in southwestern Russia, the region's governor said. No injuries were reported, he added.</p>

<p>Governors of the Bryansk and Oryol regions, also in western parts of Russia, reported that air defence units destroyed several drones there.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/russia-ukraine-swap-190-pows-ministry-6823089" target="_blank">Ukraine</a> has often said in the past that its air attacks target infrastructure key to Russia's war efforts and are a response to Moscow's continued air attacks.</p>

<p>Russian officials, on the other hand, often do not disclose the full extent of damage inflicted by the drone attacks, especially on military, transport or energy infrastructure.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Celebrations sparkled up the Times Square in New York City yesterday as the Indian community and several US citizens gathered to observe the Hindu festival of lights.</p>

<p>The event featured performances from various cultural groups. Among the notable attendees were Mayor Eric Adams, New York State Assemblywoman Jennifer Rajkumar, Senator Chuck Schumer and Consul General of India in New York, Binaya Pradhan. Ms Rajkumar has been a key advocate for recognizing Diwali as a school holiday in the USA throughout.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mayor Adams took to social media platform X (formerly, Twitter) to address the event.</p>

<p>"Proud to be with our Hindu brothers and sisters today for the annual Diwali at Times Square celebration as we push away the darkness and welcome in light all across our city," he wrote.</p>

<p>While the festive spirit, through such events and recognitions, continues to exhibit an attempt at endeavours towards fostering a spirit of unity and equality, the Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI)'s recent report showed another side of South Asian experiences. As reported by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/online-hate-against-south-asian-americans-rises-steadily-report-says-2024-10-09/">Reuters</a>, the AAPI <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://stopaapihate.org/2024/10/09/south-asian-report-oct24-press-release/">study</a> shows that South Asian people in the US have been facing alarmingly high levels of hate ahead of the 2024 elections, which transcends not just to the common people but also to heavyweights such as Kamala Harris, and Usha Vance. Such celebrations of South Asian festivities thus do their bit in bringing together the diverse communities in a dazzling show of vibrant unity across the globe.</p>

<p>Last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent a video message to 'the attendees, emphasizing the festival's role in promoting unity and goodwill. He stated that Diwali serves as a reminder of the victory of good over evil and the importance of knowledge over ignorance. He has also highlighted the importance of the Indian community in the US and referred to them as a 'living bridge' connecting the two places. Diwali falls on November 1st this year.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Boeing workers began a strike on September 13 in a dispute over pay and other compensation issues.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Boeing and its striking Seattle-area workers have reached a tentative deal to end a more than month-long stoppage, the union said Saturday. Boeing confirmed a tentative deal was reached and said it includes a 35 percent pay raise over four years and a one-time signing bonus of $7,000. Union members will vote Wednesday on the proposal.</p>

<p>The strike began September 13 in a dispute over pay and other compensation issues, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers said on social media platform X in a message to its members.</p>

<p>"It warrants presenting to the members and is worthy of your consideration," IAM Union District 751 said.</p>

<p>The strike by some 33,000 unionized workers, mainly in Washington state, halted work at two Seattle-area assembly plants and production of its 737 MAX planes.</p>

<p>The workers were seeking hefty wage hikes and other gains, complaining of more than a decade of near-flat wages amid inflation.</p>

<p>Wage increases had been a stumbling block. Boeing first offered a 25 percent raise, and then 30 percent, while the union wanted 40 percent.</p>

<p>Workers had also been pressing for the restoration of a traditional employer-paid pension plan, which Boeing withdrew in 2014, but they did not get it.</p>

<p>Such retirement plans had been a staple of the American workplace for decades but they are now rare, as the onus for preparing for old age has shifted from employer to employee.</p>

<p>Instead, among the sweeteners Boeing is now offering are enhanced contributions to largely worker-funded retirement schemes called 401(k) plans.</p>

<p>The strike has cost an estimated $7.6 billion in direct losses -- including at least $4.35 billion for Boeing and almost $2 billion for its suppliers -- the Anderson Economic Group consultancy said Friday.</p>

<p>Boeing said in a one-sentence statement, "We look forward to our employees voting on the negotiated proposal."</p>

<p>The work stoppage added to the company's litany of problems.</p>

<p>Boeing sank into further turmoil in January when a window panel blew out mid-flight on an Alaska Airlines plane, necessitating an emergency landing on a 737 MAX, the aircraft involved in two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.</p>

<p>That led to the Federal Aviation Administration tightening oversight of Boeing's production processes, capping the company's output.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This week Boeing unveiled measures meant to replenish its cash flow, including an intention to raise up to $25 billion, as it navigated recurrent production problems and the strike.</p>

<p>Last week, Boeing said it planned to cut 10 percent of its workforce as it projected a large third-quarter loss in the wake of the labor action.</p>

<p>The cuts of 17,000 positions globally will include executives, managers and employees, according to Chief Executive Kelly Ortberg, who added that the company must "reset our workforce levels to align with our financial reality."</p>

<p>In other fallout from the strike, Boeing has said it is pushing back first delivery of its 777X plane to 2026 from 2025.</p>

<p>The much-delayed jet was originally supposed to enter service in January 2020.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A 19-year-old girl suffered a horrific attack on a bus when a stranger bit off part of her face, leaving her requiring 50 stitches.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A teenager in the UK suffered a horrific attack on a bus when an inebriated stranger allegedly assaulted her. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/10/18/girl-19-face-bitten-off-stranger-bus-front-passengers-21825416/">Metro, </a></em>the incident occurred last year when Darren Taylor, 53, began making inappropriate comments about Ella Dowling and her friends. An argument between them followed, but as the bus pulled up at the Promenade and the teen tried to get off, Taylor lunged at her.&nbsp;He grabbed the 19-year-old's face and repeatedly bit her nose and mouth. The violent assault lasted approximately five minutes, leaving Ms Dowling severely injured.</p>

<p>With the help of her friends, she managed to escape and bystanders held Taylor until the police arrived. He was arrested for causing grievous bodily harm with intent after leaving the teen student severely injured. Her&nbsp;left nostril to the lower part of her top lip was detached, except for a thin layer of skin. Her lip on the right side was also split open and she had visible bite marks over her nose and mouth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The young woman was quickly taken to Cheltenham General Hospital before moving to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital for emergency surgery. She required 50 stitches for her injuries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In March 2024, Taylor pleaded guilty to GBH with intent at Gloucester Crown Court. On July 18, he received a sentence of six years and nine months in prison, accompanied by a lifelong restraining order.</p>

<p>Ella, a social work student at Portsmouth University from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, said, ''The pain I felt when he sank his teeth into my face is something which will stay with me forever. He was like a dog with a toy – moving his head side to side. I put my hands around the back of his head because I knew if I didn't he would rip my lip and nose off completely. When I saw my face for the first time after the attack, I didn't recognise my own reflection, and I couldn't look in the mirror for months after that.''</p>

<p>Ms Dowling revealed that the traumatic experience left her with lasting effects. She hasn't taken the bus since the incident due to her post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Whenever she leaves her house, she requires constant reassurance, needing to be on the phone with her mother or a friend due to an intense fear of being attacked again.</p>

<p>She added, ''People say my scar is healing well but for me, it's more than a scar, it's a disfigurement and a permanent reminder of what's happened to me. I smile and speak differently which is something I'm going to have to learn to live with for the rest of my life.''</p>

<p>Detective Constable Sophie McGough commented, ''The injuries Taylor caused were some of the worst I have ever seen. His actions that evening were dreadful, and I am relieved that he will now serve time behind bars.''</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk, the owner of X, while speaking at a town hall in the swing state of Pennsylvania, claimed that voting machines rig elections, ABC News reported.</p>

<p>Musk is on a speaking tour around Pennsylvania, ABC News reported.</p>

<p>In his speech, Musk linked voting machines by Dominion to Republicans' losses in Philadelphia and Arizona, saying, "There's always a sort of question of like, say, the Dominion voting machines. It is weird that you know, I think they're used in Philadelphia and Maricopa County, but not in a lot of other places," ABC News reported. "Doesn't that seem like a heck of a coincidence?" Musk said while calling for states around the country to "only do paper ballots, hand-counted."</p>

<p>Elon Musk emerged as a staunch supporter of Presidential Republican candidate Donald Trump and donated USD 75 million to his Political Action Committee to put Trump back in the White House. The donation made Musk one of the largest spenders of the 2024 cycle, as per ABC News.</p>

<p>"I'm a technologist, I know a lot about computers," Musk told the crowd during the event on Thursday (local time). "And I'm like, the last thing I would do is trust a computer program, because it's just too easy to hack."</p>

<p>Musk mentioned a voting machine company Dominion, which last year sued Fox News for defamation over the network's claims that it engaged in a vote-rigging conspiracy, then agreed to a landmark USD 787 million settlement with the network, as per ABC reported.</p>

<p>A statement given by Dominion's spokesperson following Musk's comments said, "Fact: Dominion does not serve Philadelphia County. Fact: Dominion's voting systems are already based on voter verified paper ballots. Fact: Hand counts and audits of such paper ballots have repeatedly proven that Dominion machines produce accurate results. These are not matters of opinion. They are verifiable facts," ABC News quoted.</p>

<p>ABC News reported that even before Musk's comments, Dominion issued a statement, encouraging voters to rely on verified sources of information with regards to elections.</p>

<p>"We are closely monitoring claims around the 2024 election. We strongly encourage people to rely upon verified, credible sources of election information -- sources who can fully explain the many layers of physical, operational, and technical safeguards that exist to protect the integrity of our elections, including voting with paper ballots that can be audited and recounted," ABC News quoted Dominion's statement.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel on Saturday released footage showing Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar moving his belongings to a tunnel in Gaza hours before the October 7 attack last year that triggered the ongoing war.</p>

<p>The footage was released following <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-drops-leaflets-over-gaza-showing-yahya-sinwars-body-and-message-to-hamas-6828030">Sinwar's death</a> in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, in a firefight that ended with the Hamas leader cornered and alone in a destroyed building.</p>

<p>The footage shows <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-is-yahya-sinwar-the-hamas-leader-killed-by-israel-6819037">Sinwar</a> and his wife and children moving belongings, including a television, water, pillows and mattresses, into the tunnel that Israeli army spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said was located under the family home in Khan Younis.</p>

<p>During a press briefing, Hagari showed photos of the underground compound, which had toilets, showers and a kitchen. Food, cash and documents were also found there.</p>

<p>Hamas, meanwhile, said Sinwar died heroically engaging in battle, calling Hagar's remarks "blatant lies".</p>

<p>Drone footage from earlier this week showed Sinwar critically wounded in his last moments, throwing an object at the drone. Autopsy found that Sinwar was killed by a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bullet-in-head-finger-cut-off-chilling-details-of-yahya-sinwars-autopsy-6822817">gunshot to the head</a>, and also found one of his fingers was cut off.</p>

<p>During a year of the Israel-Hamas conflict, the Israel Defence Forces had often closed in on Sinwar, but the latter managed to escape.&nbsp;Israel had identified Sinwar's final hiding after the military found "his DNA sample on a tissue with which he blew his nose," said Hagari.</p>

<p>While the October 7 attack in Israel killed around 1,200 people and resulted in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/yahya-sinwars-death-clouds-path-to-freeing-israeli-hostages-6824913">235 people being taken hostage</a>, the Israel operation in Gaza over a year has resulted in over 40,000 deaths.</p>

<p>The death of Sinwar, who had just months ago replaced&nbsp;slain predecessor Ismail Haniyeh, raises questions on who will lead the Hamas amid a war that has also drawn in Lebanon. Israeli attacks on Lebanon killed at least 2,350 people over the last year, according to the Lebanese health ministry, with more than 1.2 million people displaced. Hezbollah attacks have killed 50 Israeli soldiers and civilians, according to Israel.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two highly classified US intelligence documents have leaked, allegedly exposing <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hits-beirut-gaza-after-assassination-attempt-on-benjamin-netanyahu-by-iran-backed-hezbollah-6829326#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll_Imagetopscroll">Israel</a>'s military preparations for a potential strike on Iran, the New York Times <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/19/us/politics/us-intelligence-israel-iran.html" rel="noindex,nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a>. The documents, originating from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) - "responsible for analysing images and information collected by American spy satellites" - offer insights into Israeli military exercises and operational readiness.</p>

<p>The two documents, dated October 15 and 16, were circulated on Telegram by accounts largely associated with pro-Iran sentiments. They provide detailed analyses of satellite images showing Israel's military exercises, which appear to be in preparation for a retaliatory strike on Iran. The potential strike comes in the wake of escalating tensions following an Iranian missile barrage on October 1, itself a retaliation for an earlier Israeli attack.</p>

<p><strong>READ </strong>| <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/netanyahu-says-attempt-by-irans-proxy-hezbollah-to-assassinate-me-and-my-wife-was-a-grave-mistake-6827757">"Grave Mistake": Netanyahu On Hezbollah's "Assassination" Attempt</a></p>

<p>One of the documents is titled "Israel: Air Force Continues Preparations for Strike on Iran" and outlines recent Israeli exercises that seem to rehearse a potential military operation against Iran. These preparations reportedly include air-to-air refuelling operations, search-and-rescue missions, and the repositioning of missile systems in anticipation of potential Iranian strikes. The second document reveals Israeli efforts to move munitions and other military assets to strategic locations.</p>

<p>Although the documents describe Israeli military movements and exercises, they do not provide satellite images themselves. The US intelligence gathered from these images suggests that Israel is gearing up for a strike, but it is unclear whether these documents reveal the full scope of Israel's plans for Iran.</p>

<p><strong>US Response&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The leaks have reportedly prompted immediate concern within the US government. US officials are divided over the severity of the leak, with some downplaying its impact given that the documents do not reveal new American capabilities. Others, however, are alarmed by the exposure of Israel's sensitive military plans, particularly at a time of heightened tensions in the Middle East.&nbsp;</p>

<p>President Joe Biden, when asked during a recent trip to Germany whether he was aware of Israel's planned strike on Iran and its targets, responded with a brief "Yes and yes," but declined to elaborate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the exact source of the leak remains unknown, early indications suggest that the documents may have been taken by a lower-level US government employee. A joint investigation by the Pentagon, U.S. intelligence agencies, and the FBI is underway to determine how the information was leaked and whether more documents could follow.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A short story by Bram Stoker, the legendary author of "Dracula", has been unearthed by a lifelong enthusiast in Dublin who stumbled upon the work while browsing in a library archive.</p>

<p>Titled "Gibbet Hill", the story was uncovered by Brian Cleary in a Christmas supplement of the Dublin edition of the Daily Mail newspaper from 1890 and had remained undocumented for more than 130 years.</p>

<p>The rare find, which has never been referenced in any Stoker bibliography or biography, is now being brought to the public for the first time at an exhibition in the Irish capital.</p>

<p>"Dracula", the Gothic, mysterious and supernatural vampire novel from 1897 may have been set in Transylvania and England but its author, Stoker, was a Dubliner.</p>

<p>"I read 'Dracula' as a child and it stuck with me, I read everything from and about Stoker that I could get my hands on," said Cleary, 44, a writer and amateur historian who lives in the Marino neighbourhood of Dublin where the author grew up.</p>

<p>Thanks to "Dracula", Stoker "had a massive impact on popular culture, but is under-appreciated", Cleary told AFP in the Casino at Marino, an opulent 18th-century building near the writer's birthplace that is hosting the exhibition.</p>

<p><strong>'Flabbergasted'</strong></p>

<p>Cleary's journey of discovery began in 2021 when a sudden onset of deafness changed his life.</p>

<p>While on leave to retrain his hearing after having cochlear implant surgery, Cleary visited the National Library of Ireland to indulge his interest in historical literature and the works of Stoker.</p>

<p>There, in October 2023, he chanced upon the hidden literary gem, the "Gibbet Hill" story which he had never heard of before.</p>

<p>"I sat in the library flabbergasted, that I was looking at potentially a lost ghost story from Stoker, especially one from around the time he was writing 'Dracula', with elements of 'Dracula' in it," said Cleary.</p>

<p>"I sat looking at the screen wondering, am I the only living person who had read it? Followed by, what on earth do I do with it?"</p>

<p>Cleary did extensive literary searches to verify the find and consulted Stoker expert and biographer Paul Murray who confirmed the story was unknown, lost and buried in the archives for more than 130 years.</p>

<p>"'Gibbet Hill' is very significant in terms of Stoker's development as a writer, 1890 was when he was a young writer and made his first notes for 'Dracula'," Murray told AFP.</p>

<p>"It's a classic Stoker story, the struggle between good and evil, evil which crops up in exotic and unexplained ways, and is a way station on his route to publishing 'Dracula'."</p>

<p><strong>Illustrations</strong></p>

<p>The macabre tale tells of a sailor murdered by three criminals whose bodies were strung up on a gibbet or hanging gallows on a hill as a ghostly warning to passing travellers.</p>

<p>To celebrate the discovery, "Gibbet Hill" has been captured in a book that features cover art and illustrations inspired by the story by respected Irish artist Paul McKinley.</p>

<p>"It's quite surreal now to be standing next to a picture inspired by three of the characters in the story," said Cleary.</p>

<p>"When Brian sent me the 'Gibbet Hill' there was so much I could work with," said McKinley.</p>

<p>His eery, sometimes sinister illustrations include a "juicy, wet, oily painting" of worms inspired by a young character in the story who has a bunch of earthworms in his hands.</p>

<p>"Making new images for an old story that has been buried for so long" was a "fascinating challenge" said the artist.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cuba's electrical grid collapsed again early on Saturday morning, state-run media reported, plunging the entire country into blackout for a second time just hours after authorities announced they had begun reestablishing service.</p>

<p>CubaDebate, one of the islands state-run media outlets, said Cub's grid operator, UNE, had reported at 6:15AM the "total disconnection of the national electro-energetic system."</p>

<p>"The Electric Union is working on its reestablishment," the brief message said.</p>

<p>Cub's electrical grid first collapsed around midday on Friday after one of the island's largest power plants failed, suddenly leaving more than 10 million without power.</p>

<p>Even before the grid's collapse, an electricity shortfall on Friday had forced Cub's communist-run government to send non-essential state workers home and cancel school classes for children as it sought to conserve fuel for generation.</p>

<p>But lights began to flicker on in scattered pockets across the island early in the evening on Friday, offering some hope that power would be restored.</p>

<p>The grid operator has not yet provided any details on what caused the grid to collapse again on Saturday, or how long it will take to reestablish service.</p>

<p>Cub's government has blamed weeks of worsening blackouts - often 10 to 20 hours a day across much of the island - on deteriorating infrastructure, fuel shortages and rising demand.</p>

<p>Strong winds that began with Hurricane Milton last week had also complicated the island's ability to deliver scarce fuel from boats offshore to feed its power plants, officials have said.</p>

<p>Fuel deliveries to the island have dropped off significantly this year, as Venezuela, Russia and Mexico, once key suppliers, have reduced their exports to Cuba.</p>

<p>Key ally Venezuela slashed by half its deliveries of subsidized fuel to Cuba this year, forcing the island to search elsewhere for far more pricey oil on the spot market.</p>

<p>Cuba's government also blames the U.S. trade embargo, as well as sanctions under then-President Donald Trump, for ongoing difficulties in acquiring fuel and spare parts to operate and maintain its oil-fired plants.</p>

<p>The United States on Friday denied any role in the grid collapse in Cuba.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli planes dropped leaflets over southern Gaza on Saturday showing a picture of the dead Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar with the message that "Hamas will no longer rule Gaza", echoing language used by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

<p>The move came as Israeli military strikes killed at least 35 people across the Gaza Strip and its forces tightened a siege around hospitals in Jabalia in the north of the enclave, Palestinian health officials said.</p>

<p>"Whoever drops the weapon and hands over the hostages will be allowed to leave and live in peace," the leaflet, written in Arabic, read, according to residents of the southern city of Khan Younis and images circulating online.</p>

<p>The leaflet's wording was from a statement by Netanyahu on Thursday after Sinwar was killed by Israeli soldiers operating in Rafah, in the south near the Egyptian border, on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The October 7 attack Sinwar planned on Israeli communities a year ago killed around 1,200 people, with another 253 dragged back to Gaza as hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's subsequent war has devastated Gaza, killing more than 42,500 Palestinians, with another 10,000 uncounted dead thought to lie under the rubble, Gaza health authorities say.</p>

<p>In the central Gaza Strip camp of Al-Maghzai, an Israeli strike on a house killed 11 people, while another strike at the nearby camp of Nuseirat killed four others.</p>

<p>Five other people were killed in two separate strikes in the south Gaza cities of Khan Younis and Rafah, medics said, while seven Palestinians were killed in the Shati camp in the northern Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Later on Saturday, an Israeli strike killed three Palestinians in Nuseirat in central Gaza, medics said.</p>

<p>Late on Friday, medics said 33 people, mostly women and children, were killed and 85 others were wounded in Israeli strikes that destroyed at least three houses in Jabalia.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it was unaware of that incident.</p>

<p>It said forces were continuing operations against Hamas across the enclave, killing several gunmen in Rafah and Jabalia and dismantling military infrastructure. Palestinian medics said five people were killed in Jabalia on Saturday.</p>

<p><strong>EVACUATION ORDERS</strong></p>

<p>Residents and medics said Israeli forces had tightened their siege on Jabalia, the largest of the enclave's eight historic camps, which it encircled by also sending tanks to nearby towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya and issuing evacuation orders to residents.</p>

<p>Israeli officials said evacuation orders were aimed at separating Hamas fighters from civilians and denied that there was any systematic plan to clear civilians out of Jabalia or other northern areas.</p>

<p>In Jabalia, residents said Israeli army forces besieged several shelters housing displaced families before they stormed them and detained dozens of men. Footage circulated on social media, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed dozens of Palestinian men sitting on the ground next to a tank, while others were led by a soldier to a gathering site.</p>

<p>Residents and medical officials said Israeli forces were bombing houses and besieging hospitals, preventing medical and food supplies from entering to force them to leave the camp.</p>

<p>Health officials said they refused orders by the Israeli army to evacuate the hospital or leave the patients, many in a critical condition, unattended.</p>

<p>"The Israeli occupation is intensifying its targeting of the health system in the northern Gaza Strip, by besieging and directly targeting the Indonesian Hospital, Kamal Adwan Hospital, and Al-Awda Hospital during the past hours and its insistence on putting them out of service," the Gaza health ministry said.</p>

<p>It said two patients in intensive care at the Indonesian Hospital died "as a result of the hospital's siege and the power outage and medical supplies".</p>

<p>Israel's military said the troops operating in the area had been "briefed on the importance of mitigating harm to civilians and medical infrastructure".</p>

<p>"It is emphasized that the hospital continues to operate without disruption and in full capacity, and there was no intentional fire directed at it," it said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China's consulate in Myanmar's city of Mandalay was attacked with an explosive device, local media said Saturday, adding that no deaths or injuries were reported.</p>

<p>The blast occurred at the consulate office in central Mandalay, south of the sprawling Royal Palace, around 7 pm Friday (1230 GMT Friday), local media said.</p>

<p>China is a major ally and arms supplier to Myanmar's junta, but it also maintains ties with ethnic groups fighting the military in Myanmar's northern Shan state, according to analysts.</p>

<p>Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military deposed the government of Aung San Suu Kyi and seized power in 2021.</p>

<p>A statement from the junta on Saturday night blamed "terrorists" for the incident, which it said it was investigating in cooperation with consulate officials.</p>

<p>It said security had found "a blast" had occurred and that it was "raising the necessary security measures".</p>

<p>"About two feet of clay tiles of the roof of the two-storey building were damaged," the statement said.</p>

<p>A Myanmar official in Mandalay confirmed to AFP there had been "an incident at the Chinese consulate office compound in Mandalay late evening yesterday".</p>

<p>"There was no one injured," the official said, without specifying the nature of the incident.</p>

<p>The Irrawaddy outlet reported a grenade had been thrown at the compound, which is usually guarded by members of Myanmar's security forces.</p>

<p>The Voice of Myanmar newspaper reported the consulate had been hit by an unidentified "explosion" without giving details.</p>

<p>China's embassy in Yangon did not respond to AFP's queries.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's usually a serene two-and-a-half-hour ride on Japan's famously efficient bullet train. But the journey quickly descended into a zombie apocalypse, with passengers screaming in terror.</p>

<p>Organisers of Saturday's adrenaline-filled trip, less than two weeks before Halloween, touted it as the "world's first haunted house experience on a running shinkansen".</p>

<p>On board one chartered car of the shinkansen -- the Japanese word for bullet train -- were around 40 thrill-seekers, ready to brave an encounter with the living dead between Tokyo and the western metropolis of Osaka.</p>

<p>The eerie experience was inspired by the hit 2016 South Korean action-horror movie "Train to Busan", in which a father and daughter trapped on a moving train battle zombies hungry for human flesh.</p>

<p>All seemed normal at first as the bullet train made a peaceful departure Saturday evening, but it wasn't long until the first gory attack.</p>

<p>The victims -- actors planted in seats by the organisers -- jerked in agony and then underwent a terrifying transformation before starting a rampage against their fellow passengers.</p>

<p>Event organiser Kenta Iwana of the group Kowagarasetai, which translates to the "scare squad", said they wanted to "depict the normally safe, peaceful shinkansen -- something we take for granted -- collapsing in the blink of an eye".</p>

<p><strong>'Like I was in the film'</strong></p>

<p>Sitting next to one of the actors was Joshua Payne, one of many foreign tourists on board.</p>

<p>"I literally felt like I was in the film, just sitting here watching it take place in front of me," the 31-year-old American told AFP.</p>

<p>"The fact that we can physically go from Tokyo to Osaka right now and have this whole performance at the same time... I think is really cool and maybe a little bit groundbreaking," he said.</p>

<p>It was far from Central Japan Railway Company's first experiment with the usually dazzlingly clean, accident-free shinkansen, a Japanese institution that turned 60 this year.</p>

<p>After demand for long-distance travel plunged during the Covid-19 pandemic, the railway operator started renting out bullet train compartments for special events to diversify its business.</p>

<p>A sushi restaurant, a bar and even a wrestling match have been hosted on the high-speed train, and carriages can also be reserved for private parties.</p>

<p>Marie Izumi of JR Central's tourism subsidiary told AFP that she was surprised by the idea for a zombie-themed commute when Kowagarasetai approached her, thinking it would be "almost impossible to pull off".</p>

<p>But the event has convinced her of "new possibilities" for the bullet train, Izumi said, adding that concerts and comedy shows might be a good fit in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Thriller</strong></p>

<p>On Saturday, toy chainsaws and guns were used as props, but depictions of extreme violence and gore that could tarnish the shinkansen's squeaky-clean reputation were avoided.</p>

<p>To counterbalance the subdued horror, the two-and-a-half-hour tour was peppered with light-hearted performances by zombie cheerleaders, magicians and comedians, including a choreographed dance to Michael Jackson's "Thriller".</p>

<p>"Nobody wants to sit tight for such a long time being constantly exposed to horror," said Ayaka Imaide from Kowagarasetai.</p>

<p>Many aboard the zombie-infested train said the experience alone was worth the ticket price of up to 50,000 yen ($335).</p>

<p>"It was very immersive," Naohiko Nozawa, 30, told AFP. "And the appearance of so many different kinds of zombies kept me entertained all the way."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Quite often over the last few years, you've had to really try hard to overcome all that was being aimed at you.</p>

<p>"You just wanted to be loved and to make people happy with your music," she added.</p>

<p>On Friday, Liam Payne's father visited the Buenos Aires hotel where his son plunged to his death from a third-floor balcony two days earlier, thanking fans gathered nearby in a shared moment of grief.</p>

<p>After landing in the Argentine capital that morning, Geoff Payne also visited the morgue where the body of his 31-year-old son was being kept pending the results of toxicological tests.</p>

<p>Meanwhile reactions continued to stream in, including from Girls Aloud star Cheryl Tweedy, Payne's former partner and the mother of their seven-year-old boy, Bear.</p>

<p>She called his death an "earth shattering event".</p>

<p>In a social media message, Tweedy hit out at "abhorrent reports and media exploitation" following Payne's passing, which were causing "further harm to everyone left behind picking up the pieces".</p>

<p>"Before you leave comments or make videos, ask yourself if you would like your own child or family to read them," she said.</p>

<p>"Please give Liam the little dignity he has left in the wake of his death to rest in some peace at last."</p>

<p>Payne died from "multiple traumas" and "internal and external haemorrhaging" after falling from the balcony of his room at the Casa Sur hotel in central Buenos Aires, an autopsy found.</p>

<p>Investigators said he appeared to have been "going through an episode of substance abuse."</p>

<p>Among others to pay tribute on Friday was Simon Cowell, the creator of and judge on "The X Factor" show that launched One Direction in 2010.</p>

<p>Cowell said he was "truly devastated", in an Instagram post also spoke directly to Payne.</p>

<p>"I want you to know how much love and respect I have for you," he said.</p>

<p>"I watched you spending so much time with people who had wanted to meet you. You really cared."</p>

<p>Cowell added that a meeting with Payne last year reminded him "that you were still the sweet, kind boy I had met all of those years ago."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gaza's health ministry said two patients at a hospital in the territory's north died during a siege by Israeli forces around the facility on Saturday, while Israel's military reported its troops were operating in the area.</p>

<p>Since dawn, Israeli forces had surrounded and shelled the Indonesian Hospital in the northern town of Beit Lahia, Gaza health officials said.</p>

<p>"Israeli tanks have completely surrounded the hospital, cut off electricity and shelled the hospital, targeting the second and third floors with artillery," the facility's director Marwan Sultan said.</p>

<p>"There are serious risks to medical staff and patients."</p>

<p>Later on Saturday, the health ministry of the Hamas-run territory said two patients in the hospital had died, blaming the Israeli military siege.</p>

<p>It said the military operation caused "the death of two patients inside the Indonesian Hospital in the northern Gaza Strip, as a result of the hospital's siege and the power outage and (lack of) medical supplies".</p>

<p>The ministry did not provide details about the two patients, their illnesses or the exact cause of their deaths.</p>

<p>It also accused the Israeli military of imposing a siege on hospitals across northern Gaza since midnight.</p>

<p><strong>'State of great panic'</strong></p>

<p>In an earlier statement, the ministry said Israel had targeted the upper floors of the Indonesian Hospital, adding there were "more than 40 patients and wounded in addition to the medical staff" present.</p>

<p>"Heavy gunfire" towards the hospital and its courtyard had sparked a "state of great panic" among patients and staff, it added.</p>

<p>When asked for a response to the ministry's allegation that the two patients had died due to the military siege, the Israeli army told AFP that its troops were "operating near the Indonesian Hospital".</p>

<p>"The troops operating in the area have been trained for the operational activity and briefed on the importance of mitigating harm to civilians and medical infrastructure," the military said in a statement.</p>

<p>"It is emphasised that the hospital continues to operate without disruption and in full capacity, and there was no intentional fire directed at it."</p>

<p>Israeli forces launched a new offensive in northern Gaza earlier this month, saying it was targeting Hamas fighters who were regrouping there.</p>

<p>Gaza's civil defence agency said an Israeli strike the night before killed 33 people in Jabalia, which is near the Indonesian Hospital.</p>

<p>The UN humanitarian affairs agency on Friday continued "to sound the alarm about the increasingly dire and dangerous situation that civilians in northern Gaza are facing. Families there are trying to survive in atrocious conditions, under heavy bombardment."</p>

<p>Indonesian Hospital was also damaged during Israeli shelling in October 2023, residents told AFP at the time.</p>

<p>Israel has come under strong international criticism for targeting hospitals in Gaza, which it has repeatedly accused of being used by Hamas militants for military purposes.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Hezbollah that its alleged attempt to assassinate him and his wife was a "grave mistake" and anybody who tries to harm Israel's citizens would pay a heavy price.</p>

<p>Mr Netanyahu's warning was seen as a response to a drone being launched towards his residence in the Israeli town of Caesarea.</p>

<p>In a post on X on Saturday, Mr Netanyahu referred to Hezbollah as "Iran's proxy" and said the assassination attempt would not deter him or Israel from continuing the war against the country's enemies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The attempt by Iran's proxy Hezbollah to assassinate me and my wife today was a grave mistake. This will not deter me or the State of Israel from continuing our just war against our enemies in order to secure our future," Mr Netanyahu wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>Issuing a warning to Iran and the 'Axis of Resistance', which includes Hezbollah, Hamas and Yemen's Houthis, the prime minister said Israel is determined to achieve its war objectives and "change the security reality in our region for generations".</p>

<p>"I say to Iran and its proxies in its axis of evil: Anyone who tries to harm Israel's citizens will pay a heavy price; We will continue to eliminate the terrorists and those who dispatch them; We will bring our hostages home from Gaza; And we will return our citizens who live on our Northern border safely to their homes. Israel is determined to achieve all our war objectives and change the security reality in our region for generations to come," he warned.</p>

<p>A drone was launched at Mr Netanyahu's residence on Saturday, a day after Hamas confirmed that its chief Yahya Sinwar was killed in an Israeli attack in Gaza.</p>

<p>"A UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) was launched toward the prime minister's residence in Caesarea. The prime minister and his wife were not at the location, and there were no injuries in the incident," Mr Netanyahu's office said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Israeli military said three drones had been fired from Lebanon on Saturday and two had been intercepted.</p>

<p>Neither Hezbollah nor any other militant group has claimed responsibility for the drone attack so far.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sinwar was allegedly the architect of the October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel in which over 1,200 Israelis were killed and over 250 taken hostage. Sinwar, who was killed on Wednesday, took over as the chief of Hamas after his predecessor Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Iran's capital, Tehran.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping called this week for troops to strengthen their preparedness for war, state media reported today, just days after Beijing staged large-scale military drills around Taiwan.</p>

<p>Xi made his comments while visiting a brigade of the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force on Thursday, according to state-run broadcaster CCTV.</p>

<p>Xi said the military should "comprehensively strengthen training and preparation for war, (and) ensure troops have solid combat capabilities", state media CCTV reported.</p>

<p>Soldiers must "enhance their strategic deterrent and combat capability," Xi said.</p>

<p>China, which claims Taiwan as part of its territory, has stepped up its shows of force around the self-ruled island in recent years.</p>

<p>On Monday, Beijing had deployed fighter jets, drones, warships and coast guard vessels to encircle Taiwan -- its fourth round of large-scale war games around the democratic island in just over two years.</p>

<p>China's communist leaders have insisted they will not rule out using force to bring Taiwan under Beijing's control.</p>

<p>Xi on Thursday said the Chinese military must "strongly safeguard the country's strategic security and core interests", according to the CCTV report.</p>

<p>The dispute between China and Taiwan dates back to a civil war in which the nationalist forces of Chiang Kai-shek were defeated by Mao Zedong's communist fighters and fled to the island in 1949.</p>

<p>China and Taiwan have been ruled separately since then.<br />

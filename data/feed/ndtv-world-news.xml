       <description><![CDATA[As of the last update, Joe Rogan had changed his X (formerly Twitter) bio to, "Dragon Believer".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Rogan has seemingly mocked popular ABC show, <em>The View's </em>co-host, Joy Behar, after she claimed that the popular podcast show host believed in 'dragons'. Ms Behar, featuring alongside Whoppie Goldberg, Sara Haines, Sunny Hostin and Alyssa Farah Griffin made the remark when the panel was discussing a poll, showing the number of young American voters who received their daily news from right-leaning political influencers and podcasters. Mr Rogan's endorsement of Donald Trump is believed to have inspired a swathe of young American voters to cast their ballot for the Republican leader in the just-concluded presidential election.</p>

<p>"I think that's why people like our show, because they know that we are checked by ABC News...We went from Walter Cronkite, basically, to this guy Joe Rogan, who believes in dragons. I checked it," said Ms Behar.</p>

<p>"And he also thinks that they, dragons-like, I guess, dinosaur-type of animals, roamed the Earth when people did. So this is a type of really, really bad information that's going out there. But it's possible Donald Trump did roam the Earth when dinosaurs were here," she added.</p>

<p>As the video of Ms Behar's monologue went viral, Mr Rogan quote posted it and said: "That's my new official X description."</p>

<p>At the time this article went live, Mr Rogan's bio/description on the X platform read: "Dragon Believer."</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<h3><strong>Rogan goes on a spree</strong></h3>

<p>Mr Rogan fired another shot at the hosts of the ABC show when he shared a clip of his podcast interview with Frrest Galante -- a well-known adventurer. Sharing a YouTube link, Mr Rogan captioned it as saying, "Were dragons real animals?"</p>

<p>"It's so possible that something that flew like a pterodactyl, like we think of pterodactyls as being like bat wings, maybe they had feathers, maybe that a gigantic predatory bird and maybe some of those things looked like dragons," Rogan said in the video.</p>

<p>Afterwards, Mr Rogan went on a spree on his X timeline, posting a number of messages and links, strengthening his argument about dragons being real.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Sunny Hostin was forced to read a legal disclaimer on air after alleging that former Attorney General nominee, Matt Gaetz had sex with a 17-year-old girl and was engaged in illegal sex trafficking.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Compare The Market recently shared data regarding the cost of obtaining a passport, which can vary anywhere between Rs 19,000 and Rs 1,500 in 2024.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A passport is one of the most important travel documents. Apart from verifying international travel, a passport also serves as proof of identification and nationality. Most governments issue their own passports which citizens can apply for - usually for a cost. This fee depends on the country and the validity period. Based on these fees, Compare The Market recently shared data regarding the cost of obtaining a passport, which can vary anywhere between Rs 19,000 and Rs 1,500 in 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Interestingly, Mexico has the most expensive passports in the world. The fee for a 10-year passport in Mexico costs around Rs 19,464, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/travel-insurance/features/cost-of-a-passport-2024/">report</a>. The country offers three kinds of passports, based on their validity, and they all appear on the top 10 most expensive passports list. Mexico's six-year passport is the fourth most expensive, while its three-year passport is the ninth most expensive.</p>

<p>Australia has the second-most expensive passport, costing around Rs 19,023 and valid for 10 years. It is followed by the United States, which costs Rs 13,899 and has the same validity period.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the other hand, the United Arab Emirates offers the cheapest passport worldwide, per the report. Getting a passport for UAE costs just Rs 1,492. The Indian passport, which costs Rs 1,523 for 10 years of validity, ranks as the second cheapest passport worldwide, as of April 2024.</p>

<p>Other countries with affordable passports include Hungary, Spain, Kenya and South Africa.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, according to the report, the Indian passport offers the best value in terms of 'cost per year'. This is mainly because of the validity period as well as the fact that Indian residents have visa-free access to 58 countries across the globe. The Indian passport has also been ranked 82nd in the Henley Powerful Passport Index 2024.</p>

<h3><strong>Here's the list of top 5 most expensive passports:</strong></h3>

       <description><![CDATA[The newly developed Steadfast helps differentiate between highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) strains.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid rising threats of bird flu killing hundreds of birds and also spilling over to some mammals and even humans, a global research team on Friday announced Steadfast -- an advanced diagnostic kit for detecting the highly pathogenic H5N1 Avian Influenza Virus (AIV).</p>

<p>This development marks a significant breakthrough in avian influenza monitoring, reinforcing global efforts in pandemic preparedness, said the team from Diagnostics Development Hub (DxD Hub) -- a national platform hosted by the Agency for Science, Technology, and Research (A-STAR), Singapore, in collaboration with researchers from Japan.</p>

<p>The newly developed Steadfast offers rapid detection of the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu virus. It also helps differentiate between highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) strains -- critical for effective control measures.</p>

<p>While conventional sequencing methods take two to three days for results, Steadfast can detect HPAI H5 strains (H5N1, H5N5, H5N6) in about three hours.</p>

<p>In the recent past, the highly pathogenic bird flu virus has caused mass mortality in chickens and wild birds worldwide. The infections also spread to seals, cats, cattle, and even from cattle to humans -- increasing the threat of a potential next pandemic virus.</p>

<p>Dr Onuma Manabu, Head of the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES), Biodiversity Resource Conservation Office in Japan said that these events show how rapidly the virus is mutating.</p>

<p>This stresses “the importance of establishing an effective surveillance system and developing faster detection methods that can promptly adapt to virus mutation to prevent the spread of infection,” Manabu said.</p>

<p>Manabu said the novel kit “meets this demand, and its widespread use” can help remove “public anxiety and allow for a more flexible response to the spread of infection”.</p>

<p>Detecting the virus and the strains early and rapidly is important as it can help monitor more migratory birds, provide timely warnings, and also reinforce biosecurity at poultry facilities, said the team. The timely responses can also significantly reduce transmission risks and help prevent potentially devastating epidemics.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump has nominated <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-picks-pam-bondi-as-us-attorney-general-after-matt-gaetzs-withdrawal-7076412 ">Pam Bondi as the country's next attorney general</a>. The Thursday announcement came after firebrand Rep. Matt Gaetz's withdrawal from consideration amid allegations of sexual misconduct.</p>

<p>Ms Bondi, a vocal supporter of Trump during his impeachment defence and a prominent surrogate during the 2024 campaign, is set to lead the Justice Department with a budget of $45 billion and over 115,000 employees.<br />
<br />
<strong>Who is Pam Bondi?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Pam Bondi practised law in Florida for over a decade, first as a prosecutor in Tampa and then as the state attorney general for eight years, earning a reputation as a media-savvy and effective litigator.</li>
	<li>She served as Florida's attorney general from 2011 to 2019, becoming the first woman to hold the position. She initiated litigation against opioid manufacturers.</li>
	<li>She has been involved in several high-profile cases. In 2012, Ms Bondi led an unsuccessful effort to overturn the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). In 2016, she faced criticism for defending Florida's ban on gay marriage, a stance that attracted significant attention, particularly after the Pulse nightclub shooting. She was also involved in a legal dispute over custody of a St Bernard dog, Master Tank, with a Louisiana family after Hurricane Katrina. Accused of stealing the dog, Ms Bondi countered with claims of neglect. The case was settled before trial, and Master Tank was returned to his original family.</li>
	<li>After leaving public office, Pam Bondi joined Ballard Partners, a lobbying firm with ties to Trump. Between 2019 and 2020, she represented Qatar, as disclosed in federal filings under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>A vocal Trump supporter, Ms Bondi played a significant role in defending him during his first impeachment as a senior adviser and lawyer. She has been heading the legal arm of the America First Policy Institute, a conservative think tank focused on advancing Trump's policies.&nbsp;</li>

       <description><![CDATA[Musk posted a conspiracy theory alleging that DeGeneres had left the country as she was involved with Sean 'Diddy' Combs.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX founder Elon Musk has taken a jibe at former talk show host, Ellen DeGeneres, after she alongside her wife, Portia de Rossi left the United States owing to Donald Trump's presidential election win. Mr Musk quote posted a conspiracy theory alleging that Ms DeGeneres had left the country as she was involved with Sean 'Diddy' Combs, who is currently in jail for his alleged 'freak-off' parties. The billionaire was referring to an original post made by Ms DeGeneres in 2016 when she wished happy birthday to P Diddy by calling him 'Cuddle McSnugglestuff'.</p>

<p>"Happy birthday, P Diddy, Puff Daddy, Sean Combs, or as I call him, Cuddle McSnugglestuff. You don't need to know why. @iamdiddy," read the post.</p>

<p>A user posted the screenshot of the said message and captioned it as saying, "That It makes sense why she fled the country after the election", which was amplified by Mr Musk who posted an 'eyebrow-raising' emoji without further elaboration.</p>

<p></p>

<p>One of the users under the Tesla CEO's post said: "If that is what she calls him - I wonder what he calls her. Actually - no no I don't - I really don't want to know," while another added: "Ellen literally fled the country before Donald Trump could release the Jeffrey Epstein client list."</p>

<p>A third commented: "Ellen DeGeneres is part of their club. Does she know that the UK has an extradition treaty with America? She can run but can't hide."</p>

<p>While Mr Musk mocked Ms&nbsp;DeGeneres, court documents have revealed that a fund linked to Diddy invested money to help the billionaire buy X (erstwhile Twitter) for $44 billion in 2022. However, he&nbsp;later expressed surprise at the extent of the allegations against him, stating on the platform, "I wonder how many people knew about this."</p>

<h3><strong>DeGeneres leaves US</strong></h3>

<p>DeGeneres and her actress wife have moved to the Cotswolds in southwest England, after putting up their Montecito Estate in California for sale, according to reports. She had endorsed Democrat nominee Kamala Harris for the presidential job.</p>

<p>DeGeneres had a successful talk show programme that officially ended in 2022 after 19 seasons when several of her staff members, and even some guests accused her of promoting a toxic work environment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Justin Trudeau-led Canadian government on Friday denied a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/smear-campaign-india-slams-canada-media-report-on-nijjar-murder-plot-7068353">report linking top Indian leaders</a> to criminal activities in Canada, saying it is "speculative and inaccurate".</p>

<p>In a statement days after a strong rebuttal from New Delhi, National security and intelligence advisor to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/india-canada-diplomatic-row-amid-india-canada-diplomatic-standoff-a-bombshell-from-justin-trudeau-6977740">Justin Trudeau</a>, Nathalie G Drouin, said the Canadian government is "not aware" of any evidence of the claims made by a Canadian media house citing unnamed officials.</p>

<p>"On October 14th, because of a significant and ongoing threat to public safety, the RCMP and officials took the extraordinary step of making public accusations of serious criminal activity in Canada perpetrated by agents of the Government of India. The Government of Canada has not stated, nor is it aware of the evidence, linking Prime Minister Modi, Minister Jaishankar, or NSA Doval to the serious criminal activity within Canada," the statement read.</p>

<p>The report by Canada's 'Globe and Mail' newspaper on Thursday quoted unnamed Canadian officials claiming that Indian leaders were "aware" of the plot to kill Sikh separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar - who was killed in Vancouver last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>India immediately responded sharply to what it called "ludicrous claims", with External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal calling the report a "smear campaign".</p>

<p>"Such ludicrous statements made to a newspaper purportedly by a Canadian government source should be dismissed with the contempt they deserve. Smear campaigns like this only further damage our already strained ties," Mr Jaiswal said.</p>

<h3><strong>India-Canada diplomatic crisis after Nijjar's killing</strong></h3>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/india-canada-ties-hit-record-low-all-you-need-to-know-about-justin-trudeau-6811687">India-Canada diplomatic relations</a> have nosedived after Justin Trudeau raised allegations that Indian agents were involved in the killing of Nijjar, a Sikh separatist and the mastermind behind the banned terror outfit 'Khalistan Tiger Force'. The Canadian Prime Minister claimed he had "credible allegations" of India's hand in the Nijjar killing.</p>

<p>India has repeatedly trashed the allegations, accusing Mr Trudeau of pandering to Khalistani sympathisers for domestic political gains at a time his popularity with Canadian voters is at an all-time low. India has also termed the allegations "absurd" and "politically motivated".</p>

<p>Last month, the Canadian government linked Indian High Commissioner Sanjay Verma and some other diplomats to the killing. The Centre rejected the claims and pointed out that despite repeated requests for evidence, Canada had failed to share any substantive proof to substantiate its allegations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[On WhatsApp, voice messages can now be transcribed into text "to help you keep up with conversations no matter what you're doing".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta-owned WhatsApp has introduced a new feature called voice message transcripts and voice messages can now be transcribed into text, “to help you keep up with conversations no matter what you're doing”.</p>

<p>Transcripts are rolling out globally over the coming weeks with a few select languages to start, and the company plans to add more languages over the coming months.</p>

<p>In a blog post, WhatsApp said that sending a voice message makes connecting with friends and family even more personal.</p>

<p>“There's something special about hearing your loved one's voice even when you're far away. Though sometimes, you're on the move, in a loud place, or you receive a long voice message that you just can't stop and listen,” the social media company added.</p>

<p>For those moments, “we're excited to introduce voice message transcripts”. Transcripts are generated on your device so that no one else, not even WhatsApp, can hear or read your personal messages.</p>

<p>To start using this feature, go to Settings, Chats and then Voice message transcripts to easily turn transcriptions on or off and select your transcript language.</p>

<p>“You can transcribe a voice message by long pressing on the message and tapping on ‘transcribe'. We're excited to build on this experience and make it even better and more seamless,” said WhatsApp.</p>

<p>The Meta-owned company recently introduced the Message Drafts feature which addresses a common issue — forgetting to send an unfinished message.</p>

<p>When you start typing but don't hit “send,” WhatsApp now marks the chat with a clear “Draft” label and moves it to the top of your chat list. This ensures you can quickly locate and complete your messages without scrolling through multiple conversations, said the company.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Denouncing the International Criminal Court (ICC), Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu likened the court's arrest warrant against him to the infamous Dreyfus trial of 1894.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Denouncing the International Criminal Court (ICC), Israeli Prime Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/benjamin-netanyahu" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> likened the court's <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/world-leaders-split-as-icc-issues-arrest-warrant-for-netanyahu-7075339" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">arrest warrant</a> against him to the infamous Dreyfus trial of 1894. &nbsp;The Dreyfus trial, which began in 1894, involved a Jewish French army officer falsely accused of treason based on fabricated evidence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ICC's move accuses Netanyahu and former Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant of war crimes in the ongoing Gaza conflict, a decision Netanyahu lambasted as "anti-Semitic" and reflective of a "modern-day Dreyfus trial."</p>

<p>"The anti-Semitic decision of the International Criminal Court is comparable to a modern-day Dreyfus trial - and it will end in the same way," Netanyahu declared, referring to the wrongful conviction of Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish French army officer, in a landmark case that exposed deep anti-Semitism in late 19th-century France.</p>

<p>The Dreyfus Affair was one of the most controversial legal scandals of 19th-century France, marked by anti-Semitism and judicial corruption. Alfred Dreyfus, a French Jewish army captain, was wrongfully convicted of treason in 1894 based on fabricated evidence. Stripped of his rank in a humiliating public ceremony and exiled to Devil's Island, a former penal colony in french Guayana, Dreyfus's plight became a symbol of systemic injustice and anti-Semitism.</p>

<p>French authorities accused Dreyfus of leaking military secrets based on a scrap of handwriting vaguely resembling his own. The trial, fueled by rampant anti-Semitism, resulted in a conviction despite evidence pointing to another officer, Ferdinand Esterhazy, as the true culprit. The case divided France, with prominent intellectuals like Émile Zola denouncing the injustice in his famous open letter, J'accuse...!</p>

<p>The ICC has issued warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant over alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza following Hamas's brutal October 7 attacks on Israel. These attacks, which left over 1,400 Israelis dead and led to the kidnapping of hundreds, triggered a massive Israeli military response, resulting in immense loss of life and devastation in Gaza. The warrants mark the first time an Israeli head of state has been targeted by the court.</p>

<p>Netanyahu rejected the ICC's actions as "absurd and false," accusing Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan of corruption and alleging the decision was an attempt to distract from accusations of sexual harassment against Khan - charges Khan has denied. Israeli President Isaac Herzog described the ICC's move as a "dark day for justice," while Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said the court had "lost all legitimacy."</p>

<p>Human rights group B'Tselem, however, welcomed the ICC's actions, urging international enforcement of the warrants. The group called the warrants "a critical step toward accountability for leaders responsible for crimes committed in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaking at an Indian community event in Georgetown, Guyana's President Mohamed Irfaan Ali praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his exemplary leadership and transformative impact on India's global stature.</p>

<p>Addressing the gathering, President Ali said, "...Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India is a shining light in your leadership. It is no secret that the strength of your leadership, the passion and compassion of your leadership and the deliberateness of your leadership have placed India in a different light and realm around the globe. You have brought incredible respect. But more importantly, you have brought a level of dignity and pride to India that is unmatched, and we congratulate you on that."</p>

<p>President Ali underscored India's growing influence in the world under PM Modi's leadership, noting, "Today, many developing countries and developed countries look to India for example, look to India for technology, look to India for research and development. That speaks volumes. It speaks about transformation. It speaks about a changed society and a society that is firmly rooted as a global leader, and we look forward to your continued leadership at a political level."</p>

<p>In a heartfelt acknowledgment of PM Modi's visit, President Ali expressed his gratitude for the time spent in Guyana, stating, "My dear friend and brother, PM Narendra Modi, we had you for more than two days, but still, people cannot have enough of you. It is all because of your hard work, humility, and the way you have led. This is not departure; this after today is saying, safe flight back home and we hope for your early return to our beautiful shores."</p>

<p>PM Modi's visit to Guyana, the first by an Indian Prime Minister in over five decades, marked the third and final leg of his three-nation tour.</p>

<p>During the historic visit, PM Modi co-chaired the 2nd India-CARICOM Summit alongside Caribbean leaders, further strengthening India's partnerships in the region.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler will step down as Wall Street's top regulator at the end of the Joe Biden administration, he said.</p>

<p>"Gensler has been coy about when he planned to leave the SEC but was expected to depart before President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office. He will serve through noon on January 20, when Trump is set to become President," reported The Wall Street Journal on Thursday about the move.</p>

<p>"Gensler's decision to remain until the very end of the Biden administration probably disappoints some Republicans who wanted to see him leave sooner. It means he could try to push through some additional measures since Democrats will retain a majority on the five-member SEC as long as he stays," it noted.</p>

<p>Gensler presided over a hyperactive period in SEC rulemaking, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Wall Street groups challenged many of the regulations he pushed through including a rule that would have imposed new transparency requirements on private equity managers.</p>

<p>A court also rejected a regulation that Gensler backed that tried to overhaul how companies do stock buybacks.</p>

<p>Gensler previously worked for Goldman Sachs and has led the Biden-Harris transition's Federal Reserve, Banking, and Securities Regulators agency review team.</p>

<p>Prior to his appointment, he was a professor of Practice of Global Economics and Management at the Sloan School of Management at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden called the International Criminal Court's arrest warrants for top Israeli leaders "outrageous" in a statement Thursday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Whatever the ICC might imply, there is no equivalence -- none -- between Israel and Hamas," Biden said after the international tribunal issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant on suspicion of war crimes and crimes against humanity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We will always stand with Israel against threats to its security," the president added.</p>

<p>In an earlier statement, the White House said it "fundamentally rejects" the calls for arrests.</p>

<p>"We remain deeply concerned by the prosecutor's rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling process errors that led to this decision. The United States has been clear that the ICC does not have jurisdiction over this matter," a National Security Council spokesperson said.</p>

<p>The statement made no mention of an ICC arrest warrant also issued for Mohammed Deif, the military chief of Hamas.</p>

<p>Mike Waltz, the incoming national security advisor under US president-elect Donald Trump's administration, defended Israel and promised a "strong response to the antisemitic bias of the ICC &amp; UN come January."</p>

<p>"The ICC has no credibility and these allegations have been refuted by the US government," Waltz said on social media platform X.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His comments reflected a wider outrage among Republicans, with some calling for the US Senate to sanction the ICC, which counts 124 national members who are in theory obliged to arrest individuals subject to warrants.</p>

<p>Neither the United States nor Israel is a member of the ICC and both have rejected its jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The Hague-based court said Thursday that the warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant were issued "for crimes against humanity and war crimes committed from at least 8 October 2023 until at least 20 May 2024."</p>

<p>A warrant was also issued for Deif, whom Israel claimed was killed in an air strike in Gaza in July. Hamas has not confirmed his death.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In the last 20 years, just a little more than 50 face transplants have been performed worldwide, which makes Mr Pfaff's operation a rare success.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man in the US state of Michigan has become one of just several dozen people in the world to successfully receive a face transplant. Derek Pfaff, 30, attempted to kill himself but miraculously survived and now has a second crack at life, following a life-changing surgery. Mr Pfaff underwent the complex procedure that lasted more than 50 hours and involved at least 80 healthcare professionals at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester earlier this year, according to an announcement published.</p>

<p>In the last 20 years, just a little more than 50 face transplants have been performed worldwide, which makes Mr Pfaff's operation a rare success. Prior to the operation at Mayo Clinic, Mr Pfaff had undergone 58 reconstructive facial surgeries in 10 years but remained unable to eat solid food or speak casually with friends and family. Since he had no nose, Mr Pfaff could not wear glasses either.</p>

<p>"After my last surgery, the doctor told my parents that there's nothing more he could do except refer us to a place to get a face transplant. This surgery has transformed my life. I feel so much more confident," Mr Pfaff said in a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/video-dereks-story-just-another-face-in-the-crowd/" rel="noindex, nofollow">video </a>shared by the clinic.</p>

<p>"I'm also going to keep sharing my story with others to help as many people as I can. I lived for a reason. I want to help others. I am so grateful to my donor, his family and my care team at Mayo Clinic for giving me this second chance."</p>

<p>As per the doctors, approximately 85 per cent of Mr Pfaff's face has been reconstructed and replaced with donor tissue. Upper and lower eyelids, upper and lower jaws, teeth, nose, cheek structure and neck skin are some of the parts that have been reconstructed.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/distressed-uk-vet-dies-by-suicide-after-rich-clients-euthanise-their-pets-to-save-money-7054349" rel="noindex, nofollow"><strong>Also read | Distressed UK Vet Dies By Suicide After Rich Clients Euthanise Their Pets To Save Money</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>Pfaff's suicide attempt</strong></h3>

<p>The son of Jerry and Lisa Pfaff, Mr Pfaff was a straight-A student and captain and star running back on the school's only state championship football team. However, on the fateful night of March 5, 2014, Mr Pfaff, then 19, decided to take his own life while at home during college spring break.</p>

<p>"I don't remember anything. I don't remember getting the gun, going outside, shooting myself or the weeks afterwards," said Mr Pfaff.</p>

<p>Shortly after 1:30 am, Mr Jerry found the family's gun cabinet open and soon found his son, lying on a snowbank, next to the garage. He was rushed to the hospital where he eventually regained consciousness.</p>

<p>"He does not remember getting the gun. He does not remember going outside. He does not remember shooting himself," said Ms Pfaff. "We met with the doctors, and they told us that there was no way Derek was going to make it."</p>

<p>But Derek did survive. "It's a miracle he lived," Ms Pfaff says.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump tapped Pam Bondi, a staunch ally who helped defend the ex-leader against impeachment, as US attorney general on Thursday following firebrand Matt Gaetz's withdrawal from the running.</p>

<p>Gaetz's retreat amid sexual misconduct allegations signaled limits to Trump's power, even as the president-elect prepares to retake the White House with his Republican Party also in control of both chambers of Congress.</p>

<p>The nomination of Bondi, a former Florida attorney general who served as a surrogate during the 2024 campaign and pushed to de-legitimize vote counting in swing state Pennsylvania in 2020, could be seen as a useful tool for Trump in his attempt to settle personal grievances.</p>

<p>"For too long, the partisan Department of Justice has been weaponized against me and other Republicans -- Not anymore," Trump wrote on his Truth Social network in announcing Bondi's nomination.</p>

<p>Bondi, 59, was a member of Trump's legal team during his first Senate impeachment trial, in which he was alleged to have pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, using aid as leverage, to hand over political dirt on Biden.</p>

<p>"Pam will refocus the DOJ to its intended purpose of fighting Crime, and Making America Safe Again," Trump wrote, adding that she is "smart and tough, and is an AMERICA FIRST Fighter."</p>

<p>Trump has made several eye-catching selections for top roles, including Fox News host Pete Hegseth as defense secretary, vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary and billionaire Elon Musk to head a government cost-cutting unit.</p>

<p>The exit of Gaetz, 42, was the first setback for Trump and Vice-president elect JD Vance in placing key allies in top positions, but his confirmation by the Senate was widely seen as doomed due to lack of support from fellow Republicans.</p>

<h3><strong>Ethics probe</strong></h3>

<p>A congressional panel has been investigating alleged illegal activity by Gaetz, including sexual contact with a 17-year-old girl -- which he denies -- as well as drug use and misappropriating campaign funds.</p>

<p>"I had excellent meetings with Senators yesterday," Gaetz said on X.</p>

<p>"While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition."</p>

<p>Gaetz was first elected to the House of Representatives in 2016 and won reelection recently, but he resigned as a congressman shortly after Trump picked him to be attorney general.</p>

<p>"Matt has a wonderful future, and I look forward to watching all of the great things he will do," Trump said in response to his withdrawal.</p>

<p>The ethics probe into Gaetz, a deeply polarizing Florida congressman, was effectively ended after he resigned from the House.</p>

<p>Gaetz is known as a political disruptor who earned the enmity of some House colleagues, including by engineering the ouster of fellow Republican Kevin McCarthy as speaker last year.</p>

<p>The latest transition upheaval ahead of Trump's inauguration on January 20 came as new lurid details emerged about defense secretary nominee Hegseth.</p>

<p>He was investigated for sexual assault after a complaint from an unnamed woman at a 2017 conference in California.</p>

<p>The New York Times reported details from the police investigation, which was closed without Hegseth being charged.</p>

<p>The married woman told officers that her memory of the episode was hazy and thought her drink might have been spiked, while Hegseth said the encounter was consensual.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

The post claims she was a successful businesswoman in Bangladesh, with Muslim tenants. The post further alleges that a group of 35 radicals forcibly took over her house and raped her. &nbsp;Let's verify the truth behind the video in this article.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: Video shows a Hindu woman who was allegedly raped by some Muslims in Bangladesh and took over her house.</p>

<p><strong>Fact</strong>: The woman in the video is 'Kohinoor Akhtar,' a member of the Bangladesh Krishak League affiliated with the Bangladesh Awami League led by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. She is a Muslim woman. On 10 November 2024, she attended a protest where she was attacked. The viral visuals are from that incident. There is no truth in the claim that she was raped. Hence, the claim made in the post is <strong>FALSE</strong>.</p>

<p>A reverse image search of the keyframes from the viral video led us to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkHUyq1_HvA" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">YouTube video</a> (<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://mvau.lt/media/4c1f01f5-cc31-4266-8959-df994c1ac920" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">archived link</a>) dated 11 November 2024, featuring a similar clip. The video's title identifies the woman in the footage as Kohinoor Begum, a member of the Bangladesh Krishak League.</p>

<p>Taking a clue from the description a Google keyword search led to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.facebook.com/krishakleague.diary/videos/440248262139840/" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">video</a> (<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://mvau.lt/media/dda482f8-d794-46af-b67d-b165da98b23e" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">archived link</a>) on the Krishak League's Facebook page. According to the post, the woman in the video is Kohinoor, a member of the Bangladesh Krishak League. The post claimed that she was attacked by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) during an event held on 10 November 2024 to commemorate Shaheed Noor Hussain Day. The Bangladesh Krishak League also claimed in the post that she was arrested.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump has unveiled his latest merchandising venture, a line of branded acoustic and electric guitars, some of which are autographed. According to the 'Trump Guitars' website, four different Trump-branded guitars are for sale - The "American Eagle Series," the "Presidential Series," the "Signature Edition" and "God Bless The USA". "Coming Soon! The Limited Edition '45' Guitar. Only 1,300 of each Acoustic and Electric Guitars MADE - Some personally signed!" Mr Trump announced on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday, accompanied by a photograph of himself brandishing one of the instruments.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="truthsocial-embed" src="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/113516618080692655/embed" style="max-width: 100%; border: 0" width="600"></iframe><script src="https://truthsocial.com/embed.js" async="async"></script></p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://gettrumpguitars.com/" rel="noindex,nofollow">site</a>, the "American Eagle Series" includes acoustic and electric guitars - with 1,000 of each available for purchase at $1,250 and $1,500, respectively. The guitars feature the image of the American flag, a bald eagle and writing along the guitar's neck that reads, "MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN". Some of the guitars are signed by Mr Trump, and they will cost buyers $10,000. Only 275 are available.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"These beautiful guitars feature the iconic phrase 'Make America Great Again' inlaid in authentic pearl up the neck of the guitar and the number 45 on the headstock signifying President Donald J Trump's historic term as president," the website states, promising that all orders will "arrive in time for Christmas".&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first 1,000 "Presidential Series" guitars will be numbered and sold for $2,000, while an unspecified number of "God Bless The USA" acoustic guitars are available for $1,000, per the website.</p>

<p>Notably, the President-elect has advertised several pieces of merch during his campaign. In September, he unveiled a series of watches valued at $100,000. He has also promoted $100 silver coins and 1,000 pairs of limited edition shoes, in addition to $60 Trump-branded Bibles, cologne, perfume and NFT cards. In 2023, he offered a "Mugshot Edition" of digital trading cards featuring a bonus offer for a piece of his suit from his Fulton County, Georgia Mug shot and a dinner with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In September, <em>CNN </em>reported that Mr Trump's foray into merchandising has seen financial success. His $60 Bible reportedly generated around $399,000 in sales. The limited edition sneakers sold out, yielding at least $399,000 in revenue. However, the most lucrative of his ventures has been the NFTs, which netted him approximately $7.2 million in licensing fees.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The star, identified as WOH G64, is located 160,000 light-years from us in the Large Magellanic Cloud and is on the verge of dying.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have successfully captured the first detailed image of a dying star outside our Milky Way galaxy, wrapped in a strange, egg-shaped cocoon. The star, identified as WOH G64, is located 160,000 light-years from us in the Large Magellanic Cloud and is surrounded by a plume of gas and dust -- suggesting it was in the final stage of its life. During a star's last phase, it transforms into a red supergiant before dying in a huge cosmic explosion, known as a supernova.</p>

<p>"For the first time, we have succeeded in taking a zoomed-in image of a dying star in a galaxy outside our own Milky Way," said Keiichi Ohnaka, an astrophysicist from Universidad Andr&amp;#233;s Bello in Chile and the lead author of the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2024/11/aa51820-24/aa51820-24.html#S2" rel="noindex, nofollow">study</a>.</p>

<p>WOH G64 was captured using the GRAVITY instrument at the European Southern Observatory's (ESO) Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). With a size roughly 2000 times that of our Sun, WOH G64 provides insights into the lifecycle of a star and how it goes out with a fascinating bang.</p>

<p>"We discovered an egg-shaped cocoon closely surrounding the star. We are excited because this may be related to the drastic ejection of material from the dying star before a supernova explosion," Mr Ohnaka added.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/science/milky-way-blasts-neighbouring-galaxys-mass-like-a-giant-hairdryer-nasas-hubble-reveals-7024371" rel="noindex, nofollow"><strong>Also Read | Milky Way Blasts Neighbouring Galaxy's Mass Like A 'Giant Hairdryer', Hubble Finds</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>Years of research</strong></h3>

<p>Scientists have been interested in the red supergiant for nearly two decades. In 2005 and 2007, Mr Ohnaka and his team used ESO's VLTI in Chile's Atacama Desert to learn more about the star's features and carried on studying it in the years since. However, an actual image of the star remained elusive. To click the first, detailed image, the team had to wait for the development of one of the VLTI's second-generation instruments.</p>

<p>"Massive stars explode with an energy equivalent to the Sun shining for all of its 10 billion years of life. People have seen these supernova explosions, and astronomers have found some of the stars that exploded in older images. But we have never seen a star change in a way that signals its imminent death."</p>

<p>The researchers believe that the gas and dust around the star, also known as shed material, might be responsible for the dimming and for the unexpected shape of the cocoon around the star. The new image shows that the cocoon is stretched out, which surprised scientists, who expected a different shape based on previous observations and computer models.</p>

<p>The team believes that the cocoon's egg-like shape could be explained by either the star's shedding or by the influence of a yet-undiscovered companion star.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US billionaire Elon Musk, owner of social media platform X, has criticised Australia's proposed law to ban social media for children under 16 and fine social media platforms of up to A$49.5 million ($32 million) for companies for systemic breaches.</p>

<p>Australia's centre-left government on Thursday introduced the bill in parliament. It plans to try an age-verification system to enforce a social media age cut-off, some of the toughest controls imposed by any country to date.</p>

<p>"Seems like a backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians," Musk, who views himself as a champion of free speech, said in a reply late on Thursday to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's post on X about the bill.</p>

<p>Several countries have already vowed to curb social media use by children through legislation, but Australia's policy could become one of the most stringent with no exemption for parental consent and pre-existing accounts.</p>

<p>France last year proposed a ban on social media for those under 15 but allowed parental consent, while the US has for decades required technology companies to seek parental consent to access the data of children under 13.</p>

<p>Musk has previously clashed with Australia's centre-left Labor government over its social media policies and had called it "fascists" over its misinformation law.</p>

<p>In April, X went to an Australian court to challenge a cyber regulator's order for the removal of some posts about the stabbing of a bishop in Sydney, prompting Albanese to call Musk an "arrogant billionaire".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has accused the United States of ramping up tension and provocations, saying the Korean peninsula has never faced such risks of nuclear war as now, state media KCNA said on Friday.</p>

<p>In a speech at a military exhibition on Thursday in Pyongyang, Kim said his previous experience of negotiations with Washington only highlighted its "aggressive and hostile" policy against Pyongyang, KCNA said.</p>

<p>"Never before have the warring parties on the Korean peninsula faced such a dangerous and acute confrontation that it could escalate into the most destructive thermonuclear war," Kim said, according to KCNA.</p>

<p>"We have already gone as far as we can on negotiating with the United States, but what we became certain of from the result is not the superpower's willingness to coexist, but its thorough stance of power and aggressive and hostile policy toward us that can never change."</p>

<p>During US President-elect Donald Trump's first term, he and Kim held three unprecedented meetings in Singapore, Hanoi, and at the Korean border in 2018 and 2019.</p>

<p>But their diplomacy failed to achieve any concrete outcome due to differences between US calls for North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons and Kim's demands for sanctions relief.</p>

<p>Trump has long touted his ties with Kim, saying last month that the two countries "would've had a nuclear war with millions of people killed" but he stopped it thanks to their relationship.</p>

<p>North Korean state media has not yet publicly mentioned Trump's reelection.</p>

<p>Kim, in the speech, called for developing and upgrading weaponry into "ultra-modern ones" and vowed to continue advancing defence capabilities to bolster the country's strategic position, KCNA said.</p>

<p>The event, called the Defence Development Exhibition, featured strategic and tactical weapons.</p>

<p>Kim's latest speech came amid international criticism over increasingly deepening military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow, with North Korea having sent more than 10,000 troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine.</p>

<p>Last week, Kim urged the country's military to improve capabilities for fighting a war, blaming the United States and its allies for stoking tension to "the worst phase in history" and calling the Korean peninsula "the world's biggest hotspot."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon said Israeli strikes Thursday on the country's east and south killed 52 people, as raids also hit south Beirut and Hezbollah claimed its deepest attack on Israel in over a year.</p>

<p>More than 11 months of cross-border fire between Israel and Hezbollah over the Gaza conflict escalated into all-out war in September, with Israel conducting an extensive bombing campaign, primarily targeting Hezbollah strongholds, and sending ground troops into southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>"Israeli enemy strikes that targeted the Baalbek district" in east Lebanon's Bekaa Valley left "40 dead and 52 wounded", a health ministry statement said, listing tolls for 10 different locations.</p>

<p>Lebanon's official National News Agency (NNA) said a couple and their four children were killed in a strike on a house in the village of Maqneh, while another couple and their young daughter were among 11 people killed in a raid on nearby Nabha.</p>

<p>The ministry also reported "seven dead and 24 wounded" in "Israeli enemy strikes" on south Lebanon's Nabatiyeh district, and "five dead and 26 wounded" in strikes elsewhere in south Lebanon.</p>

<p>In Israel, first responders said a man was killed after rocket fire from Lebanon hit the Galilee region in the country's north.</p>

<p>In Beirut's southern suburbs, the NNA reported at least 12 strikes throughout Thursday, after relative calm while US envoy Amos Hochstein visited earlier this week, seeking to broker an end to the Israel-Hezbollah war.</p>

<p>Israeli army spokesman Avichay Adraee on social media platform X issued several rounds of evacuation warnings for Beirut's southern suburbs, as well as areas in and around the southern coastal city of Tyre, but none for east Lebanon.</p>

<p>AFPTV footage showed columns of smoke rising from the southern suburbs, usually a densely populated residential district but now largely emptied.</p>

<p><strong>Khiam&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Adraee said on X that the Israeli military "targeted a weapons depot, a command headquarters and terrorist infrastructure" belonging to Hezbollah in south Beirut.</p>

<p>Amid a series of attack claims, Hezbollah said its fighters targeted "the Hatzor air base" near Israel's southern city of Ashdod, around 150 kilometres (90 miles) from Lebanon's southern border, "with a missile salvo" -- its deepest target in more than a year of hostilities.</p>

<p>In 10 separate statements, Iran-backed Hezbollah said its fighters also targeted Israeli troops in and near the south Lebanon town of Khiam, including with artillery, rockets and drones.</p>

<p>The NNA said "the enemy army" was "blowing up homes and residential buildings during its incursion into the town".</p>

<p>Lebanon's official news agency and Hezbollah have reported fighting and air strikes in the Khiam area ever since Israeli ground troops first entered Lebanon on September 30.</p>

<p>Earlier Thursday, United Nations special coordinator for Lebanon Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert visited Baalbek's UNESCO-listed archaeological area, after the UN's cultural body this week granted more than 30 heritage sites in Lebanon "provisional enhanced protection" amid the war.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry said Thursday that at least 3,583 people had been killed in the violence since October 2023. Most of the deaths have been since September this year.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said Wednesday that three soldiers were killed in south Lebanon, bringing to 52 the number killed in Lebanon since the start of ground operations.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

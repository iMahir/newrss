       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire Elon Musk has donated almost $75 million to the political action committee he created to support Donald Trump's US presidential campaign, according to filings made late Tuesday, illustrating the Tesla founder's growing commitment to the Republican's cause.</p>

<p>Musk, estimated to be the world's richest man, has taken an increasingly visible role in Trump's campaign, accompanying him on stage at a recent rally in Pennsylvania and frequently lambasting his opponent, Democrat Kamala Harris, on social media.</p>

<p>Trump frequently name-checks Musk at rallies and has promised to appoint him to a committee tasked with slashing government bureaucracy.</p>

<p>Harris and Trump are locked in a too-close-to-call race for the White House, according to polls.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-elections-2024-elon-musk-says-he-is-all-in-for-donald-trump-as-the-next-us-president-6740162">Musk</a>'s America PAC raised $74.95 million for Trump's cause between July 1 and September 30, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The PAC has focused on launching grassroots get-out-the-vote efforts, including in battleground states such as Pennsylvania that tip the overall national election result.</p>

<p>On its website, America PAC offers those who sign up to help with voter turnout "$30 per hour, with bonuses for performance."</p>

<p>Musk earlier said he would<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-secretly-funded-right-wing-group-long-before-donald-trump-endorsement-sources-6706711"> pay </a>$47 to anyone who gets a registered swing-state voter to sign a petition supporting free speech and the right to bear arms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The billionaire endorsed Trump after the Republican survived an assassination attempt in July.</p>

<p>In the same reporting period, Harris's primary Harris Victory Fund PAC hauled in $633 million, according to its FEC filing.</p>

<p>Harris dramatically entered the race for the presidency after the withdrawal of incumbent President Joe Biden, following a disastrous debate performance against Trump in July.</p>

<p>Since then, the current vice president has reinvigorated the party's base and carried out a barnstorming campaign across the country, with a particular focus on battleground states.</p>

<p>Her political action committee's year-to-date receipts were nearing a billion dollars, the filing said, standing at $931.2 million.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[China announced plans to launch a manned lunar mission, construct a lunar space station and explore habitable planets and extra-terrestrial life to expand its space programme in the next few decades.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China on Tuesday announced plans to launch a manned lunar mission, construct a lunar space station and explore habitable planets and extra-terrestrial life to expand its space programme in the next few decades.</p>

<p>China's top space bodies unveiled a national mid- and long-term development programme for space science, which will guide the country's planning of space science missions and space research from 2024 to 2050.</p>

<p>An established space power, China in recent years built its own space station which is currently in operation besides launching several space missions, including a lunar probe that collected samples for the first time from the far side of the Moon and brought them back to Earth for scientific studies.</p>

<p>The programme released by the China Academy of Sciences (CAS), China National Space Administration and the China Manned Space Agency to the media here outlined the goals of China's space science, including 17 priority areas under five key scientific themes, and a three-phase roadmap.</p>

<p>The international lunar research station initiated by China will be constructed during the second phase from 2028 to 2035, Ding Chibiao, vice president of the CAS, told the media here.</p>

<p>The programme also outlines a roadmap for the development of space science in China through 2050.</p>

<p>In the first phase, leading up to 2027, China will focus on the space station operation, implementing the manned lunar exploration project, the fourth phase of its lunar exploration programme and the planetary exploration project.</p>

<p>Under the new plan, scientists will also explore the habitability of celestial bodies in the solar system and exoplanets and search for extraterrestrial life, he said.</p>

<p>Key areas of space development in the coming years will be the origin and evolution of the solar system, characterisation of planetary atmospheres, the search for extraterrestrial life, and exoplanet detection, Ding said.</p>

<p>The theme of the extreme universe focuses on exploring the origin and evolution of the universe, revealing the physical laws under extreme cosmic conditions, dark matter and the universe's origin and evolution, as well as the detection of cosmic baryonic matter, according to the programme.</p>

<p>Studies will be conducted on detecting medium to low-frequency gravitational waves and primordial gravitational waves, with the goal of uncovering the nature of gravity and space-time, and the exploration of the Sun and the Earth.</p>

<p>Priority areas include Earth's cycle systems, comprehensive observations of the Earth-Moon, space weather observation, three-dimensional solar exploration, and heliosphere exploration, according to the programme.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Astronauts walking on the moon as part of NASA's first human mission to the lunar South Pole will be wearing Prada, as part of a new venture unveiled.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Astronauts walking on the moon as part of NASA's first human mission to the lunar South Pole will be wearing Prada, as part of a new venture unveiled on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Private space company Axiom Space teamed up with the Italian luxury brand to provide the surface suits and spacewalk systems for NASA's Artemis 3 mission, which is planned for September 2026.</p>

<p>The external layer of the space suit, designed to reflect heat, is largely white, as it was on the suits worn by the Apollo astronauts who last walked on the moon more than 50 years ago.But the update will have a few touches of grey and some red stripes similar to those seen on Italy's Luna Rossa America's Cup boat, which was also sponsored by Prada.</p>

<p>Matt Ondler, president of Axiom Space, told a press launch in Milan that making the suit had required "extreme engineering" and "fantastic manufacturing capability".</p>

<p>"They will go in places that are incredibly hazardous, extreme environments," he said.</p>

<p>"One of the missions that NASA wants to do is to try to find water craters at the South Pole. These are some of the coldest places in the universe. And so this suit has to be designed very cleverly."</p>

<p>At the lunar South Pole, a land of mountains and deep craters, the sun hovers below or just above the horizon.</p>

<p>As a result, temperatures vary from upwards of 54 degrees Celsius (130 degrees Fahrenheit) in sunlit periods to minus 203 degrees Celsius (minus 334 degrees Fahrenheit) in shadowed areas that have never see the sun, NASA says.</p>

<p>The suit aims to provide maximum comfort to the astronauts, the team said, while also protecting them against radiation, external pressure and provide the power and oxygen they need for up to eight hours of moonwalks.</p>

<p>With the mission set to see the first woman on the moon, the suits are also unisex and can be adapted to different sizes.</p>

<p>"We've blended engineering, science and art to produce the ultimate garments for future moonwalkers, ensuring that astronauts can perform their tasks and missions in safety and comfort," said Russell Ralston, Axiom spacesuit programme manager.</p>

<p>The design of the boots was a particular challenge, in terms of insulation and to make them robust enough for the terrain.</p>

<p>But the materials used are "confidential", said Lorenzo Bertelli, marketing manager for Prada and the son of the fashion house's founder, Miuccia Prada.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump, 79, is the oldest major-party presidential candidate ever in the US history.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrat's US presidential nominee Kamala Harris attacked her Republican rival Donald Trump on Thursday, calling him "unstable" and questioning the 78-year-old former president's fitness for office. In an interview with right-wing Fox News, Harris, 59, blasted Trump - the oldest major-party presidential candidate ever - for threatening to use the military against internal enemies.</p>

<p>"He has talked about turning the American military on the American people. He has talked about going after the people who are engaged in peaceful protest. He has talked about locking people up because they disagree with him," she said.</p>

<p>"He is unstable, and we should all be concerned," she told the interviewer Bret Baier.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://special.ndtv.com/ndtv-world-summit-2024-167/" target="_blank"><strong>WATCH NDTV World Summit on October 21-22. Get All The Details Here</strong></a></p>

<p>During the half-hour sit-down interview, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kamala-harris-says-her-presidency-would-not-be-a-continuation-of-joe-biden-6806793" target="_blank">Harris</a> clashed with Baier on several issues and repeatedly asked "may I finish" when he talked over her answers.</p>

<p>She was also pressed on comments she made last week when she said she could not think of anything she would have done differently from US President <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-elections-kamala-harris-will-cut-her-own-path-says-president-joe-biden-6799780" target="_blank">Joe Biden</a> during his four years in the White House.</p>

<p>"My presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden's presidency," Harris, who became her party's nominee after 81-year-old Biden dropped out in July.</p>

<p>She said she would bring "fresh and new ideas".</p>

<p>"I represent a new generation of leadership," she added.</p>

<p>Asked when she had first noticed that Biden's mental acuity had "diminished" before he quit the race following a disastrous debate with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hope-hes-okay-kamala-harris-as-trump-dances-during-town-hall-6799707" target="_blank">Trump</a>, the Democrat turned the subject back to the Republican.</p>

<p>"Bret, Joe Biden is not on the ballot. And Donald Trump is," she said.</p>

<p>After her interview, the Trump campaign released a statement calling it a "train wreck."</p>

<h3><strong>Harris Asks Trump To Release Medical Report</strong></h3>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kamala-harris-to-donald-trump-release-your-medical-records-6784346" target="_blank">Kamala Harris</a> this week challenged Donald Trump to release his medical records, days after she was found in "excellent health" and fit for the presidency.</p>

<p>According to a medical report published by the White House on Saturday, Harris "possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the presidency."</p>

<p>"Yesterday, I released my medical records. Donald Trump should do the same," she wrote on X on Monday.</p>

<p>"I invite the public to watch his rallies and be the decision maker on his acuity," she said in a video attached to the tweet.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Yesterday, I released my medical records. Donald Trump should do the same. <a href="https://t.co/GWXn7CPaTM">pic.twitter.com/GWXn7CPaTM</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>As Harris ramped up pressure for details on the physical health and mental acuity of Trump ahead of the US Presidential elections in November, Trump's campaign issued a statement saying he was also "in perfect and excellent health to be Commander in Chief".</p>

<p>A journalist had asked Trump in August whether he would release his medical records and he replied, "Oh sure, I would do that very gladly, sure."</p>

<p>He, however, has not released any detailed medical records since then.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An American man died last week following a five-year fight with a mosquito-borne virus that kills almost 30% of patients. The rare disease is also making a comeback in the tri-state area on the East Coast.</p>

<p>Richard Pawulski, 49, of Colchester, Connecticut, contracted Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) while performing garden work on his woods property in August 2019, according to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/16/us-news/conn-dad-dies-from-mosquito-borne-virus-eee-as-cases-rise/"><em>New York Post.</em></a> Even those who survive the virus's first outbreak, which attacks the brain, are often left with lasting impairments and neurologic issues. When Pawulski first developed the condition, he had severe migraines and was vomiting yellow bile, but doctors were confused.</p>

<p>"I'm not joking when I say your life can change in the blink of an eye, because that was what happened to us," his grieving daughter of Richard, Amellia Pawulski, 18, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/16/us-news/conn-dad-dies-from-mosquito-borne-virus-eee-as-cases-rise/"><em>The Post.</em></a></p>

<p>Richard died at 2:30 am Monday, one week after he was admitted into hospice when doctors determined that "there wasn't much else" that could be done for him, Amellia said.</p>

<p><strong>What is Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE)?</strong></p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cdc.gov/eastern-equine-encephalitis/about/index.html"><em>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), </em></a>Eastern equine encephalitis is caused by a virus spread to people through the bite of an infected mosquito. It is a rare but serious disease. Approximately 30% of people who develop severe eastern equine encephalitis die, and many survivors have ongoing neurologic problems. Symptoms of eastern equine encephalitis can include fever, headache, vomiting, diarrhoea, seizures, behavioural changes, and drowsiness.</p>

<p>There are no vaccines to prevent or medicines to treat eastern equine encephalitis. People living in areas where eastern equine encephalitis virus circulates should protect themselves by preventing mosquito bites.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>K-pop megastar J-hope from BTS ended eighteen months of South Korean military service Thursday, with his bandmate embracing him and dozens of fans turning up to celebrate his return to the industry.</p>

<p>The seven members of the world's most popular boy band have been on a self-described "hiatus" since 2022 due to their military service, which South Korea requires of all men under 30 due to tensions with the nuclear-armed North.</p>

<p>J-hope, the main dancer of the group, emerged from the gates of his army base in South Korea's central Wonju city, where he was met by fellow band member Jin, who<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bts-star-jin-finishes-south-korean-military-service-greeted-by-bandmates-5871639"> finished his service</a> in June.</p>

<p>Outside the base fans had hung up colourful banners to welcome the star back to civilian life saying: "The sun is finally shining upon ARMY" referring to the group's official fandom, and: "My bank account! It's ready to go straight to J-hope!"</p>

<p>Fans had put a life-size cut out of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/entertainment/bts-j-hope-purchased-2-luxury-apartments-for-rs-125-crore-in-seoul-report-6498346">J-hope</a> dancing outside the base, with a giant balloon congratulating him on his military discharge flying overhead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fans had been urged not to show up for safety reasons, but early Thursday there were around 50 admirers present -- including international fans from China and Brazil -- outside the base.</p>

<p>A group of Japanese fans rented a bus to get to the military unit, which is located about 100 km (62 miles) from Seoul.</p>

<p>The latest BTS military discharge is likely to be good for the K-pop industry as a whole, analysts said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"J-Hope's comeback is certainly like a refreshing downpour for HYBE during a long, dry spell," Yoo Sung-man, an analyst at Leading Investment and Securities, told AFP.</p>

<p>BTS' agency HBYE is struggling with a legal battle with K-pop girl group NewJeans' superproducer Min Hee-jin, which has been causing a headache for investors, he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, another BTS member, SUGA, was investigated over a drunk e-scooter incident in Seoul earlier this year, which led to HYBE's share price dropping to a record low.</p>

<p>"Even putting aside the 'Suga' issue, the 'Min Hee-jin and NewJeans' issue needs to be resolved first," said Yoo.</p>

<p>"Unless all BTS members complete their military service and make a full-group comeback, J-Hope's solo return might not be enough to overshadow the conflict completely," he added.</p>

<p>HYBE's share price was up 2.9 per cent in early trading Thursday.</p>

<p>The rest of the band will complete their service in June 2025.</p>

<p>Jin announced Monday that he will release his first solo album in November.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of lions mauled a zookeeper to death at one of Europe's largest big-cat parks on Wednesday after a door inside their enclosure was left unlocked, investigators said.</p>

<p>The mauling occurred at the Taigan safari park on the Russian-annexed Crimean peninsula, one of the largest breeding grounds for lions in Europe and home to around 60 of the predators.</p>

<p>"A criminal case has been opened over the death of an employee at the Taigan lion park as a result of a predator attack," the Moscow-installed Investigative Committee of Crimea and Sevastopol said in a statement.</p>

<p>The employee who had worked at the park for almost 17 years died after she "went to clean a cage with three lions, without shutting the bolt of a door between two rooms of the enclosure", investigators said.</p>

<p>The park's owner Oleg Zubkov identified the victim as chief zookeeper Leokadia Perevalova, calling the incident a "tragic" mistake.</p>

<p>"It is unclear how and why this happened, as the animals could not have done such a thing on their own, and apparently there were no people around," he said in a statement on his blog.</p>

<p>"The employees who discovered the body, unfortunately, could no longer provide any assistance, since she had simply been torn to pieces," he said.</p>

<p>On his Telegram channel, Zubkov praised Perevalova as a "valuable employee" who was the "soul of our park", adding that "the human factor of forgetfulness played a role".</p>

<p>"Unfortunately when I arrived there was nothing I could do to help. (They are) top predators and they do not forgive mistakes, he said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Wednesday stood by debunked claims that immigrants in Ohio were eating pets, telling Latino voters during a town hall he was "just saying what was reported."</p>

<p>Trump in recent weeks has amplified a false claim that has gone viral that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were stealing residents' pets or taking wildlife from parks for food.</p>

<p>There have been no credible reports of Haitians eating pets, and officials in Ohio - including Republicans - have repeatedly said the story is untrue.</p>

<p>At a town hall hosted by Univision, an undecided Latino Republican voter from Arizona, a battleground state, asked Trump whether he truly believed that immigrants were eating pets.</p>

<p>"I was just saying what was reported. All I do is report," Trump replied during the event held in Miami. "I was there, I'm going to be there and we're going to take a look."</p>

<p>Trump added that "newspapers" had also reported on the claim, without naming any or providing any details.</p>

<p>Trump, who has not yet traveled to Springfield, has previously said he would conduct mass deportations of Haitian immigrants from the Ohio city, even though the majority of them are in the U.S. legally.</p>

<p>The city has faced bomb threats since Trump began repeating the false accusations about Haitians.</p>

<p>In the final weeks before the Nov. 5 election, Trump is increasingly resorting to darker and more violent language about illegal immigration, an issue that opinion polls show resonates with many voters, especially Republicans.</p>

<p>He is competing against Democrat Kamala Harris for key votes from the growing Latino population. Latino voters have typically backed Democrats, but the Trump campaign is hoping to win over more Latino voters, especially men, on the back of economic discontent.</p>

<p>Harris led Trump by eight percentage points - 47% to 39% - among Hispanic voters in Reuters/Ipsos polling conducted between Sept. 11 and Oct. 7.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States has a broken immigration system that needs to be repaired, Vice President Kamala Harris said on Wednesday in a rare interview with the Republican-leaning news channel during which she sparred with its popular host.</p>

<p>“The point is that we have a broken immigration system that needs to be repaired,'” Ms Harris told Fox News anchor Bret Baier in a rare sit-down with the news channel.</p>

<p>“So, your Homeland Security Secretary said that 85 per cent of apprehensions,” Mr Baier interjected.</p>

<p>“I'm not finished. We have an immigration system,” Ms Harris tried to continue with her answer.</p>

<p>“It's a rough estimate that 6 million people have been released into the country,” the Fox News anchor interrupted again.</p>

<p>“And let me just finish. I'll get to the question. I promise you. I was beginning to answer,” the vice president pleaded.</p>

<p>“When you came into office, your administration immediately reversed a number of Trump border policies. Most significantly, the policy that required illegal immigrants to be detained through deportation, either in the U.S. or in Mexico. And you switched that policy. They were... released from custody awaiting trial. So instead, included in those were a large number of single men, adult men, who went on to commit heinous crimes. So looking back, do you regret the decision to terminate Remain in Mexico at the beginning of your administration?” Mr Baier asked again.</p>

<p>“At the beginning of our administration, within practically hours of taking the oath, the first bill, practically within hours of taking the oath, was a bill to fix our immigration system,” Ms Harris said as Mr Baier kept on interjecting in between.</p>

<p>“We recognized from day one that to the point of this being your first question, It is a priority for us as a nation and for the American people. Our focus has been on fixing a problem. From day one, then, we have done a number of things, including to address our asylum system and put more resources, getting more judges, what we needed to do to tighten up penalties and increase penalties for illegal crossings, what we needed to do to deal with points of entry between border, entry points,” she said.</p>

<p></p>

<p>“We worked on supporting what was a bipartisan effort, including some of the most conservative members of the United States Congress, to actually strengthen the border. That border bill would have put 1,500 more border agents at the border, which is why I believe the Border Patrol agents supported the bill. It would have allowed us to stem the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States, which is a scourge affecting people of every background, every geographic location in our country, killing people,” she said.</p>

<p>“Donald Trump learned about that bill and told them to kill it because he preferred to instead of fixing a problem,” Harris alleged.</p>

<p>“This election in 20 days will determine whether we have a president of the United States who actually cares more about fixing a problem, even if it is not to their political advantage in an election, because there was a solution,” she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After dodging the issue for weeks, Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance said unequivocally on Wednesday he believes false claims that Donald Trump did not lose the 2020 election.</p>

<p>Taking questions from reporters at a campaign event in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, Vance was again asked if Trump lost to President Joe Biden four years ago.</p>

<p>"On the election of 2020, I've answered this question directly a million times. No! I think there are serious problems in 2020," Vance said. "So, did Donald Trump lose the election in 2020? Not by the words that I would use."</p>

<p>Trump, the Republican candidate for president in 2024, continues to falsely claim that he lost the 2020 election due to extensive voter fraud, a view shared by millions of his supporters. Numerous inquiries, however, have found no evidence of fraud.</p>

<p>During his current run for president, Trump has suggested he will challenge the results if he does not prevail in the Nov. 5 contest against Democrat Kamala Harris, the US vice president.</p>

<p>His efforts to overturn the 2020 election led to his indictment by federal and state officials. He still awaits trial in those cases. His refusal to accept the outcome also sparked the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol by thousands of his supporters.</p>

<p>Vance, a first-term U.S. senator, made headlines when he sidestepped the question during his debate with Harris' running mate, Tim Walz, on Oct. 1, saying he was focused on "the future."</p>

<p>That led Walz to rebuke him. "That's a damning non-answer," he said.</p>

<p>In Williamsport, Vance said he was not espousing "some crazy conspiracy theory" in arguing Trump won. Instead, he blamed the election outcome on online censorship by large tech companies.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania is considered perhaps the most critical of the seven battleground states that will determine the election.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former One Direction singer Liam Payne was found dead outside a hotel in Buenos Aires after falling from his third-floor room balcony, Argentine police confirmed on Wednesday.</p>

<p>In a statement, the capital police said they were called to the hotel in the capital's leafy Palermo neighborhood where they were notified of an "aggressive man who could be under the effects of drugs and alcohol."</p>

<p>The hotel manager said he heard a loud noise at the back of the hotel, and when police arrived they found that a man had fallen over the balcony in his room, the statement said.</p>

<p>Emergency workers confirmed the death of the 31-year-old British singer, who was reportedly found in the hotel's interior patio.</p>

</div>

<p>"We're deeply saddened to learn of Liam Payne's tragic passing today. During this difficult time, our hearts remain with his family, loved ones, and fans," MTV said on X.</p>

<p>Neither Payne's record label Republic Records, nor its owner Universal Music Group, could immediately be reached for comment.</p>

<p>Payne rose to global fame as part of the since-disbanded pop band One Direction, alongside Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson.</p>

<p>The boy band got its start after finishing third on the British version of the X Factor music competition show in 2010, but the group broke up in 2016 as its members pursued different projects including solo careers.</p>

<p>One Direction was ranked the third greatest boy band of all time by Entertainment Weekly in 2024. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Payne's One Direction and solo career helped garner a net worth of some $70 million.</p>

</div>

<p>Reuters reporters at the scene saw crowds gathering outside the hotel, where dozens of police and emergency services teams had cordoned off an area as night fell on the city.</p>

<p>Local news outlet Todo Noticias TV interviewed Hernan Palazzo, who works near the hotel in the Palermo neighborhood, who said, "The neighborhood is very shaken up ... There's a lot of police, some fans arriving. It is very sad."</p>

<p>Payne had a son named Bear with British TV personality and Girls Aloud singer Cheryl in 2017.</p>

<p>Payne had earlier this month attended the concert of his former bandmate Niall Horan in Buenos Aires. The musician has been open in the media about struggling with addiction and spending time in a rehabilitation facility.</p>

<p>Earlier on Wednesday, Payne had appeared to post on Snapchat about his trip in Argentina, talking about riding horses, playing polo, and looking forward to returning home to see his dog.</p>

<p>"It's a lovely day here in Argentina," he said in the video.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A combative Kamala Harris pledged a clean break from Joe Biden's presidency Wednesday in a feisty interview with right-wing Fox News as she sought to reach Republican voters wary of Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Harris clashed with interviewer Bret Baier on hot-button issues including immigration, with the Democratic nominee repeatedly asking to be allowed to complete her answers.</p>

<p>"May I finish responding?" Vice President Harris at one point said to Baier, regarded as a tough but fair interviewer, in an encounter broadcast from the battleground state of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Pressed on previous comments when she said she could not think of anything she would have done differently from Biden, Harris replied: "My presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden's presidency."</p>

<p>"I will bring my life experiences, my professional experiences, and fresh and new ideas. I represent a new generation of leadership," added Harris, 59, who became her party's nominee after the aging Biden dropped out in July.</p>

<p>Biden had said on Tuesday that Harris would "cut her own path" as president.</p>

<p>Harris also launched into a blistering attack on Republican former president Trump, 78, for threatening to use the military against internal enemies.</p>

<p>"He's the one who tends to demean and belittle and diminish the American people. He's the one who talks about an enemy within."</p>

<p><strong>- Harris's gamble -</strong></p>

<p>The Democrat faced probing questioning during the interview, during which Fox News played an advert for Trump about operations for transgender prisoners, and a clip of Trump defending his military remarks.</p>

<p>Her first-ever sitdown with Fox was a gamble as she seeks to break the deadlock in a White House race that remains neck-and-neck with less than three weeks to go.</p>

<p>Fox News has played a key role in Trump's political rise, and he earlier blasted the network over the Harris interview, accusing Baier of being "very soft."</p>

<p>Trump's campaign later described it as a "train wreck."</p>

<p>"Kamala was angry, defensive, and once again abdicated any responsibility for the problems Americans are facing," Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.</p>

<p>Trump also sat down with Fox News ahead of Harris's appearance, in a pre-recorded town hall with an all-female audience, where the conversation turned to vitro fertilization (IVF), a fertility treatment that Democrats say is threatened by his policies.</p>

<p>Despite being on home turf, it was a challenging topic as women have been turned off by Trump's statements on reproductive rights, and by his campaign more broadly.</p>

<p>He was cheered as he told his audience in the swing state of Georgia that Republicans were the party championing the procedure.</p>

<p>"I want to talk about IVF. I'm the father of IVF, so I want to hear this question," he said.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Bizarre' -</strong></p>

<p>Harris, who has made the defense of reproductive rights a centerpiece of her election platform, called his comments "bizarre."</p>

<p>Reproductive rights have been a major vulnerability for Trump since the Supreme Court, featuring three Trump-picked justices, gutted federal protections for abortion access in 2022.</p>

<p>Many in the anti-abortion movement also want to see IVF curbed.</p>

<p>Trump's town hall in Georgia was filmed on Tuesday, the first day of early voting in the closely-watched state, with voters casting a record number of 328,000 ballots.</p>

<p>Trump has been charged with election tampering in the state, pushing for Georgia officials to "find" enough votes to overturn Biden's narrow win there in 2020.</p>

<p>Harris at least knows she has one vote in the bag for 2024. Former president Jimmy Carter cast his vote by mail on Wednesday, just days after turning 100.</p>

<p>The Democrat was fulfilling what his family said was a wish to live long enough to back Harris in the election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Inaction on the water crisis could put more than half of the world's food production at risk by 2050, experts warned in a major report published Thursday.</p>

<p>"Nearly 3 billion people and more than half of the world's food production are now in areas where total water storage is projected to decline," said the report by the Global Commission on the Economics of Water (GCEW).</p>

<p>The report also warned the water crisis could lead to an eight percent drop in GDP on average for high-income countries by 2050 and as much as 15 percent for lower-income countries.</p>

<p>Disruptions of the water cycle "have major global economic impacts," said the report.</p>

<p>The economic declines would be a consequence of "the combined effects of changing precipitation patterns and rising temperatures due to climate change, together with declining total water storage and lack of access to clean water and sanitation".</p>

<p>Facing this crisis, the report called for the water cycle to be viewed as a "global common good" and for a transformation of water governance at all levels.</p>

<p>"The costs entailed in these actions are very small in comparison to the harm that continued inaction will inflict on economies and humanity," it said.</p>

<p>While water is often perceived as "an abundant gift of nature", the report stressed it was scarce and costly to transport.</p>

<p>It called for the elimination of "harmful subsidies in water-intensive sectors or redirecting them towards water-saving solutions and providing targeted support for the poor and vulnerable".</p>

<p>"We have to couple the pricing of water with appropriate subsidies," said the World Trade Organization's Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, a co-chair of the GCEW, during an online briefing.</p>

<p>Another co-chair, Singaporean President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, insisted on the need to see water as a global problem, to "innovate and invest" to solve the crisis and "stabilise the global hydrological cycle".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a French newspaper that Israeli forces had found "state-of-the-art" Russian weapons in searches of Hezbollah bases in south Lebanon.</p>

<p>Netanyahu highlighted to Le Figaro newspaper, in an interview released Wednesday, that under a 2006 UN Security Council resolution only the Lebanese army was allowed to have weapons south of the country's key Litani river. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"However, in this area, Hezbollah has dug hundreds of tunnels and caches, where we have just found a quantity of state-of-the-art Russian weapons," the French article quoted Netanyahu as saying.</p>

<p>The Washington Post, quoting Israeli officials, has reported that Russian and Chinese anti-tank weapons had been found in Israel's raids inside Lebanon since it escalated its conflict with the Iran-backed Hezbollah last month.</p>

<p>The Israeli army did not immediately respond to an AFP question about the prime minister's comments.</p>

<p>Israel says the aim of its military campaign against Hezbollah is to make the region safe so that about 60,000 evacuated residents of northern Israel can return to their homes.</p>

<p>Many left their homes because of cross-border shelling between Israel and Hezbollah after the launch of the Gaza war on October 7 last year.</p>

<p>"A new civil war in Lebanon would be a tragedy. It is certainly not our aim to provoke one. Israel does not intend to interfere in Lebanon's internal affairs," Netanyahu told Le Figaro.</p>

<p>"Our only aim is to allow our citizens living along the Lebanon frontier to go home and feel safe," he added.</p>

<p>Hezbollah and Israel fought a gradually mounting artillery duel after the Hamas attacks on Israel set off the Gaza war.</p>

<p>Since Israel started raids on Hezbollah, at least 1,373 people have died in Lebanon, according to an AFP tally of Lebanese health ministry figures. The real toll is likely higher.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a late night post by the Ministry of External Affairs, India affirmed its stand on the massive diplomatic row with Canada. Putting the responsibility of the disastrous diplomatic fallout squarely on Justin Trudeau, the foreign ministry reiterated that "Canada has presented us with no evidence whatsoever".</p>

<p>In its terse-but-sharp response to Mr Trudeau's deposition at the Commission of Inquiry, the foreign ministry wrote in its post-midnight statement that "What we have heard today only confirms what we have been saying consistently all along - Canada has presented us (India) no evidence whatsoever in support of the serious allegations that it has chosen to level against India and Indian diplomats"</p>

<p>Putting the onus of the grave diplomatic situation entirely on the incumbent Prime Minister of Canada's conduct, the statement noted that "The responsibility for the damage that this cavalier behaviour has caused to India-Canada relations lies with Prime Minister Trudeau alone."</p>

<h2><strong>JUSTIN TRUDEAU'S LATEST REMARKS</strong></h2>

<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau testified before a Commission of Inquiry on Wednesday where he acknowledged and admitted that he only had intelligence-based speculation and no "hard evidentiary proof" when he alleged the involvement of Indian government agents in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar last year.</p>

<p>Stung by India's sharp rebuttal to his "absurd" allegations, and less than 48 hours after New Delhi kicked out six top Canadian diplomats over their Prime Minister's <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/india-canada-fallout-how-far-can-justin-trudeau-go-as-personal-electoral-gain-trumps-diplomatic-ties-6798226" target="_blank">"politically motivated" behaviour</a>, Mr Trudeau tried to hit back aggressively claiming that "The Indian government made a horrific mistake in thinking that they could interfere as aggressively as they did in the safety and sovereignty of Canada."</p>

<p>Testifying before the public inquiry into foreign interference in federal electoral processes and democratic institutions, Mr Trudeau went on to allege that Indian diplomats were "collecting information on Canadians who are in disagreement" with the Government of India and allegedly "passing it to the highest levels within the Indian government and criminal organisations like the Lawrence Bishnoi gang" - another claim that neither Mr Trudeau, nor the Canadian government or authorities have any proof of.</p>

<p>When the same claim was made by Mr Trudeau two days ago, New Delhi had said in its statement at the time that, "The Canadian government has not shared a shred of evidence with the Government of India, despite many requests from our side. This latest step follows interactions that have again witnessed assertions without any facts. This leaves little doubt that on the pretext of an investigation, there is a deliberate strategy of smearing India for political gains."</p>

<h3><strong>TRUDEAU'S SUPPORT TO 'KHALISTAN' EXTREMISTS</strong></h3>

<p>India has repeatedly said that the main issue between the two countries is that of Canada, especially Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, giving space and shelter to pro-Khalistan separatists and extremists operating from Canadian soil with impunity.</p>

<p>Mr Trudeau has also been seen openly supporting radicals by attending separatist rallies and even <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/glorification-of-violence-india-slams-canada-over-khalistani-floats-5611239" target="_blank">sharing space with declared terrorists</a>. Mr Trudeau has attempted to justify such actions by calling it "Canadian freedom of speech and expression".</p>

<p>India has stated that the reason behind Mr Trudeau's words and actions are <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/canada-showing-its-vote-bank-is-more-powerful-than-its-rule-of-law-s-jaishankar-5631952" target="_blank">"his vote bank"</a> - extremists and radicals who are <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bruised-by-fresh-election-loss-justin-trudeau-shows-no-sign-of-stepping-down-6592944" target="_blank">crucial for his electoral gains</a>.</p>

<p>"Prime Minister Trudeau's hostility to India has long been in evidence. In 2018, his visit to India, which was aimed at currying favour with a vote bank, rebounded to his discomfort. His Cabinet has included individuals who have openly associated with an extremist and separatist agenda regarding India. His naked interference in Indian internal politics in December 2020 showed how far he was willing to go in this regard. That his government was dependent on a political party, whose leader openly espouses a separatist ideology vis-a-vis India, only aggravated matters," the Government of India had said in a statement.</p>

<p>Justin Trudeau's latest remarks come two days after he called the Indian High Commissioner a "person of interest" in the "murder" investigation of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Nijjar. India trashed Mr Trudeau's allegations, describing them as "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/reject-preposterous-imputations-india-strongly-hits-back-at-canada-6785660" target="_blank">preposterous imputations</a>."</p>

<p>Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was declared a terrorist by India, was shot dead outside a gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia, on June 18 last year.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Donald Trump called himself the "father of IVF" at a town hall for women voters on Wednesday, as the Republican presidential candidate tries to convince the crucial voting bloc they can trust him on reproductive issues.</p>

<p>Trump, who is trailing Democrat Kamala Harris in popularity among women voters ahead of the Nov. 5 U.S. election, suggested he was eager to discuss the issue at an all-women event hosted by Fox News in Georgia. The state is among a handful likely to decide the election.</p>

<p>"I want to talk about IVF. I'm the father of IVF, so I want to hear this question," Trump said.</p>

<p>Hearing that some women were concerned about possible restrictions on fertility treatments, Trump touted his party's support for the procedure, even though some conservative Republicans do not support in vitro fertilization.</p>

<p>"We really are the party for IVF," Trump said, "We want fertilization that is all the way, and the Democrats tried to attack us on it, and we're out there on IVF, even more than them."</p>

<p>Senate Republicans blocked Democratic-led legislation designed to protect IVF access twice in recent months, with some Republicans arguing the legislation is unnecessary as IVF access is not in danger.</p>

<p>IVF emerged as a hot-button issue in the election after the conservative Alabama Supreme Court ruled in February that embryos are children. That ruling left it unclear how to legally store, transport and use embryos, prompting some IVF patients to consider moving their frozen embryos out of the state.</p>

<p>Republicans nationwide scrambled to contain the backlash from the decision, while Democrats warned more reproductive rights could be under threat.</p>

<p>Trump's campaign described his "father of IVF" comment as a joke.</p>

<p>"It was a joke President Trump made in jest when he was enthusiastically answering a question about IVF as he strongly supports widespread access to fertility treatments for women and families," spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said.</p>

<p>Harris, when asked about Trump's comments, warned against being "distracted by his choice of words."</p>

<p>"The reality is his actions have been very harmful to women and families in America on this issue," Harris told reporters.</p>

<p>According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released this week, 49% of women who are registered to vote support Harris, while 40% support Trump.</p>

<p>Polls also show Americans broadly trust Democrats more than Republicans on reproductive rights.</p>

<p>Trump, who as president appointed three of the justices who made up the majority that ended constitutional protection for abortion, has said the matter should now be decided by individual states.</p>

<p>He also has said he would support making IVF free of charge, though he has not detailed how he would do so.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden announced a $425 million arms package for Kyiv Wednesday in a call with President Volodymyr Zelensky, ahead of a farewell visit to Berlin to discuss Ukraine, the White House said.</p>

<p>The package includes air defense and armored vehicles, said a readout of the call, adding that President Biden had briefed Mr Zelensky "on his efforts to surge security assistance to Ukraine over the remainder of his term in office."</p>

<p>Mr Biden would also hold a virtual meeting of Ukraine's allies in November, it added, as he tries to shore up international support for Kyiv before a possible return of Donald Trump to the White House in January 2025.</p>

<p>There was no mention, however, of any decision on whether to allow Ukraine to fire Western-made long-range missiles deep into Russia, a move Biden has been reluctant to green-light so far.</p>

<p>The $425 million US package includes "additional air defense capability, air-to-ground munitions, armored vehicles, and critical munitions to meet Ukraine's urgent needs," the White House said.</p>

<p>The United States would in coming months provide hundreds of air defense missiles, artillery, hundreds of armored personnel carriers and thousands of additional armored vehicles, it added.</p>

<p>Mr Zelensky meanwhile "updated President Biden on his plan to achieve victory over Russia, and the two leaders tasked their teams to engage in further consultations on next steps."</p>

<p>Mr Zelensky said on X that he had spoken with Biden and thanked him for the package, which included "long range weapons."</p>

<p>"I am grateful to President Biden, both parties in Congress, and the American people for the $425 million defense package announced today," said Ukraine President, who is due to meet EU leaders on Thursday.</p>

<p>The United States has provided around $175 billion in both military and economic assistance to Ukraine during the war, despite frequent opposition from Republicans.</p>

<p>The call came on the eve of Mr Biden's whirlwind trip to Germany, where Ukraine will be high on the agenda.</p>

<p>Mr Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz could be joined for talks by French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, media reports said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

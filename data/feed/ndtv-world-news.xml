       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three years after the suicide bomber attack at Afghanistan's Abbey Gate that killed 13 US service personnel and about 170 Afghan civilians, the network behind the perpetrator is "pretty degraded" but not eliminated, the Pentagon's civilian commando chief said.</p>

<p>"A lot of allied and partner disruptions" of the ISIS-K network have reduced its "capability to conduct such an attack," Christopher Maier, assistant secretary for special operations and low-intensity conflict, said in a brief interview after a breakfast meeting with reporters Friday.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden promised on the day of the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/satellite-image-offers-rare-insight-into-kabul-airport-blast-targets-599477">attack outside Hamid Karzai International Airport</a> that "we will not forgive, we will not forget, we will hunt you down and make you pay." Maier said "we are in the process of doing that," and "we have made significant dents in this network that conducted the Abbey Gate attack."</p>

<p>The attack three years ago next Monday marked a devastating low point in an operation that critics have lambasted as chaotic even as 124,000 Afghans were evacuated amid the US exit from Afghanistan and the Taliban takeover of the country.</p>

<p>Republicans have seized on the attack to blast Biden's foreign policy. During his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in July, former President Donald Trump said US standing in the world "began to unravel with the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, the worst humiliation in the history of our country."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump forged a February 2020 deal with the Taliban, but not the Afghan government, that set an initial timetable for US troop withdrawals from Afghanistan, which Biden modified. Trump and the Republican Party blame Biden - and now Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee to succeed him - for how the withdrawal was carried out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the breakfast with reporters, Maier said "we continue to assess that Abbey Gate" was the work of "more than one individual" who benefited from the ISIS-K infrastructure. Since then, he said, the US and partners "have had clear cases where we've been able to disrupt the network that was associated with Abbey Gate."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"One of the things we have been able to benefit from is Central Asian countries more attuned from the threat from Afghanistan," he said. "Some of the recent plots that have been foiled point to direct support from some of these partners," he said, without naming the countries involved.</p>

<p>The House Foreign Affairs Committee plans to release its review of the withdrawal from Afghanistan early next month.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The new behind-the-scenes details from HR McMaster, Donald Trump's second national security adviser, come as Americans are set to decide whether the former president should return to the White House.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump was determined during his presidency to cozy up to Vladimir Putin despite Russia's interference in US democracy and objections by advisers, a former top aide claims in a new book, according to an excerpt published Saturday.</p>

<p>The new behind-the-scenes details from HR McMaster, Trump's second national security adviser, come as Americans are set to decide whether the former president should return to the White House and as US officials warn of fresh foreign election meddling.</p>

<p>"After over a year in this job, I cannot understand Putin's hold on Trump," McMaster, in an excerpt from his memoir published in the Wall Street Journal, says he told his wife in March 2018.</p>

<p>A former lieutenant-general, McMaster became Trump's national security adviser in February 2017, and says that from the beginning, discussions of Vladimir Putin and Russia "were difficult to have with the president."</p>

<p>He says Trump connected "all topics involving Russia" to the federal investigation into Moscow's interference in the 2016 election and possible ties with Trump's campaign, a probe which would dog his entire presidency.</p>

<p>US officials have warned this year of new efforts by foreign powers, including Russia and Iran, to meddle in the November election, in which Trump is facing Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>McMaster says an "overconfident" president Trump sought early in his administration to improve relations with Russia by building a personal rapport with Putin.</p>

<p>But the Russian president, "a ruthless former KGB operator, played to Trump's ego and insecurities with flattery," McMaster says.</p>

<p>"Trump had revealed his vulnerability to this approach, his affinity for strongmen and his belief that he alone could forge a good relationship with Putin," he added.</p>

<p>McMaster detailed several instances of friction with Trump over his approach toward Putin, with the disagreements ultimately leading to his dismissal.</p>

<p>Following Putin's election to a fourth term in March 2018, McMaster says Trump wanted to congratulate him by phone, but that he explained to the president that the vote had been rigged.</p>

<p>A call was scheduled nonetheless.</p>

<p>Before Trump called Putin, McMaster says he warned him about the conversation potentially being spun by the Kremlin as tacit support of the election process and to boost Russia's image, in tatters at the time over an assassination attempt on UK soil.</p>

<p>He said he asked Trump: "As Russia tries to delegitimize our legitimate elections, why would you help him legitimize his illegitimate election?"</p>

<p>Trump nonetheless called Putin and congratulated him, and then requested the Russian president be invited to the White House.</p>

<p>Trump's aversion to McMaster, he said, "was because I was the principal voice telling him that Putin was using him and other politicians in both parties in an effort to shake Americans' confidence in our democratic principles, institutions and processes."</p>

<p>McMaster was replaced just days later by John Bolton, who was also fired about a year-and-a-half later.</p>

<p>While Trump had four national security advisers during his term, President Joe Biden has had one since taking office in 2021.</p>

<p>"With Donald Trump, most everybody gets used up, and my time had come," McMaster wrote.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon- based militant group Hezbollah fired a large number of missiles at Israel on Sunday, retaliating for the assassination of their senior commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut last month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hezbollah and Israel have been exchanging fire since October 7, while avoiding a major escalation. While both sides had avoided a major escalation, tensions rose significantly after a missile strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights killed 12 people. While Hezbollah denied involvement in that attack, Israel responded with targeted airstrikes, assassinating Fuad Shukr and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Sunday, the Iranian-backed movement said the attack was a response to Israel's actions and announced that they had completed the "first phase" of its retaliation against the Jewish State, reported Reuters.</p>

<p><strong>Who was Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr?</strong></p>

<p>Fuad Shukr, also known by the alias "Al-Hajj Mohsin", was a senior commander in Hezbollah, a militant group based in Lebanon, widely regarded as a terrorist organisation by several countries, including the United States and Israel. Shukr was among the founding members of Hezbollah during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982. He was part of the generation of Lebanese Shi'ites who aligned with Iran's Revolutionary Guards to establish the group.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He was a close associate of Imad Mughniyeh, Hezbollah's former military commander who was assassinated in Damascus in 2008. Shukr's prominence in the group grew after Mughniyeh's death.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The US accused Shukr of playing a central role in the 1983 bombing of the US Marine barracks in Beirut, which killed 241 US military personnel. This attack is one of the deadliest against American forces in the Middle East. The US government had placed a bounty of up to $5 million on Shukr's head through its Rewards for Justice program.</p>

<p>Fuad Shukr served as a senior military commander in Hezbollah's forces in southern Lebanon and was a member of the group's highest military body, the Jihad Council. He played a key role in Hezbollah's military operations in Syria, particularly in supporting President Bashar al-Assad during the Syrian civil war. Hezbollah's involvement in Syria was crucial to Assad's survival during the conflict's early years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fuad Shukr was also a special adviser to Hezbollah's leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and was a member of the Shura Council, a key decision-making body within the organisation.</p>

<p>On July 30, <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-is-hezbollah-commander-fuad-shukr-targeted-by-israel-in-beirut-6226900">Fuad Shukr was targeted</a> by an Israeli airstrike in Beirut. Following the airstrike, Lebanese security sources reported that Shukr was critically injured. His death was later confirmed by Israeli broadcast reports.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title">The Great Barrier Reef will continue to deteriorate, largely to climate change, and the window to secure its future is rapidly closing. That is the sobering conclusion of a major new report into the state of the reef.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>The <a href="https://www2.gbrmpa.gov.au/our-work/outlook-report-2024">report was released</a> by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. It confirms what scientists have long known: humanity is killing the Great Barrier Reef, and other reefs around the world, by failing to curb the greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, I visited parts of the southern Great Barrier Reef where mass coral bleaching and death <a href="https://theconversation.com/new-drone-imagery-reveals-97-of-coral-dead-at-a-lizard-island-reef-after-last-summers-mass-bleaching-233325">had just occurred</a>. The picture was devastating. Vast swathes of coral were bleached a ghostly white. It was interspersed with bright flashes of pink and blue: a final, heartbreaking release of coral pigment as the organism makes a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/PL00006956">last-ditch effort to survive</a>. I've since learned much of that coral is now dead.</p>

<h3><strong>Climate change is not the only threat</strong></h3>

<p>The report said climate-driven disturbances are compounding the effects of other chronic damage to the reef from:</p>

<ul>
	<li>unsustainable fishing</li>
	<li>pollution</li>
	<li>sediment runoff</li>
	<li>outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish.</li>
</ul>

<p>Among other key findings of the report were that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>most populations of marine turtles have declined</li>
	<li>species such as seabirds, sharks, rays, dugongs and seagrasses have recovered in some areas and plateaued or declined in others</li>
	<li>populations of estuarine crocodiles are recovering</li>
	<li>many species in decline are listed as threatened or protected.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Strong leadership is needed</strong></h3>

<p>I first visited the Great Barrier Reef in 1980, as a university student. My interest in it has never waned. It's one of those incredible bits of nature that defies description.</p>

<p>The reef's World Heritage listing is proof of its outstanding global value. Australians love and feel pride in this vast and stunning place. The reef supports the livelihoods and wellbeing of many, including Traditional Owners who have cared for it over thousands of generations. It sustains all of us: economically, culturally and spiritually.</p>

<p>You might see a photo of healthy-looking coral and think the reef must be doing well. But I have seen the problem first-hand over many years. The reef is suffering badly – and every fraction of a degree of global warming compounds the harm.</p>

<p>Humanity must take urgent action to limit global temperature rise. But we are failing. We are failing the Great Barrier Reef and indeed, coral reefs across the planet.</p>

<p>There was a time when governments and reef managers were not willing to admit the extent of the problem. I don't think that's the case anymore. As the report states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2024 opens a new chapter for the reef. Future warming already locked into the climate system means that further degradation is inevitable. This is the sobering calculus of climate change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Climate change is a global problem, but Australia is undeniably part of it. This nation <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/aug/12/australian-fossil-fuel-exports-ranked-second-globally-for-climate-damage-with-no-plan-for-reduction#:%7E:text=Australian%20fossil%20fuel%20exports%20in,thermal%20coal%20exports%20in%202022.">cannot export fossil fuels</a> to be burnt overseas if we want to save the Great Barrier Reef. Dealing with this will take strong political leadership, from the prime minister down.</p>

<p>Humanity has all the facts in front of us. Earth is in an unchartered time of very rapid change. If we don't respond, we will lose the Great Barrier Reef.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel today said that is launched strikes inside Lebanon as a "self-defence act" to prevent a Hezbollah attack on civilians, Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Daniel Hagari said. The military also warned Israelis to expect incoming missiles and drones launched by Hezbollah, with air alert sirens sounding across the country's north.</p>

<p>The IDF claimed that they had information that Hezbollah was preparing to fire missiles and rockets toward Israeli territory.</p>

<p>"The IDF identified the Hezbollah terrorist organization preparing to fire missiles and rockets toward Israeli territory. In response to these threats, the IDF is striking terror targets in Lebanon. Israeli Air Force fighter jets are currently striking targets belonging to the Hezbollah terrorist organization that posed an imminent threat to the citizens of the State of Israel," IDF said in a statement.</p>

<p>Israel's international Ben Gurion airport has canceled all take-offs and landings for several hours, the country's airport authority said.</p>

<p>“Due to the security situation, the morning departures from Ben Gurion International Airport will be postponed, and will not take off in the next few hours,” the authority said. “Flights en route to Ben Gurion will be directed to land at alternative airports in the region.”</p>

<p>The Middle East has been on edge for weeks after Hezbollah and Iran vowed to respond to an Israeli strike in Beirut that killed a senior commander of the group as well as the assassination in Tehran of Hamas's political leader, also blamed on Israel.</p>

<p>The strikes came as negotiators were meeting in Cairo in a last-ditch effort to conclude a halt to fighting in Gaza and a return of Israeli and foreign hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.</p>

<p>Hezbollah fired missiles at Israel immediately after the October 7 attacks by Hamas gunmen on Israel. Hezbollah and Israel have been exchanging fire constantly ever since, while avoiding a major escalation as war rages in Gaza to the south.</p>

<p>That precarious balance appeared to shift after the strike in the Golan Heights, for which Hezbollah denied responsibility, and the subsequent assassination of Fuad Shukr, a senior military commander in Beirut.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Lebanon-based Hezbollah announced on Sunday large-scale rocket and drone launches towards Israel in an "initial response" to a top commander's killing.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Defence Minister Yoav Gallant announced a 48-hour nationwide state of emergency from 06:00 am (0300 GMT) Sunday after the Israeli military launched what it called pre-emptive strikes in Lebanon.</p>

<p>"The declaration on the state of emergency enables the IDF (Israeli military) to issue instructions to the citizens of Israel, including limiting gatherings and closing sites where it may be relevant," Gallant said, in a statement issued by his office.</p>

<p>Lebanon-based Hezbollah announced on Sunday large-scale rocket and drone launches towards Israel in an "initial response" to a top commander's killing, after Israel's military said it was carrying out a series of pre-emptive strikes against the group.</p>

<p>"In the context of the initial response" to the killing of its commander Fuad Shukr last month, Hezbollah said it "began an air attack with a large number of drones" targeting deep into Israel, a statement from the group said. Fighters also targeted "a number of enemy positions and barracks and Iron Dome platforms... with a large number of rockets", it said, adding that "military operations will take some time to complete".</p>

<p>The Middle East has been on edge for weeks after Hezbollah and Iran vowed to respond to an Israeli strike in Beirut that killed a senior commander of the group as well as the assassination in Tehran of Hamas's political leader, also blamed on Israel.</p>

<p>In a message addressed to the residents of southern Lebanon early Sunday morning, the Israeli military said: "We are monitoring Hezbollah's preparations to carry out large-scale attacks on Israeli territory near your homes. You are in danger. We are attacking and eliminating Hezbollah threats.</p>

<p>"Anyone who is near areas where Hezbollah operates should leave immediately to protect themselves and their families," the message posted on Telegram said.</p>

<p>In a separate statement released shortly before 5:00 am (0100 GMT), the military said its jets were striking targets in Lebanon "that posed an imminent threat" to Israelis.</p>

<p>Announcing the strikes in a video released at the same time, military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said that "Hezbollah will soon fire rockets, and possibly missiles and UAVs, towards Israeli territory".</p>

<p>"From right next to the homes of Lebanese civilians in the south of Lebanon, we can see that Hezbollah is preparing to launch an extensive attack on Israel, while endangering the Lebanese civilians" he added, urging civilians there "to move out of harm's way".</p>

<p>"Hezbollah's ongoing aggression risks dragging the people of Lebanon, the people of Israel, and the whole region into a wider escalation."</p>

<p>Prime Minister Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would hold a security cabinet meeting at 0400 GMT, his office said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In key US swing state Michigan, Democratic voters of Arab and Middle Eastern heritage say Kamala Harris is going to have to win them back after they were alienated by President Joe Biden's handling of Israel's military offensive in Gaza.</p>

<p>The town of Dearborn, home to 110,000 people and a cultural hub for Arab Americans, could play a decisive role in deciding the fate of the battleground state in November's presidential election.</p>

<p>Members of the community interviewed by AFP said they were willing to hear what the vice president had to say and weigh their options -- a marked change from the outright hostility towards Biden.</p>

<p>"We are in a listening mode right now," said Osama Siblani, publisher of The Arab American News.</p>

<p>Accepting the Democratic presidential nomination at the party's convention on Thursday, Harris pledged to get a Gaza ceasefire "done" and ensure Palestinians realize their right to "dignity, security, freedom and self-determination."</p>

<p>But there was outrage among pro-Palestinian delegates that their request for a speaker spot at the convention was rejected. The group Muslim Women for Harris-Walz said the decision sent a "terrible message" and announced it was disbanding and withdrawing its support from the campaign.</p>

<p>Harris, who has vowed "not to be silent" about the suffering of Palestinians, recently met with members of the national "Uncommitted" movement that led the charge against Biden during the Democratic primary process.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although she made no firm promises, leaders said she impressed them with a show of empathy.</p>

<p>At the forefront of concerns are Israel's 10 months of military operations in Gaza, which have devastated the Palestinian enclave since the war began in response to Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.</p>

<h3><strong>Growing influence&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Michigan, home to the "big three" automakers -- Ford, General Motors and Chrysler -- has long been an essential stop for White House aspirants.</p>

<p>Economic downturns in the 1970s led many to leave the so-called "Rust Belt" state, just as unrest in the Middle East brought new waves of Lebanese, Iraqi, Yemeni, and Palestinian immigrants.</p>

<p>"We're a global city, where nearly 55 per cent of our residents are of Arab background," said Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud in a recent interview. "For many of us, when you talk about what's happening in Gaza, these are our family and our friends."</p>

<p>Famous as the birthplace of Henry Ford, Dearborn appears at first glance just like any small US city, with its wide thoroughfares and strip malls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But it is also home to the Islamic Center of America -- the largest mosque in the country -- and countless Middle Eastern supermarkets, eateries, and coffee shops.</p>

<p>When Siblani first started his newspaper in the mid-1980s, he remembers the then-mayor campaigned on a platform to address the "Arab problem."&nbsp;</p>

<p>But as the community's numbers grew, and the children of blue-collar factory workers took up positions as lawyers, doctors, and businesspeople, so too did their political influence.</p>

<h3><strong>'Lesser of two evils'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Historically socially conservative, Arab and Muslim Americans heavily favoured George W. Bush in the 2000 election.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Years of the US "War on Terror" -- which saw wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan, and Muslim American communities put under stricter law enforcement scrutiny -- swung them firmly to the Democratic camp.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2018, southeast Michiganders elected Rashida Tlaib, the first Palestinian-American in Congress -- a milestone for the community.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Three Arab-American mayors have also recently been elected in suburbs known for historic racism towards non-whites.</p>

<p>Angered by former president Donald Trump's travel ban on Muslim countries, support for Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, and more, Dearborn voters overwhelmingly backed Biden in 2020, helping secure Michigan for the Democrats by a slim margin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Residents here are tired, however, of being asked to vote for the "lesser of two evils" and instead want candidates who will deliver on demands, such as a permanent ceasefire and an end to the supply of weapons to Israel.</p>

<p>"I think VP Harris has a window of opportunity," said Faye Nemer, a community activist and CEO of the MENA American Chamber of Commerce. "She can either continue President Biden's legacy or set her own agenda."</p>

<p>Arab Americans in Dearborn have been impressed by Harris's pick of Tim Walz as her running mate. Walz has taken a conciliatory approach to opponents of the war, unlike Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, who took a hard line against college protesters.</p>

<p>But demands are hardening.</p>

<p>"We don't want crumbs anymore," declared Soujoud Hamade, a business lawyer and long-time Democrat, who vowed to vote for Green Party candidate Jill Stein if Harris did not deliver on the campaign trail.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The West Nile virus is mainly transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dr Anthony Fauci, the former top U.S. infectious disease expert, was hospitalised for about a week after being infected with West Nile virus and is now recovering at home. Dr Fauci is expected to recover fully, according to his spokesperson.</p>

<p>''Tony Fauci has been hospitalised with a case of West Nile virus. He is now home and is recovering. A full recovery is expected,'' a spokesperson said in a statement Saturday.</p>

<p>According to the<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/08/24/fauci-west-nile-virus/"> Washington Post,</a></em> he likely contracted the disease from a mosquito bite in his backyard and spent a week in the hospital after developing fever, chills, and severe fatigue.</p>

<p>Dr Fauci, 83, was the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for nearly four decades before he retired in 2022. He emerged as the prominent public figure leading the US government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, providing guidance, expertise, and reassurance to the nation during a time of unprecedented crisis.</p>

<p>Following his departure from government service, Dr Fauci assumed a new role as a university professor at Georgetown University last summer.</p>

<p><strong>What is&nbsp;West Nile virus?</strong></p>

<p>The West Nile virus (WNV) is a viral infection that primarily affects birds but can also be transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes. It is named after the West Nile region of Uganda where it was first identified in 1937. While some might experience flu-like symptoms. In rare cases, it may be fatal and affect your brain or the spinal cord.</p>

<p>It is the most common mosquito-borne illness in the continental United States, typically spreading during the summer and fall months when mosquito activity is at its peak. About 216 cases of West Nile virus have been reported in 33 states this year,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/data-maps/current-year-data.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">according to the CDC</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most people who become infected with WNV do not develop any symptoms, but around 20% may experience flu-like symptoms such as fever, headache, body aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhoea, or rash.</p>

<p>In rare cases, the virus can cause severe illness including inflammation of the brain or spinal cord, leading to potentially fatal conditions such as encephalitis or meningitis.</p>

<p>There is no vaccine or specific treatment for West Nile.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian-origin astronaut Sunita Williams and her NASA colleague Butch Wilmore, who arrived at the International Space Station (ISS) aboard crisis-hit Boeing's Starliner in June, will return home with billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX next year. The two veteran astronauts were launched to the ISS on June 5 for what was expected to be an eight-day test mission. Their homecoming, however, was delayed for weeks by thruster malfunctions of the Boeing spacecraft, and NASA announced Saturday they will return to Earth in February next year. Starliner will return to Earth uncrewed.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/astronauts-sunita-williams-barry-butch-wilmore-in-space-for-80-days-will-return-february-next-year-says-nasa-6410618#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll" target="_blank">NASA</a> administrator Bill Nelson said the decision to keep the two astronauts on the space station and return the Starliner uncrewed "is the result of our commitment to safety," adding, "Our core value is safety."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Space flight is risky even at its safest and even at its most routine," he told reporters. "A test flight, by nature, is neither safe nor routine."&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Boeing's Starliner Setbacks</strong></h3>

But a day later, as Starliner was approaching the ISS, NASA and Boeing identified helium leaks and experienced issues with the spacecraft's reaction control thrusters.</p>

<p>Five of Starliner's 28 thrusters failed during flight and it sprang several leaks of helium, which is used to pressurize the thrusters. It was still able to dock with the space station, which has housed rotating crews of astronauts for over two decades.</p>

<p>NASA, however, feared the capsule would not be able to achieve the thrust necessary to return to Earth and decided to transfer the two astronauts to a SpaceX mission and return the Starliner empty.</p>

<p>"The uncrewed return allows NASA and Boeing to continue gathering testing data on Starliner during its upcoming flight home, while also not accepting more risk than necessary for its crew," the US space agency said.</p>

<h3><strong>How Elon Musk's SpaceX Will Help Sunita Williams, Butch Willmore</strong></h3>

<p>Under the new plan, the SpaceX Crew-9 mission will take off in late September after the Starliner has headed earthward, freeing a docking port on the ISS.</p>

<p>It, however, will carry only two passengers instead of the originally planned four to make room for Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore.</p>

<p>The SpaceX vehicle will then in February bring back the two stranded colleagues with its crew members.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pavel Durov, the billionaire founder and CEO of the Telegram messaging app, was arrested at the Bourget airport outside Paris on Saturday evening, French local media said, citing unnamed sources.<br />
They said the investigation was focused on a lack of moderators on Telegram, and that police considered that this situation allowed criminal activity to go on undeterred on the messaging app.</p>

<p>Telegram did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The French Interior Ministry and police had no comment. Russia's Foreign Ministry said it was taking steps to "clarify" the situation and questioned whether Western non-governmental organizations (NGOs) would seek his release..</p>

<h3><strong>What is known about Durov and Telegram:</strong></h3>

<p>* Russian-born Durov, 39, is the founder and owner of messaging app Telegram, a free-to-use platform that competes with other social media platforms such as Facebook's WhatsApp, Instagram, TikTok and WeChat. The platform aims to surpass one billion active monthly users within a year.</p>

<p>* Telegram is influential in Russia, Ukraine and the republics of the former Soviet Union. It has become a critical source of information on Russia's war in Ukraine, used heavily by both Moscow and Kyiv officials. Some analysts call the app "a virtual battlefield" for the war.</p>

<p>* Durov, whose fortune was estimated by Forbes at $15.5 billion, left Russia in 2014 after refusing to comply with government demands to shut down opposition communities on his VKontakte social media platform, which he sold.</p>

<p>* Russian and French media say Durov became a French citizen in 2021. He moved himself and Telegram to Dubai in 2017.</p>

<p>* "I would rather be free than to take orders from anyone," Durov told US journalist Tucker Carlson in April about his exit from Russia and search for a home for his company which included stints in Berlin, London, Singapore and San Francisco.</p>

<p>* In the same interview, Durov said that, beyond money or Bitcoin, he had no major property such as real estate, jets or yachts, as he wanted to be free.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The decision to transfer the crew of Boeing's Starliner to a SpaceX mission after the spacecraft malfunctioned is just the latest twist in a long saga that has undermined the credibility of the US aerospace giant.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here is a recap of the setbacks and delays on Starliner's journey to fly a crew to the International Space Station -- and how it was unable to bring them back again.</p>

<h3><strong>2014: Nasa awards contract</strong></h3>

<p>A decade ago NASA chose two companies, Boeing and SpaceX, to each develop a new spacecraft capable of transporting its astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The US space agency asked both to be ready for 2017, as it sought to end its dependence on the Russian spacecraft it had used to ferry astronauts to the ISS since the end of the space shuttle program in 2011.</p>

<p>Boeing was awarded a $4.2 billion contract, against SpaceX's $2.6 billion. At the time, billionaire Elon Musk's young company was widely seen as the underdog against Boeing's aerospace might.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>2019: Failed unmanned flight</strong></h3>

<p>During the first unmanned flight in December 2019, the capsule failed to set itself on the right trajectory and returned to Earth prematurely after two days, without reaching the ISS.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The problem was due to a clock that was eleven hours late, preventing the capsule from firing its thrusters at the scheduled time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>NASA then realized that another software problem could have led to a catastrophic collision.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The manufacturer was given a long list of recommendations and modifications to make.</p>

<h3><strong>2021: False hope</strong></h3>

<p>In August 2021, when the rocket was already on the launch pad for another attempt at flight, unexpected moisture caused a chemical reaction that blocked the opening of some of the capsule's valves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The capsule returned to the factory for inspection over a period of several months.</p>

<p>The delay was in stark contrast to the progress being made by SpaceX, which had been successfully transporting astronauts to the ISS since 2020.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>2022: First (unmanned) success</strong></h3>

<p>In May 2022, Starliner finally completed its first unmanned test flight.</p>

<p>Despite a few glitches -- including a propulsion system problem detected in flight, but with no adverse consequences -- the capsule lifted off, reached the ISS where it remained docked for several days, and returned safely to Earth.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>2023: New worries, new delays</strong></h3>

<p>Starliner's nascent momentum was arrested in 2023 when new problems emerged, delaying preparations for its first manned flight.</p>

<p>One concerned the design of the parachutes that would slow the capsule as it re-entered the atmosphere. It was modified and new tests carried out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The other was even more surprising: adhesive tape, used over several meters to wrap electrical cables inside the capsule, proved to be flammable and had to be removed.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>2024: First manned flight goes awry</strong></h3>

<p>The big day finally arrived on June 5, 2024: the capsule lifted off with two astronauts -- Barry "Butch" Wilmore and Sunita "Suni" Williams -- for the first time, a final test mission to prove it was safe before beginning regular operations to the ISS.</p>

<p>But leaks of helium, the gas used to create pressure in the propulsion system, were discovered in flight.</p>

<p>Several thrusters then failed before the capsule docked with the ISS, although all but one were eventually reignited.&nbsp;</p>

<p>NASA feared the capsule would not be able to achieve the thrust necessary to return to Earth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a result, the space agency took a radical decision: to transfer the two astronauts to a SpaceX mission and return Starliner empty.</p>

<p>Analysis of the flight will determine the path forward -- and how long any new delays will last.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Boeing has already gone $1.6 billion over budget on the program.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump, touting plans on taxes and health, tried on Friday to turn the page on a week in which he was overshadowed by Kamala Harris and struggled to focus on policy issues instead of personal attacks on his opponent in the US presidential race.</p>

<p>From a lectern at a Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas, the Republican candidate spoke about his plan to eliminate taxes on tips to waiters and other service employees. He discussed his campaign's efforts to court Hispanic voters in Nevada, a battleground state that could help determine the Nov. 5 election, and nationwide.</p>

<p>The tax proposal, a pillar of Trump's economic agenda, is the kind of issue his advisers have been pressing him to focus on, rather than his frequent personal attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris' looks, Black and Indian heritage and intelligence, warning they could turn off the moderate voters he needs to win.</p>

<p>At an event in Arizona later, the former president repeated his tax pledge, while promising to set up a commission to investigate presidential assassination attempts. He also said he would install a panel to investigate "an increase in chronic health problems and childhood diseases."</p>

<p>Both proposals are apparent concessions to independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who endorsed Trump at the event after dropping out of the race.</p>

<p>Trump's comments come one day after Kamala Harris accepted the Democratic Party's presidential nomination with a muscular speech that laid down broad foreign policy principles and sharp contrasts with Trump with 11 weeks left until Election Day.</p>

<p>Trump sought to counter-program the four-day convention with events of his own around the country, hoping to steal some media attention from Kamala Harris. However, his speeches on foreign policy, the economy and crime did little to dislodge the spotlight from Kamala Harris and received little attention - a stunning turnabout for a politician used to dominating headlines.</p>

<p>The Republican and his aides hope Thursday's boisterous convention finale marks the end of the honeymoon period for Kamala Harris, who emerged as the Democratic candidate little more than a month ago, after President Joe Biden exited the race and endorsed her.</p>

<p>During Kamala Harris' acceptance speech in Chicago, Trump attacked her with dozens of posts on his Truth Social platform, calling her a liar, a Marxist and "Comrade Kamala Harris." One post simply asked: "IS SHE TALKING ABOUT ME?"</p>

<p>William Rosenberg, a political science professor at Drexel University, said Trump's personal attacks on Kamala Harris underscored his frustration with having to face a biracial woman, a task complicated by his history of making racist remarks.</p>

<p>"His anger and his words speak volumes," Rosenberg said. "He's navigating a path which is full of problems for him."</p>

<p>Kamala Harris has surged in the polls since entering the race, with polling aggregator website FiveThirtyEight putting her ahead of Trump in six of seven battleground states.</p>

<p>She is also outraising her Republican counterpart. Her campaign told the Federal Election Commission this week that it raised $204 million last month, compared to $48 million reported to the body by Trump's main fundraising group.</p>

<p>One question still to be answered is whether Kamala Harris will also outpace Trump on the trail in the coming weeks. Biden, 81, made relatively few campaign stops, easing pressure on Trump to travel more around the country. That may now change with Harris, 59.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, will travel to Detroit on Monday to address a conference of the National Guard Association of the United States and is scheduled to give a speech at a conservative women's group's annual summit in Washington on Friday.</p>

<p>Campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Trump would hold at least one additional campaign stop between those two events, without providing details.</p>

<p>The Kamala Harris campaign has not yet released details of her movements for next week.</p>

<p>Leavitt blamed the media for focusing their stories on Trump's personal attacks, which she said made up a fraction of his otherwise policy-heavy rallies and speeches.</p>

<p>At a speech event on Wednesday in Asheboro, North Carolina, billed as one on national security, Trump said he had rejected the recommendations of his advisers to focus on policy, and he insulted Kamala Harris and other Democrats in personal terms.</p>

<p>He again recounted those conversations with advisers at the rally in Arizona on Friday.</p>

<p>"My geniuses, they get paid a fortune - actually not that much - but I call up my people, I say, 'They're knocking the hell out of me, and you say I shouldn't get personal. I have to get personal, don't I?'" Trump said to applause.</p>

<p>An outside adviser to Trump told Reuters on condition of anonymity that several advisers had told the former president that a continued focus on insults rather than policy could doom his chances in November.</p>

<p>Republican strategist Doug Heye said Trump could still win the race, which he predicted would be close, but to do that he should focus on inflation, illegal immigration and other issues that polling show many voters give him higher marks on.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>German police on Saturday arrested the suspected killer behind a knife rampage that left three people dead at a street festival, an attack claimed by the Islamic State group.</p>

<p>The unidentified assailant fled after striking in the western town of Solingen late on Friday, sparking a day-long manhunt.</p>

<p>"We have just arrested the true suspect," North Rhine-Westphalia region interior minister Herbert Reul said on public television late Saturday evening.</p>

<p>"The man we have been looking for all day has since a short time ago been in detention," he said, adding that police found evidence to convict him.</p>

<p>In a statement on Telegram, IS's Amaq propaganda arm said that "the perpetrator of the attack on a gathering of Christians in the city of Solingen in Germany yesterday was a soldier of the Islamic State".</p>

<p>IS said the attack was carried out as "revenge for Muslims in Palestine and everywhere", in an apparent reference to Israel's war with Palestinian group Hamas in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>The claim has yet to be verified. German officials had earlier said that "a terrorist motive cannot be excluded" for the act.</p>

<p>A police spokesman earlier told AFP that officers had arrested a man in a raid at a hostel for asylum seekers, not far from the scene of Friday's attack.</p>

<p>Earlier on Saturday, a prosecutor said a first person was arrested: a 15-year-old suspected of failing to report a criminal act.</p>

<p>Witnesses had allegedly seen the teen discussing the attack just before it happened with a man who could be the killer, said Markus Caspers, prosecutor of Duesseldorf, just west of Solingen.</p>

<p>The people killed were men of 56 and 67 years of age and a 56-year-old woman, officials said.</p>

<p>"The victims were completely unknown with no known ties between them," Caspers told a press conference.</p>

<p>Four of the wounded were in a "serious" condition, officials said, revising down an earlier estimate of five.</p>

<p>Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the perpetrator "must be caught quickly and punished".</p>

<p>The attacker struck as thousands of people gathered for the first night of a "Festival of Diversity", part of a series of events to mark Solingen's 650th anniversary.</p>

<p><strong>High terror alert</strong></p>

<p>Germany has been on high alert for possible Islamist attacks after a series of atrocities.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of the war in Gaza on October 7, the risk of Islamist plots has "worsened considerably", Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said, warning that "the threat posed by Islamist terrorism remains high".</p>

<p>Jihadists have carried out several attacks in Germany in recent years, the deadliest being a truck rampage at a Berlin Christmas market in 2016 that killed 12.</p>

<p>A police officer was killed and five people were wounded in a knife attack at a far-right rally in the city of Mannheim in May, with an Islamist motive suspected.</p>

<p>Friday's killing started as thousands of people had gathered in front of a stage for the first night of the three-day festival.</p>

<p>Witness Lars Breitzke told the Solinger Tageblatt newspaper he was a few metres away from the attack, not far from the stage, and "understood from the expression on the singer's face that something was wrong".</p>

<p>"And then, a metre away from me, a person fell," said Breitzke, who at first thought it was someone who had had too much to drink.</p>

<p>When he turned around, he saw other people lying on the ground amid pools of blood.</p>

<p>Solingen mayor Tim-Oliver Kurzbach said the whole city was in "shock, horror and great grief".</p>

<p>Faeser called for the country to "remain united" as she denounced "those who want to stir up hatred" during a visit to the site of the tragedy. "Let us not be divided", she said.</p>

<p><strong>Series of knifings</strong></p>

<p>Solingen is a city of some 150,000 people located between Duesseldorf and Cologne.</p>

<p>Up to 75,000 visitors had been expected to attend the "Festival of Diversity".</p>

<p>After the attack, "people left the scene in shock, but calmly," Philipp Mueller, one of the organisers, told the newspaper, adding that the rest of the festival was cancelled.</p>

<p>Scholz's centre-left coalition faces regional elections next week in the east of the country, where the far-right AfD is leading strongly in the polls.</p>

<p>Germany took in more than a million asylum seekers in 2015-2016 at the height of Europe's migrant crisis.</p>

<p>The influx was deeply divisive in Germany and fuelled the popularity of the AfD.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Telegram chief executive Pavel Durov is expected to appear in court Sunday after being arrested by French police at an airport near Paris for alleged offences related to his popular messaging app, sources told AFP.</p>

<p>The Franco-Russian billionaire, 39, was detained at Le Bourget airport north of the French capital on Saturday evening, one of the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>Durov had arrived from Baku, in Azerbaijan, another source close to the case said.</p>

<p>France's OFMIN, an office tasked with preventing violence against minors, had issued an arrest warrant for Durov in a preliminary investigation into alleged offences including fraud, drug trafficking, cyberbullying, organised crime and promotion of terrorism, one of the sources said.</p>

<p>Durov is accused of failing to take action to curb the criminal use of his platform.</p>

<p>"Enough of Telegram's impunity," said one of the investigators, adding they were surprised Durov came to Paris knowing he was a wanted man.</p>

<h3><strong>Platform of 'privacy'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The encrypted messaging app, based in Dubai, has positioned itself as an alternative to US-owned platforms, which have been criticised for their commercial exploitation of users' personal data.</p>

<p>Telegram has committed to never disclosing any information about its users.</p>

<p>In a rare interview given to right-wing talk show host Tucker Carlson in April, Durov said he got the idea to launch an encrypted messaging app after coming under pressure from the Russian government when working at VK, a social network he created before selling it and leaving Russia in 2014.</p>

<p>He said he then tried to settle in Berlin, London, Singapore and San Francisco before choosing Dubai, which he praised for its business environment and "neutrality".</p>

<p>People "love the independence. They also love the privacy, the freedom, (there are) a lot of reasons why somebody would switch to Telegram," Durov told Carlson.</p>

<p>He said at the time that the platform had more than 900 million active users.</p>

<p>By basing itself in the United Arab Emirates, Telegram has been able to shield itself from moderation laws at a time when Western countries are pressuring large platforms to remove illegal content.</p>

<p>Telegram allows groups of up to 200,000 members, which has led to accusations that it makes it easier for false information to spread virally, as well as for users to disseminate neo-Nazi, paedophilic, conspiratorial and terrorist content.</p>

<p>Competitor messaging service WhatsApp introduced worldwide limits on message forwarding in 2019 after it was accused of enabling the spread of false information in India that led to lynchings.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military announced on Saturday the deaths of three reserve soldiers killed in fighting in the Gaza Strip the previous day.</p>

<p>The soldiers, two sergeants first class and a sergeant major, were killed in central Gaza, the military said.</p>

<p>Two were killed in a bomb blast, while the third died in a gun battle when militants opened fire on a group of soldiers, military spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a televised briefing.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, Israeli forces have been engaged in fierce fighting with Palestinian operatives in central Gaza, particularly in the Deir el-Balah area.</p>

<p>The latest deaths bring the military's losses in the Gaza campaign to 338 since it launched a ground offensive in the Palestinian territory on October 27.</p>

<p>The war in Gaza erupted after Hamas-led operatives attacked Israel on October 7, which resulted in the deaths of 1,199 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Hamas operatives also seized 251 people, 105 of whom are still captive in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 40,334 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.</p>

<p>Most of the dead are women and children, according to the UN human rights office.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Negotiators geared up for a crucial weekend of Gaza ceasefire talks Saturday, as Hamas said it was sending delegates to Cairo but would not participate in the discussions, and fighting raged in the Palestinian territory.</p>

<p>The United States, Egypt and Qatar have spent months trying to broker an end to the war in Gaza between Hamas Palestinian militants and Israel.</p>

<p>The war, sparked by Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, has devastated Gaza, displaced nearly all of its population at least once and triggered a humanitarian crisis.</p>

<p>The White House said progress had been made at the latest round this week, although the possible permanent presence of Israeli troops along the Gaza-Egypt border has emerged as a major sticking point.</p>

<p>Previous bouts of optimism during months of on-off ceasefire and hostage release negotiations have always proven unfounded.</p>

<p>A senior Hamas official said a delegation from the Islamist group was heading to Cairo, but that they would not engage in the talks. Instead, they would meet with senior Egyptian officials for updates on the negotiations.</p>

<p>The delegation would "be briefed... but this does not mean it will take part in the negotiations", the official told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>The official said Hamas would insist Israel withdraw all its forces from all of Gaza, including "from the border area with Egypt", known as the Philadelphi Corridor.</p>

<p><strong>'Pivotal step'</strong></p>

<p>The basis of the talks is a framework which US President Joe Biden outlined on May 31, and which he described as an Israeli proposal.</p>

<p>A second Hamas official on Saturday reiterated that "the leadership of Hamas, including its leader Yahya Sinwar" had already agreed to the Biden plan and want it put into effect without "amendment of its wording."</p>

<p>The three-phase plan outlined by Biden and endorsed by the UN Security Council would initially see hostages exchanged for Palestinians in Israeli jails during what Biden called a "full and complete ceasefire" lasting six weeks.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has since insisted on keeping troops along the corridor, arguing Israel needs to prevent Hamas from rebuilding its strength by smuggling in arms from Egypt.</p>

<p>The White House said CIA chief William Burns was among US officials taking part in the Cairo talks, alongside the heads of Israel's spy agency and domestic security service.</p>

<p>An Egyptian source close to the talks said the United States was "discussing with mediators new proposals to bridge the gap between Israel and Hamas".</p>

<p>The source said Sunday's "enlarged round of negotiations" would be a "pivotal step in formulating an agreement that will be announced if Washington can pressure Netanyahu."</p>

<p>Fighting raged in Gaza on Saturday, with AFP correspondents and civil defence rescue sources reporting ongoing Israeli artillery fire and air strikes across the Hamas-run territory.</p>

<p>An overnight strike on a house west of Khan Yunis in southern Gaza killed 11 people, including a woman and four children, a doctor at Nasser Hospital said.</p>

<p>In Gaza City's Zeitun neighbourhood, gunfire and explosions echoed as Palestinian militants clashed with Israeli soldiers, an AFP correspondent reported.</p>

<p>The military announced the deaths of three soldiers in fighting in central Gaza on Friday, all of them non-commissioned officers.</p>

<p>The latest deaths bring the military's losses in the Gaza campaign to 338 since it launched a ground offensive in the Palestinian territory on October 27.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of civilians were on the move from Deir el-Balah and Khan Yunis after Israeli evacuation orders, which precede military operations, the United Nations said on Thursday.</p>

<p>"I have six children and every day I flee with them from one place to another," said Khan Yunis resident Raghda Sammour.</p>

<p><strong>Hostage protests</strong></p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,199 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed 40,334 Palestinians in Gaza, according to Gaza's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.</p>

<p>The UN rights office says most of the dead are women and children.</p>

<p>Palestinian militants also seized 251 hostages, of whom 105 remain in Gaza, including 34 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's military recovered the remains of six hostages from a tunnel in the Khan Yunis area this week, and said bullets were found in their bodies.</p>

<p>Thousands protested in Tel Aviv and other Israeli cities ahead of Sunday's talks, calling for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages.</p>

<p>Efforts to reach a Gaza truce and avert a wider war intensified after the killings of two senior Iran-backed militants last month sparked threats of reprisals from Tehran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Gazans said they were desperate for an end to the war.</p>

<p>"We are tired and hope that the negotiations persist, the siege is lifted, and the war stops," said Umm Muhammad Wadi, a displaced woman in Deir el-Balah.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Tuesday was poised to warn that life in Britain will "get worse" before it gets "better", in his first major speech since taking office.</p>

<p>Keir Starmer, whose Labour Party was elected by a landslide on July 4, is expected to use the speech to ramp up attacks on the legacy left by the ousted Conservatives.</p>

<p>His comments come after criticism that Labour is seeking a pretext to raise taxes, despite pre-election promises that certain taxes would not be hiked.</p>

<p>"We have inherited not just an economic black hole but a societal black hole. And that is why we have to take action and do things differently," Keir Starmer will say, according to excerpts of the speech released in advance.</p>

<p>"Part of that is being honest with people -- about the choices we face. And how tough this will be. Frankly -- things will get worse before we get better."</p>

<p>Finance minister Rachel Reeves in recent days warned of "difficult decisions" over whether to cut spending or increase taxes in her first budget on October 30.</p>

<p>Since Labour's election victory, Reeves has repeatedly accused the ex-prime minister Rishi Sunak's Tories of leaving a &amp;#163;22 billion ($29 billion) black hole in this year's budget.</p>

<p>But opponents say she would have been aware of the state of the country's finances months ago and is simply preparing the ground for unpopular announcements.</p>

<p>Keir Starmer is expected to tell the public that things are "worse than we ever imagined".</p>

<p>The same theme has been adopted by ministers across government since July 4.</p>

<p>Commentators, however, have warned that the electorate could quickly tire of Labour blaming the Tories if it does not make clear progress in fixing some challenges facing the nation.</p>

<p>Main election issues included long waiting times for treatment under the state-funded National Health Service (NHS), immigration and a cost-of-living crisis that has triggered widespread strikes even by emergency health care staff.</p>

<p>"In the first few weeks, we discovered a &amp;#163;22 billion black hole in the public finances. And don't let anyone say that this is performative, or playing politics," Keir Starmer will say.</p>

<p>"The OBR (Office for Budget Responsibility) did not know about this. They wrote a letter saying so. They didn't know -- because the last government hid it."</p>

<p>The prime minister will also address the recent riots sparked by a mass stabbing in which three young girls aged between six and nine-years-old attending a Taylor Swift themed dance class were killed.</p>

<p>He is expected to say that the rioters were able to exploit "the cracks in our society after 14 years of populism and failure", referring to the Conservatives' time in office.</p>

<p>Officials have blamed far-right elements for helping to stir up the disorder, which targeted mosques and hotels housing asylum-seekers as well as police officers and other properties.</p>

<p>The authorities have cited misinformation spread online that the suspect was a Muslim asylum-seeker for fuelling the violence.</p>

<p>Axel Rudakubana, who was aged 17 at the time, was actually born in Britain to parents who hail from Rwanda, an overwhelmingly Christian country.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's cases in connection with the May 9 riots might go to military courts, the Pakistan government's spokesperson for legal affairs, Barrister Aqeel Malik, said.</p>

<p>Notably, countrywide protests erupted on May 9 last year after the paramilitary Rangers whisked away Imran from the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in a corruption case.</p>

<p>When the protests took place, social media was flooded with footage of rioting and vandalism at various spots, including the Lahore Corps Commander's residence and General Headquarters, the army's head of office in Rawalpindi.</p>

<p>The already incarcerated former prime minister was "arrested" in these cases on July 15 -- just a day after he and his wife, Bushra Bibi, had been apprehended in a new Toshakhana case, following their acquittal in the Iddat case, as reported by Dawn.</p>

<p>In an interview with DawnNewsTV, Barrister Aqeel Malik was questioned whether he thought the trial of Imran could be in a military court following the arrest of former intelligence chief Lt-Gen (retired) Faiz Hameed, to which he said, "Yes absolutely."</p>

<p>He said the events and vandalism seen on May 9 invited the application of the Army Act since military installations were attacked and damaged. Aqeel Malik further alleged that the PTI founder "orchestrated" and "properly operated" the riots that took place last year.</p>

<p>"This was premeditated. This was pre-planned," Aqeel Malik said.</p>

<p>He further said regarding military courts that "it is entirely possible that Imran Khan's trial is held in a military court and the reason for that is because the Army Act will be applicable."</p>

<p>Aqeel Malik said that a lot of people were saying that any conviction by a military could be appealed at the high court, but he added neither the high court nor the Supreme Court could entertain it.</p>

<p>"According to the legal provisions, the appeal for the case would be taken by the military court of appeals," Aqeel Malik further stated.</p>

<p>He added that once the options of appeals were exhausted, then only the mercy appeal could be submitted to the army chief or the president as a last resort.</p>

<p>Notably, Imran Khan previously claimed that there is a plan to try him in the military court. He claimed that Hameed was being forced to turn approver against him to pave the way for his trial in a military court on May 9 cases, as reported by Dawn.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

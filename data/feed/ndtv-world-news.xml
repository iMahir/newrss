       <description><![CDATA[The Stegosaurus, nicknamed Apex, will be available for public viewing for the next four years at an NYC museum.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 150-million-year-old fossil of a Stegosaurus which became the most expensive dinosaur fossil ever sold earlier this year, has been put on display at the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan. The Stegosaurus, nicknamed Apex, will be available for public viewing for the next four years after billionaire Kenneth C. Griffin, who bought the fossil for $44.6 million, generously decided to offer it to the museum authorities. Afterwards, a cast of the specimen will take the fossil's place.</p>

<p>The impressive specimen was revealed to reporters, photographers and museum employees and is expected to be opened to the public on Sunday (Dec 8).</p>

<p>"It's one of the dinosaurs that every kid knows how to draw. This is a unique opportunity to have something that simultaneously, I think, really resonates in the public imagination about dinosaurs, but also from a research standpoint, is really a pretty special specimen to understand," Sean M. Decatur, the museum's president was quoted as saying by NYT.</p>

<p>"We hope our millions of visitors are as awe-struck as we are by Apex."</p>

<p>Commenting about lending the fossil, Mr Griffin said Apex "offers a unique window into our planet's distant past" and that he is grateful millions of visitors and researchers will be able to learn from the magnificent specimen at the museum.</p>

<p>"The joy and awe every child feels colouring a Stegosaurus with their crayons will now be brought to life for the millions of people who have the opportunity to see this epic dinosaur in person."</p>

<p>This is not the first instance when Mr Griffins, the founder and chief executive of the hedge fund Citadel, has shown interest in the massive reptiles.In 2017, he donated $16.5 to Chicago's Field Museum to fund an exhibit featuring the largest Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton ever discovered.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-billionaire-buys-largest-stegosaurus-skeleton-for-44-6-million-shatters-auction-records-6147977" rel="noindex, nofollow"><strong>Also Read | US Billionaire Buys Largest Stegosaurus Skeleton For $44.6 Million, Shatters Auction Records</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>When was Apex found?</strong></h3>

<p>Apex was discovered by palaeontologist Jason Cooper on his private land in Colorado in 2022. Measuring 11 feet tall and 27 feet long, scientists stated it was a nearly complete and remarkably preserved fossil, which eventually fetched the record-breaking sum from Mr Griffins.</p>

<p>The skeleton was initially anticipated to fetch somewhere around $6 million but interest from six other participants saw the value balloon to $44.6 million, which smashed the previous record set by a Tyrannosaurus rex fossil, which sold for $$31.8 million in 2020.</p>

<h3><strong>What are Stegosaurus?</strong></h3>

<p>The Stegosaurus is recognisable by its distinct double row of large, kite-shaped plates along its back plates and spiked tail. It roamed the Earth as a herbivorous dinosaur in the late Jurassic period, around 155-150 million years ago. Despite its impressive armour, Stegosaurus was a relatively small dinosaur, measuring about 30 feet in length and weighing around two to three metric tons.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In another setback to President Bashar al-Assad's hold on power, the Syrian government forces have lost control of Daraa city, widely regarded as the birthplace of Syria's 2011 civil uprising.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">In 2011, Daraa city, located roughly 100 km from capital Damascus, became the epicentre of nationwide protests after the Assad government detained and allegedly tortured a group of boys for scrawling anti-regime graffiti. What began as peaceful demonstrations soon spiralled into a violent conflict that has since seen over 500,000 dead and millions displaced.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">According to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, opposition forces now control over 90 per cent of Daraa province, with regime forces retreating in successive waves.&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Daraa's fall follows the swift loss of Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city, and Hama in the country's central region. These major victories have emboldened rebels to push south toward Homs, Syria's third-largest city, and even closer to Damascus, the seat of Assad's power.&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The rebel coalition spearheading this offensive is led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a group with origins in Al-Qaeda. Though designated a terrorist organisation by Western governments, HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani said in an interview that the group's primary goal remains the overthrow of Assad.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">In the country's east, government forces vacated Deir Ezzor, ceding territory to Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) backed by the United States. The withdrawal appears sudden, with troops reportedly regrouping in Palmyra, a key junction on the road to Homs.&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Airstrikes by Syrian and Russian aircraft have sought to slow the rebel advance, but observers note that these efforts have been relatively limited, likely reflecting Russia's stretched military commitments elsewhere, particularly in Ukraine.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Jordan has closed its border crossings with Syria, while Lebanon has imposed restrictions on land crossings. Israel, which occupies the Golan Heights, announced reinforcements to its aerial and ground forces. Turkey, which has supported elements of the Syrian opposition, expressed a mix of approval and caution over the rebel advance.&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/india-issues-midnight-advisory-over-grave-situation-in-syria-complete-details-here-7190703#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll_Imagetopscroll" target="_blank">Centre has issued an advisory</a> to completely "avoid all travel to Syria until further notice". Indians currently in Syria have been advised to "remain in touch with the Indian Embassy in Damascus".</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/world/middleeast/iran-syria-evacuation.html" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">New York Times</a>, Iran is evacuating its military personnel and military officials from Syria into Iraq and Lebanon. Iranian civilians in Syria are also reportedly evacuating thanks to heightened hostility towards the Iranian regime for its continued support of al-Assad.&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Over 280,000 people have been displaced since the offensive began, according to UN estimates. In Homs, which has endured some of the conflict's deadliest violence, tens of thousands of residents, particularly from Assad's Alawite minority, are fleeing in anticipation of the rebels' arrival.&nbsp;</li>

       <description><![CDATA[Bernie Littman and Marjorie Fiterman set a Guinness World Record as the oldest newlyweds with a combined age of 202 years.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A couple from Philadelphia has set a Guinness World Record by becoming the world's oldest newlyweds. Bernie Littman, aged 100, and Marjorie Fiterman, aged 102, got married earlier this year, with their combined ages totalling an extraordinary 202 years and 271 days, as confirmed on December 3 by the Guinness World Records.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The centenarian couple's love story began at a senior living facility in Philadelphia, where they both resided. They met nine years ago at a costume party held on their floor and quickly developed a romantic connection. Their journey together culminated in a wedding ceremony held on May 19, at the very same facility where their relationship began.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Both Bernie and Marjorie had lived rich and fulfilling lives, having been married to their respective spouses for more than six decades before becoming widowed. Despite attending the University of Pennsylvania simultaneously in their youth, they never crossed paths until fate brought them together in their later years. Bernie became an engineer, while Marjorie pursued a career as a teacher.</p>

<p dir="ltr">When announcing the centenarians' wedding, Littman's granddaughter, Sarah Sicherman, told the <a href="https://www.thejc.com/news/usa/jewish-couple-become-worlds-oldest-newlyweds-with-a-combined-age-of-202-sfvdo9cb#:~:text=A%20Jewish%2DAmerican%20couple%20with,Littman%27s%20great%2Dgranddaughters%20was%20born." rel="nofollow noindex">Jewish Chronicle</a>, “With so much sadness (and) fear in the world, it's nice to be able to share something that brings people joy.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">She shared in a post: "Today my 100-year-old grandfather married his 102-year-old girlfriend! Bernie Littman and Marjorie Fiterman live on the same floor of a senior living facility in Philadelphia. They both had 60-plus years of marriage to their first spouses and found love again at 100 years old!”</p>

<p dir="ltr">Rabbi Adam Wohlberg, who officiated the wedding, told <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/philadelphia-couple-ages-102-100-get-married-surprise-their-families.amp" rel="nofollow noindex">Fox News</a>, “Most of the couples I marry these days met on some kind of dating app. I much prefer the old ways. You live in the same building, you bump into each other, and you fall in love.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">The couple's bond deepened over shared meals and their active participation in the community's events, including theatrical productions. Bernie attributes his longevity and happiness to his love of reading and staying informed, while Marjorie credits buttermilk as her secret to a long life.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The wedding ceremony was a personal affair, attended by four generations of Bernie's family. Held under a traditional Jewish chuppah at their senior living facility, the couple exchanged vows in the presence of loved ones and well-wishers. Both Bernie and Marjorie were escorted to the ceremony in their wheelchairs, beaming with joy as they began this new chapter together.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The water on Earth has a unique molecular signature which has to do with specific rations of the hydrogen variant, or isotope, called deuterium.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Comets may have been responsible for the presence of water on Earth, scientists have claimed, according to a new research published this week in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adp2191" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>Science Advances</em></a>. The researchers focused on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and discovered that the molecular structure of water found on the celestial body closely resembled that of Earth's oceans. While water existed in the gas and dust form when Earth formed around 4.6 billion years ago, questions regarding how it ultimately became rich in liquid water have puzzled scientists.</p>

<p>Researchers are of the view that a substantial portion of our oceans came from the ice and minerals on asteroids and possibly comets that crashed into Earth. To further their theory, the researchers led by Kathleen Mandt, a planetary scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, decided to use an advanced statistical computation technique to find the molecular structure of water on 67P which belongs to the Jupiter family of comets, using data captured by European Space Agency's (ESA) Rosetta mission to the asteroid.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/science/dark-comets-mysterious-dark-comets-may-pose-bigger-threat-than-previously-thought-to-earth-6131464" rel="noindex, nofollow"><strong>Also Read | Mysterious 'Dark Comets' May Pose Bigger Threat Than Previously Thought To Earth</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>Earth's specific signature</strong></h3>

<p>The water on Earth has a unique molecular signature which has to do with specific rations of the hydrogen variant, or isotope, called deuterium. For the last few decades, deuterium levels in water found in the vapour trails of several Jupiter-family comets displayed similar levels to that of Earth's water.</p>

<p>"So I was just curious if we could find evidence for that happening at 67P. And this is just one of those very rare cases where you propose a hypothesis and actually find it happening," said Ms Mandt.</p>

<p>As it turned out, Ms Mandt's team found a clear connection between deuterium measurements in the comet and the amount of dust around the Rosetta spacecraft.</p>

<p>"As a comet moves in its orbit closer to the Sun, its surface warms up, causing gas to release from the surface, including dust with bits of water ice on it. Water with deuterium sticks to dust grains more readily than regular water does," the study highlighted.</p>

<p>"When the ice on these dust grains is released into the coma, this effect could make the comet appear to have more deuterium than it has," it added.</p>

<p>The research has big implications not only for understanding comets' role in delivering Earth's water but also for understanding comet observations that provide insight into the formation of the early solar system.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;A 22-year-old Indian student was stabbed to death in Canada's Ontario by his housemate, who has been charged with second-degree murder by the Sarnia Police.</p>

<p>Gurasis Singh, a first-year business management student at Lambton College, was stabbed by 36-year-old Crossley Hunter on Sunday. Early on December 1, the police received an emergency call reporting a stabbing at a rooming house on Queen Street in Sarnia. The incident occurred when the duo were engaged in a physical altercation while in the kitchen. The latter accessed a knife and stabbed Mr Singh multiple times, killing him.</p>

<p>On reaching the location, they retrieved the victim's body and took the accused into custody.</p>

<p>The accused will appear before a judicial officer on Saturday. "The Sarnia Police Criminal Investigations Division continues to gather all available evidence to determine the circumstances surrounding this criminal act and what, if any, motive may have existed that led to the murder of this young man. At this time, we do not believe this crime to be racially motivated," police chief Derek Davis said.</p>

<p>Davis added that the police, with Lambton College, "will continue our efforts to support Gurasis' family and friends as they seek to navigate these tragic circumstances."</p>

<p>The college issued a statement condoling Singh's death. "Students are at the heart of Lambton College, and the loss of a student is a tragedy of the highest magnitude. We extend our deepest condolences to Gurasis's family, loved ones, and friends. Many of our employees knew Gurasis from teaching him or providing student services. Even more have stepped in to provide support for his grieving friends and classmates," it added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Notre Dame cathedral prepares to reopen its doors for the first time since a devastating fire in 2019, a look back at five key dates in the Paris landmark's colourful history:</p>

<p><strong>1160: First Stones Laid</strong></p>

<p>Building the world-famous cathedral in the heart of the French capital began in 1160 and was not completed until almost a century later.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The project was spearheaded by the ambitious Bishop of Paris Maurice de Sully and had several striking features including vaults that reached up to 32 metres (105 feet), according to a study published in the journal PLOS ONE in 2023.</p>

<p>But some elements of the gothic building's construction remain unknown. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It is not clear, for example, how the builders "dared -- and succeeded -- in putting up such thin walls to such a height," Maxime L'Heritier, an archaeologist at University Paris 8, told AFP in an interview in 2023.</p>

<p><strong>1455: Joan Of Arc</strong></p>

<p>Burnt on a stake in a public square after being accused of heresy, the case of Joan of Arc has become legend in France.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 1455, 24 years after her dramatic death at the age of around 19, a fresh trial opened to reconsider her case, taking place at Notre Dame.</p>

<p>It concluded the verdict of Joan as a heretic had been arbitrary, paving the way for a second trial in Rouen, the original site of her public execution.</p>

<p>In 1456 her sentence was ruled null and void, elevating her to the status of French heroine -- and centuries later, a saint.</p>

<p><strong>1790s: One-Time Wine Cellar</strong></p>

<p>During the French Revolution, the cathedral was plundered and seized as public property.</p>

<p>Anti-clerical radicals attacked the facade, removing biblical statues and decapitating them in the cathedral's square, in acts reminiscent of the guillotining of King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette.</p>

<p>Over a few years in the 1790s, Notre Dame was used for a variety of purposes, including storing barrels of wine for the Revolutionary Army.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>1831: Victor Hugo Novel</strong></p>

<p>Published in 1831, Victor Hugo's novel "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" featured a host of colourful characters from the gypsy Esmeralda to Quasimodo, but at the centre was the cathedral.</p>

<p>The book was a huge hit and triggered an outpouring of emotion among Parisians over the state of disrepair into which the cathedral had fallen.</p>

<p>This popular enthusiasm contributed to an ambitious restoration project launched in 1844 and led by the architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lasting till 1865, it included the construction of a new spire, which had been dismantled during the Revolution.</p>

<p><strong>2019: Inferno On The Seine</strong></p>

<p>The spire was among the features of the cathedral that collapsed in the blaze that shocked the world on April 15, 2019.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Onlookers on the banks of the Seine watched in horror as the fire ravaged not only the spire, which crashed down, but also caused the central frame to collapse, engulfed the clock and part of the vault.</p>

<p>The cause of the blaze is not known, with an electrical fault or a cigarette among the theories.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It took 400 firefighters several hours to control the flames; stained glass windows, towers, bells and most artworks and relics survived.</p>

<p>The renovated Notre-Dame is set to reopen to the public on December 8, 2024.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Notre Dame will formally reopen Saturday five years after the Paris cathedral was devastated by fire, with US president-elect Donald Trump among world leaders there to celebrate its remarkably rapid restoration.</p>

<p>Held up as an example of French creativity and resilience by President Emmanuel Macron, Notre Dame's renaissance so soon after a 2019 blaze that destroyed its roof and spire comes at a difficult time for the country.</p>

<p>The sense of national accomplishment in restoring a beloved symbol of Paris has been undercut by political turmoil that has left France without a proper government and in a budget crisis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Macron is hoping that the first full service inside Notre Dame and the sight of around 40 world leaders in Paris might provide a fleeting sense of pride and unity -- as the Paris Olympics did in July and August.</p>

<p>The re-opening "is the proof that we know how to do grand things, we know how to do the impossible and the whole world has admired us for it on two occasions this year," Macron said during a televised address on Thursday, referring to the widely praised Olympics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During a visit with TV cameras last week however, he somewhat undermined the suspense behind the reopening, revealing the cathedral's freshly scrubbed limestone walls, new furniture and vaulted wooden roof cut from ancient oak trees selected from the finest forests of France.</p>

<p>The reconstruction effort has cost around 700 million euros ($750 million), financed from donations, with the re-opening achieved within five years despite predictions it could take decades.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Workers had to overcome problems with lead pollution, the Covid-19 epidemic, and the general overseeing the project falling to his death while hiking in the Pyrenees last year.</p>

<p><strong>Trump Show?</strong></p>

<p>While the reborn 12th-century architectural masterpiece will be the main focus of public attention on Saturday, TV cameras are also likely to linger on Trump who will be making his first overseas trip since winning re-election to the White House last month.</p>

<p>He accepted an invitation from Macron to attend earlier this week, saying the French leader had done "a wonderful job ensuring that Notre Dame has been restored to its full level of glory, and even more so."</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden will be represented by his wife Jill, while Britain's Prince William and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will also be present.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zelensky is expected to seek his first face-to-face meeting with Trump who has vowed to force a peace agreement to end the war in Ukraine, possibly by withholding US weapon supplies.</p>

<p>One surprising absentee will be Pope Francis, the head of the Catholic Church, who has decided against breaking off from a weekend trip to the French island of Corsica.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A message from Francis addressed to the French people will be read out to the congregation of VIPs, church figures and selected members of the public when the service begins on Saturday evening.</p>

<p><strong>'Universal Sadness'</strong></p>

<p>Parisians watched in horror in 2019 as flames ravaged Notre Dame, a landmark famed as the setting for Victor Hugo's novel "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" and one of the world's most visited monuments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The apocalyptic images were even seen by some as a sign of the demise of Western civilisation, with the 850-year-old wonder saved from complete collapse only by the heroic intervention of firefighters.</p>

<p>The exact cause of the blaze has never been identified despite a forensic investigation by prosecutors, who believe an accident such as an electrical fault was the most likely reason.</p>

<p>"We felt a sense of universal sadness when Notre Dame burned," said fashion designer Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, who has dreamed up colourful new priestly vestments that will be worn by senior clergy on Saturday.</p>

<p>"It was a moment of terrible emotions, like a premonition of our world in difficulty," he told AFP recently.</p>

<p>The service will feature prayer, organ music and hymns from the cathedral's choir, followed by a televised concert with performances by Chinese piano virtuoso Lang Lang, South African opera singer Pretty Yende and possibly US singer and fashion designer Pharrell Williams.</p>

<p>Harsh weather forced officials to move Macron's planned speech indoors and pre-record the concert Friday night, with forecasts for winds of up to 80 kilometres (50 miles) per hour as Storm Darragh put parts of France on red alert.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the first mass with 170 bishops and more than 100 Paris priests will take place at 10:30am (0930 GMT) followed by a second service in the evening at 6:30pm which will be open to the public.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Insurance exec killer may have fled New York, police say<br />
New York, United States | AFP | Friday 12/7/2024 - 03:51 UTC+5 | 612 words</p>

<p>New York police said Friday they believe the man suspected of gunning down a top health insurance executive may have fled the city on a bus following the brazen daylight murder.</p>

<p>The development deepens the mystery surrounding the fresh-faced suspect, an image of whom was released by investigators Thursday and who has now been on the run for almost three days.</p>

<p>The masked assailant was caught on camera entering a bus station in a northern neighborhood of Manhattan in the wake of Wednesday's slaying, but he could not be identified exiting the facility on foot, a police spokesman confirmed to AFP.</p>

<p>"They believe he's not in New York City," the spokesman added.</p>

<p>Dozens of bus and coach routes run to other US states from the George Washington Bridge Bus Station, according to the operator's website.</p>

<p>The image of the smiling suspect was obtained from a youth hostel where the gunman apparently stayed before the hit, detectives said, with media reporting he lowered his mask to flirt with a receptionist.</p>

<p>Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said Friday that detectives had access to tens of thousands of cameras around the city, allowing them to secure the "money shot" image, a significant breakthrough in the case.</p>

<p>"We had to go through lots of video evidence to get that one money shot with the mask down," she told CNN.</p>

<p>The gunman sprayed Brian Thompson, CEO of UnitedHealthcare -- one of the country's largest medical insurers -- with bullets in front of bystanders, in an audacious attack captured by a surveillance camera and now seen by millions.</p>

<p>Thompson was attending an investor conference in the Midtown business district.</p>

<p>Police have yet to suggest a motive and would not confirm a New York Times report that the words "delay" and "deny" -- often used by insurance companies to reject claims -- were written on shell casings found at the scene.</p>

<p>Video footage shows Thompson on the sidewalk outside the New York Hilton Midtown when a man in a hooded top, and with his lower face covered, approaches from behind, then fires several shots at his 50-year-old victim, who crumples to the ground.</p>

<p><strong>Sprawling Investigation</strong></p>

<p>Camera footage showed the suspect fleeing on foot, before getting on a bicycle -- which police initially said may have been a rented e-bike. Police said he went in the direction of Central Park.</p>

<p>Law enforcement sources said the suspected shooter traveled to New York via bus last month from Atlanta, Georgia -- a distance of 870 miles (1,400 kilometers), according to US media Thursday. An NYPD spokesman declined to comment on the claims.</p>

<p>NYPD chief of detectives Joseph Kenny would not confirm reports that a silencer was used on the murder weapon, saying that the question would be part of the investigation.</p>

<p>Officers have confirmed that a cell phone as well as DNA from a coffee cup had been recovered from the scene.</p>

<p>In the absence of an arrest, speculation has been rife that the gunman may have sought to take revenge for adverse medical coverage decisions made by the insurer.</p>

<p>Thompson's wife Paulette Thompson, who is based in Minnesota, told NBC News that he had received unspecified threats.</p>

<p>"There had been some threats basically I don't know -- (over) a lack of coverage? I don't know details," said Thompson, who had two children with her late husband.</p>

<p>In a statement, UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of UHC, said it was "deeply saddened and shocked."</p>

<p>UnitedHealthcare is a major player in the lucrative American health care market, and the parent group had revenues of $100.8 billion in the third quarter of the year.</p>

<p>Thompson's own compensation package in 2023 was $10.2 million according to a regulatory filing.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Melania Trump credited her 18-year-old son Barron with playing a major role in her husband Donald Trump's successful bid for a second term as President of the United States. During an interview on the morning show Fox &amp; Friends, she said that Barron had been instrumental in advising his father on strategies to connect with younger voters, reported The New York Times.</p>

<p>"He was very vocal," the former and future first lady said, highlighting her son's active involvement in recommending media personalities popular with Generation Z. "He knew exactly who his father needs to contact and to talk to."</p>

<p>Melania Trump noted that younger audiences have moved away from traditional media platforms such as television, and rely more on phones, podcasts, and streaming platforms. She credited Barron with understanding these shifts, saying that he "brought in so many young people - he knows his generation."</p>

<p>Barron Trump, currently a freshman at New York University, faces unique challenges as the son of a high-profile public figure. Speaking about his adjustment to university life, Melania Trump said, "I don't think it's possible for him to be a normal student."</p>

<p>She shared the guidance she had offered him as he navigates this territory: "This is your road. This is your life."</p>

<p>The interview took a light-hearted turn as Melania Trump discussed her husband's public appearances, including his dancing at events, and her recent memoir. Looking ahead to her return as first lady, she said that she was already interviewing potential staff members for her second term in the White House.</p>

<p>"My team is in contact with the White House, so that's a plus, but we have all that we need," she said, noting that her prior experience has made the preparation process more straightforward.</p>

<p>According to The New York Times, close associates of the president-elect have suggested that Melania Trump may divide her time between the White House and the family's New York residence.</p>

<p>In November 2024, Melania Trump had declined an invitation from current first lady Jill Biden for a traditional meeting at the White House following Donald Trump's re-election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Syrian government forces have lost control of Daraa city, a war monitor said, in another stunning blow for President Bashar al-Assad's rule after rebels wrested other key cities from his grip.</p>

<p>Daraa was dubbed "the cradle of the revolution" early in Syria's civil war, after activists accused the government of detaining and torturing a group of boys for scribbling anti-Assad graffiti on their school walls in 2011.</p>

<p>While Aleppo and Hama, the two other main cities taken from government control in recent days, fell to an Islamist-led rebel alliance, Daraa was taken by local armed groups, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</p>

<p>"Local factions have taken control of more areas in Daraa province, including Daraa city... they now control more than 90 percent of the province, as regime forces successively pulled out," the Britain-based Observatory, which relies on a network of sources around Syria, said late Friday.</p>

<p>Daraa province borders Jordan.</p>

<p>Despite a truce brokered by Assad ally Russia, the province has been plagued by unrest in recent years, with frequent attacks, clashes and assassinations.</p>

<p><strong>Waves of violence</strong></p>

<p>Syria's civil war, which began with Assad's crackdown on democracy protests, has killed more than 500,000 people and forced more than half the population to flee their homes.</p>

<p>Never in the war had Assad's forces lost control of so many key cities in such a short space of time.</p>

<p>Since a rebel alliance led by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) launched its offensive on November 27, the government has lost second city Aleppo and subsequently Hama in central Syria.</p>

<p>The rebels were on Friday at the gates of Homs, Syria's third city, as the government pulled out its troops from Deir Ezzor in the east.</p>

<p>In an interview published on Friday, the leader of HTS, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, said the aim of the offensive was to overthrow Assad.</p>

<p>"When we talk about objectives, the goal of the revolution remains the overthrow of this regime. It is our right to use all available means to achieve that goal," Jolani told CNN.</p>

<p>HTS is rooted in the Syrian branch of Al-Qaeda. Proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Western governments, it has sought to soften its image in recent years.</p>

<p><strong>Sudden Withdrawal</strong></p>

<p>As the army and its Iran-backed militia allies pulled out of Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria, Kurdish-led forces said they crossed the Euphrates river and took control of the territory that had been vacated.</p>

<p>The Observatory said government troops and their allies withdrew "suddenly" from the east and headed towards the oasis town of Palmyra on the desert road to Homs.</p>

<p>The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, who are backed by the United States, expressed readiness for dialogue with both Turkey and the rebels, saying the offensive heralded a "new" political reality for Syria.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for a "political solution to the conflict" and for the protection of civilians and minorities, his spokesperson said Friday, in a call with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan.</p>

<p>The rebels launched their offensive the same day a ceasefire took effect in neighbouring Lebanon in the war between Israel and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>The Lebanese group has been an important Assad ally, alongside Russia and Iran.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Turkey, which has backed the opposition, said it would hold talks with Russia and Iran in Qatar this weekend.</p>

<p>Ahead of the talks, the foreign ministers of Iran, Iraq and Syria met in Baghdad, where Syria's Bassam al-Sabbagh accused the government's enemies of seeking to "redraw the political map".</p>

<p>Iran's Abbas Araghchi pledged to provide Assad's government with "whatever (support) is needed".&nbsp;</p>

<p>But Tehran has started to withdraw its military commanders and personnel, including some diplomatic staff, from Syria, the New York Times reported Friday, citing unnamed regional officials and three Iranian officials.</p>

<p><strong>Fear</strong></p>

<p>In Homs, the scene of some of the war's deadliest violence, tens of thousands of members of Assad's Alawite minority were fleeing, fearing the rebels' advance, residents and the Britain-based Observatory said.</p>

<p>Syrians who were forced out of the country years ago by the initial crackdown on the revolt were glued to their phones as they watched current developments unfold.</p>

<p>"We've been dreaming of this for more than a decade," said Yazan, a 39-year-old former activist who now lives in France.</p>

<p>Asked whether he was worried about HTS's Islamist agenda, he said: "It doesn't matter to me who is conducting this. The devil himself could be behind it. What people care about is who is going to liberate the country."&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the other side of the sectarian divide, Haidar, 37, who lives in an Alawite-majority neighbourhood, told AFP by telephone that "fear is the umbrella that covers Homs now".</p>

<p><strong>'Our Joy Is Indescribable'</strong></p>

<p>The army shelled the advancing rebels as Syrian and Russian aircraft struck from the skies. At least 20 civilians, including five children, were killed in the bombardment, the war monitor added.</p>

<p>At least 826 people, mostly combatants but also including 111 civilians, have been killed since the offensive began last week, according to the Observatory's figures, while the United Nations said the violence has displaced 280,000 people.</p>

<p>Many of the scenes witnessed in recent days would have been unimaginable earlier in the war.</p>

<p>In Hama, an AFP photographer saw residents set fire to a giant poster of Assad on the facade of city hall.</p>

<p>"Our joy is indescribable, and we wish this for every honourable Syrian to experience these happy moments that we have been deprived of since birth," said Hama resident Ghiath Suleiman.</p>

<p>Online footage verified by AFP showed residents toppling a statue of Assad's father Hafez, under whose brutal rule the army carried out a massacre in the city in the 1980s.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korea's embattled President Yoon Suk Yeol apologised but stopped short of resigning Saturday over his declaration of martial law, with a vote to impeach him hours away and mass street protests planned in Seoul.</p>

<p>Yoon stunned the nation and the international community Tuesday night by imposing martial law for the first time in over four decades and deploying troops and helicopters to parliament.</p>

<p>But lawmakers managed to vote down the decree, forcing Yoon to rescind the order in the early hours of Wednesday in a night of extraordinary drama for a country assumed to be a stable democracy.</p>

<p>"The declaration of martial law arose from my desperation as the president," he said in a televised address, the first time he has appeared before the public since plunging the country into political chaos.</p>

<p>"However, in the process, I caused anxiety and inconvenience to the public. I sincerely apologize to the citizens who were greatly distressed."</p>

<p>The opposition and key members of his own party have called for him to step down, and parliament is set to vote later Saturday on his impeachment, although opposition leader Lee Jae-myung told AFP it was not clear the motion could pass.</p>

<p>Police have said they expect tens of thousands of anti-Yoon protesters to take to the streets ahead of the vote, with organisers hoping 200,000 people will attend.</p>

<p>Yoon did not offer to resign in his brief address, saying only that he would "entrust the party with measures to stabilise the political situation, including my term in office."</p>

<p>His People Power Party (PPP) is divided on the issue, with lawmakers late Friday sticking to the official line that they would block impeachment, even after party head Han Dong-hoon said Yoon must go or Seoul risked more political chaos.</p>

<p>"The normal performance of the president's duties is impossible under the (current) circumstances, and an early resignation of the president is inevitable," Han Dong-hoon told reporters early Saturday.</p>

<p>The opposition bloc holds 192 seats in the 300-strong parliament, while Yoon's PPP has 108.</p>

<p>Just eight ruling party lawmakers need to defect for the vote to get the two-thirds majority it needs to pass.</p>

<p>A successful vote would suspend Yoon from office pending a ruling by the Constitutional Court.</p>

<p>Police have begun investigating Yoon and others for alleged insurrection.&nbsp;"I will not shy away from the issue of legal and political responsibility regarding the declaration of martial law," Yoon said during his address.</p>

<p>Opposition leader Lee said Yoon's speech was "very disappointing" given widespread public demands for him to step down.</p>

<p>His speech "only exacerbates the sense of betrayal and anger among the citizens", he said, adding the only solution to the current political chaos was "the immediate resignation of the president or an early departure through impeachment".</p>

<p>An opinion poll released Friday put backing for the 63-year-old president at a record low of 13 percent.</p>

<p>On Friday night, at least 15,000 anti-Yoon protesters braved the cold weather to gather in Seoul's Yeouido district, where the National Assembly is located.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some camped out all night despite freezing temperatures, while opposition MPs remained in parliament, fearing Yoon might try some desperate measure to remain in office.</p>

<p><strong>'Anti-State Elements'</strong></p>

<p>In his address to the nation late Tuesday, Yoon said martial law would "safeguard a liberal South Korea from the threats posed by North Korea's communist forces and eliminate anti-state elements plundering people's freedom and happiness".</p>

<p>Security forces sealed the National Assembly, helicopters landed on the roof, and almost 300 soldiers tried to lock down the building.</p>

<p>But as parliamentary staffers blocked the soldiers with sofas and fire extinguishers, enough MPs got inside -- many climbed walls to enter -- and voted down Yoon's move.</p>

<p>Soldiers had been ordered to detain key politicians, lawmakers from both parties have said, with the special forces chief saying this week they'd been told to "drag out" lawmakers from parliament.</p>

<p>But experts and lawmakers have speculated that the elite special forces soldiers may have slow-walked following orders, after discovering themselves to be involved in a political rather than national security incident.</p>

<p>The episode brought back painful memories of South Korea's autocratic past and blindsided its allies, with the US administration only finding out via television.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told his Korean counterpart Cho Tae-yul on Friday that he "expects the... democratic process to prevail".</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earning money through unconventional ways has become increasingly popular in the digital age. Young individuals are finding success in fields like content creation and digital marketing. However, one British teenager has taken a unique approach during the festive season, earning an impressive $19,000 (approximately Rs 16,08,748) per month by selling stickers.</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/06/lifestyle/17-year-old-makes-over-19k-a-month-with-sticker-business-all-thanks-to-christmas-gift/"><em>New York Post, </em></a>the 17-year-old teenager Caelan McDonald is making this fortune with his personalised sticker business, thanks to a craft kit he got for Christmas from his mother. He was given a $191.37 Cricut Joy-a digital drawing, cutting, and printing machine-for Christmas two years ago by mom Karen Newsham, 49.</p>

<p>He started printing transfers, which he stuck on glassware and acrylic-and when he shared them on Facebook, he started getting commissions for personalised items. At the start of 2024, he was selling around 200 personalised items a month-featuring the transfers he made at home-working three hours a day after college.</p>

<p>He bought large industrial printers after quitting school, and since July, he has sold $94,410.31 (Rs 79,93810) worth of goods on TikTok Shop and other platforms.</p>

<p>McDonald, from Lancaster, Lancashire, said, "It's 100% the best Christmas present I ever got-it's the gift that keeps on giving. I never imagined it would get to this point.If you'd told me last year that this would happen, I'd have just laughed. It kind of started accidentally.In June I thought, 'I'll just give it a try,' and it's gone crazy. Now I'm so busy I hardly ever stop."</p>

<p>"The last few months have gone so fast it feels like they've been about two seconds.I just invest everything back into the business, but it's nice to be able to update my phone or iPad when I want or need to."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Peruvian woman was hurt on December 5 while strolling down a pavement when an underground electrical box exploded, causing injuries.</p>

<p>CCTV footage of the incident shows the woman being struck by the metal cover of the box, which causes her to fall partially into the open space. She was quickly saved by a military officer on duty in the area.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A plane carrying five passengers in Brazil had a narrow escape after a vulture smashed through the cockpit windshield and hung lifelessly in front of the pilot for the remainder of the flight, as he attempted an emergency landing. The incident took place when the single-engine aircraft was on its way to Eirunepe from Envira in Brazil's Amazonas on Thursday (Dec 5). Footage taken post-crash showed the scavenger bird dangling in front of the cockpit as the pilot's vision was hampered by it.</p>

<p>Despite the high-intensity impact, the pilot managed to hold his own and landed the aircraft at the Eirunepe airport without any trouble. None of the passengers were injured in the incident but it left the pilot and co-pilot visibly shaken as they could be heard narrating the situation to other people on board.</p>

<p>The pilot blamed the rubbish dump next to the airport as the probable reason for the presence of vultures in the area which makes piloting a difficult task.</p>

<p>"It was a close call! This is the fault of the landfill next to the airport, which attracts an absurd amount of vultures to the area," the pilot was quoted as saying by the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/06/lifestyle/vulture-crashes-into-plane-cockpits-window-stuns-pilot-and-passengers-we-thought-we-wouldnt-get-out-alive/" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>NY Post.</em></a></p>

<p>The incident left the social media users rattled as well who reflected on the uncertainty of air travel.</p>

<p>"Wow! So incredible they survived," said one user, while another added: "A vulture? DAMN! That'd give me nightmares."</p>

<p>A third commented: "How unpredictable nature can be, even at 30,000 feet."</p>

<h3><strong>Previous instance</strong></h3>

<p>This is not the first instance when a bird has smashed through the cockpit in such a manner. In May, earlier this year, Spanish-French aerobatic pilot, Olivier Masurel, lost his life when a vulture hit his cockpit and caused the light aircraft he was flying to crash.</p>

<p>Mr Masurel, one of the most recognised names in the international show-flying scene, was returning after taking part in the San Javier Air Festival in the Region of Murcia. "We accompany his family and friends in this heartfelt loss, flying was his passion and this fatal accident has taken his life; fly high, dear Olivier," read a statement by San Javier Air Show organisers.</p>

<p>Similarly, in 2023, Ecuadorian pilot Ariel Valiente was left bloodied when a massive bird struck through the windshield of his crop duster plane in mid-air.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A jury in the US state of Florida has awarded $310 million (Rs 2,624 crore) to the family of a teenager who was killed after falling off a Free Fall Tower drop ride at Orlando's ICON Park in 2022. Tyre Sampson was only 14 years old when he plummeted 70 feet from the ride at the amusement park that he was visiting on a spring break trip with his football team. The kid's parents, Nekia Dodd and Yarnell Sampson, will each be receiving $155 million (Rs 1,312 crore) from Funtime, the ride's manufacturer, that has been held responsible for the deadly incident.</p>

<p>"This verdict is a step forward in holding corporations accountable for the safety of their products. The jury's decision confirms what we have long argued: Tyre's death was the result of blatant negligence and a failure to prioritize safety over profits," read a statement by attorneys representing Tyre's parents.</p>

<p>"The ride's manufacturers neglected their duty to protect passengers, and today's outcome ensures they face the consequences of those decisions."</p>

<p>The trial only lasted a day as Funtime failed to appear in the court to defend itself. The family had already reached an undisclosed settlement with ICON Park. It now faces the challenge of pursuing the $310 million damages from Funtime, which is based in Austria and will need to seek a court order from an Austrian court to collect.</p>

<h3><strong>How did Tyre Sampson fall to death?</strong></h3>

<p>The Missouri teen plummeted to his death after slipping out of the seat on the 400 ft-tall ride. The Free Fall ride which placed 30 riders in seats attached to a tower, secured the passengers with a shoulder harness and then dropped them 430 feet. Surprisingly, it did not have seat belts, something which most drop rides have as an additional safety measure.</p>

<p>Mr Sampson also weighed 173 kilograms, which exceeded the ride's 129-kilogram weight limit but was still allowed to sit on the ride. Due to his size, the harness did not lock properly and he was ejected from the seat when the ride braked at height.</p>

<p>The ride has since been disassembled with Florida Governor, Ron DeSantis greenlighting the Tyre Sampson Act in May 2023 which aims to bolster safety requirements for amusement park attractions. The family has also demanded an industry-wide revamp to implement "stricter safety measures and oversight" to prevent such tragedies from happening again.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Syrian government forces have lost control of Daraa city, a war monitor said, in another stunning blow for President Bashar al-Assad's rule after rebels wrested other key cities from his grip.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Syrian government forces have lost control of Daraa city, a war monitor said, in another stunning blow for President Bashar al-Assad's rule after rebels wrested other key cities from his grip.</p>

<p>Daraa was dubbed "the cradle of the revolution" early in Syria's civil war, after activists accused the government of detaining and torturing a group of boys for scribbling anti-Assad graffiti on their school walls in 2011.</p>

<p>While Aleppo and Hama, the two other main cities taken from government control in recent days, fell to an Islamist-led rebel alliance, Daraa fell to local armed groups, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</p>

<p>"Local factions have taken control of more areas in Daraa province, including Daraa city... they now control more than 90 percent of the province, as regime forces successively pulled out," the Britain-based Observatory said late Friday, which relies on a network of sources around Syria.</p>

<p>Daraa province borders Jordan.</p>

<p>Despite a truce brokered by Assad ally Russia, it has been plagued by unrest in recent years, with frequent attacks, clashes and assassinations.</p>

<p>- Waves of violence -</p>

<p>Syria's civil war, which began with Assad's crackdown on democracy protests, has killed more than 500,000 people and forced more than half the population to flee their homes.</p>

<p>Never in the war had Assad's forces lost control of so many key cities in such a short space of time.</p>

<p>Since a rebel alliance led by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham launched its offensive on November 27, the government has lost second city Aleppo and subsequently Hama in central Syria.</p>

<p>The rebels were on Friday at the gates of Homs, Syria's third city, as the government pulled out its troops from Deir Ezzor in the east to redeploy towards to the centre.</p>

<p>In an interview published on Friday, the leader of HTS, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, said the aim of the offensive was to overthrow Assad.</p>

<p>"When we talk about objectives, the goal of the revolution remains the overthrow of this regime. It is our right to use all available means to achieve that goal," Jolani told CNN.</p>

<p>HTS is rooted in the Syrian branch of Al-Qaeda. Proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Western governments, it has sought to soften its image in recent years.</p>

<p>According to Fabrice Balanche, a lecturer at France's Lumiere Lyon 2 university, HTS now controls 20,000 square kilometres (more than 7,700 square miles) of territory, nearly seven times as much as it did before the offensive started.</p>

<p><strong>- Sudden withdrawal -</strong></p>

<p>As the army and its Iran-backed militia allies pulled out of Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria, Kurdish-led forces said they crossed the Euphrates and took control of the territory that had been vacated.</p>

<p>The Observatory said government troops and their allies withdrew "suddenly" from the east and headed towards the oasis town of Palmyra on the desert road to Homs.</p>

<p>The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, who are backed by the United States, expressed readiness for dialogue with both Turkey and the rebels, saying the offensive heralded a "new" political reality for Syria.</p>

<p>The rebels launched their offensive the same day a ceasefire took effect in neighbouring Lebanon in the war between Israel and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>The Lebanese militant group has been an important Assad ally, alongside Russia and Iran.</p>

<p>Turkey, which has backed the opposition, said it would hold talks with Russia and Iran in Qatar this weekend.</p>

<p>Ahead of the talks, the top diplomats of Iran, Iraq and Syria met in Baghdad, where Syria's Bassam al-Sabbagh accused the government's enemies of seeking to "redraw the political map".</p>

<p>Iran's Abbas Araghchi pledged to provide Assad's government with "whatever (support) is needed".</p>

<p><strong>- Fear -</strong></p>

<p>In Homs, scene of some of the war's deadliest violence, tens of thousands of members of Assad's Alawite minority were fleeing, fearing the rebels' advance, residents and the Britain-based Observatory said.</p>

<p>Syrians who were forced out of the country years ago by the initial crackdown on the revolt were glued to their phones as they watched current developments unfold.</p>

<p>"We've been dreaming of this for more than a decade," said Yazan, a 39-year-old former activist who now lives in France.</p>

<p>Asked whether he was worried about HTS's Islamist agenda, he said: "It doesn't matter to me who is conducting this. The devil himself could be behind it. What people care about is who is going to liberate the country."</p>

<p>On the other side of the sectarian divide, Haidar, 37, who lives in an Alawite-majority neighbourhood, told AFP by telephone that "fear is the umbrella that covers Homs now".</p>

<p>The army shelled the advancing rebels as Syrian and Russian aircraft struck from the skies. At least 20 civilians, including five children, were killed in the bombardment, the war monitor added.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Massive blow' -</strong></p>

<p>At least 826 people, mostly combatants but also including 111 civilians, have been killed since the offensive began last week, according to the Observatory's figures, while the United Nations said the violence has displaced 280,000 people.</p>

<p>Many of the scenes witnessed in recent days would have been unimaginable earlier in the war.</p>

<p>In Hama, an AFP photographer saw residents set fire to a giant poster of Assad on the facade of city hall.</p>

<p>"Our joy is indescribable, and we wish this for every honourable Syrian to experience these happy moments that we have been deprived of since birth," said Hama resident Ghiath Suleiman.</p>

<p>Online footage verified by AFP showed residents toppling a statue of Assad's father Hafez, under whose brutal rule the army carried out a massacre in the city in the 1980s.</p>

<p>Aron Lund, a fellow of the Century International think tank, called the loss of Hama "a massive, massive blow to the Syrian government".</p>

<p>Should Assad lose Homs, it wouldn't mean the end of his rule, Lund said, but "with no secure route from Damascus to the coast, I'd say it's over as a credible state entity".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol will address the nation on Saturday morning, his office said, ahead of a planned impeachment vote over his attempt this week to impose martial law.</p>

<p>The speech would be the embattled leader's first public appearance since he rescinded the martial law order early on Wednesday just six hours after it was declared, after parliament defied military and police cordons to vote against the decree.</p>

<p>On Friday the leader of Yoon's own People Power Party said the president was a danger to the country and needed to be removed from power, increasing the pressure on him to quit even though PPP members later reaffirmed its formal opposition to his impeachment.</p>

<p>Lawmakers will vote on the main opposition Democratic Party's motion to impeach Yoon, who shocked the nation late on Tuesday when he gave the military sweeping emergency powers in order to root out what he called "anti-state forces" and overcome obstructionist political opponents.</p>

<p>Some PPP members urged Yoon to resign before the vote, saying they did not want a repeat of the 2016 impeachment of then-President Park Geun-hye, who left office following months of candlelit protests over an influence-peddling scandal. Her downfall triggered the implosion of the party and a victory by liberals in presidential and general elections.</p>

<p>In scenes reminiscent of those protests, thousands of demonstrators holding candles assembled outside parliament on Friday night demanding Yoon's impeachment.</p>

<p>More demonstrations are expected on Saturday ahead of the vote.</p>

<p>Prosecutors, the police and the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials have all launched probes into Yoon and senior officials involved in the martial law decree, seeking to pursue charges of insurrection and abuse of power, among others.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;More than 2,80,000 people have been uprooted in northwest Syria following the sudden and massive offensive into Government-controlled areas led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which is sanctioned by the Security Council as a terrorist group, the United Nations said on Friday.</p>

<p>Sharing a post on X, the United Nations wrote, "Over 280,000 people have been uprooted in northwest Syria in a matter of days following the recent escalation of violence."</p>

<p>"Amid already dire living conditions after 13 years of war, the UN is scaling up humanitarian efforts to assist the most vulnerable," the post added.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, thousands of residents fled the city of Homs, desperate amid the rebels' advance towards Damascus sparked panic.</p>

<p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said on Friday that thousands of Homs residents started fleeing overnight towards the western coast, where embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad still maintains control, according to a report by Al Jazeera.</p>

<p>Fighters led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) made significant gains in Syria, capturing two key towns - Rastan and Talbiseh - in the Homs governorate. According to Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the SOHR, HTS forces were just five kilometres away from the outskirts of Homs city.</p>

<p>After capturing the city of Hama to the north on Thursday, the rebels set their sights on the crossroads city of Homs which, if captured, would split the territories under the control of President Bashar al-Assad in two.</p>

<p>The conflict began in 2011 after Assad moved to stamp out peaceful pro-democracy protests during the Arab Spring. Over 3,00,000 civilians have been killed in more than a decade of war, according to the United Nations, with millions more displaced across the region, according to CNN.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India on Friday announced that Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri will travel to Bangladesh on Monday, a visit that comes amid increasing strain in ties between New Delhi and Dhaka over attacks on minorities, including Hindus, in the neighbouring country.</p>

<p>It will be the first high-level visit from New Delhi to Dhaka after deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina fled Bangladesh and took shelter in India following massive anti-government protests.</p>

<p>Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said Mr Misri will travel to Bangladesh to attend a meeting under the framework of Foreign Office Consultations.</p>

<p>In Dhaka, the foreign secretary will hold talks with his Bangladeshi counterpart, besides holding several other meetings, he said.</p>

<p>"The foreign secretary is scheduled to visit Bangladesh for Foreign Office Consultations on December 9. This is part of our structured interactions with the Bangladesh side," Mr Jaiswal said.</p>

<p>Mr Jaiswal was responding to a question at his weekly media briefing.</p>

<p>On the arrest of Hindu monk Chinmoy Krishna Das in Bangladesh, the MEA spokesperson said India expects a fair, just and transparent legal process in the case.</p>

<p>"We have spoken on this issue earlier. We would like to reiterate our expectation that relevant legal processes underway in Bangladesh are executed in a fair, just and transparent manner, ensuring full respect for the legal rights of concerned individuals," he said.</p>

<p>The relations between India and Bangladesh came under strain after the interim government headed by Muhammad Yunus came to power in the neighbouring country. The relations deteriorated further in recent weeks over attacks on Hindus and the arrest of Chinmoy Das.</p>

<p>The attacks triggered protests in India. The Bangladesh foreign ministry summoned the Indian envoy recently and lodged a protest over the storming of the Bangladeshi mission in Agartala by a group of protesters.</p>

<p>India last week said the interim government in Bangladesh must live up to its responsibility of protecting all minorities as it expressed serious concern over the "surge" of extremist rhetoric and increasing incidents of violence against Hindus.</p>

<p>India had also hoped that the case relating to Chinmoy Das, arrested on the charge of sedition, will be dealt with in a just and fair manner.</p>

<p>Chinmoy Das was arrested at Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport last month in connection with a sedition case.<br />

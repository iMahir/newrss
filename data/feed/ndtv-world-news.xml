       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian military launched a massive strike on Ukraine's critical energy infrastructure facilities, the Russian Defence Ministry said.</p>

<p>"This morning, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation launched a massive strike with high-precision long-range air and sea-based weapons, striking unmanned aerial vehicles at critical energy infrastructure facilities that ensured the operation of the military-industrial complex of Ukraine. All the assigned targets were hit," it said on Monday in a statement.</p>

<p>The Ministry added that two electronic warfare stations and four field ammunition depots were destroyed over the past 24 hours, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Monday on Telegram that Russia launched more than 100 missiles of various types and about 100 drones, calling it "one of the largest attacks -- a combined strike".</p>

<p>Zelensky said the attack had caused extensive damage to the energy sector, but facilities are currently being restored.</p>

<p>Ukraine's government-run Ukrinform news agency said that explosions struck the Ukrainian capital, the cities of Dnipro, Kropyvnytsky, Vinnytsia and Kryvyi Rih in central Ukraine and the eastern city of Kharkiv.</p>

<p>According to the Ukrainian Air Force, Russia fired at Ukraine several groups of combat drones and cruise missiles.</p>

<p>Eleven Russian Tu-95MC strategic bombers and six Tu-22M3 long-range supersonic bombers were airborne during the attack.</p>

<p>Ukrainians had been expecting a major Russian missile attack for some time. The US Embassy issued a warning last week of an elevated risk of attack around Ukrainian Independence Day, which Ukraine marked on Saturday.</p>

<p>Nearly 15 missiles and 15 drones targeting the capital of Kyiv were downed, Serhiy Popko, head of Kyiv's military administration, wrote on Telegram. Both Russia and Ukraine deny deliberately targeting civilians.</p>

<p>Each says its attacks are aimed at destroying infrastructure critical to the other's war effort.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Former US congresswoman, who left the Democratic Party in 2022 announced her endorsement of former President Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential polls in November, The Hill reported.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Former US congresswoman, who left the Democratic Party in 2022 announced her endorsement of former President Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential polls in November, The Hill reported.</p>

<p>Gabbard, who has become a regular presence in conservative media, announced a National Guard Association gathering in Michigan where Trump was also speaking.</p>

<p>"This administration has us facing multiple wars on multiple fronts in regions around the world, and closer to the brink of nuclear war than we ever have been before," Gabbard said.</p>

<p>"This is one of the main reasons why I am committed to doing all that I can to send President Trump back to the White House, where he can once again serve us as our commander-in-chief," she added.</p>

<p>Notably, Gabbard ran an unsuccessful presidential campaign in the Democratic primary in 2020. After ending her bid, she exited Congress, left the Democratic Party and appeared at events like the Conservative Political Action Conference, The Hill reported.</p>

<p>The former congresswoman has huddled with Trump in recent weeks as part of preparations for next month's scheduled debate between Trump and Vice President Harris.</p>

<p>Arguably the most notable moment of Gabbard's unsuccessful 2020 White House bid was when she attacked Vice President Harris on the debate stage over her record as a prosecutor.</p>

<p>Gabbard's endorsement comes days after Robert F Kennedy Jr suspended his independent White House bid and backed Trump, which the former president's campaign touted as a significant development in battleground states.</p>

<p>This comes days after the New York Times reported that Trump has brought in Tulsi Gabbard to help sharpen his attacks in the debate against Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Gabbard reportedly joined Trump's practice session at the latter's private club and home, Mar-a-Lago. Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are set to face off in the ABC News debate on September 10.</p>

<p>Notably, Gabbard brings some key qualities to Trump's role: She's a woman, at a moment when Trump is for a second time facing a woman as his general election rival; she's a former House member, giving her policy experience; and, perhaps most importantly for Trump, she has been on a debate stage with Harris and delivered a stinging attack against her record as a prosecutor, New York Times reported.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States continues to assess that the threat of attack against Israel by Iran and its proxy groups still exists, the Pentagon said on Monday, after Hezbollah launched hundreds of rockets and drones at Israel in retaliation for the killing of a senior Hezbollah commander.</p>

<p>"I would point you to some of the public comments that have been made by Iranian leaders and others... we continue to assess that there is a threat of attack," Pentagon spokesperson Air Force Major General Patrick Ryder told reporters.</p>

<p>Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said earlier that Iran's aggressive activities towards Israel had never been higher, adding Israel and the U.S. must be prepared to prevent the Islamic Republic from gaining nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Gallant was meeting with top U.S. military officer General C.Q. Brown, who is on a trip to the region aimed at preventing Israel's war with the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza from engulfing the region.</p>

<p>In one of the biggest clashes in more than 10 months of border warfare, Israel on Sunday struck Iran's Lebanon-based proxy Hezbollah with around 100 jets in what it said was a pre-emptive strike aimed at thwarting a much larger attack.</p>

<p>Brown, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also met with the Israeli military's Chief of General Staff Herzi Halevi.</p>

<p>"We are very determined to continue degrading Hezbollah's capabilities, eliminating more commanders. We are not stopping. Our mission is to return the residents of the north to their homes in safety," Halevi told Brown.</p>

<p>With three deaths confirmed in Lebanon and one in Israel following Sunday's missile exchange, both sides indicated they were happy to avoid further escalation for now, but warned that there could be more strikes to come.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India on Monday trashed reports in Bangladesh that the opening of the Farakka barrage in West Bengal is causing floods in some areas in the neighbouring country.</p>

<p>"We have seen fake videos, rumours and fear-mongering to create misunderstanding. This should be firmly countered with facts," External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.</p>

<p>He said relevant data is shared with joint river commission officials concerned in Bangladesh on a regular and timely basis, and it was done this time as well.</p>

<p>"We have seen media reports of the opening of Farakka barrage gates that will allow the flow of over 11 lakh cusecs of water downstream of the river in its natural course into the Ganga/Padma river," Mr Jaiswal said.</p>

<p>"This is a normal seasonal development that takes place due to increased inflow from heavy rainfall in the Ganga river basin catchment areas upstream," he said.</p>

<p>The MEA spokesperson was responding to media queries on the matter.</p>

<p>"It is to be understood that Farakka is only a barrage and not a dam. Whenever the water level reaches the pond level, whatever inflow comes that passes," he said.</p>

<p>"It is merely a structure to divert 40,000 cusecs of water into the Farakka canal that is carefully done using a system of gates on the main Ganga/Padma river, while the balance water flows into the main river to Bangladesh," Jaiswal added.</p>

<p>Last week too, India described as factually incorrect reports in Bangladesh that the flood situation in certain parts of the country has been caused by the opening of a dam on the Gumti river in Tripura.</p>

<p>The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) had said floods on the common rivers between the two countries are a "shared" problem inflicting suffering on people on both sides and requires close mutual cooperation towards resolving it.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canada is reducing by tens of thousands the number of temporary foreign workers it brings in, reversing some expansions to the program it made in 2022 as the government struggles to bring down numbers of temporary residents.</p>

<p>The temporary foreign worker program brings non-Canadians to the country to work on a short-term basis. Meant to fill labor shortages, it has grown dramatically and has come under fire for suppressing wages and leaving workers vulnerable to abuse, in part because of permits that tie workers to employers.</p>

<p>A UN special rapporteur called it "a breeding ground for contemporary forms of slavery."</p>

<p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his cabinet is also considering reductions to permanent resident streams. Trudeau has been lagging in polls ahead of an election expected next year as a growing share of Canadians say Canada is bringing in too many immigrants.</p>

<p>"We're looking at the various streams to make sure that as we move forward, Canada remains a place that is positive in its support for immigration, but also responsible in the way we integrate and make sure there's pathways to success for everyone who comes to Canada," Trudeau told reporters Monday.</p>

<p>He said the government will present a broader plan on immigration levels this fall.</p>

<p>Canada has long prided itself on welcoming newcomers but its government is under pressure to reduce the number of temporary residents, which has grown dramatically in recent years.</p>

<p>The government has pledged more measures to reduce the temporary resident population to 5% of Canada's total population in three years. Its share was 6.8% in April and the Bank of Canada has said it expected that number to rise.</p>

<p>Changes announced Monday would end low-wage temporary foreign workers in communities with unemployment at 6% or higher, reduce the share of employers' workforces that can be low-wage temporary foreign workers to 10% and reduce the length of a low-wage temporary foreign worker permit to one year from two.</p>

<p>The changes exempt certain sectors including agriculture, food processing, construction and healthcare.</p>

<p>Combined with changes from earlier this year, the measures are expected to reduce the number of temporary foreign workers by about 65,000, Employment Minister Randy Boissonnault told reporters Monday.</p>

<p>The changes were "a great first step, but it's only a first step" said economist and Smart Prosperity Institute senior director Mike Moffatt, who called for the low-wage stream to be abolished.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[President Emmanuel Macron on Monday denied any political link to the arrest of Telegram founder Pavel Durov as the tech tycoon spent a second day in French custody following his surprise arrest at a Paris airport.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Emmanuel Macron on Monday denied any political link to the arrest of Telegram founder Pavel Durov as the tech tycoon spent a second day in French custody following his surprise arrest at a Paris airport.</p>

<p>Numerous questions have been raised about the timing and circumstances of Durov's detention.</p>

<p>Sources close to the case said Durov is accused of failing to curb the spread of illegal content on Telegram, which has over 900 million users. The company has dismissed the accusations.</p>

<p>Born in Soviet times into a family of academics in Leningrad, now known as Saint Petersburg, Durov spent his childhood in Italy before building up Russia's then-biggest social network VKontakte (VK) in his early 20s. He set up Telegram after leaving Russia a decade ago and Forbes magazine estimates his current fortune at $15.5 billion.</p>

<p>Writing on the X social media platform that he was addressing "false information" concerning the case, Macron said Durov's arrest "took place as part of an ongoing judicial investigation."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It is in no way a political decision. It is up to the judges to rule on the matter," he wrote in a highly unusual comment on a legal case.</p>

<p>Durov, 39, holds a French passport in addition to his Russian nationality.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Nothing to hide' -</strong></p>

<p>An investigating magistrate extended Durov's detention on Sunday, &nbsp;according to a source close to the investigation. The initial detention for questioning can last up to 96 hours.</p>

<p>When this period ends, the magistrate can either free Durov or press charges and remand him in custody.</p>

<p>Durov, who has been based in Dubai in recent years, arrived in Paris from the Azerbaijani capital Baku, and was planning to have dinner in the French capital, a source close to the case said.</p>

<p>He was accompanied by a bodyguard and a personal assistant who always travelled with him, added the source, asking not to be named.</p>

<p>One key question is why Durov flew into France when he would have likely been aware he was wanted in the country. "Perhaps he had a feeling of impunity," said a source close to the case, asking not to be named.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin was in Baku on a state visit to Azerbaijan on August 18 and 19 but Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied that the pair had met.</p>

<p>Durov is accused of failing to take action to curb the criminal use of his platform.</p>

<p>France's OFMIN, an office tasked with preventing violence against minors, &nbsp;issued an arrest warrant for Durov in a preliminary investigation into alleged offences including fraud, drug trafficking, cyberbullying, organised crime and promotion of terrorism, another source said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Telegram said in response that "Durov has nothing to hide and travels frequently in Europe."</p>

<p>"Telegram abides by EU laws, including the Digital Services Act -- its moderation is within industry standards," it added.</p>

<p>"It is absurd to claim that a platform or its owner is responsible for the abuse of that platform."</p>

<p><strong>- 'Enforce the law' -</strong></p>

<p>Telegram has positioned itself as a "neutral" alternative to US-owned platforms, which have been criticised for their commercial exploitation of users' personal data.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It also plays a key role since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, used actively by politicians and commentators on both sides of the war.</p>

<p>But critics accuse it of hosting often illegal content ranging from extreme sexual imagery to disinformation and also narcotics services.</p>

<p>Kremlin spokesman Peskov said Moscow had received no information from France on why Durov was detained, saying "we do not know concretely what Durov is accused of".</p>

<p>Elon Musk, who leads the Tesla car group and X, formerly Twitter, posted the hashtag #FreePavel on his platform and commented in French, "Liberte Liberte! Liberte?" (Freedom Freedom! Freedom?).</p>

<p>Macron said that while France is "deeply committed to freedom of expression and communication" such freedoms are "upheld within a legal framework, both on social media and in real life".</p>

<p>"It is up to the judiciary, in full independence, to enforce the law," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The campaigns of Donald Trump and Kamala Harris clashed on Monday over next month's U.S. presidential debate, with the vice president's team seeking a return to open microphones while her Republican rival threatened to pull out entirely, suggesting the previously agreed-upon ABC network was biased.</p>

<p>"Why would I do the Debate against Kamala Harris on that network?" Trump, who is making his third bid for the White House, wrote in a social media post late Sunday night that also accused the network of bias. "Stay tuned!!!"</p>

<p>Harris spokesperson Brian Fallon said on Monday the vice president's campaign wanted the broadcaster to keep the candidates' microphones on throughout the event, not muted when their opponent was speaking as in the last presidential debate. So-called "hot mics" can help or hurt political candidates, catching off-hand comments that sometimes were not meant for the public.</p>

<p>"The Vice President is ready to deal with Trump's constant lies and interruptions in real-time. Trump should stop hiding behind the mute button," Fallon said in a statement.</p>

<p>Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller said in a statement they had already agreed to the same terms as CNN's June debate, which had muted microphones, adding: "We said no changes to the agreed-upon rules."</p>

<p>But Trump later told reporters that he preferred to have his microphone kept on, adding that he did not like it muted last time and that he was not preparing much for the face-off against his new rival.</p>

<p>"Doesn't matter to me. I'd rather have it, probably, on. But the agreement was that it would be the same as it was last time," Trump said.</p>

<p>"I'm not spending a lot of time on it. I think my whole life I've been preparing for a debate," Trump added. "You can't cram knowledge into your head, for you know, 30 years of knowledge in one week. So, you know, there's a little debate prep, but I've always done it more or less the same way."</p>

<p>Representatives for ABC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Harris secured the Democratic nomination after President Joe Biden stepped aside last month, and had said they would do the Sept. 10 debate hosted by ABC News previously agreed to by Biden and Trump.</p>

<p>Biden had pushed for earlier debates, hoping to boost his campaign and cast a brighter light on Trump. But his own halting performance at the June 27 face-off triggered alarm within his party, with him ending his reelection bid weeks later.</p>

<p>Trump had floated another debate hosted by Fox News on Sept. 4, which he later said would be a televised town hall with just himself and host Sean Hannity. The Harris campaign said no.</p>

<p>The vice presidential candidates, Republican U.S. Senator JD Vance and Democratic Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, are scheduled to debate Oct. 1 on CBS News.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran carried out on Monday a rare public execution of a man over the murder of a lawyer two years ago, state media reported.</p>

<p>"The death sentence against the murderer of a lawyer was carried out this morning in public in Shahroud city" of the northern Semnan province, the judiciary's Mizan Online website said.</p>

<p>The official IRNA news agency said the man was a 20-year-old who confessed to having been hired by a gang to kill the lawyer, without providing further details.</p>

<p>Monday's execution was carried out in accordance with the Islamic Sharia law of "retribution".&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's interim government chief Muhammad Yunus on Monday met the country's Hindu community leaders and vowed to promote interfaith harmony as he hosted a reception for them coinciding with Janmashtami.</p>

<p>The minority Hindu population has faced vandalisation of their business and properties and devastation of Hindu temples in the students' violence that ensued for days following the ouster of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India on August 5.</p>

<p>During the meeting, Mr Yunus said he wants to build a Bangladesh where everyone can practice their faith without any fear and where no temple needs to be guarded.</p>

<p>"Our responsibility is to establish the rights of every citizen. Our job is to ensure justice for every citizen," he told a group of Hindu leaders at the State Guest Jamuna in the capital.</p>

<p>"There can't be any divisions among people in our country. We are equal citizens. The interim government is determined to protect the rights of every citizen of the country," Mr Yunus was quoted as saying by the official BSS news agency.</p>

<p>"Bangladesh is a large family where the responsibility of the government is to protect the rights of every citizen," his office quoted him as saying on X.</p>

<p>Bangladesh Puja Udjapan Parishad president Bashudeb Dhar, Ramkrishna Mission of Dhaka's principal Swami Purnatmananda Maharaj, and Hindu community leaders including Kajol Debnath and Monindra Kumar Nath were present during the meeting.</p>

<p>"We spoke with Professor Yunus for almost an hour and he said all Bangladeshis are members of a single family. We will eliminate any sense of communalism," Dhar told PTI.</p>

<p>Mr Yunus greeted the country's Hindu community leaders and promised to promote interfaith harmony, the statement said.</p>

<p>The CA office statement said the Hindu leaders greeted Mr Yunus on the auspicious occasion, saying they sought blessings of the Lord Sri Krishna for the harmony and prosperity of the nation and the interim government.</p>

<p>"Hindu leaders praised the Chief Adviser's recent comments at the Dhakeshwari Mandir, a sacred temple in Old Dhaka, saying it would help build a non-communal society in the country and ensure religious harmony in the society," the statement read.</p>

<p>During the meeting, they raised the issue of "Hindu property grabbing, including the land of Hindu temples".</p>

<p>The meeting between Mr Yunus and the Hindu leaders came as tens of thousands of Hindus celebrated Janmashtami by rallying at the famous Dhakeshwari Temple and other temples and Hindu monasteries by singing Vedic hymns, kirtans and bhajans.</p>

<p>Janmashtami is a public holiday in Bangladesh to mark the birth celebration of Lord Krishna.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After an escalation of hostilities Sunday amid over 10 months of cross-border clashes between Israel and Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah movement, here are the major eruptions of violence since their 2006 war.</p>

<p>The devastating month-long war in the summer of 2006 cost Lebanon more than 1,200 lives, mostly civilians, while some 160 Israelis were killed, mostly soldiers.</p>

<p>The following years saw sporadic attacks, which surged following the October 7 attack by Hezbollah's Palestinian ally Hamas on <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/10-key-moments-in-israel-hamas-war-6240607" target="_blank">Israel.</a></p>

<h3><strong>2007-2013: rocket fire and incursion</strong></h3>

<p>On June 17, 2007, two rockets were fired into northern Israel from Lebanon hitting an industrial zone in the border town of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hamas-war-israel-to-evacuate-over-20-000-residents-of-town-near-lebanon-border-4499426" target="_blank">Kiryat Shmona</a> without causing casualties. Hezbollah denies responsibility.</p>

<p>In early August 2010, a move by Israeli troops to uproot trees in a disputed border area at Adaysseh sparks a deadly border battle in which two Lebanese soldiers and a journalist are killed along with a senior Israeli officer.</p>

<p>On August 7, 2013, four Israeli soldiers on patrol were wounded in a blast claimed by Hezbollah 400 metres (yards) inside Lebanese territory.</p>

<h3><strong>2014-2015: Israeli strikes</strong></h3>

<p>On February 26, 2014, Hezbollah says Israeli warplanes had carried out an air raid on one of its positions at Lebanon's border with Syria.</p>

<p>On October 7, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hezbollah-missile-exchange-how-israel-vs-hezbollah-unfolded-in-the-skies-6414952" target="_blank">Israel </a>strikes two Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon in response to its bomb attack against Israeli troops on the ceasefire line on the Shebaa hills between the two countries that wounded two soldiers.</p>

<p>On January 28, 2015, two Israeli soldiers are killed in a Hezbollah ambush in the Shebaa hills.</p>

<p>The attack is carried out in retaliation for a raid blamed on Israel 10 days earlier on the Syrian-controlled side of the Golan Heights, which killed at least six members of Hezbollah and an Iranian general.</p>

<p>In retaliation, Israeli tanks and artillery bombarded several villages in southern Lebanon.</p>

<h3><strong>2019: drones and missiles strikes</strong></h3>

<p>On August 25, 2019, two explosive-laden drones hit the southern Beirut suburbs, causing material damage according to Hezbollah, which blames the attack on Israel.</p>

<p>The day before, an Israeli air strike in Syria had killed two Hezbollah members.</p>

<p>On September 1, the Israeli army and Hezbollah traded missile fire along the border.</p>

<h3><strong>2021: uptick in clashes</strong></h3>

<p>On August 4, 2021, three rockets were fired from Lebanon, of which two fell in Israel. The Israeli army responds with air strikes on southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>On August 6, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/2021-and-2023-blasts-near-israel-embassy-share-chilling-similarities-4762886" target="_blank">Hezbollah</a> fires more than 10 rockets at Israel, which responds with artillery fire.</p>

<h3><strong>2023-2024: October 7 attacks aftermath</strong></h3>

<p>Hezbollah has traded almost daily cross-border fire with Israel since Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel which triggered the war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>In southern Lebanon, a Reuters video journalist was killed on October 13, and six other journalists from AFP, Reuters and Al Jazeera were wounded in a strike by an Israeli tank.</p>

<p>On January 2, 2024, Hamas deputy leader <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hamas-gaza-palestine-groups-deputy-head-assassinated-by-israel-in-lebanon-claims-hamas-4788700" target="_blank">Saleh al-Aruri</a> was killed in Beirut's southern suburbs in a strike blamed on Israel.</p>

<p>On February 26, Israeli strikes Hezbollah targets in the Bekaa Valley in the first such raid on Lebanon's east since fighting erupted in October.</p>

<h3><strong>July, August 2024: Hezbollah, Fatah chiefs killed</strong></h3>

<p>On July 27, a rocket strike killed 12 children aged 10-16 in the Druze Arab town of Majdal Shams in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights.</p>

<p>Israel blames the strike on Hezbollah, which denies the claim.</p>

<p>The Israeli army responds by striking Beirut's southern suburbs on July 30, killing Hezbollah's top commander in the south,<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/israel-targets-hezbollah-commander-fuad-shukr-820245" target="_blank"> Fuad Shukr.</a></p>

<p>In an August 21 strike, the Israeli military kills Khalil Maqdah, described by the Palestinian Fatah movement as "one of the leaders" of its armed wing in Lebanon.</p>

<h3><strong>August 2024: hostilities surge</strong></h3>

<p>On August 25, Hezbollah says it launched a barrage of hundreds of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hezbollah-launches-dozens-of-rockets-at-israel-spurs-fears-of-regional-war-6258426" target="_blank">rockets and drones</a> on Israel in response to the killing of Shukr. It says its operation "was completed and accomplished".</p>

<p>But Israel says it has thwarted the attack, launching air strikes into Lebanon that the military says destroyed "thousands" of Hezbollah rocket launchers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A gang involving Indian-origin men that used frozen chicken consignments among their many covers to smuggle drugs has been busted by UK police and now its members face prison sentences ranging between 16 and two years each.</p>

<p>Maninder Dosanjh, 39, was jailed for 16 years and eight months, and Amandeep Rishi, 42, faces imprisonment for 11 years and two months for their role in the conspiracy to supply class A banned drugs and money laundering at Birmingham Crown Court last week.</p>

<p>West Midlands Police told the court they seized 400kg of "high-purity" cocaine as well as GBP 1.6 million in illegal cash as investigators dismantled the wholesale supply chain, which saw the 10-strong gang transporting the drugs in pallets of raw chicken.</p>

<p>"This far-reaching investigation covered the importation, exportation and wholesale national supply of cocaine and money laundering," said Detective Chief Inspector Pete Cooke from the West Midlands Police's Regional Organised Crime Unit (ROCU).</p>

<p>"We were able to expose the gangs' activities which were both sophisticated and on a commercial scale, with them using a network of highly trusted individuals and a fleet of vehicles with hidden compartments," he said.</p>

<p>"We believe they were responsible for importing hundreds of kilos of cocaine, estimated to be over a tonne, resulting in them making huge sums of cash, thought to be over GBP 10 million," he added.</p>

<p>Some of the illegal cash recovered by West Midlands ROCU was found stashed in vehicle tyres and industrial machinery inside vans disguised as mechanical service vehicles. The police also recovered 225kg of cocaine destined for export to Australia that had been stored at a warehouse in Sutton Coldfield, in the West Midlands region of England.</p>

<p>"But all this enterprise was illegal and was putting large quantities of drugs, which we know destroy many lives and blight many communities, onto the streets both here in the UK and overseas. Our teams were able to trace the activity, identify the criminals and ultimately put them behind bars with considerable jail terms," DCI Cooke added.</p>

<p>The gang communicated with each other using the Encrochat platform, an encrypted messaging app that criminals believed couldn't be accessed by law enforcers. It has since been shut down by investigators as part of a major UK-wide operation.</p>

<p>These messages discussed the logistics, management and delivery of up to a tonne of cocaine and large amounts of criminal cash being collected or delivered in the UK.</p>

<p>Dosanjh and Rishi were the first to be arrested with over 150kg of cocaine hidden in frozen chicken produce when police officers in Birmingham stopped the van they were in coming back from docks in Essex. Others in the gang were arrested after one of the gangsters collected wheels and tyres in the West Midlands before driving to London, where they were passed to another gangster in a residential street. When the tyres were cut open, they were found to contain around GBP 500,000 in cash. On another occasion, just over GBP 1 million cash was recovered from a concealed compartment of an air compressor in another of the gang's vans stopped by officers.</p>

<p>The 10 men, who lived in Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Sandwell, Walsall, South Staffordshire and London, were all arrested within 10 days in July 2020. They went on to plead guilty to drug smuggling offences between March and August 2020, with their sentencing taking place on August 20 this year.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The boss of social media platform Telegram has been arrested in France, accused of allowing the sharing of illegal content.</p>

<p>The Russia-founded messaging platform has stayed out of the limelight in the West but has hundreds of millions of users across the world, and plays a key role in the Ukraine war.</p>

<h3><strong>Libertarian leanings</strong></h3>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-is-pavel-durov-telegram-ceo-arrested-in-france-6412272">Pavel Durov</a>, arrested after landing on his private jet in Paris on Saturday, launched the platform in 2013 with his brother Nikolai.</p>

<p>It claims to have 950 million users -- up from 550 million in 2022.</p>

<p>Durov told right-wing American journalist Tucker Carlson in April that users "love the privacy, the freedom" of the platform.</p>

<p>Telegram has made great play out of refusing to hand over or sell user data, distinguishing itself from the business models of US rivals like Meta or Google.</p>

<p>In Russia and Ukraine, some of its news channels are more popular than traditional media.</p>

<p>But the platform has long been criticised for failing to moderate extreme content.</p>

<p>Durov, who has a net worth of $15.5 billion according to Forbes, told the Financial Times in March he planned to improve the moderation mechanisms.</p>

<p>But "unless they cross red lines, I don't think that we should be policing people in the way they express themselves," he said.</p>

<p>Howewer, he also said the firm only employs a few dozen people, which experts said may not be enough to provide a properly secure platform.</p>

<h3><strong>Russian origins</strong></h3>

<p>The 39-year-old made a name for himself in 2006 when he launched the social network VKontakte (VK) shortly after graduating from St Petersburg State University.</p>

<p>Millions joined up and it quickly became known as "Russia's Facebook", its popularity piquing the interest of the Kremlin.</p>

<p>He said he had to fend off demands from the Russian security services to hand over details of opposition groups using VK to organise.</p>

<p>And later he came under huge pressure to hand over the personal data of pro-European activists in Ukraine.</p>

<p>These experiences led to him forming Telegram, and eventually selling his stake in VK in 2014 and leaving Russia.</p>

<p>By 2017, he set up in Dubai, keeping at arm's length from tougher regulatory regimes in the European Union and the United States.</p>

<p>Durov has citizenship of the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts and Nevis as well as French nationality, which he picked up in 2021.</p>

<h3><strong>Legal troubles</strong></h3>

<p>French prosecutors accuse Telegram of failing to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/telegram-chief-pavel-durov-arrested-at-french-airport-report-6411921">moderate content</a> or collaborate with the authorities.</p>

<p>They have highlighted content involving fraud, drug trafficking, organised crime, glorification of terrorism and cyberbullying.</p>

<p>The firm has said it cannot be held responsible for what its users do -- a defence long used by big tech platforms.</p>

<p>Several countries have tried to block Telegram in the past.</p>

<p>In 2018, Iran accused it of hosting violent opposition groups.</p>

<p>In the same year, Russia said it had failed to hand over encryption keys.</p>

<p>Last year, Brazil blocked it briefly for failing to provide data on neo-Nazi groups and Spain acted over intellectual property violations.</p>

<h3><strong>No profits yet</strong></h3>

<p>Telegram was fully funded by Durov until 2018, when it raised $1.7 billion to launch its own cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>The crypto project collapsed after US regulators refused to approve it, and the company reimbursed most of the investment.</p>

<p>The messaging service began running ads in 2021 but insisted it would not use users' private data for targeting.</p>

<p>A premium subscription system followed in 2022.</p>

<p>Durov told the Financial Times his company was generating hundreds of millions in revenue and hoped to turn a profit soon.</p>

<p>He also did not rule out floating on the stock exchange.</p>

<p>Though he has repeatedly stated his mission is not about getting rich.</p>

<p>"For me everything in my life was about becoming free," he told Carlson, saying Telegram was about allowing others to express their liberty.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[France held the Russian-born founder of Telegram Pavel Durov in custody for a second day of questioning on Monday over alleged offences related to the popular but controversial messaging app, which insisted he had "nothing to hide".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>France held the Russian-born founder of Telegram <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-is-pavel-durov-telegram-ceo-arrested-in-france-6412272">Pavel Durov</a>&nbsp;in custody for a second day of questioning on Monday over alleged offences related to the popular but controversial messaging app, which insisted he had "nothing to hide".</p>

<p>His arrest after flying into the Le Bourget airport outside Paris late Saturday is the latest extraordinary twist in the career of one of the world's most influential tech icons.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pavel-durov-arrest-explained-the-case-against-telegram-ceo-that-got-him-arrested-in-france-6412839">detention of Durov</a>, 39, was <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/france-extends-detention-of-telegram-chief-pavel-durov-6417625">extended beyond Sunday night</a> by the investigating magistrate who is handling the case, according to a source close to the investigation. This initial period of detention for questioning can last up to a maximum of 96 hours.</p>

<p>When this phase of detention ends, the judge can then decide to free Durov, whose fortune is estimated by Forbes magazine at $15.5 billion, or press charges and remand him in further custody.</p>

<p>Russia has accused France of "refusing to cooperate" while fellow tech mogul <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/zuckerberg-should-be-arrested-for-massive-child-exploitation-on-instagram-musk-6415730">Elon Musk</a> swept to Durov's defence and called for his release. Durov holds a French passport in addition to other nationalities.</p>

<p>Durov had arrived in Paris from Baku, Azerbaijan, and was planning to have dinner in the French capital, a source close to the case said.</p>

<p>He was accompanied by a bodyguard and a personal assistant who always accompany him, added the source, asking not to be named.</p>

<p>France's OFMIN, an office tasked with preventing violence against minors, had issued an arrest warrant for Durov in a preliminary investigation into alleged offences including fraud, drug trafficking, cyberbullying, organised crime and promotion of terrorism, another source said.</p>

<p>Durov is accused of failing to take action to curb the criminal use of his platform.</p>

<p>Telegram said in response that "Durov has nothing to hide and travels frequently in Europe."</p>

<p>"Telegram abides by EU laws, including the Digital Services Act -- its moderation is within industry standards," it added. "It is absurd to claim that a platform or its owner are responsible for abuse of that platform."</p>

<h3><strong>'Assault on basic human rights'</strong></h3>

<p>Durov founded Telegram in 2013 after his first project, the Russian social network VKontakte (VK), ran into ownership difficulties he blamed on the Kremlin. He left Russia in 2014.</p>

<p>Telegram has become hugely popular partly due to the ease of viewing and posting videos on its messaging "channels".</p>

<p>But critics accuse it of hosting often illegal content ranging from extreme sexual imagery, disinformation and also services for buying drugs.</p>

<p>Russia's embassy to Paris said it had demanded access to Durov but had had no response from France, saying "the French side is refusing to cooperate".</p>

<p>Musk, who leads the Tesla car group and the X social media platform, formerly Twitter, posted the hashtag #FreePavel on X and commented in French, "Liberte Liberte! Liberte?" (Freedom Freedom! Freedom?).</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="qme"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FreePavel?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FreePavel</a><br />

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1827572720936030703?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 25, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>US whistleblower Edward Snowden, who took asylum in Russia, blasted "an assault on the basic human rights of speech and association", saying he was saddened Paris had "descended to the level of taking hostages as a means for gaining access to private communications."</p>

<h3><strong>'Express their freedoms'</strong></h3>

<p>One of the key questions is why Durov flew into France when he would have likely been aware he was wanted in the country. "Perhaps he had a feeling of impunity," said a source close to the case, asking not to be named.</p>

<p>Telegram, an encrypted messaging app based in Dubai, has positioned itself as a "neutral" alternative to US-owned platforms, which have been criticised for their commercial exploitation of users' personal data.</p>

<p>It also plays a key role in the war between Ukraine and Russia after Moscow's invasion of its neighbour.</p>

<p>The app is used by Kyiv including President Volodymyr Zelensky in regular video statements to push Ukraine's message across but also by the so-called Russian "Z-bloggers" who strongly back the war and report from the front.</p>

<p>In a rare interview given to right-wing talk show host Tucker Carlson in April, Durov predicted Telegram would have one billion users next year and insisted that despite his wealth his priority was to be "free".</p>

<p>"My mission in life was to allow other people to also become free... and using the platforms that we created my hope was that they could express their freedoms. This is the mission of Telegram."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A knife attack at a street festival in western Germany killed three people on Friday.</p>

<p>A Syrian man has been detained on suspicion of carrying out the rampage on behalf of the Islamic State (IS) group.</p>

<h3><strong>Here is what we know:</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>Festival attacked</strong></h3>

<p>The attack took place at around 9:40 pm (1940 GMT) on the Fronhof, a busy square in Solingen city centre. Stages and various attractions had been set up as part of celebrations to mark the city's 650th anniversary.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/syrian-man-confesses-to-killing-3-in-germany-stabbing-attack-6415186" target="_blank">attacker</a> struck in front of one of the stages during a concert by the group Suzan Koecher's Suprafon, aiming for the victims' necks, according to police. He then fled the scene.</p>

<p>A witness told the local daily Solinger Tageblatt that he was just a few metres away and "understood from the expression on the singer's face that something was wrong".</p>

<p>"And then, a metre away from me, a person fell," the witness, Lars Breitzke, said.</p>

<p>When he turned around, he saw other people lying on the ground amid pools of blood, he added.</p>

<p>Two men aged 56 and 67 and a 56-year-old woman were <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/3-killed-in-knife-attack-during-street-festival-in-germany-6408590" target="_blank">killed in the attack</a> and eight people were wounded, four of them seriously.</p>

<h3><strong>Islamic State claim</strong></h3>

<p>On Saturday evening, the IS group said in a statement that one of its members had carried out the attack in "revenge" for Muslims "in Palestine and everywhere".</p>

<p>"The perpetrator of the attack on a gathering of Christians in the city of Solingen in Germany yesterday was a soldier of the Islamic State," the statement from the jihadists' Amaq news agency said on the Telegram messaging app.</p>

<p>Anti-terrorism prosecutors in Germany have taken over the investigation.</p>

<h3><strong>Suspect confesses</strong></h3>

<p>Police said on Sunday that a 26-year-old <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/suspected-german-festival-stabber-who-killed-3-arrested-6411953" target="_blank">Syrian </a>had turned himself in to the authorities and confessed to carrying out the attack.</p>

<p>The suspect, named as Issa Al H., managed to escape amid the panic and threw his knife into a bin, according to details published by the Bild daily that have not been confirmed by investigators.</p>

<p>Police have seized the knife as well as the suspect's "blood-stained" jacket, which still contained his wallet and identity papers, Bild reported.</p>

<p>After the attack, the suspect reportedly took cover in a courtyard around the corner from the home for refugees where he had been living in the city centre.</p>

<p>He was found there during a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/police-search-for-assailant-after-3-killed-in-germany-stabbing-incident-6406755" target="_blank">police patrol</a> in the pouring rain just before midnight on Saturday, Bild said.</p>

<p>Issa Al H. arrived in Germany in December 2022 and had a protected immigration status often given to those fleeing war-torn Syria, according to Bild and other news outlets.</p>

<p>He was meant to have been deported to Bulgaria, where he had first arrived in the European Union, but the operation failed after he went missing.</p>

<p>He was not known to the security services as an extremist considered dangerous.</p>

<p>Police also arrested a 15-year-old after witnesses allegedly saw him discussing the attack with a man who could have been the perpetrator shortly before it happened.</p>

<h3><strong>High alert</strong></h3>

<p>German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser warned earlier this month that "the threat posed by Islamist terrorism remains high" in Germany.</p>

<p>The biggest danger is thought to be posed by Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K), the same group believed to have been behind March's deadly massacre in a Moscow concert hall.</p>

<p>The number of people considered Islamist extremists in Germany fell slightly from 27,480 in 2022 to 27,200 last year, according to a report from the federal domestic intelligence agency.</p>

<p>Islamist extremists have carried out <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/3-german-teenagers-detained-for-planning-isis-like-attack-5425532" target="_blank">several attacks</a> in Germany in recent years, the deadliest being a truck rampage at a Berlin Christmas market in December 2016 that killed 12 people.</p>

<p>More recently, an Islamist motive is suspected in the killing of a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/germany-stabbing-german-cop-stabbed-at-anti-islam-rally-dies-police-5803947" target="_blank">police officer</a> in a knife attack on the market square in the city of Mannheim in late May.</p>

<p>In January, police arrested three people over an alleged attack plot targeting the cathedral in Cologne on New Year's Eve.</p>

<p>In July, German authorities raided and banned the Hamburg Islamic Centre, an association that the interior ministry described as an "Islamist extremist organisation pursuing anti-constitutional objectives".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The US has deployed its new long-range air-to-air missile that could potentially disrupt the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific in the US-China 'Cold War'.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US has deployed its new long-range air-to-air missile that could potentially disrupt the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific in the US-China 'Cold War'. The AIM-174B missile, onboard the US Navy's F-18 Super Hornet, as seen in many pictures, is known to have an operational range of approximately 400 km.</p>

<p>The AIM-174B derivative of the Raytheon SM-6 surface-to-air missile operated out of US naval platforms. The SM-6 is a multi-role missile used for anti-air warfare, anti-ballistic missiles, and anti-surface warfare.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-08/j3fpu9q_aim174b-missile_625x300_26_August_24.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>The AIM-174B was reportedly first spotted during the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise, the world's largest naval exercise with 26 participants. The missile was attached to a hardpoint under the wings of the Super Hornet, garnering attention due to its potential to disrupt the balance of power in the air.</p>

<h3><strong>All About AIM-17B</strong></h3>

<p>Air Interceptor Missile (AIM)-174B is the air-to-air version of the SM-6 missile. It is readily available due to the existing production line for the SM-6 missile. The Raytheon SM-6 missile has a booster stage, which propels the missile into the air, followed by a solid rocket booster and sustainer motor of the missile work to hit the target.</p>

<p>The SM-6 weighs around 1,500 kilograms, while the AIM-174 weighs approximately 850 kg due to no booster motor. The US Navy's new missile has a speed of Mach 3.5, i.e. 3.5 times the speed of sound. The missile is considered to be a direct equivalent of the Russian Rh-37 Vympel long-range hypersonic air-to-air missile with a range of 400 km and the Chinese PL-15 long-range missile has a range of 300-350 km.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="The SM-6 missile is three missiles in one" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-08/vf4u7vu8_sm6-missile-_625x300_26_August_24.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="The SM-6 missile is three missiles in one" /></div>

<p>China PLA Navy has reportedly deployed an advanced version of PL-15, the PL-17 missile, with a range of 400 km. The last dedicated long-range air-to-air missile the US Navy had was the AIM-54 Phoenix for the F-14 Tomcat. The fighter jet and the missile were out of service in 2004.</p>

<p>During the Cold War, the US Navy's doctrine used long-range AIM-54 Phoenix to defeat Russian air threats before they could come closer to carrier battle groups. After the USSR broke up and the Russian Navy's strength fell, the US Navy stopped investing in such missiles and retired the AIM-54 Phoenix. Today, the development of the AIM-174B over 30 years after the Soviet Union broke proves the US Navy is once again returning to its Cold War naval doctrine, with China replacing Russia as the main maritime threat.</p>

<h3><strong>Why air-to-air missiles in the age of stealth fighters?</strong></h3>

<p>The US and China are extensively building new generation stealth fighter jets that can evade enemy radars by going undetected and striking inside their territory. The US began with the F-117 Nighthawk fighter bomber, then the F-22 Raptor and now the F-35, the most advanced fighter jet in the world.</p>

<p>China is not behind with its Chengdu J-20 fifth-generation stealth fighter jet.</p>

<p>When stealth fighters can avoid detection, then why are nations focusing on long-range air-to-air missiles? The answer is fear. China developed the PL-15 long-range missile, which can be deployed on the J-20, meaning, now a stealth fighter can strike targets from far away without getting detected. Recently, the PL-17 was deployed on its J-16 fourth-generation fighter. China's move shifted the balance of power in the air in the volatile region of East Asia.</p>

<p>A stealthy Chinese aircraft could theoretically spot non-stealthy U.S. aircraft and shoot them down well outside the range where they could even fight back, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-navys-newest-air-to-air-missile-could-tilt-balance-in-south-china-sea-6336606">Reuters reported</a>, quoting Kelly Grieco, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center.</p>

<p>Even US stealth aircraft might be forced to fly dangerously close to fire their missiles. "If a Chinese fighter can outrange an American fighter, it means they can get the first shot," she said. "It's hard to outrun something that's travelling at Mach 4."</p>

<p>The AIM-174B was quickly developed to address this need. Now, US fighter jets can target Chinese military installations from long range, avoiding the danger of flying close to the targets.</p>

<p>Justin Bronk, an airpower and technology expert at London's Royal United Services Institute, told Reuters that China is developing long-range missiles, but the radar of launching aircraft may not be able to spot targets at such distances. "If you go too big and too heavy on missiles, then you end up trading off fuel," he said.</p>

<p>An Airborne Warning and Control (AWAC) aircraft acts as an aerial command centre during combat, and combat patrol missions. These aircraft detect the enemy from long range. The new missiles will be tasked to strike high-value targets like the AWACs as well.</p>

<h3><strong>The Island Chains</strong></h3>

<p>A potential direct military face-off between the US and China could happen near the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2015/07/americas-security-role-in-the-south-china-sea?lang=en" rel="no follow, no index">South China Sea</a>, a major transit route for maritime trade and the US Navy. China has threatened Taiwan with a military invasion and in the event of a full-blown Chinese assault, the US is bound by law to defend Taiwan.</p>

<p>The Taiwan Relations Act mandates that the US have a policy to provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character".</p>

<p>American Foreign Policy statesman John Foster Dulles presented the Island Chain Strategy to keep a check on USSR and Chinese expansion by establishing military bases on the West Pacific. The USSR collapsed in 1991, but the Chinese economic and military expansion made the strategy important.</p>

<p>It works on several lines of defence for the US to stop any military invasion. The strategy has its roots in World War II when Imperial Japan took over most of East Asia and attacked Pearl Harbour, effectively bringing the US to the war.</p>

<p>Any military conflict around the South China Sea will fall within the First Island Chain, which comprises the Kuril Island, claimed by Japan but under Russian control, the Japanese archipelago, Taiwan, the north Philippines, and Borneo.</p>

<p>The First Island Chain is an important geopolitically important boundary for the US area with vast amounts of natural resources and economic significance. Any conflict would mean the US operating close to China.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="The First Island Chain is the first line of defence for the US" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-08/djs875lo_first-island-chain_625x300_26_August_24.jpeg?im=FitAndFill,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="The First Island Chain is the first line of defence for the US" /></div>

</div>

<p>The US would come even closer to China if Beijing invaded Taiwan. An AIM-174B missile would keep its aircraft carriers and fighter jets at a safer distance and put PLA hunting ships and aircraft carriers out of range. Reuters reported quoting a Taiwan-based strategist that this would increase the likelihood of the US directly getting involved in a military conflict with China over Taiwan.</p>

<p>The game-changer missile would push the US further into the South China Sea region therefore titling the equation, which as of now remains in China's favour.</p>

<h3><strong>India And Its Air-to-Air Missile Arsenal</strong></h3>

<p>India has developed the<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.drdo.gov.in/drdo/technology-cluster-links/labs-products-detail/2093/182" rel="no follow, no index"> Astra Mk1</a> beyond visual range air-to-air missile that is operational and mounted on the Su-30MKI fighter jet. The Astra Mk1 has a speed of Mach 4.5 with a range of 100 kilometres. The Astra Mk2 and Mk3 are under trial but are far behind what the US and China have.</p>

<p>The use of extremely long-range BVR missiles is based on the requirements of the Indian Air Force or Indian Navy unlike the US and China. The Astra Mk1 is operational on Su-30MKI so at present only the IAF operates the missile but later it will be developed for other aircraft too. The primary long-range air-to-air missile in service with the Indian Air Force is the Meteor on the Rafale fighter jets, which is widely considered the most advanced air-to-air missile in the world.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan scrambled fighter jets after a Chinese military aircraft "violated" Japanese airspace, the defence ministry said Monday.</p>

<p>A Chinese aircraft was "confirmed to have violated the territorial airspace off the Danjo Islands in Nagasaki Prefecture," the ministry said in a statement, adding it had launched "fighter jets on an emergency basis".</p>

<p>The "Y-9 intelligence-gathering" aircraft entered Japanese airspace at 11:29 am (0229 GMT) for around two minutes, the ministry added.</p>

<p>Local media including public broadcaster NHK said the incident marked the first incursion by the Chinese military's aircraft into Japan's airspace.</p>

<p>Japanese and Chinese vessels have previously been involved in tense incidents in disputed areas, in particular the Senkaku islands in the East China Sea, known by Beijing as the Diaoyus.</p>

<p>The remote chain of islands have fuelled diplomatic tensions and been the scene of confrontations between Japanese coastguard vessels and Chinese fishing boats.</p>

<p>Beijing has grown more assertive about its claim to the islands in recent years, with Tokyo reporting the presence of Chinese coast guard vessels, a naval ship and even a nuclear-powered submarine.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>He said a Russian barrage hit Ukraine Monday with more than 100 missiles and around 100 drones, including in several western regions neighbouring or near European countries.</p>

<p>"In our various regions of Ukraine, we could do much more to protect lives if the aviation of our European neighbours worked together with our F-16s and together with our air defence," Zelensky said in a post on social media.</p>

<p>Earlier in July, Elon Musk announced that Tesla would bring a 50,000 GPU cluster online, doubling down on its Dojo custom AI chip supercomputer. The cluster will increase Tesla's capabilities to scale full-scale driving FSD and other AI initiatives.</p>

<p>Mr Musk also addressed internal Nvidia emails revealing plans to ship thousands of GPUs reserved for Tesla to his private ventures X and xAI. He stated that the GPUs were needed to fill Tesla's data centres and would be used to support Tesla's AI initiatives.</p>

<p>Tesla's CFO, Vaibhav Taneja, mentioned that the company still expects capital expenditures to pass $10 billion despite a dip in Q2 capex, as per a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/elon-musk-tesla-to-bring-50000-gpu-cluster-online-doubling-down-on-dojo-supercomputer/">DataCentreDynamics</a>. Mr Musk also launched a poll asking users whether Tesla should invest $5 billion in his AI startup xAI.</p>

<p>The announcements come as Tesla reported second-quarter earnings that missed expectations, with a decline in revenue and profits. However, Elon Musk remains committed to advancing Tesla's AI capabilities, stating that the company has "no choice" but to make Dojo work due to the high demand for Nvidia GPUs. Mr Musk aims to make Dojo a success, with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1815850297895576040">8,000 H100-equivalent training online</a> by year-end.</p>

<p>Mr Musk's xAI aims to release Grok 2 in August and work on Grok 3, which will rival OpenAI's GPT-5.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Earlier, Saratov Region Governor Roman Busargin said that debris from destroyed drones had hit residential buildings in Saratov and neighbouring Engels, adding that one woman was hospitalised in serious condition.</p>

<p>The 9/11 attacks occurred on September 11, 2001, when the World Trade Centre in Lower Manhattan, New York City, was destroyed in a devastating terrorist attack. These were four coordinated Islamist terrorist suicide attacks carried out by al-Qaeda against the United States.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran does not seek to increase Middle East tensions, Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told his Italian counterpart Antonio Tajani, adding that its response to the killing of the Hamas chief in Tehran would be "definite and calculated".</p>

<p>Iran blames Israel for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, which Araqchi was quoted by Iran's state media as saying was "an unforgivable violation of Iran's security and sovereignty".</p>

<p>Israel has neither claimed nor denied responsibility for Haniyeh's death in the Iranian capital.</p>

<p>"Iran does not seek to increase tensions. However it is not afraid of it," Araqchi told his Italian counterpart on the phone, according to a statement about the phone call published on Monday by Iran's foreign ministry.</p>

<p>Araqchi said that Iran's response would be "definite, calculated and accurate", according to the statement.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

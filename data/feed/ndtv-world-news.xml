       <description><![CDATA[Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus returned to Bangladesh Thursday to lead a caretaker government after a student-led uprising ended the 15-year rule of Sheikh Hasina.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus returned to Bangladesh Thursday to lead a caretaker government after a student-led uprising ended the 15-year rule of Sheikh Hasina.</p>

<p>Yunus touched down in Dhaka on a flight from Paris via Dubai shortly after 2:00 pm (0800 GMT) and could be sworn in as the country's new leader as soon as Thursday evening to begin what the army chief has vowed will be a "beautiful democratic process".</p>

<p>The prospect of Yunus, 84, standing alongside military leaders was almost unimaginable a week ago when security forces fired deadly rounds at protesters who took to the streets demanding that Hasina resign.</p>

<p>But the military turned on Hasina at the weekend and she was forced to flee to neighbouring India -- as millions of Bangladeshis celebrated her demise.</p>

<p>The military then agreed to student demands that Yunus -- who won the Nobel in 2006 for his pioneering microfinancing work -- lead an interim government.</p>

<p>"I'm looking forward to going back home, see what's happening and how we can organise ourselves to get out of the trouble we are in," Yunus told reporters in Paris as he left for Dhaka.</p>

<h3><strong>'Get ready'</strong></h3>

<p>The veteran academic had travelled abroad this year while on bail after being sentenced to six months in jail on a charge condemned as politically motivated, and which a Dhaka court on Wednesday acquitted him of.</p>

<p>Yunus was hit with more than 100 criminal cases and a smear campaign by a state-led Islamic agency that accused him of promoting homosexuality, with courts accused of rubber-stamping decisions by ousted Hasina's government.</p>

<p>Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman said he backed Yunus and hoped he would be sworn in to lead the interim government on Thursday evening.</p>

<p>"I am certain that he will be able to take us through a beautiful democratic process," Waker said.</p>

<p>Yunus said he wanted to hold elections "within a few" months.</p>

<h3><strong>'Seismic moment'</strong></h3>

<p>Few other details about the planned government have been released, including the role of the military.</p>

<p>But Bangladeshis voiced hope as they joined a rally in Dhaka on Wednesday for the former opposition Bangladesh National Party (BNP).</p>

<p>"I expect that a national government will be formed with everyone's consent in a beautiful way," Moynul Islam Pintu told AFP.</p>

<p>"I expect that the country is run in a nice way, and the police force is reformed so that they can't harass people."</p>

<p>Hasina, 76, who had been in power since 2009, quit on Monday as hundreds of thousands of people flooded the streets of Dhaka.</p>

<p>Jubilant crowds later looted her palace.</p>

<p>Monday's events were the culmination of more than a month of unrest, which began as protests against a plan for quotas in government jobs but morphed into an anti-Hasina movement.</p>

<p>Hasina, who was accused of rigging the January elections and widespread human rights abuses, deployed security forces to quash the protests.</p>

<p>At least 455 people were killed in the unrest, according to an AFP tally based on police, government officials and hospital doctors.</p>

<p>"The protests are a seismic moment in Bangladesh history," said International Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean.</p>

<p>"The country really had been at risk of becoming a one-party state, and through a peaceful street-based movement led by, Gen Z students in their 20s, they've managed to force her from power."</p>

<h3><strong>Military move</strong></h3>

<p>The military's switching of allegiance was the decisive factor in her demise.</p>

<p>It has since acceded to a range of other demands from the student leaders.</p>

<p>The president dissolved parliament on Tuesday, a key demand of the students and the BNP.</p>

<p>The head of the police force, which protesters have blamed for leading Hasina's crackdown, was sacked on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The new chief, Mainul Islam, offered an apology on Wednesday for the conduct of officers and vowed a "fair and impartial investigation" into the killings of "students, common people and the police".</p>

<p>Ex-prime minister and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, 78, was also released from years of house arrest, while some political prisoners were freed.</p>

<p>The military has demoted some generals seen as close to Hasina and sacked Ziaul Ahsan, a commander of the feared Rapid Action Battalion paramilitary force.</p>

<p>Police said mobs had launched revenge attacks on officers and Hasina's allies, and also freed more than 500 inmates from a prison.</p>

<p>Protesters broke into parliament and torched TV stations. Others smashed statues of Hasina's father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country's independence hero.</p>

<p>Since Tuesday, however, streets in the capital have been largely peaceful.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus on Thursday paid tribute to those killed in Bangladesh's deadly protests that toppled Sheikh Hasina's government, saying their sacrifices had brought the nation a "second independence".</p>

<p>"Today is a glorious day for us," he told reporters at the airport in Dhaka shortly after returning to the country to lead a caretaker government.</p>

<p>"Bangladesh has created a new victory day. Bangladesh has got a second independence."</p>

<p>Yunus called for the restoration of order after weeks of violence that left at least 455 people dead, calling on citizens to guard each other, including minorities who came under attack.</p>

<p>"Law and order is our first task... We cannot take a step forward unless we fix the law and order situation," he said.</p>

<p>"My call to the people is; if you have trust in me, then make sure there will be no attacks against anyone, anywhere in the country."</p>

<p>Yunus, 84, could be sworn in as the country's new leader as soon as Thursday evening.</p>

<p>"Every person is our brother... our task is to protect them," he said, adding that "the whole of Bangladesh is one big family".</p>

<p>He choked with emotion as he recalled the killing of student activist Abu Sayeed, shot dead in July by police from close range.</p>

<p>He paid tribute to the youth who sparked the protest movement and those who risked all for their desire for change.</p>

<p>"They protected the nation and gave it a new life", he said. "Because of them, Bangladesh has got a second independence."</p>

<p>The prospect of Yunus standing alongside military leaders was almost unimaginable a week ago, when security forces fired deadly rounds at protesters who took to the streets demanding Hasina step down.</p>

<p>The veteran economist also said it must be the young generation who build the nation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Bangladesh can be a beautiful country, but we destroyed the possibilities," he said.</p>

<p>"Now we have to build a seedbed again -- the new seedbed will be built by them," he said, gesturing to the young student supporters surrounding him at the podium as he spoke.</p>

<p>"We can move forward in building a new Bangladesh very quickly", he said, dressed in a knee-length purple kurta shirt and white waistcoat, adding with a smile: "We have started today."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Tens of thousands of North Koreans have fled to South Korea since the peninsula was divided by war in the 1950s, with most going overland to neighbouring China first, then entering a third country such as Thailand before entering South Korea.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A North Korean has defected to the South across the de facto maritime border known as the Northern Limit Line, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported Thursday.</p>

<p>"1 N. Korean defects across maritime border in Yellow Sea: military," the agency said in a one-line report.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of North Koreans have fled to South Korea since the peninsula was divided by war in the 1950s, with most going overland to neighbouring China first, then entering a third country such as Thailand before finally making it to the South.</p>

<p>The number of successful escapes dropped significantly from 2020 after the North sealed its borders -- purportedly with shoot-on-sight orders along the land frontier with China -- to prevent the spread of Covid-19.</p>

<p>But the number of defectors making it to the South tripled last year to 196, Seoul said in January, with more elite diplomats and students seeking to escape, up from 67 in 2022.</p>

<p>South Korean local media reported Thursday that two North Koreans attempted to defect to the South through the border island of Gyodong, less than five kilometres (3.1 miles) from North Korea, and the South Korean military has only secured one of them.</p>

<p>The report comes days after North Korean state media said the country had deployed 250 ballistic missile launchers to its southern border, with leader Kim Jong Un describing the weapons as a "powerful treasured sword" to defend its sovereignty.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Pyongyang conducted live-fire artillery drills near South Korea's Yeonpyeong and another border island, prompting counter-drills, heightened security and evacuation orders for residents.</p>

<p>Relations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, with the North ramping up weapons testing and bombarding the South with trash-carrying balloons.</p>

<p>South Korea has responded by resuming propaganda broadcasts along the border, suspending a tension-reducing military deal and restarting live-fire drills near the border.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian prosecutors have requested a 15-year prison sentence for a dual US-Russian national charged with "treason" for making a donation to a pro-Ukraine organisation.</p>

<p>Ksenia Karelina, who lives in the United States, was arrested in February while visiting family in Russia, accused of providing financial assistance to the Ukrainian army.</p>

<p>"The prosecution requested a sentence of 15 years imprisonment in a general regime penal colony," Russian state-run news agencies quoted Karelina's lawyer, Mikhail Mushailov, as saying Thursday.</p>

<p>She donated around $50 to a US-based pro-Ukraine charity after Russia launched its full-scale military offensive in 2022, US media reported, citing her family and employer.</p>

<p>Russia's FSB security service accused her of collecting money that was "used to purchase tactical medical supplies, equipment, weapons and ammunition for the Ukrainian armed forces."</p>

<p>Russian state media reported she pleaded guilty in a court hearing in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The verdict will be delivered next Thursday, the court's press service told AFP.</p>

<p>Moscow has launched dozens of criminal cases against Russian citizens it accuses of supporting or collaborating with Kyiv.</p>

<p>Karelina, in her early 30s, is just one of a string of US citizens and dual nationals that have also been targeted.</p>

<p>Last week Russia released three of them -- journalists Evan Gershkovich and Alsu Kurmasheva, as well as ex-marine Paul Whelan -- in the largest East-West prisoner swap since the Cold War.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 19-year-old Austrian terrorism suspect had taken concrete steps in planning an attack on a Taylor Swift concert, with chemical substances found during a search of his residence, Austria's general director for public security said.</p>

<p>The teenager, with North Macedonian roots, is considered the main suspect, working closely with a 17-year-old Austrian, general director for public security Frankz Ruf told ORF radio.</p>

<p>The two males are part of a small group police are looking into, said Ruf, adding that the 19-year-old had pledged allegiance to the radical Islamic State group.</p>

<p>"We are of course investigating their wider surroundings," said Ruf, adding that the threat was minimized with the arrests.</p>

<p>Swift's three concerts in Vienna, expected to draw 195,000 people, were cancelled late on Wednesday after the government flagged a planned attack. Police had detained three people suspected of plotting attacks on concerts.</p>

<p>Searches of the main suspect's house in the town of Ternitz near the Hungarian border showed "concrete preparatory actions," said Ruf, with chemical substances and technical devices seized.</p>

<p>The Kurier newspaper, citing sources familiar with the situation, reported that the suspect had stolen the chemicals from his workplace and had built a bomb.</p>

<p>The newspaper reported that the 19-year-old had planned to drive a car into the crowd expected to gather outside the stadium, and had also considered using machetes and knives.</p>

<p>Austria's interior ministry and intelligence service were not immediately available for comment on the report's details.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[This summer, the robotic printer from ICON is finishing the last few of 100 3D-printed houses in Wolf Ranch, a community in Georgetown, Texas, about 30 miles from Austin.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As with any desktop 3D printer, the Vulcan printer pipes layer by layer to build an object - except this printer is more than 45 feet (13.7 m) wide, weighs 4.75 tons and prints residential homes.</p>

<p>This summer, the robotic printer from ICON is finishing the last few of 100 3D-printed houses in Wolf Ranch, a community in Georgetown, Texas, about 30 miles from Austin.</p>

<p>ICON began printing the walls of what it says is the world's largest 3D-printed community in November 2022. Compared to traditional construction, the company says that 3D printing homes is faster, less expensive, requires fewer workers, and minimizes construction material waste.</p>

<p>"It brings a lot of efficiency to the trade market," said ICON senior project manager Conner Jenkins. "So, where there were maybe five different crews coming in to build a wall system, we now have one crew and one robot."</p>

<p>After concrete powder, water, sand and other additives are mixed together and pumped into the printer, a nozzle squeezes out the concrete mixture like toothpaste onto a brush, building up layer by layer along a pre-programmed path that creates corduroy-effect walls.</p>

<p>The single-story three- to four-bedroom homes take about three weeks to finish printing, with the foundation and metal roofs installed traditionally.</p>

<p>Jenkins said the concrete walls are designed to be resistant to water, mold, termites and extreme weather.</p>

<p>Lawrence Nourzad, a 32-year-old business development director, and his girlfriend Angela Hontas, a 29-year-old creative strategist, purchased a Wolf Ranch home earlier this summer.</p>

<p>"It feels like a fortress," Nourzad said, adding that he was confident it would be resilient to most tornados.</p>

<p>The walls also provide strong insulation from the Texas heat, the couple said, keeping the interior temperature cool even when the air conditioner wasn't on full blast.</p>

<p>There was one other thing the 3D-printed walls seemed to protect against, however: a solid wireless internet connection.</p>

<p>"Obviously these are really strong, thick walls. And that's what provides a lot of value for us as homeowners and keeps this thing really well-insulated in a Texas summer, but signal doesn't transfer through these walls very well," Nourzad said.</p>

<p>To alleviate this issue, an ICON spokeswoman said most Wolf Ranch homeowners use mesh internet routers, which broadcast a signal from multiple units placed throughout a home, versus a traditional router which sends a signal from one device.</p>

<p>The 3D-printed homes at Wolf Ranch, called the "Genesis Collection" by developers, range in price from around $450,000 to close to $600,000. Developers said a little more than one quarter of the 100 homes have been sold.</p>

<p>ICON, which 3D-printed its first home in Austin in 2018, hopes to one day take its technology to the Moon. NASA, as part of its Artemis Moon exploration program, has contracted ICON to develop a construction system capable of building landing pads, shelters, and other structures on the lunar surface.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3><strong>Mpox Outbreak In Congo</strong></h3>

<p>Since the beginning of 2023, around 27,000 mpox cases have been reported in Congo, where the infection has killed over 1,100 people, most of them children, Reuters reported.</p>

<p>Another 50 cases were confirmed, while more were suspected in countries like Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, which did not report mpox cases earlier.</p>

<p>Mpox, also known as monkeypox, was detected in 10 African countries, including Congo, which has recorded over 96% of all cases and deaths, the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported last week.</p>

<p>The cases have jumped by 160% and deaths have increased by 19% in comparison with the same period last year.</p>

<p>On a call with media persons, Tedros noted that $1 million was released from the WHO contingency fund for "emergencies to support scale-up of the response and we plan to release more in the coming days".</p>

<p>He said the agency triggered the process for emergency use listing of Bavarian Nordic's Jynneos and KM Biologics LC16.</p>

<p>As per reports, the outbreak started with the spread of 'Clade I,' an endemic strain. However, a new variant, 'Clade Ib' now appears to be spreading more fast through routine close contact.</p>

<h3><strong>Mpox Symptoms</strong></h3>

<p>The viral disease can be transmitted through physical contact with the infected person as well as animals or contaminated materials.</p>

<p>Some of its most common symptoms include skin rash or lesions, fever, muscle aches, headache, back pain as well as swollen lymph nodes.</p>

<p>It came to global prominence two years ago after mpox cases emerged worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic. Later on, it was declared a public health emergency of international concern in July 2022. It ended the following May.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dell Technologies Inc. is cutting jobs as part of a reorganization of its sales teams that includes a new group focused on artificial intelligence products and services.</p>

<p>"We are getting leaner," sales executives Bill Scannell and John Byrne wrote Monday in a memo to Dell employees. "We're streamlining layers of management and reprioritizing where we invest." In addition to the AI-focused team, the executives said the company will change how data center sales are approached.</p>

<p>The Texas-based hardware technology company has enjoyed a renaissance of investor interest over the past year due to its high-powered servers that can run AI workloads. Still, there is increasing unease about how long it may take companies to see a payoff from AI investments, which often come in the form of expensive servers or graphics processing units.</p>

<p>A spokesperson declined to comment on how many jobs would be affected. "Through a reorganization of our go-to-market teams and an ongoing series of actions, we are becoming a leaner company," the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>The shares increased 34% this year through Friday's close, though the stock had given back more than 40% of its value since hitting a record $179.21 on May 29.</p>

<p>Dell previously announced a major workforce reduction in early 2023, shedding 13,000 jobs in that fiscal year. As of February, it had about 120,000 full-time employees globally, Dell said in a regulatory filing that month.</p>

<p>The company's best-known business of selling personal computers has struggled in recent years amid a post-pandemic decline in that market. Still, computer industry shipments have begun to pick up, and Dell is optimistic that a new generation of AI-optimized PCs will fuel upgrades.</p>

<p>"We aim to grow faster than the market by seamlessly meeting our customers and partners online, virtually, or in person, to unlock the value of modern IT and AI for their organizations," the Dell executives wrote in the memo to employees.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Albanian jeweller Pirro Ruco laboured day and night for five years to capture the essence of his country in a spectacular luxury watch.</p>

<p>Now the timepiece, worth roughly $1.4 million, is set to face off against the best watches from across the world at the Geneva Watchmaking Grand Prix in November.</p>

<p>Set under a sapphire dome, the hours are marked by 12 golden folk dancers -- each in a different regional dress -- set on Murano glass, the minute and hour hands adorned with eagle talons in homage to Albania's national symbol.</p>

<p>Ruco's rollercoaster rise mirrors that of Albania, from poverty and isolation as the most closed communist regime in Europe to rollicking capitalism.</p>

<p>Along the way the jeweller overcame jealousy, the secret police and being sent into internal exile to rise to the pinnacle of his profession.</p>

<p>It all began for Pirro -- as he is known in his homeland -- in 1985 when he was asked to make a medal in red and gold bearing the head of Enver Hoxha, the paranoid dictator who ruled the small Balkan nation with an iron fist for more than four decades.</p>

<p>"That saved me," he told AFP from his workshop tucked away in an alley in the capital Tirana.</p>

<p>The medals were awarded to the regime's most loyal supporters and later caught the eye of Hoxha's wife.</p>

<p>The turn of fortune saw thousands more produced and worn by communist cadres across Albania.</p>

<p>"All the congressional delegates had to wear it. I made a name for myself with it," he said. It also saved him from the textile mills where he had been sent because his family had been deemed "rebellious".</p>

<h3><strong>'Priceless'</strong></h3>

<p>All this, however, was nearly derailed by an anonymous letter sent to authorities accusing Pirro of working with foreign agents.</p>

<p>He was questioned by intelligence agents and his workshop was raided.</p>

<p>Down but not out, he was able to bounce back after crafting a ring bearing the image of the late husband of a member of the communist politburo and in July 1990 won a prize for a piece featuring Albania's 15th-century national hero Skanderbeg.</p>

<p>But the very next day history intervened. The regime began to crumble and the collapse of Albania's communist rule in 1991 was followed by years of violent tumult as the country transitioned to a free-market economy.</p>

<p>Amid the ups and downs, Pirro stayed busy designing pieces for officials and celebrities.</p>

<p>During a trip to Basel in Switzerland in 2016, something new caught his eye.</p>

<p>"I wanted to make a watch. It was my new dream," he told AFP.</p>

<p>For the next five years, Pirro said he focused on "doing something special, Albanian, and at the same time completely new and never before seen in the watch industry."</p>

<p>The new timepiece which he calls Primordial Passion was designed in collaboration with the Swiss watchmaker Agenhor.</p>

<p>"I never wanted to make jewellery, but art," the jeweller said.</p>

<p>"Sculptures, images of the country, pieces of culture... This watch is the culmination of all that, of this love for Albania," he added.</p>

<p>"It is more than just a watch. It combines the rich heritage of ancient Albanian culture with the notion of chronometry."</p>

<p>Pirro refuses to divulge the methods used to craft the watch but remains hopeful the painstaking details will be recognised by the judges at the Grand Prix in Geneva.</p>

<p>Several collectors have already contacted him about buying the timepiece, he said, though it would be difficult to part with his creation.</p>

<p>"I set a price because I had to. But for me, it is priceless."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Microwave ovens harbour specialised communities of highly adapted microbes, according to a new study.</p>

<p>This finding is significant for hygiene and potential biotechnological applications, as the hardy bacteria inside microwave ovens could be utilised in industrial processes.</p>

<p>"Our results reveal that domestic microwaves have a more 'anthropised' microbiome, similar to kitchen surfaces, while laboratory microwaves harbour bacteria that are more resistant to radiation," said Daniel Torrent, a researcher at Darwin Bioprospecting Excellence SL in Paterna, Spain.</p>

<p>Torrent and colleagues sampled microbes from 30 microwave ovens: 10 from single-household kitchens, 10 from shared domestic spaces like corporate centers and cafeterias, and 10 from molecular biology and microbiology laboratories.</p>

<p>The aim was to assess how microbial communities are influenced by food interactions and user habits.</p>

<p>Using next-generation sequencing and cultivation of 101 strains on five different media, the researchers found 747 different genera within 25 bacterial phyla.</p>

<p>The most common phyla were Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria.</p>

<p>The diversity was lowest in single-household microwave ovens and highest in laboratory ones.</p>

<p>Bacteria such as Acinetobacter, Bhargavaea, Brevibacterium, and Rhizobium were found only in domestic microwaves, while Arthrobacter, Enterobacter, Janibacter, and Planococcus were exclusive to shared-domestic ones.</p>

<p>Nonomuraea bacteria were isolated only from laboratory microwaves, along with Delftia, Micrococcus, Deinococcus, and a genus of Cyanobacteria.</p>

<p>The microbial diversity in microwave ovens resembled that found on typical kitchen surfaces and solar panels, suggesting that the constant thermal shock, electromagnetic radiation, and desiccation select for highly resistant microbes in these environments.</p>

<p>"Some species of genera found in domestic microwaves, such as Klebsiella, Enterococcus, and Aeromonas, may pose a risk to human health. However, the microbial population in microwaves does not present a unique or increased risk compared to other common kitchen surfaces," said Torrent.</p>

<p>"For both the general public and laboratory personnel, we recommend regularly disinfecting microwaves with a diluted bleach solution or a commercially available disinfectant spray. It is also important to wipe down the interior surfaces with a damp cloth after each use to remove any residue and to clean up spills immediately to prevent the growth of bacteria," Torrent added.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Luana Alonso, a 20-year-old swimmer from Paraguay, was asked to leave the Olympic Village for allegedly creating an "inappropriate" environment.&nbsp;At the 2024 Paris&nbsp;Olympics, Alonso missed out on qualification for the women's 100m butterfly semi-final by a mere 0.24 seconds, reports said.<br />
<br />
"Her presence is creating an inappropriate atmosphere within Team Paraguay," read a statement from Paraguayan Olympic Committee boss Larissa Schaerer. Schaerer thanked her for proceeding as instructed and added that "it was of her own free will that she did not spend the night in the Athletes' Village." Her conduct left the country's Olympic leadership upset.</p>

<p>Earlier, she announced her retirement from the sport after failing to progress past the women's 100m butterfly heats event on July 27.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Who is Luana Alonso?</strong><br />
<br />
1. Born on September 19, 2004, Luana Alonso, a competitive swimmer from Paraguay, specialises in butterfly stroke events. She is the national record holder for Paraguay in the 100m butterfly event.<br />
<br />
2. Alonso is currently a student at the Southern Methodist University in the US Dallas. Before her time with the university's women's swimming and diving team, she was a part of Virginia Tech for one semester, US Weekly magazine reported.<br />
<br />
3. She came into the limelight after she first represented her country at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics at the age of 17. Back then, she finished in the 28th place and failed to advance to the semifinals.<br />
<br />
4. At the 2024 Paris Olympics, she made her second appearance but was eliminated in the heats after finishing sixth place. Prior to this, she also participated in the Youth Olympic Games, South American Games and the World Championships.<br />
<br />
5. Ahead of the Olympics, Ms Alonso is said to have expressed a desire to represent the United States at the 2024 Olympics. In a live stream on Instagram before the summer Olympics, she allegedly said she preferred the US over Paraguay.<br />
<br />
Multiple local media reported that Alonso spent time in Disneyland, instead of supporting her Paraguayan teammates.<br />
<br />
A report in The Daily Mail stated she had become a distraction to other competitors at the Olympic Games with her “skimpy clothing and socialising with other athletes.”<br />
<br />
On her behalf, Alonso, who has over 8,98,000 followers on Instagram, said the claims against her were untrue.<br />
<br />
“I just wanted to clarify that I was never kicked out or expelled from anywhere, please stop spreading false information,” she said in a statement on Monday. “I don't want to make any statement but I'm not going to let lies affect me either.”<br />
<br />
After she failed to qualify for the semifinals, Alonso said, "It was my last race. I am retiring from swimming."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two days back, Sheikh Hasina resigned as Bangladesh Prime Minister, fled capital Dhaka amid violent protests demanding her ouster and landed near Delhi. Since then, there has been speculation on where she is headed next. Right after her escape from Dhaka, some reports had claimed that the 76-year-old leader plans to seek asylum in the UK. But with London hesitating, the Awami League leader, it is learnt, is looking at other options.</p>

<p><strong>What Sheikh Hasina's Son Said</strong></p>

<p>In an interview to NDTV, Sheikh Hasina's son and Awami League leader Sajeeb Wazed Joy said reports claiming that his mother sought asylum in the UK are incorrect. "She has not requested asylum anywhere, so the question of the UK or US not responding yet is not true. My mother was planning to retire after this term anyway. She is done with politics in Bangladesh."</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina's daughter Saima Wazed is WHO's Regional Director for South-East Asia and lives in Delhi. But a Twitter post she put up suggests that she has not met Sheikh Hasina after her escape from Dhaka. "Heartbroken with the loss of life in my country that I love. So heartbroken that I cannot see and hug my mother during this difficult time. I remain committed to my role as RD @WHOSEARO@WHO#HealthForAll#OneWHO," she posted on X.</p>

<p><strong>What Has UK Said</strong></p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina's sister Sheikh Rehana is a UK citizen, and Rehana's daughter Tulip Siddiq is a Labour Party politician and a minister in the Keir Starmer government. Also, the UK has a record of giving refuge to several prominent figures of the subcontinent, including former Pakistan president Pervez Musharraf and former Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. So soon after she fled Dhaka, multiple reports predicted that she is headed to the UK.</p>

<p>But the UK Home Office told NDTV that British immigration rules do not allow individuals to travel to that country to seek asylum or temporary refuge. A spokesperson also said individuals seeking asylum must do so "in the first safe country they reach".</p>

<p>"The UK has a proud record of providing protection for people who need it. However, there is no provision for someone to be allowed to travel to the UK to seek asylum or temporary refuge," the Home office said.</p>

<p><strong>Is US An Option?</strong></p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina's son Joy is based in the US, but the chances of her moving there are slim after Washington DC and Dhaka's ties nosedived during her tenure. In fact, earlier this year, when Awami League stormed to victory in the Bangladesh election, the US State Department had said, "The United States remains concerned by the arrests of thousands of political opposition members and by reports of irregularities on elections day. The United States shares the view with other observers that these elections were not free or fair and we regret that not all parties participated."</p>

<p>While some reports say the US has cancelled Sheikh Hasina's visa after she resigned as Prime Minister, there has been no official confirmation and authorities have said visa records are confidential.</p>

<p>Earlier, after Sheikh Hasina fled the country, the US had said it stands with the people of Bangladesh. "We welcome the announcement of an interim government and urge any transition be conducted in accordance with Bangladesh's laws," State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller had said, flagging reports of human rights abuses, casualties, and injuries during the violent protests against the Awami League government.</p>

<p><strong>What About India?</strong></p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina has been in India since she landed here Monday. Addressing the Parliament on the Bangladesh situation, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said Sheikh Hasina had sought approval to come to India on a very short notice.</p>

<p>The government, according to reports, has told an all-party meeting that they have given time to the veteran politician to decide on her next move. Sheikh Hasina is in a state of shock and the government is giving her time to recover before it discusses these issues, sources have said.</p>

<p>New Delhi also faces a diplomatic dilemma here. It does not want to be seen as overtly backing the ousted leader because that may complicate its relationship with the new dispensation in Bangladesh,a a strategic partner geopolitically. At the same time, the history of Sheikh Hasina's relationship with India must also be kept in mind. Long before she became Prime Minister, the Indira Gandhi government had given her refuge after her whole family, including father Mujibur Rahaman, was assassinated during the 1975 unrest in Bangladesh. So abandoning her at this point will also not be an easy decision, considering her equations with Delhi.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican vice-presidential candidate and Ohio Senator JD Vance tried to confront Vice President Kamala Harris on the tarmac as their planes arrived at about the same time in Wisconsin.</p>

<p>The video captured by Reuters shows Vance approaching a press gaggle at the airport and said to have a closer look at Air Force Two. He said that Kamala Harris does not respond to reporters.</p>

<p>Speaking to reporters, he said, "I figured I'd come by and just get a good look at the plane because hopefully, it's going to be my plane in a few months."</p>

<p>"But I also thought you guys might get lonely because the Vice President doesn't answer questions from reporters and hasn't for 17 days," he added. "Have they given you guys an explanation for why she won't take questions from reporters? No. Nobody? Okay, great," he asked the reporters.</p>

<p>He said that Kamala Harris should change her mind, as it would be good for the Americans.</p>

<p>Vance said, "Well, I hope that she changes her mind, because it'd be good for the American people, and I think it'd be good for you all.She actually ran a real campaign instead of one from a basement with a teleprompter."&nbsp;</p>

— JD Vance (@JDVance) <a href="https://twitter.com/JDVance/status/1821252923919364126?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Mentioning the encounter on X, Vance stated, "I thought the reporters travelling with Kamala might be a little lonely given that she never answers questions from them, so I figured I'd come say hello and check out my new plane while I was at it."</p>

<p>Kamala Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, posed for pictures with Girl Scouts Troop #3307 on the tarmac shortly before Vance spoke to reporters. The two leaders appeared to have left seconds before their rival walked over, the New York Post reported.</p>

<p>Harris' campaign tried to make fun of Vance by sharing a video of his plane landing at Eau Claire airport with the TikTok-style oral caption, "all of a sudden, I hear this agitating, grating voice."</p>

<p>In response to their post, Donald Trump-Vance campaign spokesman Steven Cheung stated, "Make sure AF2 is deep cleaned because Lord only knows what @KamalaHarris and her team have done on there."</p>

<p>"The smell alone on that plane must be crazy," he added.</p>

<p>Vance's statement comes after he accused Walz of "stolen valour" and criticized Harris' performance as US President Joe Biden's designated point person on reducing illegal immigration at a Michigan event earlier in the day, the New York Post reported.</p>

<p>He called it "insulting" to Americans that Harris has not been giving interviews. He said, "I'd love her to just answer what she wants to do and also explain why every single position she has has changed."</p>

<p>Criticising Harris for her decisions regarding the US border, Vance said, "She pretends to be a tough-on-crime prosecutor and yet here she is wanting to defund the police. She's the border czar, yet she's opened up the American southern border."</p>

<p>Vance also slammed Walz after the Minnesota governor mocked him at his first rally as Harris' running mate in Philadelphia on Tuesday, according to a New York Post report.</p>

<p>"What bothers me about Tim Waltz is the stolen valour garbage," Vance said of Walz, who left the National Guard in 2005 shortly after his battalion was ordered to deploy to the Iraq War.</p>

<p>Vance asked Walz not to pretend to be something that he is not. JD Vance, who did serve in the Iraq War, said: "Do not pretend to be something that you're not. And if he wants to criticize me for getting an Ivy League education, I'm proud of the fact that my mamaw supported me, and that I was able to make something of myself. I'd be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month was the second hottest July for the planet on record, breaking a 13-month period when each month was warmest, which had been in part fuelled by the warming El Nino weather pattern, the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service said on Thursday.</p>

<p>The month was 1.48 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above the pre-industrial reference of 1850-1990, Copernicus said in a monthly report, while the last 12 months were 1.64 C above the pre-industrial average due to climate change.</p>

<p>July also recorded the two hottest days on record.</p>

<p>Copernicus attributes the high temperatures largely to greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-based industries and noted that oceans not normally impacted by El Nino saw an unusual rise in temperatures.</p>

<p>"This El Nino has ended but this magnitude of global temperature rises, the big picture is quite similar to where we were a year ago," Julien Nicolas, a climate researcher with Copernicus, told Reuters.</p>

<p>"We are not done with temperature records causing heatwaves ... We know this long-term warming trend can be with a very high level of confidence related to the human impact on climate."</p>

<p>Above-average temperatures were recorded in southern and eastern Europe, the western United States, western Canada, most of Africa, the Middle East, Asia and eastern Antarctica.</p>

<p>Near or below-average temperatures were seen in northwestern Europe, western Antarctica, parts of the United States, South America and Australia.</p>

<p>July 2024 was also wetter than average in northern Europe and southeastern Turkey while drought warnings persisted in southern and eastern Europe.</p>

<p>Arctic sea ice was down more than in 2022 and 2023 at 7% below average though not as severe as the record 14% drop in 2020. Antarctic sea ice was the second lowest extent for July at 11% below average compared with 15% below in July last year.</p>

<p>Global sea temperatures remain at near record highs with this July only 0.1 C below July last year, ending a 15-month consecutive new record streak.</p>

<p>"What we saw was surprising in terms of how much warmer it has been. That raises the question of what is happening to the ocean outside this natural climate pattern like El Nino or La Nina events. Are there shifts in the ocean currents?" Nicolas said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tropical Storm Debby is forecast to make landfall early Thursday and dump even more rain on the South Carolina coast, prompting fears of flash flooding in areas already soaked by the slow-moving weather system.</p>

<p>The storm could dump another 9 inches (23 cm) of rain in parts of eastern South Carolina on Thursday, forecasters said, with total accumulative rainfall in some spots hitting more than 25 inches since Debby started lashing the southeastern United States on Monday.</p>

<p>While Debby produced less rain on Wednesday than the previous days, Rich Bann, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service warned that Thursday would be different.</p>

<p>"Moisture has pulsed back into Debby," Bann said, noting that the storm picked up water as it spent the last day parked over the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Georgia and South Carolina. "As Debby makes its way inland ... the threat of heavy rains will lead to flooding concerns."</p>

<p>Bann said that by Friday Debby would be dumping up to 4 inches of rain on Virginia up into Pennsylvania, where ground in some patches was already soaked from other storms this week, heightening flooding concerns there. By the weekend, the storm could also produce rain of up to 4 inches in central New York state and into northern Vermont.</p>

<p>At least six people have died in Florida and Georgia in the wake of the storm, which made landfall on Florida's Gulf Coast on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and headed northeast.</p>

<p>Governors in the Carolinas, Florida and Georgia have declared states of emergency. The storm has already left neighbourhoods and communities underwater, washing out streets and inundating homes across the region.</p>

<p>Emergency management officials were keeping a close watch as the rainwater drained into the numerous river systems that snake through the Carolinas. The National Water Prediction Service forecast that seven waterways would reach major flood levels before the weather event runs its course.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What was meant to be a 10-day mission to the International Space Station (ISS) for the NASA astronauts - Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams - to fly with Boeing could extend to eight months.</p>

<p>NASA said on Wednesday that astronauts sent to International Space Station by Boeing's Starliner on a 10-day mission could return on one of the options as SpaceX's Crew Dragon in February 2025 if Starliner is still deemed unsafe to return to Earth.</p>

<p>Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore took off aboard the Boeing Starliner in June and have been at the ISS since the sixth of that month. The Starliner has faced glitches in the propulsion system following a series of helium leaks.</p>

<p>NASA is working on several return options including using SpaceX Crew Dragon. The Crew Dragon capsule would then be able to return to Earth with Starliner's crew of Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams in February 2025.</p>

<p>At the ISS in all nine astronauts and all are safe with enough food and supplies. All must return to Earth sooner than later.</p>

<p>Starliner spacecraft launched in June carrying two astronauts to the ISS in a high-stakes test mission required before NASA can certify the spacecraft for routine astronaut flights.</p>

<p>But the mission, initially expected to last about eight days, has been drawn out far longer by an array of problems with the craft's propulsion system that Boeing and NASA have been scrambling to fix.</p>

<p>The US space agency said Ms Williams, who is a veteran and is on her third space mission, meanwhile at the ISS among many other things investigated using fluid physics, such as surface tension, to overcome the lack of gravity when watering and nourishing plants being grown in space.</p>

<p>This is akin to gardening in space and is a very vital step towards understanding how plants grow and respond to microgravity conditions. The research will be crucial when humanity looks to establish various bases in the solar system and beyond.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This arrest is the latest example of Iran's strict enforcement of the mandatory hijab laws, which human rights activists have widely criticized. This escalation is rooted in the decades-long rhetoric of Ayatollah Khomeini, Iran's supreme leader, who has denounced "Westoxication" - the perceived corruption of Iranian society by Western influences - since before and after the 1979 revolution. Her arrest also coincides with the authorities' introduction of a new initiative aimed at restricting women's autonomy, amidst the ongoing "Woman, Life, Freedom" movement.</p>

<p>Earlier, other Iranian artists have also faced persecution and arrest for expressing themselves freely.</p>

<p>While rapper Toomaj Salehi was arrested for his lyrics criticising the government and social issues, singer Shervin Hajipour was imprisoned for his song <em>'Baraye,'</em> which became an anthem for the "Woman, Life, Freedom" movement.</p>

<p>This movement gained momentum following the tragic death of Mahsa Amini in 2022, sparking widespread protests and demands for change.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A wave of riots, sparked by a deadly attack at a children's dance event and further fueled by a torrent of misinformation, has gripped parts of the United Kingdom. What began as a community's grief over the tragic loss of three young girls has spiralled into nationwide chaos, with far-right groups using the moment to incite anti-immigration and anti-Muslim violence.</p>

<p><strong>What triggered the protests</strong></p>

<p>On July 29, three young girls, aged six to nine, were killed during a Taylor Swift-themed dance event in Southport, northern England. Eight other children and two adults also suffered stab wounds and were transferred to the hospital. The attacker, 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana, was arrested and charged with three counts of murder, 10 counts of attempted murder and one of possession of a blade.</p>

<p>Axel Rudakubana was born and raised in Cardiff, Wales. However, false information that he was an Islamist migrant quickly spread on social media. This misinformation incited violent anti-Muslim protests in Southport the following day, including an attempted attack on the local mosque.</p>

<p><strong>Spread of the riots</strong></p>

<p>On Wednesday evening, a sea of angry demonstrators descended upon Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Downing Street office, voicing their outrage over immigration and demanding action from the government. The crowd's chants of "Save our kids" and "We want our country back" filled the air as protesters clashed with police, hurling flares and smoke canisters towards the prime minister's residence.</p>

<p>The Metropolitan police reported 111 arrests and five injured officers, following a night of violent disorder. This comes after Tuesday's initial protests in Southport, where over 50 police officers were hurt and police vans were set ablaze.</p>

<p>Since then, riots have erupted in over 20 locations, including Sunderland, Manchester, Plymouth and Belfast, across Britain. These protests have involved hundreds of participants targeting migrants or Muslims, vandalising shops, and clashing with police.</p>

<p><strong>Who is behind the riots?</strong></p>

<p>Keir Starmer blames the recent violence on "far-right thuggery". Prominent anti-Muslim and anti-immigration activists, like Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, are accused of spreading false information to inflame tensions. Social media platforms have been criticised for not preventing the spread of disinformation, which has played a significant role in amplifying these false narratives.</p>

<p>According to police, the majority of those involved in the clashes were far-right agitators from outside the local areas. However, some individuals with local grievances or young people seeking excitement also joined the fray, police said. Meanwhile, counter-protesters and anti-fascist groups have gathered to oppose them.</p>

<p><strong>The motivation behind the riots</strong></p>

<p>Many rioters, describing themselves as "patriots", claimed that high immigration levels were undermining British society. They argued that immigration fueled violence and crime and that politicians favoured migrants. However, rights groups and anti-racist organisations rejected these claims as baseless, suggesting the true motive was extremism masked as patriotism.</p>

<p><strong>Government's response</strong></p>

<p>The Starmer-led government has taken swift action in response to the recent riots, making nearly 600 additional prison places available and deploying specialist officers to prevent the situation from spiralling. A 58-year-old British man has also been jailed for three years for violent disorder.</p>

<p>The government is also targeting those using social media to spread trouble, with one man charged for using threatening language to stir up racial hatred on Facebook. Science Minister Peter Kyle has met with representatives from major tech companies, like TikTok, Meta, Google and X, to prevent incitement and the spread of false information online.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All Indian visa application centres in Bangladesh will remain closed until further notice after unrest in the neighbouring country forced Sheikh Hasina to resign as Prime Minister and flee the country. The online portal to apply for Indian visa now has a message, "All IVACs will remain closed till further notice, due to unstable situation. Next application date will be informed through SMS &amp; It is requested to pick up the passport on the next working day."</p>

<p>This comes a day after New Delhi evacuated non-essential staff and their families from its High Commission and consulates in Bangladesh amid the volatile situation in the country. Indian diplomats, however, remain in the country and the missions are functional, sources in the government have said.</p>

<p>India has a high commission in Bangladesh capital Dhaka and consulates in Chittagong, Rajshahi, Khulna and Sylhet.</p>

<p>Massive protests against the Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League government in Bangladesh have forced the 76-year-old leader to resign as Prime Minister and flee to India.</p>

<p>An interim government backed by the Army is in the process of being formed. Nobel peace prize winner and Grameen Bank founder Muhammad Yunus will lead the caretaker government.</p>

<p>Addressing the Parliament on the neighbourhood situation, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has said that there are nearly 19,000 Indian nationals in Bangladesh of which 9,000 are students. Many of the students, he said, returned to India after the protests broke out. He has said the government is in close contact with the Indian community there. He has also said the government is monitoring the situation regarding minorities living in Bangladesh.</p>]]></content:encoded>

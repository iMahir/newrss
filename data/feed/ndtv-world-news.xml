       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Boeing said Monday it had reached a deal with the US Department of Justice over two fatal 737 MAX crashes, which court papers show would see the aviation giant plead guilty to fraud.</p>

<p>The agreement comes after prosecutors concluded Boeing flouted an earlier settlement addressing the disasters, in which 346 people were killed in Ethiopia and Indonesia more than five years ago.</p>

<p>"We have reached an agreement in principle on terms of a resolution with the Justice Department, subject to the memorialization and approval of specific terms," Boeing told AFP in a statement.</p>

<p>Court papers filed in Texas on Sunday said the company had agreed to plead guilty to "conspiracy to defraud the United States" during the certification of MAX airplanes.</p>

<p>Boeing will be fined under the deal and must invest a minimum of $455 million in "compliance and safety programs", while compensation for families will be determined by the court.</p>

<p>Boeing's latest legal predicament was triggered by a DoJ determination in mid-May that the company ignored a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) by not meeting requirements to improve its compliance and ethics program after the MAX crashes.</p>

<p>Families of MAX victims were "highly disappointed" by the deal reached between Boeing and the DoJ, an attorney at Clifford Law representing them said.</p>

<p>"Much more evidence has been presented over the last five years that demonstrates that the culture of Boeing putting profits over safety hasn't changed. This plea agreement only furthers that skewed corporate objective," senior partner Robert A. Clifford said in a statement.</p>

<p>The families will ask the court to reject the plea deal at an upcoming hearing, according to an opposition filed by their legal team.</p>

<p>The original DPA was announced in January 2021, over charges that Boeing knowingly defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration during the certification of the MAX.</p>

<p>The agreement required Boeing to pay $2.5 billion in fines and restitution in exchange for immunity from criminal prosecution.</p>

<p>A three-year probationary period was set to expire this year. But in January, Boeing was plunged back into crisis mode when a 737 MAX flown by Alaska Airlines was forced to make an emergency landing after a fuselage panel blew out mid-flight.</p>

<p>In a May 14 letter to the US court, DoJ officials said that Boeing breached its obligations under the DPA by "failing to design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws throughout its operations."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) used the 'Hannibal directive' during the Hamas attack on October 7, Haaretz, a leading daily, has <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-07-07/ty-article-magazine/.premium/idf-ordered-hannibal-directive-on-october-7-to-prevent-hamas-taking-soldiers-captive/00000190-89a2-d776-a3b1-fdbe45520000">reported</a>. This directive allows soldiers to use force to prevent kidnappings, even if it puts the lives of hostages at risk,&nbsp;it said.</p>

<h3><strong>What is the Hannibal directive?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The Hannibal Directive is a controversial Israeli military policy that orders the use of maximum force to prevent the kidnapping of Israeli soldiers, even if it means risking their lives. The policy allows soldiers to open fire without constraints, targeting not only the abductors but also potential escape routes, including junctions, roads and highways, a former Israeli army soldier told Al Jazeera.</p>

<p>The directive was last invoked in 2014 during the Gaza war, resulting in the deaths of dozens of Palestinians and accusations of war crimes. Although the Israeli army denied using the doctrine, it was reportedly revoked in 2016 and used again now.</p>

<p>According to the Haaretz report, the protocol was used by the IDF after the&nbsp;October 7 attack at three army facilities, potentially endangering civilians. A message sent to Israel's Gaza division at 11:22 am ordered that "not a single vehicle can return to Gaza," implying that vehicles could be carrying kidnapped civilians or soldiers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Everyone knew by then that such vehicles could be carrying kidnapped civilians or soldiers ... Everyone knew what it meant to not let any vehicles return to Gaza," a source told the Israeli newspaper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the extent of harm to civilians and soldiers is unknown, soldiers' testimonies and IDF officers suggest it was used widely. The report stated that the Hannibal directive "did not prevent the kidnapping of seven of them [soldiers] or the killing of 15 other spotters, as well as 38 other soldiers".</p>

<p>On October 7, Hamas captured dozens of Israelis, including both soldiers and civilians. Many of these captives remain in the group's custody, while others were killed in subsequent Israeli airstrikes on Gaza. According to Israeli authorities, 1,139 people have died in the attacks, with 250 taken captive.</p>

<p>Israel's onslaught in Gaza has killed 38,000 people and displaced 1.9 million -- about 90% of the city's population -- since the beginning of the war.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australian authorities have accused a Sydney father of trying to stop rescuers from saving his own family in a "horrifying" home fire that killed two boys and a baby girl.</p>

<p>Flames engulfed the home in western Sydney's Lalor Park in the early hours of Sunday morning while the 28-year-old man, his female partner and seven children were inside, New South Wales state police said.</p>

<p>Three children -- two boys aged three and six, and a 10-month-old girl -- were killed.</p>

<p>The four other children aged between four and 11 and their mother, 29, were being treated at hospital for fire-related injuries but were all expected to recover, police said.</p>

<p>"This is a horrifying and senseless act that has quite rightly outraged the entire state," New South Wales Premier Chris Minns said Monday.</p>

<p>"These children deserved a loving home with safety and security, and instead they are gone."</p>

<p>Police said the three deaths were being investigated as a domestic-related multiple homicide.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has described domestic violence in Australia as a "national crisis" following a spike in the number of violent deaths of women this year and a series of high-profile attacks.</p>

<p>State police said the 28-year-old man was arrested after he allegedly "frustrated" police efforts to enter the burning building.</p>

<p>He was in an induced coma while being treated in hospital, under police guard, they said.</p>

<p>"It does appear that the 28-year-old man is responsible for multiple deaths," state homicide squad commander Danny Doherty told reporters on Sunday.</p>

<p>The suspect allegedly acted with "the intention of keeping the kids inside the premises whilst the fire was happening," he said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A policy update allowing the microblogging site X to manually review the direct messages (DMs) of some users has sparked major privacy concerns.</p>

<p>An X user, @kimdotcom, on Sunday flagged the new update that goes against the X policy of providing end-to-end encryption to every content on the platform.</p>

<p>A screenshot of the policy update shared online showed the Elon Musk-owned platform now reviews DMs to investigate reported violations and misuse of its services, "or to comply with laws or governmental requests".</p>

<p>Replying to the user, Elon Musk confirmed the update but did not provide any additional detail.</p>

<p>"It currently works in a clunky way for one to one messages (if you turn it on). We're working on making it easy to use and apply to group messages too. X audio and video calls are automatically encrypted," he said.</p>

<p>Several other users raised an alarm over the manual review of DMs and said Elon Musk did not understand the concern. "The 'comply with government requests' clause is unacceptable. Please say you still believe in free speech," a user said.</p>

<p>"Is it me or did Elon not understand the question of Kim? Kim was worried about reviewing the DMs by government request," another said on X. An user commented: "You didn't address the root of the concern. Why is X collaborating with governments to sift through our private DMs?"</p>

<p>According to the X website, encrypted DMs are an important aspect of the platform's aim to become the most trusted platform on the internet. "As Elon Musk said, when it comes to Direct Messages, the standard should be, if someone puts a gun to our heads, we still can't access your messages," the X help centre states.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month was the hottest June on record, the EU's climate change monitoring service said on Monday, continuing a streak of exceptional temperatures that some scientists said puts 2024 on track to be the world's hottest recorded year.</p>

<p>Every month since June 2023 - 13 months in a row - has ranked as the planet's hottest since records began, compared with the corresponding month in previous years, the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said in a monthly bulletin.</p>

<p>The latest data suggest 2024 could outrank 2023 as the hottest year since records began after human-caused climate change and the El Nino natural weather phenomenon both pushed temperatures to record highs in the year so far, some scientists said.</p>

<p>"I now estimate that there is an approximately 95% chance that 2024 beats 2023 to be the warmest year since global surface temperature records began in the mid-1800s," said Zeke Hausfather, a research scientist at Berkeley Earth.</p>

<p>The changed climate has already unleashed disastrous consequences around the world in 2024.</p>

<p>More than 1,000 people died in fierce heat during the haj pilgrimage last month. Heat deaths were recorded in New Delhi, which endured an unprecedentedly long heatwave, and amongst Greek tourists.</p>

<p>Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London's Grantham Institute, said there was a "high chance" 2024 would rank as the hottest year on record.</p>

<p>"El Nino is a naturally occurring phenomenon that will always come and go. We can't stop El Nino, but we can stop burning oil, gas, and coal," she said.</p>

<p>The natural El Nino phenomenon, which warms the surface waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean, tends to raise global average temperatures.</p>

<p>That effect subsided in recent months, with the world now in neutral conditions before cooler La Nina conditions are expected to form later this year.</p>

<p>Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels are the main cause of climate change.</p>

<p>Despite promises to curb global warming, countries have so far failed collectively to reduce these emissions, pushing temperatures steadily higher for decades.</p>

<p>In the 12 months ending in June, the world's average temperature was the highest on record for any such period, at 1.64 degrees Celsius above the average in the 1850-1900 pre-industrial period, C3S said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Many of France's allies breathed a sigh of relief that the worst was averted as Marine Le Pen's far-right failed to win a snap election on Sunday but they noted that a messy coalition from a hung parliament could also pose headaches for Europe.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of France's allies breathed a sigh of relief that the worst was averted as Marine Le Pen's far-right failed to win a snap election on Sunday but they noted that a messy coalition from a hung parliament could also pose headaches for Europe.</p>

<p>Le Pen's National Rally (RN) had been favourite to top the polls, raising the risk of France's first far-right government since World War Two and threatening to upend economic and foreign policy in the euro zone's second-largest economy.</p>

<p>In particular, Ukraine's allies feared a Le Pen-led government could be soft on Moscow and pare back military aid that Kyiv has relied on since the Russian invasion in 2022, though her party has latterly said Russia was a threat.</p>

<p>The National Rally's defeat signals at least a temporary pushback against a far-right surge in Europe, but could herald a period of instability with a new government in an uneasy "cohabitation" with President Emmanuel Macron.</p>

<p>"In Paris enthusiasm, in Moscow disappointment, in Kyiv relief. Enough to be happy in Warsaw," Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on X.</p>

<p>Macron had called the snap poll in an attempt to wrest the initiative back from Le Pen but his own party was left trailing behind an alliance of leftist parties that performed far better than expected to take first place.</p>

<p>Several early reactions from overseas rejoiced that the immediate threat of a far-right government had been averted.</p>

<p>"The worst has been avoided," said Nils Schmid, the foreign policy spokesperson for Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats in Germany, where the far-right has also surged in popularity during a cost of living crisis.</p>

<p>"The president is politically weakened, even if he retains a central role in view of the unclear majority situation. Forming a government will be complicated," Schmid told the Funke media group.</p>

<p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's party congratulated the leftist alliance, called the New Popular Front, for a victory that "stops the far-right from reaching the government".</p>

<p>Nikos Androulakis, the head of Greece's Socialist PASOK party, said the French people had "raised a wall against the far right, racism and intolerance and guarded the timeless principles of the French Republic: Liberty, Equality and Fraternity."</p>

<p>Colombia's leftist firebrand President, Gustavo Petro, also congratulated the French for keeping out Le Pen.</p>

<p>"There are battles that last just a few days but (which) define humanity's fate. France has gone through one of these," he said.</p>

<p>An EU official, speaking on condition of anonymity, called it a "huge relief" but added: "what it means for Europe on a day to day basis remains to be seen though."</p>

<p>DEEP DIVISIONS</p>

<p>The election left the French parliament split between three large groups - the left, the centrists, and the far right - with different platforms and no tradition of working together.</p>

<p>The left wants to cap prices of essential goods like fuel and food, raise the minimum wage and the salaries of public sector workers, at a time when France's budget deficit is already at 5.5% of output, higher than EU rules permit.</p>

<p>"Bye-bye European deficit limits! (The government) will crash in no time. Poor France. It can console itself with (Kylian) Mbapp&amp;#233;," said Claudio Borghi, senator from Italy's right-wing League party, referring to the French soccer star.</p>

<p>Other hard-right politicians expressed frustration.</p>

<p>Andre Ventura, leader of Portugal's far-right party Chega, called the result a "disaster for the economy, tragedy for immigration and bad for the fight against corruption".</p>

<p>A note by Capital Economics said France may have avoided the "worst possible outcomes" for investors, of an outright majority for either Le Pen or the leftists.</p>

<p>A fractious parliament means however it will be difficult for any government to pass the budget cuts that are necessary for France to comply with the EU's budget rules, it said.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, the chance of France's government (and the governments of other countries) clashing with the EU over fiscal policy has increased now that the bloc's budget rules have been re-introduced," it said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Colorado man, who murdered his pregnant wife and two daughters in 2018, now lives in constant fear in prison. Chris Watts is terrified of being attacked or killed by prisoners disgusted by his heinous crime, reported the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/04/us-news/killer-dad-chris-watts-lives-in-fear-in-wisconsin-prison/ ">NY Post</a>.</p>

<p>"A lot of guys would like to get their hands on him," said an inmate, who spent a year alongside Watts at the prison.</p>

<p>Watts pleaded guilty to murdering his pregnant wife, Shanann, and their two young daughters, Bella, 4, and Celeste, 3, in 2018. He initially denied knowing what happened to his family but later confessed to the crime.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.unilad.com/news/crime/chris-watts-murders-shanann-wife-prison-084583-20240123 ">letters</a> to author Cheryln Cadle, Watts described trying to smother his daughters before murdering his wife. He wrote that he used a pillow from their bed to kill them and that his wife's eyes filled with blood and her face turned black with streaks of mascara. His attempt to kill his daughters initially failed, but he later managed to kill them and disposed of their bodies in oil tanks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Watts was having an affair with Nichol Kessinger, a co-worker. The authorities believe it to be the motive for the murders. Ms Kessinger later stated that she thought Watts was already separated from his wife when they had an affair.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He is now sentenced to life in prison without parole.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"He killed two little girls who didn't do anything to deserve it. He's the lowest of the low at Dodge (Correctional Institution),” his former inmate said. “A lot of people want to get their revenge for those girls.”</p>

<p>Watts now lives a life of isolation and fear. According to sources, he is constantly in danger and has been transferred to a different facility for his safety. “He's an outcast,” said an inmate. “When people found out that his victims were two little girls, they wanted to kill him.”</p>

<p>Inmates said that he was protected at the prison, currently. “If the guards weren't always around, everyone would take a swing at him.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Every day, he thinks about what he did," Watts' former inmate said. "He has photos of the girls and he prays for forgiveness every day."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a worrying trend, Elon Musk-owned X is manually reviewing certain users' direct messages (DMs) to investigate reported violations and misuse of its service, “or to comply with laws or governmental requests”.</p>

<p>When an X user with @kimdotcom account posted this policy update, the tech billionaire on Monday did not provide a clear answer to the query, which goes against the policy of providing end-to-end encryption to every content on the platform.</p>

<p>“It currently works in a clunky way for one to one messages (if you turn it on). We're working on making it easy to use and apply to group messages too,” Musk replied.</p>

<p>“X audio and video calls are automatically encrypted,” he added.</p>

<p>Several users raised an alarm over X apparently manually reviewing DMs.</p>

<p>“Is it me or did Elon not understand the question of Kim? Kim was worried about reviewing the DMs by government request,” an X user posted.</p>

<p>Another user commented: “You didn't address the root on the concern. Why is X collaborating with governments to sift through our private DMs?”</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In a one-minute video posted on Facebook on Sunday, Lawful-Sanders said, "effective immediately I am no longer an on-air host at WURD."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Radio host Andrea Lawful-Sanders who recently interviewed US President Joe Biden and claimed that the questions asked of President were provided in advance has resigned from WURD Radio, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/07/media/biden-interview-radio-host-philadelphia/index.html"><em>CNN </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The interview featured pre-determined questions provided by the White House, which violates our practice of remaining an independent media outlet accountable to our listeners," Sara Lomax, president and CEO of the Philadelphia-based station, announced in a statement posted Sunday on its <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://wurdradio.com/2024/07/07/accountability-access-and-a-path-forward-why-black-media-matters/">website</a></em>. "As a result, Ms. Lawful-Sanders and WURD Radio have mutually agreed to part ways, effective immediately."</p>

<p>WURD is Pennsylvania's sole Black-owned talk radio station. Ms Lomax emphasized that the station prides itself on being an independent and trustworthy voice for its main audience of Black Philadelphians. She stated that using pre-provided questions "jeopardizes that trust and is not a practice that WURD Radio engages in or endorses as a matter of practice or official policy."</p>

<p>"WURD Radio is not a mouthpiece for the Biden or any other Administration," she added.</p>

<p>Lawful-Sanders, who hosted "The Source," interviewed Biden last week, asking him four questions about the election's stakes, his achievements, his debate performance, and his message to undecided voters. In a Saturday interview with CNN's Victor Blackwell, she revealed that these questions were among eight recommended to her by Biden's aides prior to the interview.</p>

<p>"The questions were sent to me for approval. I approved them," she said.</p>

<p>In a one-minute video posted on <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/443556475259170"><em>Facebook </em></a>on Sunday, Lawful-Sanders said, “effective immediately I am no longer an on-air host at WURD. I tendered my resignation yesterday. It was accepted.”</p>

<p>She then thanked “all of you who played a part in this journey, including WURD Radio.” She went on to say that she is “grateful,” and that “Life is moving. Things are shifting and changing. And, in a day or so you'll hear more.”</p>

<p>The move has intensified the ongoing controversy surrounding Biden's sharpness, following his lackluster performance in the first presidential debate hosted by CNN. Many top Democrats have expressed frustration and concern over his debate performance, with some suggesting that he should reconsider accepting the party's nomination.</p>

<p>"If the White House is trying now to prove the vim, vigor ... of the president, I don't know how they do that by sending questions first before the interview so that the president knows what's coming," said Ms Blackwell.</p>

<p>Ms Blackwell further revealed that both Lawful-Sanders and Earl Ingram, host of "The Earl Ingram Show" in Milwaukee who also interviewed the president this week, asked Biden "essentially the same questions."</p>

<p>Surprisingly, Joe Biden's campaign spokesperson did not deny the campaign provided questions, but said, "We do not condition interviews on acceptance of these questions."</p>

<p>"It's not at all an uncommon practice for interviewees to share topics they would prefer. These questions were relevant to the news of the day - the president was asked about this debate performance as well as what he'd delivered for black Americans," spokesperson Lauren Hitt said in a statement.</p>

<p>However, the spokesperson later said that it will no longer suggest questions to interviewers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"While interview hosts have always been free to ask whatever questions they please, moving forward we will refrain from offering suggested questions," a source familiar with the Biden booking operation told CNN.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>France's left-wing New Popular Front (NFP), an alliance of parties hastily assembled after President Emmanuel Macron called a surprise snap parliamentary election, looked set to score a shock win in Sunday's vote over the far right and the ruling centrists.</p>

<p>If initial projections are confirmed, Macron will be required to name a prime minister from the bloc. The initial estimates are typically accurate.</p>

<p>The NFP - made up of the Communist Party, the hard left France Unbowed, the Green party and the Socialist Party - has not said who would be its pick for prime minister. The following are some of its best-known figures:</p>

<h2><strong>Jean-Luc Melenchon, Hard Left France Unbowed Party</strong></h2>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/1bfh2fqo_jeanluc-melenchon-afp_625x300_08_July_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Jean-Luc Melenchon, 72, has been a fixture in French left-wing politics for decades and held ministerial posts in past governments, when he was a member of the Socialist Party.</p>

<p>He ran for president in 2012, 2017 and 2022, improving his score each time. He came third in 2022, just behind far-right leader Marine Le Pen. Macron won that election.</p>

<p>A fiery orator, Melenchon is one of the most divisive figures in French politics, enthusing some voters while horrifying others with his unbridled tax-and-spend proposals, class war rhetoric and controversial foreign policy positions, especially on Gaza. Critics accuse him of antisemitism, which he denies.</p>

<h2><strong>Marine Tondelier, Leader Of The Greens</strong></h2>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/7d40ep0o_marine-tondelier-afp_625x300_08_July_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Tondelier, 37, grew up in Henin-Beaumont, a town in northern France that is well-known as a bastion of the far-right National Rally (RN) and its leader Le Pen.</p>

<p>Tondelier has a long record of opposing the RN.</p>

<p>She was elected as an opposition member of the town's municipal council in 2014. She documented her experiences working under an RN mayor and what she described as the oppressive atmosphere generated by the far-right administration in a 2017 book entitled "News from the Front".</p>

<p>Tondelier was also elected to a northern regional council in 2021, and she became leader of France's best-known ecologist party, the Greens, the following year.</p>

<h2><strong>Raphael Glucksmann, Socialist Party</strong></h2>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/4lk4lpl8_raphael-glucksmann-afp_625x300_08_July_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Raphael Glucksmann, 44, headed the Socialist list of candidates in the European elections in early June. It obtained nearly 14% of the vote, just behind Macron's Together group. This was considered a sign of revival for a party that governed France in past decades but had recently fallen into electoral oblivion.</p>

<p>Glucksmann attended prestigious schools and had a career in journalism and broadcasting before branching out in a variety of directions, including being an adviser to then Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili.</p>

<p>He advocates strong European support for Ukraine in its resistance against Russia's invasion.</p>

<h2><strong>Laurent Berger, Former CFDT Trade Union Leader</strong></h2>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/ctana8e_laurent-berger-afp_625x300_08_July_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Laurent Berger, 55, is a former head of one of France's main trade unions, the moderate CFDT. He has a track record of strong opposition to the RN.</p>

<p>Berger has said he does not want to be prime minister, but others on the left have put his name forward, saying he could be a unifying figure and a popular alternative to Melenchon.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un slammed Seoul Monday for recent military drills near the border, saying the South must be "suicidal" and warning of a "terrible disaster".</p>

<p>After Pyongyang sent multiple barrages of trash-carrying balloons across the border, Seoul last month fully suspended a tension-reducing military deal and resumed live-fire drills on border islands and by the demilitarised zone that divides the Korean Peninsula.</p>

<p>Kim Yo Jong, who is a key regime spokesperson, said this was "an undisguised war game (and) an inexcusable and explicit provocation that aggravates the situation," according to a statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency.</p>

<p>South Korea's border drills were "suicidal hysteria, for which they will have to sustain terrible disaster," she added.</p>

<p>Kim Yo Jong said it was "clear to everyone... the riskiness of the above-said reckless live ammunition firing drills of the ROK army coming nearer to the border of the DPRK," referring to the South by its official name, the Republic of Korea.</p>

<p>If Seoul's exercises breach the North's sovereignty, Kim Yo Jong warned: "our armed forces will immediately carry out its mission," without giving further details.</p>

<p>Relations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, with Pyongyang ramping up weapons testing as it draws ever closer to Russia.</p>

<p>Seoul and Washington have accused Pyongyang of supplying arms to Moscow for use in the war in Ukraine -- which would violate rafts of sanctions on both countries.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, the nuclear-armed North declared Seoul its chief enemy, and has jettisoned agencies designed for outreach and diplomacy with Seoul, while ramping up security along the shared border.</p>

<p>North Korean soldiers have crossed the border three times in recent weeks, likely accidentally Seoul's military says, while they were working to lay mines, clear foliage and build likely anti-tank barriers.</p>

<p>Kim Yo Jong also criticised recent trilateral drills between the United States, South Korea and Japan, saying they were "the height of confrontational hysteria".</p>

<p>"The war drumbeats clearly showed that the US and other hostile forces' rash manoeuvres for military hegemony in the region have crossed the red line," she added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Florida man is facing a felony robbery charge after allegedly attempting to withdraw 1 cent from a bank in Sumter County, according to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/06/us-news/florida-man-michael-fleming-tries-to-withdraw-1-cent-from-bank-gets-hit-with-robbery-charge/"><em>New York Post</em></a>. The Sumter County Sheriff's Office's arrest affidavit states the incident occurred just before 2 pm on Saturday at the Chase Bank on US-441 in Lady Lake.</p>

<p>The man, identified as Michael Fleming, entered the bank, filled out a withdrawal slip for 1 cent, and handed it to a teller. The teller reportedly informed Fleming that he couldn't withdraw just a penny.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-says-he-has-cleaned-a-lot-of-toilets-elon-musk-responds-6053618">Also Read|&nbsp;Nvidia's Jensen Huang Says He Has ''Cleaned A Lot Of Toilets'', Elon Musk Responds</a></p>

<p>"So you want me to say the other word?" Fleming reportedly told the bank teller, according to the arrest report. No further details about their conversation were provided in the affidavit, but deputies stated that the teller was afraid of potential violence and called law enforcement.</p>

<p>When deputies arrived, Fleming was still inside the bank and was taken into custody, the affidavit said. He was transported to the Sumter County Sheriff's Office, where he agreed to speak with deputies after being read his Miranda Rights.</p>

<p>Although the details of this conversation were redacted from the report, deputies stated they had probable cause to believe Fleming violated Florida's robbery laws, according to the affidavit.</p>

<p>The 41-year-old man was then taken to the Sumter County Detention Center, where he remains on $5,000 bond as of Tuesday afternoon, according to online jail records.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a tragic and appalling incident, a father has been arrested for the heinous act of burying his 15-day-old daughter alive in Tharushah, as reported by ARY News.</p>

<p>Police officials disclosed that the father, identified as Tayyab, confessed to this grievous deed, citing financial constraints that prevented him from affording medical treatment for his infant daughter. Tayyab admitted to placing the newborn in a sack before burying her.</p>

<p>A case has been formally lodged against Tayyab, who has admitted guilt in the matter. Authorities have indicated that pursuant to a court directive, the child's grave will be opened for forensic examination through postmortem procedures, according to ARY News.</p>

<p>In a separate incident that took place in Lahore's Defence B area, where a husband and wife allegedly subjected a 13-year-old domestic worker to severe abuse, including stripping and physical torture.</p>

<p>Following a complaint filed by the worker's mother, law enforcement promptly registered a First Information Report (FIR) against the accused, Hassam. Hassam has been detained in connection with the incident, while efforts to apprehend his wife are reportedly ongoing.</p>

<p>According to the FIR, Tehreem was subjected to continued physical abuse, including being stripped naked, allegedly over suspicions of theft. Her mother asserted in the FIR that her daughter sustained fractures to her hand and nose during the ordeal.</p>

<p>The Superintendent of Police (SP) Cantt assured that those responsible for the reprehensible acts against Tehreem would be brought to justice swiftly, ARY News reported.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The champagne was on ice at the far-right National Rally's (RN) headquarters, but the celebratory mood swiftly turned to disbelief when the first projected results from Sunday's parliamentary election appeared on TV screens.</p>

<p>For days, Marine Le Pen had confidently predicted that her party would triumph with an outright majority and her protege Jordan Bardella would be prime minister. Instead, the National Rally was on course to come third, behind a left-wing alliance and President Emmanuel Macron's centrist bloc.</p>

<p>It was undone to a large extent by tactical dealmaking between centrist and leftist opponents, who pulled more than 200 candidates from three-way races to avoid splitting the anti-RN vote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The projected result brought to a shuddering halt what had appeared to be the far right's relentless rise in France, carefully engineered by Le Pen who had sough to clean up her party's image and tap the grievances of voters angry over living costs, strained public services, and immigration.</p>

<p>To be sure, Le Pen and her party have suffered disappointment before, most recently her 2022 defeat to Macron in the presidential election, and have managed to bounce back more strongly than before.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But for now, the outcome was a bitter pill to swallow.</p>

<p>"The results are disappointing and they don't represent what French people want," said Jocelyn Cousin, 18, who had come to party HQ expecting a victory party.</p>

<p>The RN's momentum had appeared unstoppable after it trounced the centrists in European elections in early June and came first, ahead of the hastily assembled leftist New Popular Front, in the first round of the parliamentary vote on June 30.</p>

<p>Le Pen and Bardella attributed their party's setback on Sunday to the what Bardella called the "disgraceful alliance" the anti-RN forces, who he said had caricatured the party and disrespected its voters.</p>

<p>But IPSOS pollster Brice Teinturier pointed to the RN's own shortcomings, including revelations before the run-off that several of its candidates had expressed xenophobic views, raising questions over whether the party had really ditched its more toxic past.</p>

<p>"What happened is also that RN candidates themselves showed in this campaign that they either were not ready or had in their ranks candidates that are antisemitic, xenophobic or homophobic," Teinturier told France 2 television.</p>

<p><strong>'TIDE IS RISING'</strong></p>

<p>Florent de Kersauson, an RN candidate in Brittany in western France, acknowledged the fallout had been damaging. But he also said voters may have felt the party was arrogant in predicting an absolute majority.</p>

<p>"I thought it was strange that they said that," said Kersauson, who lost his race against a pro-Macron candidate. "It seemed like something that was very hard to achieve."</p>

<p>Bardella and Le Pen strove to put a brave face on their result. The party had increased its share of seats in the National Assembly to a record high, they noted, vowing to keep fighting until they won power.</p>

<p>"The tide is rising, but it didn't rise quite high enough this time," said Le Pen, who is likely to mount her fourth presidential campaign in 2027. "Our victory has merely been delayed."</p>

<p>That was also the feeling among many of the supporters gathered at party HQ in Paris.</p>

<p>"I see our victory coming. People are going to understand that the National Rally is not so horrible. I believe it will happen in 2027. I have a lot of hope and I'll continue to fight," said Elea da Cunha, 17.</p>

<p>Frederic-Pierre Vos, a close associate of Le Pen and former RN party lawyer elected in a constituency north of Paris, said the hung parliament thrown up by the election would mean an ungovernable France, providing fresh opportunities for RN in 2027.</p>

<p>Yet despite the party's fighting talk, Sunday's outcome was a clear setback.</p>

<p>Business newspaper Les Echos ran a front page showing a grim-faced Bardella with the headline "la claque" or "the slap".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several top House Democrats are urging President Joe Biden to step aside from the 2024 campaign, expressing deep concerns about his potential impact on the Democratic Party's chances in the upcoming elections, CNN reported.</p>

<p>The sentiments were revealed during a leadership call organised by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Sunday, aimed at gauging the opinions of ranking members and leaders before the return of members to Washington this week.</p>

<p>According to sources familiar with the call, the discussion was dominated by apprehensions regarding the potential damage Biden's candidacy could inflict on the Democratic ticket and the party's prospects of reclaiming the House majority. Jeffries, however, did not disclose his own stance on whether Biden should continue running for re-election, leaving the issue open for debate among the participants, as reported by CNN.</p>

<p>The call saw a notable division among House Democrats, with a greater number of lawmakers advocating for Biden to step aside than those who voiced support for his candidacy.</p>

<p>Notable figures among those opposing Biden included Representatives Mark Takano, Adam Smith, Jim Himes, Joe Morelle, Jerry Nadler, and Susan Wild. Conversely, Representatives Maxine Waters and Bobby Scott were reported to have spoken in favour of Biden, underscoring the internal divisions within the party leadership.</p>

<p>One of the primary concerns raised during the nearly two-hour call was the perceived risk of losing the opportunity to secure a House majority if Biden were to remain the Democratic nominee. Several participants expressed a preference for Vice President Kamala Harris to lead the ticket, viewing her as a potentially stronger candidate.</p>

<p>"It was pretty brutal," remarked a senior Democratic aide anonymously to CNN, describing the intensity of the discussions that unfolded during the private call among House leaders.</p>

<p>The aide indicated that no immediate decisions regarding formal demands or actions, such as a White House meeting or a letter to Biden, were expected before the full Democratic caucus convenes on Tuesday. Jeffries reportedly emphasised that members would be allowed to voice their opinions freely and make their own judgments on the matter.</p>

<p>Another senior House Democrat revealed that sentiment within the caucus overwhelmingly supports Biden stepping aside. The member emphasised that while there is respect for Biden's lengthy career in public service, there is a growing consensus that the party needs to strategise effectively to move forward.</p>

<p>Tuesday's scheduled caucus meeting was anticipated to be a pivotal moment for Biden, according to sources within the Democratic Party. Many Democrats dissatisfied with Biden's recent debate performance are awaiting Jeffries' public stance on the matter. Thus far, Jeffries has maintained a cautious approach, refraining from publicly endorsing any particular course of action as he continues to assess the sentiments within his caucus.</p>

<p>President Biden, meanwhile, appeared confident during a visit to battleground Pennsylvania, affirming his belief in the Democratic Party's unified support behind him. When questioned by the press, Biden unequivocally asserted that the party continues to stand behind him, CNN reported.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least five Democratic lawmakers expressed their view on Sunday that President Joe Biden should step down from the US presidential election scheduled for November 5, according to multiple news reports.</p>

<p>The lawmakers -- Jerry Nadler, Mark Takano, Joe Morelle, Ted Lieu and Adam Smith -- expressed their view in this regard during a Democratic Party phone call organised to discuss Biden's disastrous debate performance against his Republican rival, Donald Trump, in Atlanta on June 27.</p>

<p>Biden himself has described his performance as "a bad night". His approval ratings have come down and his own party colleagues have started questioning his health and ability to govern the country for the next four years. Biden has asserted that he is staying in the race and exuded confidence that he will win the election against Trump in November.</p>

<p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries had convened a virtual meeting of his party colleagues in the House of Representatives to discuss the evolving political scenarios after the June 27 presidential debate between Biden and Trump.</p>

<p>The virtual meeting was billed as a "listening session" to get inputs from members about the viability of Biden's candidacy, "The New York Times" reported, adding that it was clear before the call that many top Democrats felt strongly that Biden had to go.</p>

<p>Congressman Smith, the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, said it is time for Biden to go, according to two people familiar with the call, the daily reported. The four other Congressmen also felt the same and believed it was time for Biden to exit the race.</p>

<p>"Lieu was the highest-ranking person in the House Democratic leadership to support pressing for Biden to not seek reelection," "The Washington Post" reported.</p>

<p>"The developments opened a wide crack in Biden's wall of support, bringing the number of House Democrats publicly or privately saying he should step aside to about 10. They included the top Democrats on the Judiciary, Armed Services and Intelligence committees. The defections cast further doubts on Biden's path forward, even as he largely controls his own fate thanks to sweeping the Democratic presidential primaries," "The Wall Street Journal" reported.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Biden and his team appeared defiant to such a call and asserted that he is in the race. Biden himself has exuded confidence that he would defeat Trump in November.</p>

<p>Biden was in Pennsylvania on Sunday, addressing rallies and meeting people in the key battleground state.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canadian writer <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/5-classic-short-stories-of-canadian-noble-laureate-alice-munro-who-died-at-92-5663690">Alice Munro's daughter</a> said Sunday that her stepfather sexually abused her as a child and that her mother was told but stayed with him, in a damning account published after the Nobel laureate's death.</p>

<p>Andrea Robin Skinner wrote in the Toronto Star that she was nine when, in 1976, "one night, while she (Munro) was away, her husband, my stepfather, Gerald Fremlin, climbed into the bed where I was sleeping and sexually assaulted me."</p>

<p>She wrote that when she was alone with Fremlin -- who died in 2013 -- he "exposed himself during car rides, told me about the little girls in the neighborhood he liked, and described my mother's sexual needs."</p>

<p>Skinner said that, when she was 25, she shared everything that had happened with Munro -- but acclaimed author decided to stay with Fremlin, whom she wed in the 1970s after her first marriage ended.</p>

<p>"She reacted exactly as I had feared she would, as if she had learned of an infidelity," Skinner wrote of Munro.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We all went back to acting as if nothing had happened. It was what we did," she added.</p>

<p>At 38, Skinner said she took her allegations to the police after Munro complimented her husband in a New York Times interview. Fremlin pleaded guilty in 2005 to indecent assault.</p>

<p>"What I wanted was some record of the truth, some public proof that I hadn't deserved what had happened to me," Skinner wrote.</p>

<p>"I also wanted this story, my story, to become part of the stories people tell about my mother," she added.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Emmanuel Macron has avoided his nightmare scenario of the far right coming to power in France but still faces an unprecedented challenge steering his country and the remainder of his presidency through an uncertain future.</p>

<p>Macron's centrist forces performed more strongly than expected in the legislative elections, projected to come in second behind the resurgent left, with the far right that won the first round on June 30 in only third place.</p>

<p>Yet as he prepares to fly to the United States for a NATO summit in Washington, he now faces a number of headaches including a left that now believes it has a mandate to govern, his own unpopularity, and open dissent among some of his most influential allies.</p>

<p>There is still palpable anger among Macron's allies over his decision to call snap legislative elections three years ahead of time after his party was trounced in EU Parliament elections last month.</p>

<p>The president argued that a "clarification" was needed in French politics.</p>

<p>"The decision to dissolve the National Assembly, which was supposed to be a moment of clarification, has instead led to uncertainty," his former Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said Sunday in an unusually sharp barb.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, who said he would offer his resignation Monday but was also prepared to stay on, said in an extraordinary show of dissent after the election that he "did not choose this dissolution".</p>

<h3><strong>'The question now'</strong></h3>

<p>The government's strategy of employing a so-called Republican Front for the centre and left to team up to block the far right appears to have worked.</p>

<p>But the election will mark a turning point in Macron's presidency with three years of his term still to run until 2027, with the very mixed new parliament inevitably becoming a far more important actor.</p>

<p>Macron appeared in no hurry on this occasion to make a rapid and theatrical decision, with an aide briefing media that the president preferred to analyse the full results before jumping to conclusions.</p>

<p>The president is confident "and is not going for a small majority", the aide said. "The question now is who is going to govern and have a majority."</p>

<p>Philippe raised the prospect of a broad coalition that would take in parties from right to left via the centre, but exclude the far-right National Rally (RN) and the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI).</p>

<p>So far the leftist New Popular Front (NFP) has not fractured even if the LFI's firebrand figurehead Jean-Luc Melenchon is a constant source of tension.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne, who leads Macron's party, ruled out that Melenchon "and a certain number of his allies" would govern France.</p>

<p>But Laurent Wauquiez, a senior figure among traditional right-wing lawmakers, who won his seat, appeared to rule out entering into any coalition with Macron.</p>

<h3><strong>'Tide is rising'</strong></h3>

<p>Macron's own popularity has hit such a low that he stayed totally out of the final week of the election campaign, not making a single comment in public as the vastly more popular Attal took the lead.</p>

<p>After voting Sunday he mingled with well-wishers in Le Touquet, but did not repeat his walk through the fashionable Channel resort in a bomber jacket and baseball cap as he did in the June 30 first round, seen as arrogant by some supporters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Political manoeuvring will intensify beneath him. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin, who won his seat, has made it clear he plans to be a leading voice in the new parliament, possibly in alliance with the faction of Philippe.</p>

<p>And while the far right was defeated in these elections, its three-time presidential candidate Marine Le Pen said she believed this would have no impact on her ambition to win the Elysee Palace in 2027.</p>

<p>"The tide is rising. It did not rise high enough this time, but it continues to rise and, consequently, our victory has only been delayed," Le Pen said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon's Hezbollah movement said on Sunday it launched its "largest" air operation, sending explosive drones at a mountaintop Israeli military intelligence base in the annexed Golan Heights.</p>

<p>It is the latest incident among escalating cross-border exchanges of fire that have triggered global alarm.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, an Iran-backed Hamas ally, has traded almost daily fire with Israeli forces since the Palestinian group's October 7 attack on Israel triggered war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Announcing "the largest operation" carried out by its aerial forces, Hezbollah said in a statement that its fighters sent "multiple, successive squadrons of drones to target the reconnaissance centre" on Mount Hermon.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said an explosive drone "fell in an open area in the Mount Hermon area" but there were "no injuries".</p>

<p>Attacks as well as rhetoric have escalated in recent weeks, spurring fears of an all-out conflict between Israel and Hezbollah which last went to war in 2006.</p>

<p>The Lebanese movement said the drone attack was part of its "response" to the killing of an operative in a strike Saturday deep into east Lebanon around 100 kilometres (60 miles) from the border.</p>

<p>The Mount Hermon attack targeted intelligence systems, "destroying them and starting a major fire", Hezbollah said.</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant visited troops on Mount Hermon earlier on Sunday, his office said.</p>

<p>In two additional statements, the military said its air defences "successfully intercepted" several "aerial targets" that crossed from Lebanon after sirens sounded in the Golan Heights area.</p>

<p>Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967 and later annexed it in a move largely unrecognised by the international community.</p>

<p>The Israeli strike on Saturday killed "a key operative in Hezbollah's Aerial Defence Unit", the military has said.</p>

<p>Throughout Sunday, Hezbollah announced four more attacks on Israeli military sites across the border with barrages of rockets as well as some guided missiles. Israeli authorities reported four wounded.</p>

<p>Gallant, in a video from Mount Hermon, said that "even if there is a ceasefire" in Gaza, "we will continue fighting and doing everything necessary to bring about the desired result" in the campaign against Hezbollah.</p>

<p>The cross-border violence has killed at least 497 people in Lebanon, mostly fighters but also including 95 civilians, according to an AFP tally.</p>

<p>On the Israeli side, at least 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed, according to the authorities.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of residents have been displaced from the border areas in both southern Lebanon and northern Israel.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris is potentially poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee in the November election. Here are her views and actions related to some key business topics.</p>

<h3><strong>Tech Regulation</strong></h3>

<p>As California attorney general, Harris sued eBay in 2012, alleging anticompetitive hiring practices surrounding a no-poaching agreement with Intuit that led to a nearly $4 million settlement in 2014.</p>

<p>In 2015, she compelled startup Houzz to hire a chief privacy officer after allegations that the home design app had recorded sales calls without proper notification and consent.</p>

<p>One of her signature issues was curtailing the distribution of pornography on social media, particularly "revenge porn," a practice involving the posting of explicit photos without the subject's consent. She took credit for a pressure campaign that led to Facebook, Alphabet's Google, Microsoft and others taking measures to remove certain explicit images.</p>

<p>"I cannot emphasize enough how leaders in technology have stepped up," said Harris at a news conference then. "I'm not suggesting any of them were happy to get a call from the AG saying, 'Come in, we want to talk with you.' But they all did. They did."</p>

<h3><strong>Big Tech</strong></h3>

<p>As a candidate for California attorney general, Harris reportedly assured potential donors that she was "a capitalist." She has generally been seen as cozy with prominent tech executives and investors, the local industry in her home Bay Area. She attended the wedding of Sean Parker, an early Facebook executive. Her brother-in-law, Tony West, is the chief legal officer for Uber.</p>

<p>She also accepted donations from Reid Hoffman, a prominent venture capitalist and co-founder of Linkedin, as well as billionaire John Doerr and venture capitalist Ron Conway. Big tech executives also supported her, including Sheryl Sandberg, then chief operating officer of Facebook, and Marc Benioff, the billionaire CEO of Salesforce.</p>

<h3><strong>Climate And Energy</strong></h3>

<p>Harris' climate and energy positions are similar to Biden's. But throughout her career she has made clear that clean energy and environmental justice are priorities.</p>

<p>When Biden announced Harris as his running mate in the 2020 race, he emphasized her tough stance against big oil when she served in key roles in California, noting lawsuits she had launched both as San Francisco's district attorney from 2004 to 2011 and then as the state's attorney general until January 2017, when she became a U.S. senator.</p>

<p>Last year, Harris made her debut at international climate negotiations, announcing a $3 billion commitment to the Green Climate Fund and making her first major international speech focused on climate.</p>

<p>As vice president, Harris has also been involved in Environmental Protection Agency policy rollouts that tackled long-standing environmental justice issues, such as a multibillion-dollar program to replace lead pipes and lead paint around the country.</p>

<h3><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></h3>

<p>As vice president, Harris has been particularly outspoken on artificial intelligence. She warned against the "existential" threat of AI and said it could "endanger the very existence of humanity," in a November 2023 address.</p>

<p>In meeting with tech execs like Microsoft's Satya Nadella, OpenAI's Sam Altman and Alphabet's Sundar Pichai, Harris warned that they have a "moral" obligation to guard against AI's possible dangers.</p>

<p>She backed an AI executive order from Biden that seeks stronger protections for consumers, singling out AI-generated scam calls and the impacts of unlabeled AI-generated content.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to stick largely to Joe Biden's foreign policy playbook on key issues such as Ukraine, China and Iran but could strike a tougher tone with Israel over the Gaza war if she replaces the president at the top of the Democratic ticket and wins the U.S. November election.</p>

<p>As the apparent frontrunner for the nomination after Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed her on Sunday, Harris would bring on-the-job experience, personal ties forged with world leaders, and a sense of global affairs gained during a Senate term and as Biden's second-in-command.</p>

<p>But running against Republican candidate Donald Trump she would also have a major vulnerability - a troubled situation at the U.S.-Mexico border that has bedeviled Biden and become a top campaign issue. Harris was tasked at the start of his term with addressing the root causes of high irregular migration, and Republicans have sought to make her the face of the problem.</p>

<p>On a range of global priorities, said analysts, a Harris presidency would resemble a second Biden administration.</p>

<p>"She may be a more energetic player but one thing you shouldn't expect - any immediate big shifts in the substance of Biden's foreign policy," said Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East negotiator for Democratic and Republican administrations.</p>

<p>Harris has signaled, for instance, that she would not deviate from Biden's staunch support for NATO and would continue backing Ukraine in its fight against Russia. That stands in sharp contrast to a pledge by former president Trump to fundamentally alter the U.S. relationship with the alliance and the doubts he has raised about future weapons supplies to Kyiv.</p>

<h3><strong>Staying On The Course On China?</strong></h3>

<p>A lawyer by training and a former California attorney general, Harris struggled in the first half of Biden's term to find her footing, not helped by being saddled early on with a major part of the intractable immigration portfolio amid record crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>

<p>That followed a failed 2020 presidential campaign that was widely considered lackluster.</p>

<p>If she becomes the nominee, Democrats will be hoping Harris will be more effective at communicating her foreign policy goals.</p>

<p>In the second half of Biden's presidency, Harris - the country's first Black and Asian American vice president - has elevated her profile on issues ranging from China and Russia to Gaza and become a known quantity to many world leaders.</p>

<p>At this year's Munich Security Conference she delivered a tough speech slamming Russia for its invasion of Ukraine and pledging "ironclad" U.S. respect for NATO's Article 5 requirement for mutual self-defense.</p>

<p>On China, Harris has long positioned herself within Washington's bipartisan mainstream on the need for the U.S. to counter China's influence, especially in Asia. She would likely maintain Biden's stance of confronting Beijing when necessary while also seeking areas of cooperation, analysts say.</p>

<p>Harris has made several trips aimed at boosting relations in the economically dynamic region, including one to Jakarta in September to fill in for Biden at a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). During the visit, Harris accused China of trying to coerce smaller neighbors with its territorial claims in the disputed South China Sea.</p>

<p>Biden also dispatched Harris on travels to shore up alliances with Japan and South Korea, key allies who have had reason to worry about Trump's commitment to their security.</p>

<p>"She demonstrated to the region that she was enthusiastic to promote the Biden focus on the Indo-Pacific," said Murray Hiebert, a senior associate of the Southeast Asia Program at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p>

<p>While she could not match the "diplomatic chops" Biden had developed over decades, "she did fine," he added.</p>

<p>However, like her boss, Harris has been prone to the occasional verbal gaffe. On a tour of the Demilitarized Zone between South and North Korea in September 2022 to reassert Washington's support for Seoul, she mistakenly touted a U.S. "alliance with the Republic of North Korea," which aides later corrected.</p>

<p>If Harris becomes her party's standard-bearer and can overcome Trump's lead in pre-election opinion polls to win the White House, the Israel-Palestinian conflict would rank high on her agenda, especially if the Gaza war is still raging.</p>

<p>Although as vice president she has mostly echoed Biden in firmly backing Israel's right to defend itself after Hamas carried out a deadly cross-border raid on Oct. 7, she has at times stepped out slightly ahead of the president in criticizing Israel's military approach.</p>

<p>In March, she bluntly criticized Israel, saying it was not doing enough to ease a "humanitarian catastrophe" during its ground offensive in the Palestinian enclave. Later that month, she did not rule out "consequences" for Israel if it launched a full-scale invasion of refugee-packed Rafah in southern Gaza.</p>

<p>Such language has raised the possibility that Harris, as president, might take at least a stronger rhetorical line with Israel than Biden, analysts say.</p>

<p>While her 81-year-old boss has a long history with a succession of Israeli leaders and has even called himself a "Zionist," Harris, 59, lacks his visceral personal connection to the country.</p>

<p>She maintains closer ties to Democratic progressives, some of whom have pressed Biden to attach conditions to U.S. weapons shipments to Israel out of concern for high Palestinian civilian casualties in the Gaza conflict.</p>

<p>But analysts do not expect there would be a big shift in U.S. policy toward Israel, Washington's closest ally in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Halie Soifer, who served as national security adviser to Harris during the then-senator's first two years in Congress, from 2017 to 2018, said Harris' support of Israel has been just as strong as Biden's. "There really has been no daylight to be found" between the two, she said.</p>

<h3><strong>Iran Nuclear Threat</strong></h3>

<p>Harris could also be expected to hold firm against Israel's regional arch-foe, Iran, whose recent nuclear advances have drawn increased U.S. condemnation.</p>

<p>Jonathan Panikoff, formerly the U.S. government's deputy national intelligence officer for the Middle East, said the growing threat of "weaponization" of Iran's nuclear program could be an early major challenge for a Harris administration, especially if Tehran decides to test the new U.S. leader.</p>

<p>After a series of failed attempts, Biden has shown little interest in returning to negotiations with Tehran over resuming the 2015 international nuclear agreement, which Trump abandoned during his presidency.</p>

<p>Harris, as president, would be unlikely to make any major overtures without serious signs that Iran is ready to make concessions.</p>

<p>Even so, Panikoff, now at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, said: "There's every reason to believe the next president will have to deal with Iran. It's bound to be one of the biggest problems."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden's withdrawal from the US election offers Democrats the precious opportunity for a late reset in a campaign that was going badly -- but ushers in an uncertain few weeks that will make or break their chances against Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Grassroots voters will hope to be better served than they were during the initial nomination race, when Democrats put up no serious competition to the 81-year-old president's candidacy despite worries over his age.</p>

<p>"Remarkable leadership shown by Joe Biden. Now it falls to the (Democrats) to show equal leadership by having an open process to determine the best candidate(s) to take on Trump-Vance in November," said entrepreneur Andrew Yang, who ran against Biden for the party's nomination in 2020.</p>

<p>"The goal should be simple -- to win," he wrote on X.</p>

<p>With Biden's endorsement, Vice President Kamala Harris, 59, starts out in the strongest position to replace him and may be able to consolidate support in the coming days -- a coronation that would allow Democrats to turn their fire on Trump.</p>

<p>If that doesn't happen then a chaotic -- and potentially damaging -- fight for the votes of almost 4,000 delegates at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in just four weeks looks more likely.</p>

<p>The party's national chairman Jaime Harrison promised a "transparent and orderly process" to replace Biden, the first president since Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968 not to seek a second term.</p>

<h3><strong>Kamala the prosecutor</strong></h3>

<p>His campaign began collapsing after his dismal debate performance against Trump last month prompted concerns over his advanced years and mental capacity.</p>

<p>Trump, who would be 82 at the end of a second term, appeared more robust -- but opposition from a younger candidate would turn the spotlight on his speeches and interviews, where he often appears incoherent and confuses names.</p>

<p>Several rising Democratic stars -- all younger than 60 -- have been floated as Biden alternatives, including governors Josh Shapiro, Gretchen Whitmer and Gavin Newsom.</p>

<p>Whitmer immediately appeared to suggest she would not be running and Newsom has previously said he would not challenge Harris, but neither explicitly ruled themselves out.</p>

<p>A campaign led by Harris and backed up by a moderate midwestern running mate could present the best chance for Democrats -- helping turn out more women, who historically vote in greater numbers than men and are a weakness for Trump.</p>

<p>Harris would also give Democrats a chance to redefine the race at their convention as a clash of cultures between a former prosecutor and a convicted felon.</p>

<p>"While she has largely been in the shadows for the last four years it is time for Kamala the prosecutor... to make her comeback," said Sara Sadhwani, an assistant professor of politics at Pomona College in Claremont, California.</p>

<p>A new survey from Democratic polling firm Public Policy Polling released Thursday found that Harris -- with the right running mate -- could defeat Trump and Vance in Pennsylvania and Michigan, two of the three "Blue Wall" states seen as critical to electing a Democratic president.</p>

<h3><strong>Clean break?</strong></h3>

<p>Ryan Waite, a political marketing expert from Brigham Young University-Idaho, told AFP a contested nomination might actually benefit Democrats by depriving Trump of headlines for several months.</p>

<p>"A new Democrat candidate will benefit from a short vetting window and significant earned media impact right before the election," he told AFP. "The story is now who will it be and that will take the air out of the room through their convention."</p>

<p>Any new nominee other than Harris would represent a clean break and be immune from much of the criticism directed at the Biden administration over high inflation, the border crisis and the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.</p>

<p>But while Harris would likely inherit all of the Biden campaign's cash reserves -- about $94 million as of July -- other candidates may have to share the money with down-ballot candidates.</p>

<p>They would also have to make the case anew for endorsements from some of the Biden-Harris campaign's most influential backers, such as the United Auto Workers union. Harris herself could also face this problem, of course.</p>

<p>Republicans have suggested that they might challenge any late substitutions in the courts but Marc Elias, the Democrats' top election lawyer vowed that the eventual nominee would be on all 50 state ballots.</p>

<p>"There is no basis for any legal challenge. Period," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yemen's Houthi rebels on Sunday promised a "huge" retaliation against Israel for a deadly strike on the port of Hodeida, as regional fallout widens from months of war in Gaza.</p>

<p>The Israeli strike, the first claimed by Israel in Yemen, set oil tanks ablaze at the vital port and came a day after the first fatal attack by the Houthis in Israel.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Israel said it intercepted a missile fired from Yemen and struck targets in southern Lebanon. Residents of southern Gaza reported combat in the Rafah area.</p>

<p>The fighting across the region came ahead of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's trip this week to Washington, which has been trying to secure a ceasefire in the more than nine-month war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas in Gaza.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Netanyahu's office said he was sending a negotiating team -- it was unclear where -- for new talks on a deal under which hostages held by Hamas would be freed.</p>

<p>But Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry warned Israel's attack on Hodeida "aggravates the current tension in the region and halts the ongoing efforts to end the war in Gaza".</p>

<p>Dozens have been killed since Saturday across Gaza, the civil defence agency in the Hamas-run territory said, including in strikes on homes in the central Nuseirat and Bureij areas and near southern Khan Yunis.</p>

<p>Residents said a major operation was underway in a district west of Rafah, where they reported heavy artillery and clashes.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, chief of the Iran-backed group, said the Hodeida strikes would lead to "further escalation and more attacks targeting Israel". He said the deadly Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv had opened "a new phase" in operations.</p>

<p>Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree said the rebels' "response to the Israeli aggression against our country is inevitably coming and will be huge".</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the fire left raging by the strikes on rebel-held Hodeida port "is seen across the Middle East and the significance is clear".</p>

<p>Gallant warned of further operations if the Houthis "dare to attack us" after the rebel strike hit Tel Aviv, at least 1,800 kilometres (1,119 miles) from Yemen.</p>

<p>It appeared to be the first to pierce Israel's intricate air defences but an analyst said Houthi drones do not pose a "strategic threat" to Israel.</p>

<h3><strong>Fuel storage tanks</strong></h3>

<p>In Hodeida, six people were killed and 83 wounded, health officials said in a statement carried by Houthi media.</p>

<p>AFPTV images showed heavy flames and black smoke spiralling into the sky from burning oil tanks. Debris covered the dock where equipment was damaged.</p>

<p>Hodeida port is a vital entry point for fuel imports and international aid for rebel-held areas of Yemen, a country where the United Nations says more than half the population needs humanitarian assistance.</p>

<p>Analysts say the strike on Hodeida will likely only embolden the Houthis. They have already withstood since January repeated United States and British strikes aimed at deterring recurrent Houthi attacks on shipping.</p>

<p>The rebels also endured thousands of air raids during nearly a decade of war against forces backing Yemen's internationally-recognised government.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the Israeli military said it had intercepted a missile fired from Yemen towards the Red Sea resort town of Eilat. The rebel spokesman said ballistic missiles were fired towards the port.</p>

<p>In Lebanon, Iran-backed and Hamas-allied Hezbollah said it fired Katyusha rockets and drones at northern Israel after Israeli strikes hit a weapons depot and wounded six civilians.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, which reported three more of its fighters killed, said Israel's strikes on its Yemeni allies marked "a new, dangerous phase".</p>

<h3><strong>Netanyahu to Washington</strong></h3>

<p>The Gaza war was triggered by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 42 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel has killed at least 38,983 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the Gaza health ministry.</p>

<p>The war has left most of Gaza's population displaced, much of the housing and other infrastructure destroyed, and essential goods in short supply as the UN says diseases are spreading.</p>

<p>Israel has started vaccinating its troops in Gaza against polio and supplying vaccines for the Palestinian population after health agencies said the virus was found there, the military said.</p>

<p>The war has brought Israelis to the streets, sometimes in their tens of thousands, demanding a deal to free remaining hostages.</p>

<p>On Sunday they protested at Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv ahead of Netanyahu's meetings in the United States where he will be under pressure to reach a ceasefire with Hamas.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>U.S. President Joe Biden on Sunday ended his reelection campaign. He said in a letter posted on social media platform X that he would remain in office until the end of his term and address the country later this week on his decision.</p>

<p>Below are reactions from politicians, industry and advocacy groups and other observers.</p>

<h3><strong>Vice President Kamala Harris</strong></h3>

<p>"I am honored to have the president's endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination," Harris said in a statement. "I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party - and unite our nation - to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda."</p>

<h3><strong>Former President Donald Trump</strong></h3>

<p>In a phone call with CNN minutes after Biden announced his exit from the 2024 race, former President Trump responded, "He is the worst president in the history of our country. He goes down as the single worst president by far in the history of our country." Trump also said he thought Vice President Kamala Harris will be easier to defeat than Biden would have been, according to CNN.</p>

<h3><strong>Former President Barack Obama</strong></h3>

<p>"I also know Joe has never backed down from a fight. For him to look at the political landscape and decide that he should pass the torch to a new nominee is surely one of the toughest in his life. But I know he wouldn't make this decision unless he believed it was right for America," the former president said in a statement. "I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges."</p>

<h3><strong>Chuck Schumer, Senate Majority Leader</strong></h3>

<p>"Joe Biden has not only been a great president and a great legislative leader but he is a truly amazing human being. His decision of course was not easy, but he once again put his country, his party, and our future first. Joe, today shows you are a true patriot and great American," the Democrat said in a statement.</p>

<h3><strong>Elise Stefanik, House Republican Conference Chairwoman</strong></h3>

<p>"If Joe Biden can't run for re-election, he is unable and unfit to serve as President of the United States. He must immediately resign," Stefanik said in a statement.</p>

<h3><strong>Independent Presidential Candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</strong></h3>

<p>"I commend President Biden for stepping down. His infirmities were evident to any unbiased observer from the beginning. It was this progressive deterioration - and his abandonment of Democratic Party principles - that prompted me to enter the race and ensure American voters had a viable, vigorous alternative to Donald Trump," Kennedy said in a post on X.</p>

<h3><strong>Hakeem Jeffries, House Democratic Leader</strong></h3>

<p>"America is a better place today because President Joe Biden has led us with intellect, grace and dignity. We are forever grateful," Jeffries said in a statement.</p>

<h3><strong>Steve Scalise, House Majority Leader</strong></h3>

<p>"Democrat party bosses just proved that they have absolutely no respect for their own voters. After lecturing others about democracy, they just forced Joe Biden off the ticket-trashing the primary choice of 14 million of their own voters," Scalise, a Republican, said on X.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Congressional Black Caucus Political Action Committee</strong></h3>

<p>"Americans and democracy-loving people world owe Joe Biden a debt of gratitude. The Congressional Black Caucus PAC joins President Biden in fully supporting Kamala Harris as our party's nominee," the organization said in a statement posted to X.</p>

<h3><strong>Nancy Pelosi, Former House Speaker</strong></h3>

<p>"President Joe Biden is a patriotic American who has always put our country first. His legacy of vision, values and leadership make him one of the most consequential Presidents in American history. With love and gratitude to President Biden for always believing in the promise of America and giving people the opportunity to reach their fulfillment. God blessed America with Joe Biden's greatness and goodness."</p>

<h3><strong>Gavin Newsom, Governor Of California</strong></h3>

<p>"President Biden has been an extraordinary, history-making president - a leader who has fought hard for working people and delivered astonishing results for all Americans. He will go down in history as one of the most impactful and selfless presidents," Newsom posted on X.</p>

<h3><strong>Nanette Barragan, Chair Of The Congressional Hispanic Caucus</strong></h3>

<p>"I am with you @JoeBiden - I endorse @KamalaHarris as our Democratic nominee &amp; will work tirelessly to make sure she is elected our next President in November," Barragán said in a post on X.</p>

<h3><strong>South Carolina Democratic Congressman Jim Clyburn</strong></h3>

<p>"I echo the good judgment [President Biden] demonstrated in selecting Vice President Harris to lead this nation alongside him, and I am proud to follow his lead in support of her candidacy to succeed him as the Democratic Party's 2024 nominee for president," Clyburn said in a statement</p>

<h3><strong>Andy Beshear, Governor Of Kentucky</strong></h3>

<p>Beshear, whose name has also been floated as a possible contender as president or vice president, praised Biden for acting "in the best interest of our country, and our party" and "for a successful presidency that got big, important things done."</p>

<p>"Now it is time for our nation to come together," he added in his post on X.</p>

<h3><strong>Peter Welch, US Senator</strong></h3>

<p>Welch, the first Democratic Senator to call on Joe Biden to drop his reelection run, on Sunday praised the president for ending his quest, saying he showed "good judgment and great humility" and "put the country first."</p>

<p>"It was an agonizing decision," Welch said in an interview with Reuters. "Every fiber of his being wanted to continue to fight and to beat Trump again."</p>

<p>Welch declined to endorse Harris, who he acknowledged was the frontrunner to replace Biden.</p>

<p>The Democrats should have "an open process so that whoever our nominee is, including Kamala, has the strength of having a process that shows the consensus position of the party," he said.</p>

<h3><strong>Barbara Lee, US Representative</strong></h3>

<p>Lee, a former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, said in a phone interview there is "no other option" but to choose Harris as the party's nominee.</p>

<p>"She is the best vice president," Lee said. "She is experienced, capable and smart. She has been a part of the Biden-Harris legacy that needs to continue."</p>

<h3><strong>Gretchen Whitmer, Governor Of Michigan</strong></h3>

<p>"President Biden is a great public servant who knows better than anyone what it takes to defeat Donald Trump. His remarkable work to lower prescription drug costs, fix the damn roads, bring supply chains home, address climate change, and ensure America's global leadership over decades will go down in history. My job in this election will remain the same: doing everything I can to elect Democrats and stop Donald Trump, a convicted felon whose agenda of raising families' costs, banning abortion nationwide, and abusing the power of the White House to settle his own scores is completely wrong for Michigan," Whitmer said on X.</p>

<h3><strong>United Auto Workers</strong></h3>

<p>"Vice President Kamala Harris walked the picket line with us in 2019, and along with President Biden has brought work and jobs back to communities like Lordstown, Ohio, and Belvidere, Illinois. That's the legacy President Biden leaves and that's the work we will continue to build on as a union," the union said in a statement.</p>

<h3><strong>Dick Durbin, Senator And Majority Whip</strong></h3>

<p>"Throughout his public career, Joe Biden always put country first. His four years as President made it clear that he was determined to put our country back on track and restore the soul of our nation. America will be forever grateful for all he has given to this country," Durbin posted on X.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The Clintons</strong></h3>

<p>"We are honored to join the President in endorsing Vice President Harris and will do whatever we can to support her," the Clintons said in a statement. &nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senator JD Vance, the Republican nominee for Vice-President, sought to tie Vice-President Kamala Harris, who could become the Democratic nominee for President, to President Joe Biden's presidency, saying the latter was the "worst President in my lifetime" and Harris was with him every step of the way.</p>

<p>Vance finds himself in a strange situation. From preparing to take on Harris in a Vice-Presidential debate, he does not know who he will face.</p>

<p>"Joe Biden has been the worst President in my lifetime and Kamala Harris has been right there with him every step of the way," Vance said in a post on X.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Vance ended on a note of nonchalance. "President Trump and I are ready to save America, whoever's at the top of the Democrat ticket. Bring it on," he wrote in conclusion.</p>

<p>If Harris secures the nomination, which she might as she has already been endorsed by Biden, former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, with more endorsements on the way. Several names are doing the rounds for her running mate, including Roy Cooper, the Governor of North Carolina, a swing state; Senator Mark Kelly from Arizona, another swing state; and Andy Beshear, Governor of Kentucky, a Republican-ruled state.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four years ago, as he ran for the White House, Joe Biden saw himself as a one-term president -- a savvy conduit from the chaotic years of Donald Trump to a new generation of Democratic leaders.</p>

<p>"Look, I view myself as a bridge, not as anything else," Biden said at a campaign event in March 2020, with a group of much younger politicians vying to be his running mate -- including Kamala Harris, who ultimately got the nod.</p>

<p>"There's an entire generation of leaders you saw stand behind me. They are the future of this country," said Biden, who went on to beat Trump, though the Republican never accepted his defeat.</p>

<p>It was widely seen as his main mission -- dislodge Trump from the White House, then bow out, with elegance, after one term.</p>

<p>Biden, now 81, will indeed be a one-term president, but under tumultuous, agonizing circumstances: long-simmering worries about his age and mental sharpness have exploded to doom him when he decided to go for a second term after all.</p>

<p>On Sunday Biden said he was dropping his bid to run against Trump again in November, yielding to intense and growing pressure as polls showed most people even in his own Democratic Party felt he was too old to run for another term, much less serve four more years.</p>

<h3><strong>Defiance to dropping out</strong></h3>

<p>Presidents tend to see their party take a beating in congressional elections held half way through their term, but Biden and his Democrats did surprisingly well in 2022. A feared hemorraghing of Democratic seats failed to materialize.</p>

<p>This was due in part to Americans' anger over the Supreme Court's ending of the 50-year-old federal right to abortion -- the decision of a court with three new conservatives judges appointed by Trump.</p>

<p>Energized by that strong showing, months later Biden announced that he would seek a second term after all.</p>

<p>"When I ran for president four years ago, I said we are in a battle for the soul of America. And we still are," Biden said in April 2023.</p>

<p>"The question we are facing is whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom. More rights or fewer," Biden said in a video announcing his 2024 run.</p>

<p>Biden and his party went through the motions of the Democratic primary elections with no serious opposition, although some in the party grumbled that Biden was too old to seek a second term.</p>

<p>"No, I've been very clear. I'd like to see a generational change," said Tim Ryan, a Democratic senator from Ohio.</p>

<p>Polls had long shown that many people considered Biden's age an issue, and for him the beginning of the end came on a debate stage with Trump in Atlanta on June 27.</p>

<p>As 50 million people watched on TV, the president performed dismally, struggling to complete sentences, speaking incoherently at times and looking dazed, his mouth agape.</p>

<p>A drum roll of calls for him to bow out began immediately, and grew steadily louder, amid warnings to Biden that he could not beat Trump, might destroy his own legacy if he insisted on running and lost, and could might well drag the Democratic Party down with him in defeat.</p>

<p>To the very end Biden insisted, day after day, he was all in -- the only candidate who could beat Trump as he had once before.</p>

<p>As he isolated at his beach house this weekend to recover from a Covid infection, Biden announced he would go back on the campaign trail next week.</p>

<p>Until Sunday's bomb dropped in a message on X. He said it was in the interest of the country and his party for him to step aside.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Democratic party will be taking a historic gamble if it now turns to Vice President Kamala Harris to become its presidential candidate, betting that a Black woman can overcome racism, sexism and her own missteps as a politician to defeat Republican Donald Trump.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden, 81, announced on Sunday he was ending his campaign for reelection, while staying on as president for the remainder of his term. In a separate post on X, formerly Twitter, he endorsed Harris.</p>

<p>"My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President. And it's been the best decision I've made," Biden wrote. "Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year."</p>

<p>Biden's decision comes after weeks of pressure from Democratic lawmakers and donors who feared he lacked the mental and physical stamina to win and serve four more years.</p>

<p>In more than two centuries of democracy, American voters have elected only one Black president and never a woman, a record that makes even some Black voters wonder if Harris can crash through the hardest ceiling in U.S. politics.</p>

<p>"Will her race and gender be an issue? Absolutely," said LaTosha Brown, a political strategist and co-founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Harris would face other big challenges: if promoted to the top of the ticket, she would have barely three months to campaign and unite the party and donors behind her. But many Democrats are excited about her chances.</p>

<p>Harris, 59, is two decades younger than Trump and a leader in the party on abortion rights, an issue which resonates with younger voters and Democrats' progressive base. Proponents argue she would energize those voters, consolidate Black support, and bring sharp debating skills to prosecute the political case against the former president.</p>

<p>Her candidacy would offer a contrast with Trump and his vice presidential running mate, Senator J.D. Vance, the two white men on the Republican ticket, Brown said.</p>

<p>"That to me is reflective of America's past. She is reflective of America's now and future," Brown said.</p>

<p>But despite earning praise in the last few weeks for her strong defense of Biden, some Democrats remain concerned about Harris' shaky first two years in office, short-lived campaign for the 2020 Democratic nomination, and - perhaps most of all - the weight of a long history of racial and gender discrimination in the United States.</p>

<h3><strong>'No Safe Option'</strong></h3>

<p>In a hypothetical head-to-head matchup, Harris and Trump were tied with 44% support each in a July 15-16 Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted immediately after the assassination attempt against Trump. Trump led Biden 43% to 41% in that same poll, though the 2 percentage point difference was within the poll's 3 percentage point margin of error.</p>

<p>Harris's approval ratings, while low, are a tick higher than Biden's. According to polling outfit Five Thirty Eight, 38.6 percent of Americans approve of Harris while 50.4 percent disapprove. Biden has 38.5 percent approval and 56.2 percent disapproval.</p>

<p>"If you think that there is consensus among the people who want Joe Biden to leave that they will support Kamala - Vice President Harris - you would be mistaken," Representative Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, a Biden supporter, said on Instagram. "There's no safe option."</p>

<p>The United States elected Barack Obama, the first and only Black president, in 2008. The only woman to head a presidential ticket of a major party, Hillary Clinton, lost to Trump in 2016.</p>

<p>Supporters of Harris, the first woman and first Black and South Asian person to serve as vice president, argue she has already weathered unfair attacks related to her race and gender and is prepared for more.</p>

<p>"America has a history of racism, sexism, so I'm sure that will factor into this conversation, factor into her campaign," said Jamal Simmons, a former Harris aide.</p>

<p>But he said there is a flip side: Black voters could be galvanized if Harris is put at the top of the ticket, and women, including some who regret not voting for Clinton in 2016, would back her as well.</p>

<p>"It's also true that she will benefit from her race and her gender, that many African Americans may rally to her candidacy," he said.</p>

<p>Harris benefits from greater name recognition than the other Democratic leaders who have been floated as potential presidential candidates, he said. California Governor Gavin Newsom and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer are among those talked about in Democratic circles as possible replacements.</p>

<p>"While she has flaws and faults like everyone, we know those flaws and faults, so you can build a campaign with clarity. Any other candidates are complete unknowns," Simmons said.</p>

<p>One former Democratic lawmaker, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he thought Harris was a bigger risk because of her record than her race.</p>

<p>Harris was plagued by staff turnover at the beginning of her vice presidency and showed little progress on her portfolios of protecting voting rights and stemming migration from Central America.</p>

<p>"I think the race thing is just a compounding factor or an exacerbating factor," the former lawmaker said. "Any of it's going to be a gamble, but I like the odds with another candidate, even if that means Kamala at the top of the ticket."</p>

<h3><strong>'Patriarchy Is Hell Of A Drug'</strong></h3>

<p>Critics have accused Trump of using racist and sexist language, explicitly and in code. In 2020 he said he had "heard" Harris, a U.S. citizen born in California, did not qualify to be a candidate for vice president.</p>

<p>At a rally in Michigan on Saturday, Trump piled on Harris for the way she laughs.</p>

<p>"I call her Laughing Kamala," Trump said. "You ever watch her laugh? She's crazy."</p>

<p>Trump's campaign said Democrats were deploying "classic disinformation" about his language and noted Harris's dispute with Biden in a 2019 debate about school busing and her criticism of Biden for working with segregationists in the Senate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In contrast, President Trump is polling at record-high levels with African Americans," Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump made false "birtherism" claims against Obama, who was born in Hawaii. Those falsehoods gained traction among far-right activists and his nationalist base, prompting an exasperated Obama, blasting "carnival barkers," to release a longer version of his birth certificate from the White House.</p>

<p>Polling at the time showed a quarter of all Americans - and 45 percent of Republicans - believed Obama had not been born in the country.</p>

<p>"You've got birtherism 2.0," said Cliff Albright, co-founder and CEO of Black Voters Matter Fund, an Atlanta-based non-profit, referring to Harris.</p>

<p>Nadia Brown, director of the women's and gender studies program at Georgetown University, said despite the rise of Black political leaders, there remains a notable reluctance to accept women in key leadership roles.</p>

<p>"Patriarchy is a hell of a drug," Brown said. "With racism, we know it, we can call it out. The mood that we're not seeing as articulately expressed is a real reticence to have a Black woman in particular as a leader."</p>

<p>Harris's standing in the party has improved with her aggressive advocacy for reproductive rights after the Supreme Court in 2022 struck down Roe v Wade, which protected women's right to abortion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Biden credited her with helping to prevent a "red wave" of Republican victories in that year's midterm elections, and Harris has crisscrossed the country as a top campaign spokesperson on abortion rights.</p>

<p>Harris could also inherit Biden's strong support among Black voters, who helped propel him to the 2020 Democratic nomination.</p>

<p>But if the party ends up coalescing around Harris, she could receive some of the blame from voters who say Democratic leaders covered up Biden's frailties.</p>

<p>"I'm kind of done with the Democrats. So many knew about Biden's condition and hid it. Kamala was part of that," said Gina Gannon, 65, a retiree in the battleground state of Georgia, who voted for Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden's shock decision Sunday to end his reelection bid drew an outpouring of heartfelt reactions from American voters.</p>

<p>Several people expressed deep sadness that Biden, 81, had essentially been forced out after what they saw as an effective first term.</p>

<p>But others said the decision was a relief, given the growing calls for him to step down, and the clear signs of aging seen in his debate against Republican Donald Trump and other appearances.</p>

<p>Here is a selection of their comments.</p>

<p>"It's a shame. But the leader of the free world needs to be sharp, and needs to be on his game.... He is a kind man, he cares about our country, and so for him to be somewhat forced out of his position that he loved so much -- he served our nation for a long, long time -- it is sad." -- Thomas Watson, 67, amateur presidential historian, interviewed in Grand Rapids, Michigan.</p>

<p>"I think that Biden brought it upon himself. His performance has been a debacle. I think that it made the public very nervous as far as him going into this presidential race as a contender against Donald Trump, who is, although, an older individual as well." -- Tayaba Zahra, a 41-year-old lawyer, in New York.</p>

<p>"It's not a surprise. His mental decline has been obvious, I think. And it's a shame" -- Thomas Watson, 67, an amateur presidential historian at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum, in Grand Rapids, Michigan.</p>

<p>"The honest truth is I do think he wasn't equipped... (but) I'm sure for him personally this is a personal kind of devastation." -- Ingrid Gonzalez, 46-year-old entrepreneur and self-described independent, in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>"I'm stunned. And happy - because the decision has finally been made, and now the Democratic Party can get their crap together and figure it out." -- Barb Katz, 59, a retired teacher from Illinois visiting Grand Rapids.</p>

<p>"I hope that there's no nonsense and they put Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket... Think about how invigorated the Democratic Party is going to be." -- Jill Lake, a Democratic voter from Maryland, interviewed in Grand Rapids.</p>

<p>"It makes me nervous in other ways because I don't know that this country is ready to elect a Black woman. But I think that we have to get ready, quick." -- Mary Biggs, a 58-year-old educator, in New York.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican Party presidential candidate Donald Trump crowed, "the Corrupt and Radical Democrats are throwing him overboard" after President Joe Biden announced he was dropping out of the race for the White House.</p>

<p>"He was annihilated in an Earth Shattering Debate," Trump posted on Saturday on Truth Social, the X-like social media platform he uses, mangling the capitalisation of his text.</p>

<p>After the June 27 debate in which his performance raised questions about cognitive abilities and his capacity to match Trump's campaign vitality, Biden announced he was dropping out of the race and endorsing Vice-President Kamala Harris to be the Democratic Party candidate.</p>

<p>Trump piled on personal insults and questions about Biden's performance in the post, "Crooked Joe Biden is the Worst President, by far, in the History of our Nation."</p>

<p>"He has done everything possible to destroy our Country, from our Southern Border, to Energy Dominance, National Security, International Standing, and so much more," Trump said repeating his constant refrain.</p>

<p>Trump alleged that "the people around him lied to America about his Complete and Total Mental, Physical, and Cognitive Demise" to prop up Biden.</p>

<p>Trump did not mention Harris, but said, "Whoever the Left puts up now will just be more of the same."</p>

<p>On Saturday at a campaign rally, Trump ridiculed Harris.</p>

<p>He said, "Kamaala, I call her laughing Kamaala. Have you seen her laughing? She is crazy. You can tell a lot by a laugh. She is nuts. She is not as crazy as (former Speaker) Nancy Pelosi."</p>

<p>CNN reported that Trump said that she (Harris) will be easier to defeat than Biden.</p>

<p>Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. fired the opening salvo on his father's behalf, "Kamala Harris owns the entire Left-wing policy record of Joe Biden. The only difference is that she is even more liberal and less competent than Joe, which is really saying something.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Biden had "every right" to run for reelection, the former president said in a statement, lauding the 81-year-old's record and calling him a "patriot of the highest order."</p>

<p>"We will be navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead. But I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges," he continued.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If a week is a long time in politics, the last eight days of the US presidential campaign have proved a drama of epic proportions.</p>

<p>Joe Biden's shock decision Sunday to drop out of the 2024 presidential race capped a head-spinning week that began with the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, and has left Americans reeling.</p>

<p>Here is how the week unfolded:</p>

<h3><strong>Saturday: Trump assassination bid</strong></h3>

<p>Republican candidate Donald Trump survives an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, when a 20-year-old on a nearby rooftop opened fire.</p>

<p>Pictures of the bloodied candidate defiantly shaking his fist as Secret Service agents rush him from the stage become iconic, galvanizing his supporters.</p>

<h3><strong>Monday: Republican National Convention begins</strong></h3>

<p>Trump appears before a roaring crowd at the Republican National Convention, his ear -- wounded in the assassination attempt -- covered by a white bandage. He names Ohio Senator J.D. Vance as his running mate.</p>

<h3><strong>Wednesday: Pressure on Biden increases</strong></h3>

<p>Biden's support continues to ebb following his disastrous June 27 debate with Trump, as Democratic fears grow over the 81-year-old's age and ability to beat Trump at the polls -- then serve another four years.</p>

<p>A top Democratic lawmaker, Adam Schiff, joins a fast-growing list of party officials urging the president to step aside, praising him but saying "our nation is at a crossroads."</p>

<p>Biden is also diagnosed with Covid, forced to step off the campaign trail and retreat to his Delaware home to recover.</p>

<p>In an interview released the same day, he says he could reconsider his election bid if a "medical condition" emerged.</p>

<h3><strong>Thursday: Pelosi, Obama, Trump</strong></h3>

<p>New signs of waning Democrat support emerge: Former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, who had worked to resolve the growing crisis, is said to tell House Democrats the president might be persuaded soon to exit the race.</p>

<p>And Barack Obama, the former president who was once Biden's boss, reportedly tells allies the president should "seriously consider the viability of his candidacy."</p>

<p>In Milwaukee, Trump accepts his nomination at the Republican National Convention, promising an enraptured crowd they can expect an "incredible victory" in November.</p>

<h3><strong>Friday: 'Stakes are high'</strong></h3>

<p>With the list of lawmakers urging Biden to drop out reaching 25, he again insists he will stay in the race, saying, "The stakes are high, and the choice is clear. Together, we will win."</p>

<h3><strong>Saturday: 'Bullet for democracy'</strong></h3>

<p>In his first rally since the attempted assassination, Trump tells a rapt crowd in swing state Michigan "I took a bullet for democracy."</p>

<p>He mocks Democrats' leadership crisis, saying, "They have no idea who their candidate is."</p>

<h3><strong>Sunday: Biden's big decision</strong></h3>

<p>Sunday begins with key Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat-aligned independent, joining the chorus urging Biden to step aside.</p>

<p>Two polls bring grim news for the president, one showing sharply dropping support in battleground state Michigan, the other showing Trump enjoying his highest favorability ratings in years.</p>

<p>At 1.46 pm Washington time (1746 GMT) Biden posts a stunning statement on social media announcing he is ending his candidacy, saying it is "in the best interest of my party and the country."</p>

<p>He endorses Vice President Kamala Harris as the party's new nominee, as top Democrats such as Bill and Hillary Clinton echo their support.</p>

<p>Trump declares on social media that Biden was "not fit to run" and "is certainly not fit to serve." Republicans including House Speaker Mike Johnson insists that Biden "must resign" as president "immediately."</p>

<p>The Democratic Party chairman announces there will be a "transparent and orderly" to pick someone to run in Biden's place.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many Democrats on Sunday quickly backed Vice President Kamala Harris to run as the party's presidential nominee against Donald Trump after incumbent President Joe Biden's abrupt departure from the race, but some powerful party members, including former House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi, stayed quiet. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>After weeks of in-party fighting between Democrats on whether Biden, 81, should stay in the race, a rush of support coalescing behind her is crucial just over 100 days before November's election.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, there are plenty of doubts inside the Democratic Party about whether Harris can beat Trump in November.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Biden himself endorsed Harris on Sunday, not in his initial letter stepping down, but in a separate statement. He was quickly followed by the powerful Congressional Black Caucus, several key donors, lawmakers including U.S. Senator Patty Murray, and super PACs including Priorities USA and Unite the Country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year," Biden said on social media platform X. "Democrats - it's time to come together and beat Trump. Let's do this."</p>

<p>Dmitri Mehlhorn, an adviser to Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn founder and a major Democratic donor, called Harris "the American dream personified," noting she was the daughter of immigrants. "She is also toughness personified, rising from my home town of Oakland California to become the top prosecutor of the state. With Scranton Joe stepping back, I cannot wait to help elect President Harris."</p>

<p>Still, others including Pelosi thanked Biden for his patriotism but did not yet throw their support behind Harris or any other candidate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>U.S. Senator Peter Welch, the first Democratic senator to call on Biden to drop his reelection run, called for an open process to nominate Harris.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Democrats should have "an open process so that whoever our nominee is, including Kamala, has the strength of having a process that shows the consensus position of the party," he said. "The debate in the Democratic Party is who can carry on the legacy of President Biden and defeat Trump."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris has said she was honoured to have President Joe Biden's endorsement as the nominee of the Democratic party for the presidential election and asserted that her aim was to unite the nation in "defeating Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda".</p>

<p>Her remarks came after Biden (81), in a stunning decision, on Sunday announced that he was withdrawing from the race to be the next president in 2024 and endorsed Harris, who is of both Indian and African origin, as the Democratic Party's new nominee.</p>

<p>Biden's decision to nominate Harris (59) follows weeks of intense pressure from fellow Democrats after his disastrous presidential debate performance against his Republican rival and former US president Donald Trump last month.</p>

<p>"I am honoured to have the President's endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination," said Harris, who has been serving as US' first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president since 2021.</p>

<p>Though Biden's endorsement almost seals her position as the presidential nominee of her party, she still needs to get elected by the party's delegates during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month.</p>

<p>Harris immediately secured the endorsement of former president Bill Clinton, thus making it a bit easier for her to win the delegate battle during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago beginning August 19.</p>

<p>"On behalf of the American people, I thank Joe Biden for his extraordinary leadership as President of the United States and for his decades of service to our country," she said.</p>

<p>Harris said over the past year, she has travelled across the country, talking to Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election.</p>

<p>"And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead. I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party -- and unite our nation-- to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda... We have 107 days until Election Day. Together, we will fight. And together, we will win," she said.</p>

<p>Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton quickly endorsed Harris to be the nominee. "We've lived through many ups and downs, but nothing has made us more worried for our country than the threat posed by a second Trump term," they said in a joint statement.</p>

<p>"He has promised to be a dictator on day one, and the recent ruling by his servile Supreme Court will only embolden him to further shred the Constitution. Now is the time to support Kamala Harris and fight with everything we've got to elect her," the Clintons said.</p>

<p>In her statement, Harris thanked Biden on behalf of the country's people for his extraordinary leadership and said, "His remarkable legacy of accomplishment is unmatched in modern American history, surpassing the legacy of many Presidents who have served two terms in office." "It is a profound honour to serve as his vice president, and I am deeply grateful to the President, Dr Biden, and the entire Biden family. I first came to know President Biden through his son Beau. We were friends from our days working together as Attorneys General of our home states," she said.</p>

<p>"As we worked together, Beau would tell me stories about his dad. The kind of father and the kind of man he is. And the qualities Beau revered in his father are the same qualities, the same values, I have seen every single day in Joe's leadership as President: His honesty and integrity. His big heart and commitment to his faith and his family. And his love of our country and the American people," Harris said.</p>

<p>With this selfless and patriotic act, President Biden is doing what he has done throughout his life of service: putting the American people and the country above everything else, she added.</p>

<p>Earlier, Biden announced that he has decided not to contest the presidential election.</p>

<p>"My fellow Democrats, I have decided not to accept the nomination and to focus all my energies on my duties as President for the remainder of my term. My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President. And it's been the best decision I've made," Biden said.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old president's decision comes four months before Americans go to the polls on November 5.</p>

<p>Such a decision from Biden comes amid a visible deterioration in his health. The president is currently in self-isolation at his Delaware residence after he tested positive with COVID-19.</p>

<p>Biden said he will speak to the nation later this week in more detail about his decision.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race for the White House leaves a gap atop the Democratic presidential ticket that the party is now rushing to fill.</p>

<p>Here is a look at potential replacements:</p>

<h3><strong>Kamala Harris</strong></h3>

<p>She seems like the obvious choice, and Biden has given her his endorsement.</p>

<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris, who has been a heartbeat away from the Oval Office since Biden's January 2021 swearing in, is well positioned to be the Democratic Party's standard-bearer.</p>

<p>The 59-year-old Harris, the daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, is a trailblazer.</p>

<p>She was the first Black person and the first woman to serve as California's attorney general, and then was the first US senator of South Asian descent.</p>

<p>She is now the first woman and first Black vice president.</p>

<p>During her career as a prosecutor, Harris had a reputation for being tough -- a trait she could use to advantage in a campaign expected to focus on crime and immigration.</p>

<p>But some progressive Democrats have been critical of her strict punishment of minor offenders, saying it disproportionately affected minorities.</p>

<p>Harris also suffers from a dismal approval rating, which could prompt Democrats to find another solution.</p>

<h3><strong>Gavin Newsom</strong></h3>

<p>There is no rule that a running mate automatically replaces the presidential candidate in the case of a withdrawal. This is why California Governor Gavin Newsom's name keeps popping up.</p>

<p>The 56-year-old Democrat, a former mayor of San Francisco, has been at the helm of the Golden State -- the most populous in the United States -- for five years, and has made it a haven for abortion access.</p>

<p>Newsom steadfastly supported Biden and dismissed talk of replacing him prior to the Democrat's withdrawal, but he has also made little secret of his own presidential ambitions.</p>

<p>In recent months, he has increased his international travel, run multiple ads touting his record, and invested millions of dollars in a political action committee, fueling speculation that he will run in 2028. So why not 2024?</p>

<h3><strong>Gretchen Whitmer</strong></h3>

<p>Another possible Democratic candidate is Gretchen Whitmer, the 52-year-old governor of Michigan.</p>

<p>Her state has both a strong working-class population and major Black and Arab American communities -- all key groups of voters that Biden struggled to court.</p>

<p>Whitmer, a fierce critic of Trump, is perhaps best known for being the intended target of a kidnapping plot devised by a far-right militia group.</p>

<p>Michigan will be one of the crucial battleground states in the November 5 presidential election -- a strong argument, according to her supporters, for naming Whitmer as a candidate.</p>

<h3><strong>Josh Shapiro</strong></h3>

<p>Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro leads the biggest swing state in November's race.</p>

<p>The 51-year-old, who was elected in November 2022 with a convincing victory over a conservative rival and took office in early 2023, previously was elected twice as the state's attorney general.</p>

<p>He condemned Catholic priests who had sexually abused thousands of children and prosecuted Purdue Pharma, the maker of the powerful opioid painkiller OxyContin.</p>

<p>Shapiro is an effective speechmaker and an avowed centrist -- qualities that could propel him to national office.</p>

<h3><strong>The rest</strong></h3>

<p>Other names circulating include Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, Maryland Governor Wes Moore and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, but their chances so far seem limited at best.</p>

<p>Senator Amy Klobuchar and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who both ran against Biden in the 2020 primaries, have also been mentioned.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following are some reactions from abroad to U.S. President Joe Biden's decision on Sunday to pull out of his campaign to seek reelection in November:</p>

<h3><strong>BRITISH PRIME MINISTER KEIR STARMER:</strong></h3>

<p>"I respect President Biden's decision and I look forward to us working together during the remainder of his presidency," Starmer said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I know that, as he has done throughout his remarkable career, President Biden will have made his decision based on what he believes is in the best interests of the American people."</p>

<h3><strong>IRISH TAOISEACH SIMON HARRIS ON &nbsp;X:</strong></h3>

<p>"On behalf of the people and government of Ireland. I, as Taoiseach, would like to thank you Mr President for your global leadership and your friendship as you make your announcement that you will not stand in the 2024 US Presidential election.</p>

<p>"The world has changed since President Biden's victory in 2020 and we have had to face extraordinary challenges from a global pandemic to the return of war to the continent of Europe with the horrific full- scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia which has deliberately targeted and killed innocent civilians.</p>

<p>"President Biden has been a voice for reason, effective multilateralism and shared solutions."</p>

<h3><strong>KREMLIN SPOKESMAN DMITRY PESKOV speaking to SHOT news outlet:</strong></h3>

<p>"The elections are still four months away, and that is a long period of time in which a lot can change. We need to be patient and carefully monitor what happens. The priority for us is the special military operation," Peskov said, referring to the war in Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>NORWEGIAN PRIME MINISTER JONAS GAHR STOERE:</strong></h3>

<p>"I respect Joe Biden's decision not to run for re-election. That justification deserves respect," Stoere told national broadcaster NRK.</p>

<p>"Biden has been one of America's most prominent politicians over several decades, and a president who has carried out several important reforms."&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>POLISH PRIME MINISTER DONALD TUSK ON X:&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"Mr. President @JoeBiden, many times you have made difficult decisions that have made Poland, America, and the world safer, and democracy and freedom stronger. I know that you were guided by the same principles when announcing your latest decision. Perhaps the most difficult one in your life."</p>

<h3><strong>CZECH PRIME MINISTER PETR FIALA ON X:&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"It is undoubtedly the decision of a statesman who has served his country for decades. It is a responsible and personally difficult step, but it is all the more valuable. I am keeping my fingers crossed for the USA that a good president emerges from the democratic competition of two strong and equal candidates."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former president Donald Trump on Sunday reacted to Joe Biden ending his reelection bid, claiming the incumbent president is "certainly not fit to serve."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Biden announced that he was withdrawing from the race to be the next president, following mounting pressure from Democrats after a faltering debate performance against Republican candidate Trump last month.</p>

<p>Biden has endorsed Kamala Harris, the current vice-president, to be the new Democratic nominee.</p>

<p>"Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve - And never was! He only attained the position of President by lies, Fake News, and not leaving his Basement.</p>

<p>"All those around him, including his Doctor and the Media, knew that he wasn't capable of being President, and he wasn't," Trump posted on Truth Social.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, added, "We will suffer greatly because of his presidency, but we will remedy the damage he has done very quickly. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!" In a phone call with CNN minutes after Biden, 81, announced his exit from the 2024 race, Trump described Biden as going "down as the single worst president by far in the history of our country." Meanwhile, Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., also attacked Kamala Harris as "even more liberal and less competent" than Biden.</p>

<p>Donald Trump Jr. attacked Vice President Harris, who President Biden endorsed for the Democratic nomination after stepping down, as "even more liberal and less competent" than Biden.</p>

<p>"Kamala Harris owns the entire leftwing policy record of Joe Biden. The only difference is that she is even more liberal and less competent than Joe, which is really saying something. She was put in charge of the border and we saw the worst invasion of illegals in our history!!!" Trump Jr. said.</p>

<p>Former president Donald Trump, told CNN earlier that he thinks Harris will be easier to defeat than Biden would have been in the November 5 presidential election.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

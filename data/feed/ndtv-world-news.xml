       <description><![CDATA[The Mangione family, long seen as "beloved" royalty in Baltimore, is reeling from the recent arrest of Luigi Mangione, accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Mangione family, long seen as “beloved” royalty in Baltimore, is reeling from the recent arrest of <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-is-luigi-mangione-man-behind-unitedhealthcare-ceos-murder-7212585">Luigi Mangione</a>, accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Known for their immense wealth, philanthropy, and a long history in the healthcare sector, the Mangione family's legacy now stands in contrast to the shocking crime allegedly committed by Luigi, a 26-year-old University of Pennsylvania graduate.</p>

<p>Luigi's family history is one of immigrant success. His late grandfather, Nick Mangione Sr, often shared his rags-to-riches story, proudly recounting his rise from humble beginnings. "I didn't have two nickels to rub together when my father died when I was 11, yet I still became a millionaire," Nick had said to <a href="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/community/criminal-justice/luigi-mangione-family-baltimore-towson-GPRMNCATXRGDJAUZXJQO6RHSHU/ " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">The Baltimore Sun</a>, recalling his father's struggles as an Italian immigrant and his own determination. "What other country can you do that in? None that I can think of."</p>

<p>Nick Mangione's empire spanned a range of industries, from owning local resorts and country clubs to operating nursing homes and even a radio station. He and his wife, Mary, were also philanthropists, donating millions, including over $1 million to the Greater Baltimore Medical Centre, where all of their 37 grandchildren were born. In honour of their contributions, the hospital even named its obstetrics unit after the Mangione family.</p>

<p>The Mangione Family Foundation has also made significant donations to institutions like St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and St. Joseph Medical Centre at the University of Maryland. Loyola University's pools are named after them, and several family members, including six of Nick and Mary's children, attended the local college.</p>

<p>The family's influence also extends into the political sphere, with Nick's grandson, Nino Mangione, serving in Maryland's House of Delegates.</p>

<p>Despite their sterling reputation, the Mangiones were blindsided by the arrest of Luigi. The motive allegedly comes from Luigi's anger toward the US healthcare system – a sector his family has greatly supported.</p>

<p>According to reports, Luigi Mangione is accused of fatally shooting Brian Thompson in a Midtown sidewalk attack, allegedly fuelled by his disdain for what he viewed as a “mafioso” of greedy healthcare companies. His uncle, Jerry O'Keefe, told the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/10/us-news/inside-luigi-mangiones-family-of-beloved-baltimore-royalty-its-a-shock-for-all-of-us/ " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">NY Post</a>, “It's a shock for all of us. I can't say anymore. The statement summed it up for all of us. We don't know anything more than what's been reported in the media.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump has used a photograph of himself sitting next to US First Lady Jill Biden to unveil his new line of fragrances. Called 'Fight, Fight, Fight', the fragrance line includes perfume for women and cologne for men, each retailing at $199.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the GetTrumpFragrances.com website, they are also selling bundles of two or more fragrances, while there is a 50% discount on the second item.</p>

<p>"A fragrance your enemies can't resist!" Trump wrote to introduce his latest product.</p>

<p>"Here are my new Trump Perfumes &amp; Colognes! I call them Fight, Fight, Fight because they represent us WINNING. Great Christmas gifts for the family. Go to&nbsp;<a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://gettrumpfragrances.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1733978143200000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3J03hGRaJS235CSgv_pXQs" href="http://gettrumpfragrances.com/" target="_blank">gettrumpfragrances.com/</a>. Merry Christmas, and Happy New Year," Trump wrote on his <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113618551122258874" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">Truth Social platform</a>.</p>

<p>The image of Trump seated near Jill Biden was taken on December 7 in Paris where they attended the re-opening of Notre Dame Cathedral.</p>

<p>The event was held nearly five years after the prestigious landmark faced a massive fire that toppled its spire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the viral image, the US First Lady and Trump can be seen in conversation, while there is an empty chair between them, which was marked for Brigitte Macron, French President Emmanuel Macron's wife.</p>

<p>The official website of the brand does not describe the actual scents of both cologne and perfume. "Our fragrances are curated to capture the essence of success and determination, with each scent symbolizing victory and strength," it reads.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-fragrance-jill-biden-fight-fight-fight-perfumes-cologne/" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">CBS News</a>, the fragrances mark the latest merchandise offer from the US President-elect, who over the years has launched a wide range of products branded with his name. Among these include the watches that are being sold for up to $100,000 as well as the "President Donald J. Trump First Edition" silver coins for $100 each.</p>

<p>Trump and Jill Biden's all-smiles picture comes after months of bitter takedowns on the campaign trail, wherein the Republican leader even said that US President Joe Biden was “thrown out like a dog” after he announced his exit from the US presidential race.</p>

<p>After Trump's victory in the November 5 election against US Vice President Kamala Harris, Biden met him for nearly two hours at the Oval Office.&nbsp;During the meeting, he was also handed over a handwritten letter by Jill Biden to deliver to his wife, Melania Trump, who remained absent at Trump's post-election visit to the White House.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A travel insurance company has revealed the winners of the World's Unluckiest Traveller awards for 2024, featuring a collection of frightening and bizarre travel misadventures. This contest of stories of travel nightmares received nearly 500 entries from across North America. After weeks of voting, a winner has emerged.</p>

<p>Julie S was named the World's Unluckiest Traveller and won $10,000. Her story, "From Bodybag to Skydiving," recounts a trip to Phoenix with her friend Sam. After a night of mishaps, Sam had to be transported in a body bag due to space constraints but recovered and insisted on skydiving.</p>

<p>The runner-up, Jennifer G, shared her story "MexiNO!" about her kidney failure diagnosis and decision to travel before starting dialysis. Her vacation in Mexico, meant to escape Wisconsin winter, turned disastrous with no beach, a closed pool, and a mouldy, bedbug-infested room without water. She spent the night in the bathtub and won $5,000.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Akshay Nanavati, a former US Marine with Indian roots, is pushing the boundaries of human endurance with a solo ski quest across Antarctica. This 110-day expedition, never before attempted, will see him confront temperatures as low as -40 degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>Despite his years as a Marine, accustomed to harsh conditions, Nanavati's mother, based in Bengaluru, had a different concern when she learned of his Antarctica expedition. Four months ago, her only question was, "Do they have good hotels there?" A bemused Akshay had to explain that his accommodations would be far from luxurious - a tent, with a four-minute walk to the nearest toilet, as reported by <em>The Times of India</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a boy studying in Bengaluru, Akshay always had a penchant for swimming and running, his father Ajay told the publication. He added that as a teenager, Akshay was struggling with drugs and alcohol. At that time, &nbsp;a Ridley Scott movie Black Hawk Down inspired him to join the US Marines. Even with a blood disorder that "two doctors said would kill him in Marine Corps boot camp", Akshay not only managed to survive but also served in Iraq.</p>

<p>Nanavati previously achieved a remarkable feat, becoming one of only 26 individuals to successfully ski up the remote Axel Heiberg Glacier in Antarctica. However, this challenging expedition resulted in frostbite, leading to the amputation of two fingers. One finger could not be saved, while the other was preemptively removed, as his wife Melissa explained to the Times of India, "Once you get frostbite, you're always more prone to it in the future."</p>

<p>Akshay, who successfully raised close to Rs 9 crore for his solo ski expedition, confidently stated his readiness to conquer the Antarctic wilderness. He emphasized his rigorous training for extreme conditions and the invaluable support he will receive from Antarctic Logistics and Eric Philips, an experienced polar expedition guide. "Polar travel in Antarctica, while not as inherently dangerous as free soloing or mountaineering, presents a level of suffering that surpasses any other voluntary struggle I've ever experienced," Akshay shared on Instagram.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chronic back pain has emerged as a point of interest in the murder investigation of UnitedHealthcare CEO, who 26-year-old Luigi Mangione gunned down in New York last week.</p>

<p>Mangione, an Ivy League graduate, yelled and struggled as he was taken into a courtroom in Pennsylvania after he was held from a McDonald's in Altoona on Monday, ending over a week-long nationwide manhunt after Brian Thompson was shot down in Manhattan. He is in custody in Pennsylvania and faces multiple charges there as well as murder charges in New York.</p>

<p>As police say the head of one of US's biggest health insurers was deliberately targeted, a trail of posts on social media by Mangione could point to likely grievances he harboured against the healthcare system. Mangione was also arrested with a manifesto where he accused health insurance companies for putting corporate greed over the well-being of people, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/10/us-news/luigi-mangiones-back-pain-was-so-intense-that-he-couldnt-be-physically-intimate-with-anyone-former-landlord-says/"><em>NY Post</em></a>. This has led to theories that the murder could be linked to Mangione's disappointment with the insurance provider.</p>

<p>Mangione lived in Hawaii in 2022 and, according to his former roommate RJ Martin, suffered from back pain, and was hoping to strengthen his back. After a surfing lesson, Mangione was "in bed for about a week" because of the pain, Martin told <em>CNN</em>. Earlier this year, Mangione confirmed he'd had back surgery and sent him photos of the X-rays, Martin said.</p>

<p>He also told the manager of Surfbreak, the co-living residence in Hawaii he resided at, that he had a back problem, and in August of 2023 sent him pictures of a back surgery, according to the New York Times. "His spine was kind of misaligned. He said his lower vertebrae were almost like a half-inch off, and I think it pinched a nerve," Mr Martin told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/nyregion/united-healthcare-ceo-shooting-luigi-mangione.html"><em>New York Times</em></a>.&nbsp;"He knew that dating and being physically intimate with his back condition wasn't possible," he added, while saying that Mangione was a young man yearning a normal lifestyle.</p>

<p>Mr Martin said that Mangione left Hawaii in the summer of 2023, presumably for an operation on his back. In August that year, he checked in via text to see how his friend was doing, "and he sent me back pictures of his back surgery."</p>

<p>On his X profile, he shared a picture of an x-ray of a spinal surgery and on GoodReads, he reviewed a book called "Crooked: Outwitting the Back Pain Industry and Getting on the Road to Recovery."</p>

<p>Another account was narrated by Paul Piek, a 21-year-old software testing professional from Flensburg, Germany, met Mangione in March while watching a muay thai boxing fight in Ao Nang, Thailand. The two and another friend of Piek's met up again in Krabi, Thailand on April 8 and roadtripped through Khao Sok and Bangkok, where they shared a hotel room for four nights and visited temples. "He told us he did (muy thai) before his injury," said Piek.</p>

<p>Piek said Mangione told him he was interested in hiking when they met, with no further mention of his back injury. "It didn't seem like a problem," though he did opt out of one guided hike for an easier walk, saying he was ill.</p>

<p>Mangione had left his previous employer Truecar, a car-purchse platform with offices in California, in 2023, the company said. A colleague he worked with there told Reuters he took leave during the middle of 2023 for about two months, a move the colleague's manager told him was due to back-related issues.</p>

<p>Further, a deleted Reddit account allegedly associated with Mangione wrote multiple comments in a subreddit for people diagnosed with spondylolisthesis, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2024/12/10/unitedhealthcare-shooting-suspect-luigi-mangione-appeared-to-suffer-from-rare-back-condition-heres-what-to-know/"><em>Forbes</em></a>&nbsp;reported. The user wrote the condition "went bad on me" and was "completely devastating as a young athletic person" because they learned the condition would force them into "a desk job for the rest of my life."</p>

<p>In a 14-page handwritten document that Sky News identified as having been uploaded to his Google Drive account in 2021 and which has not been independently verified by Reuters, Mangione said he had a back injury known as an L5-S1 isthmic spondylolisthesis, in which one of the bones in the spine slips forward and presses on the vertebra below it. Mangione's notes mention that his condition involved a stress fracture in the pars bone that connects the vertebrae to the spinal column.</p>

<p>Mangione's profile on X includes an X-ray of a person who has had an L5-S1 spinal operation in which two vertebra are surgically fused together. The surgery has an overall success rate of 80%, according to the National Institutes of Health.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US President-elect Donald Trump has picked Kimberly Guilfoyle, a former Fox News host turned political fundraiser and - more pointedly - the fiancee of his son Donald Jr, as the next United States ambassador to Greece.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump has picked Kimberly Guilfoyle, a former Fox News host turned political fundraiser and - more pointedly - the fiancee of his son Donald Jr, as the next United States ambassador to Greece. Ms Guilfoyle has been engaged to Donald Trump Jr since December 31, 2020.</p>

<p>In his announcement of Ms Guilfoyle's posting to Greece, the incoming president called her "a close friend and ally" for years, but made no mention of her relationship with his son.</p>

<p>She is "perfectly suited to foster strong bilateral relations with Greece, advancing our interests on issues ranging from defence cooperation to trade and economic innovation," he said in a post on the social media platform Truth Social.</p>

<p>"Her extensive experience and leadership in law, media, and politics along with her sharp intellect make her supremely qualified to represent the United States," the post added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, what preceded Tuesday's announcement was a report that the president-elect's eldest son was dating a socialite, Bettina Anderson.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, British tabloid <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14173793/Donald-Trump-Jr-Bettina-Anderson-holding-hands-birthday-palm-beach-Kimberly-Guilfoyle.html" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">The Daily Mail </a>published a series of photos of Donald Trump Jr with "it girl" Bettina Anderson, describing them as "incontrovertible proof the soon-to-be First Son has moved on" with a "stunning 'it girl.'"&nbsp;</p>

<p>So far, there is no official confirmation from Mr Trump's office or Ms Guilfoyle about the engagement being called off.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/style/kimberly-guilfoyle-trump-greece-ambassador.html" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">New York Times</a> report, rumours about the closeness between Ms Anderson and the president-elect's son gained pace in September, when the pair was reportedly seen kissing during a brunch. Ms Anderson was reportedly a friend of Donald Jr's ex-wife, Vanessa Trump, with whom he shares five children.</p>

<p>The chatter on the love triangle grew in recent days after Ms Anderson's recent birthday celebration. On the occasion, Ms Anderson posted a story on her Instagram account, showing a big bouquet of flowers, with a gushy card from an admirer. "Many have said that you're aging out but I think you're perfect," the card read.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;"Tough but fair," Ms Anderson added to the post, with the NYT report saying Donald Trump Jr's Instagram handle was noted in the posting.</p>

<h3><strong>Guilfoyle Add To List To Trump Appointee With Family Ties</strong></h3>

<p>Ms Guilfoyle is not the President-elect's first appointee with family ties.&nbsp;In November, Mr Trump announced plans to nominate his son-in-law Jared Kushner's father, Charles Kushner, as ambassador to France and to appoint Massad Boulos - the father-in-law of his youngest daughter, Tiffany Trump - as a senior adviser on Arab and Middle East issues.</p>

<p>His pick for ambassador to Turkey, Tom Barrack is a longtime friend of the Republican president-elect. He's also a private equity executive and has been previously charged with unlawfully acting as an agent of the United Arab Emirates and was acquitted in 2022 of all nine counts he faced.</p>

<p>Trump described Tom as a "well-respected and experienced voice of reason," in his post announcing the appointment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Arctic can feel like a far-off place, disconnected from daily life if you aren't one of the&nbsp;<a href="https://arctic-council.org/explore/topics/arctic-peoples/">4 million people</a>&nbsp;who live there. Yet, the changes underway in the Arctic as temperatures rise can profoundly affect lives around the world.</p>

<p>Coastal flooding is worsening in many communities as Arctic glaciers and the Greenland Ice Sheet send&nbsp;<a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-sea-level">meltwater into the oceans</a>. Heat-trapping gases&nbsp;<a href="https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/high-carbon-emissions-wildfires-russian-arctic">released by Arctic wildfires</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/thawing-permafrost-is-roiling-the-arctic-landscape-driven-by-a-hidden-world-of-changes-beneath-the-surface-as-the-climate-warms-174157">thawing tundra</a>&nbsp;mix quickly in the air, adding to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/resources/climate-change-in-data/">human-produced emissions</a>&nbsp;that are warming the globe. Unusual and extreme weather events, pressure on food supplies and intensifying threats from wildfire and related smoke can all be influenced by changes in the Arctic.</p>

<p>In the&nbsp;<a href="https://arctic.noaa.gov/report-card/report-card-2024/">2024 Arctic Report Card</a>, released Dec. 10, we brought together 97 scientists from 11 countries, with expertise ranging from wildlife to wildfire and sea ice to snow, to report on the state of the Arctic environment.</p>

<p>They describe the&nbsp;<a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/634627/original/file-20241126-15-zcj8mj.png">rapid changes they're witnessing</a>&nbsp;across the Arctic, and the consequences for people and wildlife that touch every region of the globe.</p>

<h2>Pace of change in the Arctic accelerates</h2>

<p>The Arctic of today looks stunningly different from the Arctic of even one to two decades ago. Over the&nbsp;<a href="https://arctic.noaa.gov/report-card/report-card-archive/">Arctic Report Card's 19 years</a>, we and the many contributing authors to the report have watched the pace of environmental change accelerate and the challenges become more complex.</p>

<p>For the past 15 years, the&nbsp;<a href="https://arctic.noaa.gov/report-card/report-card-2024/terrestrial-snow-cover-2024/">Arctic snow season</a>&nbsp;has been one to two weeks shorter than it was historically, shifting the timing and character of the seasons.</p>

<p>Shorter snow seasons can challenge plants and animals that depend on regular seasonal changes. Longer snow-free seasons can also reduce water resources from snowmelt earlier in spring or summer and increase the possibility of drought.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://arctic.noaa.gov/report-card/report-card-2024/sea-ice-2024/">extent of sea ice</a>, an important habitat for many animals, has declined in ways that make today's mostly thin and seasonal sea ice landscape unrecognizable compared with the thicker and more extensive sea ice of decades past.</p>

<p>With a shorter sea ice season, the dark ocean surface is exposed and can absorb and store more heat during summer, which then adds to air and ocean temperature increases. This aligns with observations of&nbsp;<a href="https://arctic.noaa.gov/report-card/report-card-2024/sea-surface-temperature-2024/">long-term warming for Arctic surface ocean waters</a>. Sea ice-dependent animals can also be forced ashore or into longer fasting seasons. The Arctic shipping season is also lengthening, with&nbsp;<a href="https://gcaptain.com/arctic-shipping-boom-continues-as-china-and-russia-push-cargo-volume-to-new-heights/">rapidly increasing shipping traffic</a>&nbsp;each summer.</p>

<h2>Arctic tundra becomes a carbon source</h2>

<p>For thousands of years, the Arctic tundra landscape of shrubs and permafrost, or frozen ground, has acted as a carbon dioxide sink, meaning that the landscape was taking up and storing this gas that would otherwise trap heat in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>But permafrost across the Arctic&nbsp;<a href="https://arctic.noaa.gov/report-card/report-card-2024/arctic-terrestrial-carbon-cycling/">has been warming and thawing</a>. Once thawed, microbes in the permafrost can decompose long-stored carbon, breaking it down into carbon dioxide and methane. These heat-trapping gases are then released to the atmosphere, causing more global warming.</p>

<p>Wildfires have also increased in size and intensity,&nbsp;<a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/wildfires-are-erasing-californias-climate-gains-research-shows">releasing more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/climate/wildfires-2024-charts-1.7341341">wildfire season</a>&nbsp;has grown longer.</p>

<figcaption>Large parts of the Arctic that once took up more carbon that they released have become net carbon sources in recent years, contributing to climate change.&nbsp;<a href="https://arctic.noaa.gov/report-card/">Arctic Report Card 2024, NOAA Climate.gov</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These changes have pushed the tundra ecosystem over an edge. Susan Natali and colleagues found that the Arctic tundra region is&nbsp;<a href="https://arctic.noaa.gov/report-card/report-card-2024/arctic-terrestrial-carbon-cycling/">now a source – not a sink, or storage location – for carbon dioxide</a>. It was already a methane source because of thawing permafrost.</p>

<p>The Arctic landscape's natural ability to help to buffer human heat-trapping gasses is ending, adding to the urgency to reduce human emissions.</p>

<h2>Stark regional differences make planning difficult</h2>

<p>The Arctic Report Card covers October through September each year, and 2024 was the&nbsp;<a href="https://arctic.noaa.gov/report-card/report-card-2024/">second-warmest year on record for the Arctic</a>. Yet, the experience for people living in the Arctic can feel like regional or seasonal weather whiplash.</p>

<p>Stark regional differences in weather can make planning difficult and challenge familiar seasonal patterns. These include very different conditions in neighboring areas or big changes from one season to another.</p>

<p>For example, some areas across North America and Eurasia experienced more winter snow than usual during the past year. Yet, the Canadian Arctic experienced the&nbsp;<a href="https://arctic.noaa.gov/report-card/report-card-2024/terrestrial-snow-cover-2024/">shortest snow season in the 26-year record</a>. Early loss of winter snow can strain water resources and may exacerbate dry conditions that can add to fire danger.</p>

<p>Summer across the Arctic was the third warmest ever observed, and areas of Alaska and Canada experienced record daily temperatures during August heat waves. Yet, residents of Greenland's west coast experienced an unusually cool spring and summer. Though the Greenland Ice Sheet continued its 27-year record of ice loss, the&nbsp;<a href="https://arctic.noaa.gov/report-card/report-card-2024/greenland-ice-sheet-2024/">loss was less than in many recent years</a>.</p>

<h2>Ice seals, caribou and people feeling the change</h2>

<p>Rapid Arctic warming also affects wildlife in different ways.</p>

<p>As Lori Quakenbush and colleagues explain in this year's report,&nbsp;<a href="https://arctic.noaa.gov/report-card/report-card-2024/ice-seals-of-alaska/">Alaska ice seal populations</a>, including ringed, bearded, spotted and ribbon seals, are currently healthy despite sea ice decline and warming ocean waters in their Bering, Chukchi and Beaufort sea habitats.</p>

<p>However, ringed seals are eating more saffron cod rather than the more nutritious Arctic cod. Arctic cod are very sensitive to water temperature. As waters warm, they&nbsp;<a href="https://arctic.noaa.gov/report-card/report-card-2019/comparison-of-near-bottom-fish-densities-show-rapid-community-and-population-shifts-in-bering-and-barents-seas/">shift their range northward</a>, becoming less abundant on the continental shelves where the seals feed. So far, negative effects on seal populations and health are not yet apparent.</p>

<figcaption>Many caribou herds have lost population in recent years.&nbsp;<a href="https://arctic.noaa.gov/report-card/">Arctic Report Card 2024, NOAA Climate.gov</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>On land,&nbsp;<a href="https://arctic.noaa.gov/report-card/report-card-2024/migratory-tundra-caribou-in-a-warmer-climate/">large inland caribou herds are overwhelmingly in decline</a>. Climate change and human roads and buildings are all having an impact. Some Indigenous communities who have depended on specific herds for millennia are deeply concerned for their future and the impact on their food, culture and the complex and connected living systems of the region. Some smaller coastal herds are doing better.</p>

<p>Indigenous peoples in the Arctic have deep knowledge of their region that has been passed on for thousands of years, allowing them to flourish in what can be an inhospitable region. Today, their&nbsp;<a href="https://arctic.noaa.gov/report-card/report-card-2024/the-original-researchers-hunters-are-scientists-deserving-sustained-support/">observations and knowledge provide vital support for Arctic communities</a>&nbsp;forced to adapt quickly to these and other changes. Supporting Indigenous hunters and harvesters is by its very nature an investment in long-term knowledge and stewardship of Arctic places.</p>

<h2>Action for the Arctic and the globe</h2>

<p>Despite global agreements and bold targets, human emissions of heat-trapping gasses are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2024">still at record highs</a>. And natural landscapes, like the Arctic tundra, are losing their ability to help reduce emissions.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, the impacts of climate change are growing, increasing Arctic wildfires, affecting buildings and roads as permafrost thaws, and increasing flooding and coastal erosion as sea levels rise. The affects are challenging plants and animals that people depend on.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A McDonald's staff is credited with the breakthrough in the manhunt that followed the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. A witness at the Pennsylvania outlet, who saw the cops swoop away 26-year-old Luigi Mangione, said the customers were struck by the resemblance of the suspect with that of circulated images.</p>

<p>The New York Police Department had released photos of the suspect two days ago - after the killing sparked a nationwide manhunt and made global headlines.</p>

<p>The witness, identified by only his first name Larry, told BBC he had gone to the McDonald's in Altoona town for coffee with about five of his friends. At the outlet, one of his friends talked about the suspect's resemblance - that he was wearing similar clothes in the images circulated by the cops, but Larry felt that he was joking.</p>

<p>Larry said when he asked that friend about it the next morning- after the suspect was arrested - he said, "Yes, I was serious."</p>

<p>Another restaurant employee, whom Larry spoke to, said he found a similarity with his "eyes and eyebrow" while noting down his order. He was working on a laptop, wearing a mask and a beanie, that time.</p>

<p>A staff at the fast-food restaurant tipped the cops after another customer recognized the suspect. Mangione, who was an Ivy League student, was soon arrested from the outlet and was charged with the UnitedHealthcare CEO's murder last night.</p>

<p>The cops found a gun in his possession, fake IDs, and documents that suggested he had "ill will towards corporate America". "These parasites had it coming," said a two-page note found with him.</p>

<p>When they asked the suspect if he had been to New York recently, he became quiet and "started to shake".</p>

<p>Thompson was attending an investors' conference in New York last week when Mangione came from behind and fired multiple rounds in full public view. As Thompson collapsed to the ground, he fled on foot. Later, he took a bike to Central Park and boarded a bus.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Kim Yong-hyun, the former South Korean Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun accused of playing a lead role in the failed imposition of martial law on December 3, tried to commit suicide inside a detention centre on Wednesday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kim Yong-hyun, the former South Korean Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun accused of playing a lead role in the failed imposition of martial law on December 3, tried to commit suicide shortly before he was formally arrested. The defence minister, who resigned last Thursday, had been detained since Sunday. He was formally arrested on Tuesday.</p>

<p>During a parliamentary hearing, the commissioner general of the Korea Correctional Service said that Mr Kim tried to kill himself minutes before his arrest was announced.</p>

<p>"Former Minister of Defence Kim Yong-hyun attempted suicide at the Seoul Dongbu Detention Center" shortly before midnight, an AFP report quoted Shin Yong-hae as saying.</p>

<p>As per the official, Mr Kim had tried to kill himself in the toilet using a string from his clothing.</p>

<p>A Reuters report said the former defence minister used underwear to commit suicide, adding that he was under observation and his life was not currently in danger.</p>

<p>Mr Kim is being investigated on insurrection charges related to President Yoon Suk Yeol's brief declaration of martial law. He has now been arrested on charges including "engaging in critical duties during an insurrection" and "abuse of authority to obstruct the exercise of rights", according to a report by AFP.</p>

<p>As per the report, Kim's formal arrest came amid concerns that evidence might be destroyed. It was determined that the former minister's alleged offences "fall within the scope of crimes for which the prosecution can initiate an investigation," a court spokesperson said early Wednesday.</p>

<p>Mr Kim was contrite Tuesday, saying through his lawyers that "all responsibility for this situation lies solely with me". He also "deeply apologised" to the South Korean people, saying that his subordinates were "merely following my orders and fulfilling their assigned duties".</p>

<h3><strong>Martial Law in South Korea</strong></h3>

<p>South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol suspended civilian rule a week ago and sent special forces and helicopters to parliament, before lawmakers forced him to rescind the decree in a country assumed to be a stable democracy. The brief declaration of martial law plunged Asia's fourth-largest economy and a major U.S. ally into a constitutional crisis.</p>

<p>Earlier Tuesday, Army Special Warfare Command chief Kwak Jong-geun told lawmakers that Yoon had ordered him to stop enough MPs from gathering at parliament to vote down the martial law decree.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, in a dramatic escalation of the probe against Mr Yoon, South Korean police said they raided the President's office. Mr Yoon is already under a travel ban as part of an "insurrection" probe into his inner circle after his short-lived suspension of civilian rule on December 3.</p>

<p>The President has not been seen in public since apologising on Saturday for trying to impose martial law.</p>

<p>Apart from the former Defence Minister, two top police officials were also taken into custody in the early hours of Wednesday, as the investigation into the political turmoil caused by the martial law declaration gathered pace.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the leadership crisis deepened with questions over who is running the country and the main opposition party planning to hold a second impeachment vote in parliament on Saturday. Some members of the president's People Power Party (PPP) have also spoken out in favour of the motion, which failed in the first vote on December 7.</p><p><div class='table-div suicide'><table class='table'><thead><tr><th colspan='2'>Helplines</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Vandrevala Foundation for Mental Health</td><td><a href='tel:+919999666555'>9999666555</a> or <a href='mailto:help@vandrevalafoundation.com'>help@vandrevalafoundation.com</a> </td></tr><tr><td>TISS iCall</td><td><a href='tel:+912225521111'>022-25521111</a> (Monday-Saturday: 8 am to 10 pm)</td></tr> <tr><td colspan='2'>(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Syria's new transitional Prime Minister Mohammad al-Bashir took charge and called for "stability and calm" in the country, Israel carried out over 350 airstrikes targeting weapons stockpiles and strategic infrastructure in the Middle Eastern country over the past 48 hours. The Hayat Tahrir al-Shams (HTS) led rebels, who toppled President Bashar al-Assad three days ago, appointed Mohammad al-Bashir as the transitional head of government to run the country until March 1.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr al-Bashir, a figure little known across most of Syria ran the rebel-led Salvation Government in a pocket of the northwest controlled by rebels before their 12-day lightning offensive swept into Damascus.</p>

<p>In his first interview since being appointed, Mr Bashir told Qatar's Al Jazeera television, "Now it is time for this people to enjoy stability and calm."</p>

<h3><strong>Israel Strikes Syria</strong></h3>

<p>Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), in a statement posted to X, said it has carried out more than 350 airstrikes targeting weapons stockpiles and strategic infrastructure in Syria over the past 48 hours.</p>

<p>The targets included Syrian Navy facilities at Al-Bayda port and Latakia port, Syrian Air Force airfields, dozens of weapons production sites in Damascus, Homs, Tartus, Latakia, and Palmyra, numerous anti-aircraft batteries, drones, aircraft, tanks, scud missiles, cruise missiles, surface-to-sea, surface-to-air, surface-to-surface missiles, UAVs, fighter jets, attack helicopters, radars, hangars, and more.</p>

<p>The IDF said it "conducted air strikes on 130 assets in Syria, including weapons depots, military structures, launchers, and firing positions."</p>

<p>Earlier on Tuesday, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said that in overnight strikes the Syrian navy fleet was wiped out and Israeli troops were "establishing themselves" at the buffer zone between Syria and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.</p>

<h3><strong>Turkish Strikes</strong></h3>

<p>Meanwhile, the Turkish intelligence agency is also attacking targets in Syria. On Tuesday, Turkish security officials said their intelligence agency attacked a convoy of trucks allegedly carrying missiles, heavy weapons and ammunition that were abandoned by the Syrian government and reportedly seized by Syrian Kurdish militias, according to a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/10/syria-live-blog-updates-assad-rebel-leaders-latest-news-damascus" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">The Guardian</a>.</p>

<p>As per the report, 12 trucks, two tanks and two ammunition depots were "destroyed" in aerial strikes in the city of Qamishli, near the Turkish border.</p>

<h3><strong>US Urges 'Inclusive' Process For New Syrian Govt</strong></h3>

<p>The outgoing US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has urged all nations to support an "inclusive" political process in Syria, saying the United States would eventually recognize a government if it meets such standards. "The Syrian people will decide the future of Syria. All nations should pledge to support an inclusive and transparent process and refrain from external interference," Mr Blinken said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The United States will recognize and fully support a future Syria government that results from this process," he added.</p>

<p>The US Secretary of State said that the future government of Syria should be "credible, inclusive and non-sectarian" after Islamist rebels toppled strongman Bashar al-Assad, a member of the Alawite minority who led a secular dictatorship.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>HTS's Message To The World</strong></h3>

<p>HTS commander Ahmed al-Sharaa, aka Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, has urged foreign countries to not fear Syria after Bashar al-Assad's regime was overthrown. Speaking to American broadcaster <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://news.sky.com/story/west-has-nothing-to-fear-from-syria-rebel-leader-whose-group-ousted-assad-tells-sky-news-13270905" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">Sky News</a>, Jolani, said, "Their (West's) fears are unnecessary, God willing".</p>

<p>"The country will be rebuilt," he said, adding, "The fear was from the presence of the regime. The country is moving towards development and reconstruction. It's going towards stability."</p>

<p>He continued: "People are exhausted from war. So the country isn't ready for another one and it's not going to get into another one. The source of our fears was from the Iranian militias, Hezbollah and the regime which committed the massacres we are seeing today. So their removal is the solution for Syria. The current situation won't allow for a return to panic."</p>

<h3><strong>UN To Consider Taking HTS Off Terrorist List</strong></h3>

<p>The United Nations said it would consider removing Hayat Tahrir al-Sham from its designated terrorist list if it passes the key test of forming a truly inclusive transitional government, according to a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/10/un-may-remove-syrian-rebel-group-hts-from-terror-list-if-conditions-met" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">The Guardian</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Quoting Geir Pedersen, UN special envoy for Syria, the report said the UN would consider the proposal if the group could not seek to govern Syria in the way that it had governed Idlib, the northern province where it was based and from where it led the military breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We have to be honest and look at the facts. It has been nine years since that resolution was adopted and the reality so far is that HTS and other armed groups have been sending good messages to the Syrian people of unity and inclusiveness. In Hama and Aleppo, there have been reassuring things on the ground...My message is Syria cannot be run like Idlib." he said.</p>

<h3><strong>75 Indians Evacuated From Syria&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>India on Tuesday evacuated 75 Indian nationals from Syria, two days after rebel forces overthrew President Bashar Assad's authoritarian government. The evacuation, coordinated by the embassies of India in Damascus and Beirut, was put into effect following an assessment of the security situation, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said.</p>

<p>"The Government of India today evacuated 75 Indian nationals from Syria, following recent developments in that country," it said in a late-night statement.</p>

<p>"The evacuees included 44 'zaireen' from Jammu and Kashmir who were stranded at Saida Zainab. All Indian nationals have safely crossed over to Lebanon and will return by available commercial flights to India," it said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 75 Indians have been evacuated from war-torn Syria where the rebels have toppled the Bashar al-Assad government and are set to form a government on their own. The Indian nationals have safely crossed to Lebanon and will return by commercial flights to India, the External Affairs Ministry said late last night.</p>

<p>The ministry said the evacuees included 44 'zaireen' (pilgrims) from Jammu and Kashmir, who were stranded at Saida Zainab.</p>

<p>The development follows requests from Indian nationals in Syria and an assessment of the security situation, the ministry said, adding that the Indian embassies in Damascus and Beirut coordinated the evacuation.</p>

<p>Some Indians, however, remain in Syria. The government has advised them to stay in touch with the embassy in Damascus via the helpline number +963 993385973, also on WhatsApp, and email ID hoc.damascus@mea.gov.in.</p>

<p>Rebel forces, led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, captured capital Damascus on Sunday after a lightning 12-day offensive, ending five decades of brutal rule by the Assad clan. Assad, a Kremlin ally, fled to Russia before the rebels breached his palace and has reportedly been granted asylum.</p>

<p>Reports suggest the US has reached out to the rebels and urged them to run an inclusive process to form a transitional government instead of assuming automatic leadership. An official said the Biden administration in the US is also in touch with Donald Trump's team over the matter.</p>

<p>Trump had earlier called Syria a "mess" and said the US should not be involved.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China's naval deployments in the East China Sea and South China Sea are elevated but consistent with other large exercises in the past, a U.S. military official said on Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>The assessment contrasted with statements from Taiwan that described the deployments as the largest in nearly three decades.</p>

<p>"The PRC military activity is elevated in the region, consistent with levels we have seen during other large exercises," the official said, using the country's official name, the People's Republic of China.</p>

<p>China's military has yet to comment and has not confirmed it is carrying out any exercises.</p>

<p>China, which claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory over the island's rejection, had been expected to launch drills to express its anger at President Lai Ching-te's tour of the Pacific that ended on Friday, which included stopovers in Hawaii and the U.S. territory of Guam.</p>

<p>But the U.S. official did not link the deployments to Lai's travels.</p>

<p>"We do not see the activity in the East China Sea and South China Sea as a response to President Lai's transit," the official said.</p>

<p>"This activity is part of a broader increase in the PLA's military posture and military exercises over the last several years. These activities are destabilizing and risk escalation."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 127 people, mostly civilians, were killed in Sudan on Monday and Tuesday by barrel bombs and shelling from the warring sides, rights activists said.</p>

<p>The 20-month-old war between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has been turning increasingly bloody as ceasefire efforts have stalled, and crises elsewhere have dominated world attention.</p>

<p>The army has stepped up airstrikes in the half of the country that the RSF controls, while the RSF has staged raids on villages and intense artillery strikes. Both have targeted densely populated civilian areas.</p>

<p>More than eight barrel bombs hit the market in the North Darfur town of Kabkabiya on Monday, the pro-democracy Al-Fashir Resistance Committee said. Emergency Lawyers, a human rights group, said more than 100 had been killed and hundreds wounded.</p>

<p>The army has frequently targeted towns in North Darfur with airstrikes as it fights the RSF for control of the state capital, al-Fashir, its last foothold in the region.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It denied responsibility for the attack on Kabkabiya, while insisting that it had the right to target any location used by the RSF for military purposes. The RSF did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>An image shared by Emergency Lawyers showed shrouded bodies in a mass grave.</p>

<p>Video verified by Reuters showed bloodied bodies strewn around the market. It also showed fires burning and people being carried from the wreckage of stores and fruit stalls.</p>

<p>People can be heard crying and screaming in the footage, while others pray for those who were killed. One man is heard saying "People are dying wholesale".</p>

<p>The video also shows armed men in the headwraps typically worn by RSF soldiers on motorcycles.</p>

<p>An activist from Kabkabiya said that, while there were typically a few soldiers in the market and other parts of the town, the vast majority of those present were civilians.</p>

<p>He said 87 bodies had been identified, but that some were too charred or mutilated to identify.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the RSF aimed heavy artillery fire at an army-controlled sector of Omdurman, part of Khartoum state, residents said.</p>

<p>Emergency Lawyers said at least 20 people had been killed, including at least 14 who were riding on a bus that was hit. The state government, controlled by the army, said 65 people had been killed, and that other casualties had been transferred to nearby Al-Naw Hospital.</p>

<p>Images circulating on social media not verified by Reuters showed shrouded bodies on the street amid vehicle wreckage.</p>

<p>The United Nations has said more than 30 million people need aid, and some 12 million have fled their homes.</p>

<p>Famine has been declared in Zamzam camp in North Darfur, where shelling on Tuesday killed seven people, according to Adam Rojal, spokesperson of the Coordinating Committee for Displaced People.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed corruption charges against him as 'ridiculous' in court on Tuesday, becoming the country's first sitting premier to face criminal trial.</p>

<p>Israeli media called it a "historic day" as Mr Netanyahu faced charges of bribery, fraud and breach of public trust in three separate cases while running a country at war.</p>

<p>But Mr Netanyahu rejected the charges, saying: "There's no corruption, no fraud. It is just ridiculous."</p>

<p>He also lashed out at the media during almost a full day of testimony, saying most of the Israeli public was right-wing but the media was "98 per cent on the other side".</p>

<p>The trial has already heard from various witnesses, including former close aides of Mr Netanyahu who testified against him.</p>

<p>Asked how much the charges bothered him, he said: "If I tell you it's a drop in the ocean that would be an exaggeration".</p>

<p>"I'm busy with matters of world importance."</p>

<p>On Monday, at a press conference, he said he had been waiting for years to present his side.</p>

<p>"It has been eight years that I have waited for this day, eight years of wanting to present the truth, eight years waiting to completely demolish these absurd and baseless accusations against me," he said, labelling the cases a "relentless witch hunt".</p>

<p>Outside the court supporters of the prime minister chanted "Netanyahu, the people support you", while protesters chanted "Bibi to prison".</p>

<h3><strong>Luxury Goods</strong></h3>

<p>"If, at the end of the trial, it is determined that Mr Netanyahu be sent to prison, then he must go to prison," said Sarah Kritzman, a psychologist protesting outside the court.</p>

<p>"I don't think there should be any plea bargain or any kind of pardon just because he is the prime minister."</p>

<p>The trial, which has been delayed many times since it began in May 2020, is scheduled to last for months, with an appeals process that could further prolong matters.</p>

<p>Mr Netanyahu, who filed multiple requests to delay the proceedings based on the wars in Gaza and Lebanon, has steadfastly denied any wrongdoing.</p>

<p>In the first case, Mr Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, are accused of accepting more than $260,000 worth of luxury goods such as cigars, jewellery and champagne from billionaires in exchange for political favours.</p>

<p>Among the alleged benefactors are Israeli-born Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan and Australian business executive James Packer.</p>

<p>The other two cases allege that Mr Netanyahu attempted to negotiate more favourable coverage in two Israeli media outlets.</p>

<p>One involves alleged attempts by the prime minister to reach a deal with Arnon Mozes, publisher of the popular Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth, for better coverage by agreeing to weaken the status of a rival daily newspaper.</p>

<p>The other alleges Mr Netanyahu received favourable coverage on the popular news website Walla, owned by his close friend Shaul Elovitch, in exchange for smoothing the way for a telecoms merger sought by Elovitch.</p>

<p>Since returning to power in late 2022, Mr Netanyahu's coalition government has clashed with the country's judiciary and law enforcement officials and sparked mass protests by trying to advance legislation that would weaken the courts.</p>

<p>Mr Netanyahu's critics insist the legal cases will finally serve justice to a highly corrupt politician who will do anything to stay in power.</p>

<p>They also accuse him of intentionally prolonging the 14-month conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon to evade justice.</p>

<h3><strong>'Important Milestone'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute, said the lengthy and divisive trial had now reached "an important milestone".</p>

<p>Mr Netanyahu, he said, not only faced a conflict of interest being both prime minister and a criminal defendant, but the trial was "putting him in direct confrontation with important institutions in the state, especially the justice ministry".</p>

<p>On Monday, around a dozen ministers in Mr Netanyahu's coalition sent a letter to attorney general Gali Baharav-Miara requesting the trial be postponed considering events in Syria and the overall security situation.</p>

<p>The letter followed similar calls by ministers and requests from the prime minister's legal team to postpone his testimony because of Israel's wars and his busy schedule.</p>

<p>The prosecution has argued that it is in the public interest for the trial to conclude as quickly as possible and the court has denied all such petitions, although it has agreed to begin trial days slightly later and occasionally reduce the hearings from three to two days a week due to the prime minister's work.</p>

<p>Other Israeli leaders have been convicted in criminal cases, including former prime minister Ehud Olmert who resigned before his trial began, but Mr Netanyahu is the first to take the stand as sitting prime minister.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Syria's new transitional prime minister on Tuesday said it was time for "stability and calm" in the country, two days after longtime president Bashar al-Assad was toppled by rebels in a lightning offensive.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Syria's new transitional prime minister on Tuesday said it was time for "stability and calm" in the country, two days after longtime president Bashar al-Assad was toppled by rebels in a lightning offensive.</p>

<p>The rebels appointed Mohammad al-Bashir as the transitional head of government to run the country until March 1, a statement said.</p>

<p>"Now it is time for this people to enjoy stability and calm," Bashir told Qatar's Al Jazeera television in his first interview since being appointed.</p>

<p>Assad fled Syria as an Islamist-led opposition alliance swept into the capital Damascus over the weekend, bringing to an end five decades of brutal rule by his clan. A senior official told US broadcaster NBC that the ousted Syrian leader was now in Moscow.</p>

<p>Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, the Islamist leader who headed the rebel offensive, had previously announced talks on a transfer of power and vowed to pursue former senior officials responsible for torture and war crimes.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, he sought to allay fears over how Syria would be ruled, telling British broadcaster Sky News the country was "exhausted" by war and would not be heading back into one.</p>

<p>"Syria will be rebuilt... The country is moving towards development and reconstruction. It's going towards stability," he said.</p>

<p>"People are exhausted from war. So the country isn't ready for another one, and it's not going to get into another one."</p>

<p>His group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, is rooted in Syria's Al-Qaeda branch and is proscribed by many Western governments as a terrorist organisation, though it has sought to moderate its image.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged all nations to support an "inclusive" political process in Syria, saying the United States would eventually recognise a government if it meets such standards.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Unity, inclusiveness' -</strong></p>

<p>Blinken said the future government of Syria should be "credible, inclusive and non-sectarian".</p>

<p>Laying out US priorities, Blinken said the new government must "uphold clear commitments to fully respect the rights of minorities" and allow the flow of humanitarian assistance.</p>

<p>The United States wanted the next government to "prevent Syria from being used as a base for terrorism", he added.</p>

<p>Although they no longer hold any territory in Syria, the jihadists of the Islamic State group remain active.</p>

<p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said IS fighters killed 54 government troops after capturing them as they fled across the vast Syrian desert.</p>

<p>The UN envoy for Syria said the groups that forced Assad to flee must transform their "good messages" into actions on the ground.</p>

<p>"They have been sending messages of unity, of inclusiveness," Geir Pedersen said.</p>

<p>"What we need not to see is... that this is not followed up in practice in the days and the weeks ahead of us," he added.</p>

<p>EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas warned of the risks of sectarian violence and a resurgence of extremism. "We must avoid a repeat of the horrific scenarios in Iraq, Libya and Afghanistan," she said.</p>

<p>Syria's nearly 14-year civil war killed 500,000 people and forced half the country to flee their homes, millions of them finding refuge abroad.</p>

<p><strong>- Thousands missing -</strong></p>

<p>The fall of Assad has sparked a frantic search by families of the tens of thousands of people held in his security services' jails and detention centres.</p>

<p>As they advanced towards Damascus, the rebels released thousands of detainees, but many more remain missing.</p>

<p>Syria's White Helmet rescuers on Tuesday called on Russia to pressure Assad into providing maps of secret jails and lists of detainees as they race against time to release prisoners.</p>

<p>A large crowd gathered Monday outside Saydnaya jail, synonymous with the worst atrocities of Assad's rule, to search for relatives, many of whom had spent years in captivity, AFP correspondents reported.</p>

<p>"I'm looking for my brother, who has been missing since 2013. We've looked everywhere for him, we think he's here, in Saydnaya," said 52-year-old Umm Walid.</p>

<p>Crowds of freed prisoners wandered the streets of Damascus, many maimed by torture, weakened by illness and emaciated by hunger.</p>

<p>The United Nations said whoever ended up in power in Syria must hold Assad and his lieutenants to account.</p>

<p>UN investigators who for years have been gathering evidence of horrific crimes called Assad's ouster a "game-changer" because they will now be able to access "the crime scene".</p>

<p>Jolani, who now uses his real name Ahmed al-Sharaa, vowed on Tuesday: "We will not hesitate to hold accountable the criminals, murderers, security and army officers involved in torturing the Syrian people."</p>

<p>- Strikes -</p>

<p>While Syrians were celebrating Assad's ouster, the Israeli military said it had conducted hundreds of strikes on Syria over the past two days.</p>

<p>Pedersen, the UN special envoy, called on Israel to stop.</p>

<p>"We are continuing to see Israeli movements and bombardments into Syrian territory. This needs to stop," he said.</p>

<p>But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Syria's new rulers that he would respond "forcefully" if they allow "Iran to re-establish itself in Syria, or permits the transfer of Iranian weapons or any other weapons to Hezbollah".</p>

<p>Lebanon's Hezbollah meanwhile said it hoped that Syria's new rulers would "take a firm stand against Israeli occupation, while preventing foreign interference in its affairs".</p>

<p>The Britain-based Observatory said Israeli strikes had "destroyed the most important military sites in Syria".</p>

<p>The monitor said the strikes targeted weapons depots, naval vessels and a research centre that Western governments suspected of having links to chemical weapons production.</p>

<p>Israel, which borders Syria, also sent troops into the UN-patrolled buffer zone east of the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights.</p>

<p>The UN official in New York told AFP late Tuesday that Israeli forces were occupying seven locations in the buffer zone. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel backer the United States said the incursion must be "temporary", after the United Nations said Israel was violating the 1974 armistice.</p>

<p>The Israeli defence minister said the military had orders to "establish a sterile defence zone free of weapons and terrorist threats in southern Syria, without a permanent Israeli presence."</p>

<p>Fighting also continued in the north of the country, where battles between Turkish-backed and Kurdish-led forces left 218 people dead over the last three days, according to the Observatory.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Indo-Pacific Commander, Admiral Samuel Paparo, expressed confidence in the US military's ability to defeat China in the Pacific. However, he warned that the US technical advantage over China is rapidly shrinking, Taipei Times reported citing The Washington Post report.</p>

<p>While addressing the Reagan Defence Forum on Saturday, Paparo emphasised the need for the US to maintain its technical lead over China. He highlighted two key areas for improvement: enhancing missile technology and developing a secure communications network that can withstand cyber attacks.</p>

<p>Further, he said, "Although the US is able to hit long-distance and difficult targets with its advanced cruise missile system, each launch costs more than USD 1 million. By contrast, drones, which are relatively cheap to build and develop, can be remotely controlled to fight on the front lines through a computer."</p>

<p>As per The Washington Post report, Paparo stated that "Russia and North Korea had reached an agreement on Moscow providing fourth-generation Mikoyan MiG-29 and Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jets in exchange for Pyongyang sending troops to help in the fight against Ukraine."</p>

<p>Pyongyang, rather than Moscow, proposed sending North Korean troops to Ukraine, Paparo said, adding that the condition was set so that Pyongyang could also obtain ballistic missile re-entry technology and submarine-related technology from Moscow, as per Taipei Times.</p>

<p>According to Paparo, North Korea on October 31 tested an intercontinental ballistic missile that reached an altitude of 7,000km.</p>

<p>"Even though Pyongyang continues to test long-range missiles with adequate range to reach the US ... the US has not yet seen evidence that North Korea has mastered the difficult task of building re-entry vehicles that could contain nuclear warheads, and that could withstand atmospheric resistance and heating when returning from space at a speed of 7km per second. This may help explain why the testing continues," he said.</p>

<p>"Chinese President Xi Jinping had given his military leaders the task of being ready to take Taiwan by 2027, even in the face of US military involvement, but it does not represent a decision to attack that year or any particular year," he said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stating that Israel has "no intention of interfering" in Syria's internal affairs, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned to take "necessary" measures if the current regime allows Iran to re-establish itself in Syria or transfers weapons to Hezbollah.</p>

<p>"We have no intention of interfering in Syria's internal affairs. However, we do intend to do what is necessary for our security. As such, I approve the Air Force bombing of strategic military capabilities left by Syrian military. So that they will not fall into the hands of the jihadists. This is similar to what the British Air Force did when it bombed the fleet of the Vichy regime, which was cooperating with the Nazis, so that it would not fall into the Nazis' hands," Netanyahu said in a video address on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"We want to have relations with the new regime in Syria, but if this regime allows Iran to re-establish itself in Syria, or allow the transfer of Iranian weapons, or weapons of any kind to Hezbollah or attack us, we will respond forcefully and we will exact a heavy price. What happened to the previous regime will also happen to this one," he added.</p>

<p>On Sunday, when the Syrian rebels entered Damascus, forcing President Bashar al-Assad to flee from the country, ending his over two-decade rule in the country, Netanyahu hailed the collapse calling it a "historic day" for the Middle East region.</p>

<p>Netanyahu had further acknowledged that while the collapse presents great opportunities, it also poses significant dangers. He extended a 'hand of peace' for all beyond Israeli borders to live in peace with Israel.</p>

<p>Netanyahu had also shared a video on X and stated, "This is a historic day for the Middle East. The collapse of the Assad regime, the tyranny in Damascus, offers great opportunity but also is fraught with significant dangers. We send a hand of peace to all those beyond our border in Syria: to the Druze, to the Kurds, to the Christians, and to the Muslims who want to live in peace with Israel."</p>

<p>Following the Syrian Army abandoning its positions, Netanyahu on Sunday said that he had ordered the Israeli Army to take over these positions to ensure that no hostile force embeds itself right next to the border of Israel.</p>

<p>"This collapse is a direct result of our forceful action against Hezbollah and Iran, Assad's main supporters. It set off a chain reaction of all those who want to free themselves from this tyranny and its suppression. But it also means we have to take action against possible threats. One of them is the collapse of the Separation of Forces agreement from 1974 between Israel and Syria. This agreement held for 50 years. Last night it collapsed," he had said.<br />
Notably, the head of Syria's main opposition group abroad Hadi al-Bahra Syrian said on Sunday that Damascus is now "without Bashar al-Assad."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India on Tuesday evacuated 75 Indian nationals from Syria, two days after rebel forces overthrew President Bashar Assad's authoritarian government.</p>

<p>The evacuation, coordinated by the embassies of India in Damascus and Beirut, was put into effect following an assessment of the security situation, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said.</p>

<p>"The Government of India today evacuated 75 Indian nationals from Syria, following recent developments in that country," it said in a late-night statement.</p>

<p>"The evacuees included 44 'zaireen' from Jammu and Kashmir who were stranded at Saida Zainab. All Indian nationals have safely crossed over to Lebanon and will return by available commercial flights to India," it said.</p>

<p>The MEA said the government accords the highest priority to the safety and security of Indian nationals abroad.</p>

<p>"Indian nationals remaining in Syria are advised to stay in touch with the Indian Embassy in Damascus," it said.</p>

<p>"The government will continue to monitor the situation closely," the MEA added.</p>

<p>The Syrian government collapsed on Sunday as the rebels seized control of the capital Damascus after capturing several other prominent cities and towns. Assad fled the country after the rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) took control of Damascus, marking the end of his family's 50-year rule.</p>

<p>Russian state media reported that Assad is in Moscow and will be given asylum. His nearly 14-year tenure was marked by civil war, bloodshed and brutal crackdown on his political opponents.</p>

<p>The MEA Monday said it is monitoring the unfolding developments in Syria and advocated a peaceful and inclusive Syrian-led political process going forward in that country.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

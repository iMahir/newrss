       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Masoud Pezeshkian emerges victorious from Iran's presidential election, defeating hardliner Saeed Jalili, his presidency promises a shift towards more pragmatic and reformist policies. But how will Mr Pezeshkian's presidency reshape Iran-India relations?</p>

<p>Mr Pezeshkian, a seasoned lawmaker and cardiac surgeon, has long supported both domestic and international reforms in Iran. His win is viewed as a call for change since it follows a general unhappiness with the hardline policies of his predecessors. But the dynamics of Iranian politics, where hardliners still control the majority and the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei retains ultimate authority, will put Mr Pezeshkian's ability to carry out his vision to the test.</p>

<p><strong>READ </strong>| <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/iran-reformist-masoud-pezeshkian-leads-in-runoff-vote-against-hardline-candidate-saeed-jalili-6044941">Iran Reformist Pezeshkian Defeats Hardliner Jalili In Presidential Polls</a></p>

<p>"Today, we are holding the second round of the presidential election. More than 700 polling centres are accepting the vote of Iranians. We hope that by tomorrow morning we will have a new president. There will be no changes in Iranian foreign policy and internal policy. Both discourses emphasise strengthening Iranian power internally and externally," said Iran's ambassador to India, Iraj Elahi.</p>

<h3><strong>India-Iran Ties</strong></h3>

<p>India and Iran have historically enjoyed strong economic ties. Under Pezeshkian's presidency, these ties are likely to deepen.</p>

<p>The focus will be especially on the strategic Chabahar Port, a project to which India has already committed heavy investments. It is an important transit point for trade with Afghanistan and Central Asia, bypassing Pakistan. India has pledged $120 million for the development of the Shahid-Beheshti Port terminal and offered a $250 million credit line for infrastructure projects in Iran. Experts believe that Iran's general foreign policy is unlikely to change whoever takes over next; modus operandi and details may, however, be different.</p>

<p>Iran is one of India's key sources of crude oil. With Iran eyeing an increase in the exports of oil against the backdrop of ongoing Western sanctions, India could be looking at a reliable and arguably cheaper source of crude oil.</p>

<p>The Pezeshkian approach to regional security will be closely watched in New Delhi. His stand related to keeping up the Axis of Resistance" against Israel and strategic regional siding with forces against what he calls "the Zionist regime" could continue to impact India's tightrope diplomacy in the region.</p>

<p>Another platform for close cooperation between India and Iran is the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), a multi-modal transportation route connecting India to Russia via Iran. This corridor increases connectivity in terms of trade and bilateral ties for regional stability.</p>

<h3><strong>Iran Elections</strong></h3>

<p>The presidential election in Iran takes place in the backdrop of former President Ebrahim Raisi passing away in a helicopter crash on May 19. The polls saw the lowest turnout of voters since the 1979 Islamic Revolution as only 39.92 per cent of eligible voters took part.</p>

<p>The Iranian government had predicted, and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei forecasted a higher turnout. State television showed modest lines at polling centres, while online videos depicted empty polls and light traffic at some sites in the capital, Tehran, reportedly with a heavy security presence.</p>

<p>The elections were held amid heightened regional tensions. In April, for instance, Iran launched its first direct attack on Israel amid the latter's ongoing aggression in Gaza. This was then followed by an intensification of attacks by militant groups, including Lebanon's Hezbollah and the Houthis of Yemen, both armed by Tehran.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While Ayatollah Khamenei has the last word on state affairs, it remains to be seen if the Middle Eastern nation adopts a change in its foreign policy in light of recent events.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Iran's reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian on Saturday won a runoff presidential election against ultraconservative Saeed Jalili, interior ministry said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian on Saturday won a runoff presidential election against ultraconservative Saeed Jalili, the interior ministry said.<br />
Pezeshkian received more than 16 million votes and Jalili more than 13 million out of about 30 million votes cast, electoral authority spokesman Mohsen Eslami said, adding that voter turnout stood at 49.8 percent.</p>

<p>The number of spoiled ballots was reported to be over 600,000.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian thanked his supporters who came to vote "with love and to help" the country.</p>

<p>"We will extend the hand of friendship to everyone; we are all people of this country; we should use everyone for the progress of the country," he said on state television.</p>

<p>The election, called early after the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash, followed a first round marked by a historically low turnout last week.</p>

<p>Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who wields ultimate authority, had called for a higher turnout in the runoff, emphasising the importance of the election.</p>

<p>He said the first round turnout was lower than expected, but added that it was not an act "against the system".</p>

<p>The ballot comes against a backdrop of heightened regional tensions over the Gaza war, a dispute with the West over Iran's nuclear programme, and domestic discontent over the state of Iran's sanctions-hit economy.</p>

<h2>Reformist support</h2>

<p>In last week's first round, Pezeshkian, who was the only reformist allowed to stand, won the largest number of votes, around 42 percent, while Jalili came second with around 39 percent, according to figures from Iran's elections authority.</p>

<p>Only 40 percent of Iran's 61 million eligible voters took part in the first round -- the lowest turnout in any presidential election since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.</p>

<p>The candidacy of Pezeshkian, a relative unknown until recently, has raised the hopes of Iran's reformists after years of dominance by the conservative and ultraconservative camps</p>

<p>Iran's main reformist coalition supported Pezeshkian, with endorsements by former presidents Mohammad Khatami and Hassan Rouhani, a moderate.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian, a 69-year-old heart surgeon, has called for "constructive relations" with Western countries to revive the nuclear deal in order to "get Iran out of its isolation".</p>

<p>Jalili, 58, is Iran's former nuclear negotiator who is widely recognised for his uncompromising anti-West stance.</p>

<p>During his campaign, he rallied a substantial base of hardline supporters and received backing from other conservative figures.</p>

<p>Ahead of Friday's runoff, Pezeshkian and Jalili took part in two televised debates during which they discussed the low turnout, as well as Iran's economic woes, international relations and internet restrictions.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian vowed to ease long-standing internet restrictions and to "fully" oppose police patrols enforcing the mandatory headscarf for women, a high-profile issue since the death in police custody in 2022 of Mahsa Amini.</p>

<p>The 22-year-old Iranian Kurd had been detained for an alleged breach of the dress code and her death sparked months of nationwide unrest.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Catholic Church is to pay 104 million Canadian dollars ($76 million) to hundreds of victims of sexual abuse from eastern Canada, according to a statement released Friday.</p>

<p>In 2020 the Archdiocese of St. John was found liable for one of Canada's largest child sex abuse scandals, at Mount Cashel Orphanage, a now-defunct boy's orphanage in Newfoundland and Labrador province.</p>

<p>The court found sexual abuse was perpetrated by priests and other church officials at the orphanage starting in 1940 and continued over the course of several decades.</p>

<p>A total of 292 victims will receive payouts ranging from 55,000 to 850,000 Canadian dollars, according to the report seen by AFP.</p>

<p>Accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young has been tapped as a third-party intermediary to determine the amount distributed to each victim.</p>

<p>Geoff Budden, one of the attorneys representing the victims, told AFP the amount was in line with "similar compensation from other courts."</p>

<p>"People didn't really grasp the scale of the problem and how widespread the abuse was," he said.</p>

<p>The Archdiocese of St. John declared bankruptcy in 2021, though it has raised 40 million Canadian dollars through selling buildings that belonged to it.</p>

<p>However, Budden said he is optimistic that the victims will receive the full amount awarded by the court.</p>

<p>"There are still assets that need to be processed, including insurance products," he said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A disturbing incident of medical negligence has come to light in Pakistan, where hospital authorities have been accused of swapping a baby boy with a dead baby girl, the <em>Dawn </em>reported. According to an official statement, the parents brought their four-day-old sick baby boy to a Children's Hospital in Lahore after he fell ill. During the treatment, doctors at the hospital declared the boy dead and handed over the body to his father. But when the father took the body to his hometown, Gujranwala, for burial, he was shocked to find it was a girl. He immediately rushed back to the hospital with the body of the girl, claiming that they had brought their baby boy for treatment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1843699/childrens-hospital-replaces-sick-baby-boy-with-dead-girl"><em>Dawn</em></a>, this incident has prompted an investigation. After learning of the shocking accusations, the hospital authorities launched an inquiry into the matter. Later, the hospital authorities found that the baby boy had reportedly gone "missing," the official said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In his formal complaint, the father detailed the sequence of events and accused the hospital of substituting his son with the dead girl's body. He urged the police to lodge a case against the hospital's managerial officials and the doctors concerned for committing the crime and demanded the recovery of his son.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Punjab Health Department in Pakistan swiftly responded to the incident, forming an inquiry committee comprising three senior doctors from the Children's Hospital. The team was tasked with conducting a thorough investigation and submitting a detailed report to uncover the truth, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1843831">outlet</a>.</p>

<p>In its findings, the committee declared that the investigating officers questioned all the relevant staff, including doctors, nurses and paramedics, who remained at the neonatal unit where the baby boy was provided treatment. They also examined the footage of the CCTV cameras.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During their investigation, the hospital management claimed that the parents had themselves taken away the male baby from the hospital against medical advice, without explaining the issue of baby "exchange". The report also stated that the condition of the newborn got critical despite all possible treatments, and the doctors shifted him to the high-dependency unit to put him on ventilator support. However, the parents of the patient refused to get further treatment and left the hospital along with the baby after signing the Leave Against Medical Advice form, the report said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The report did not address the issue of the alleged exchange of the babies. Meanwhile, police have lodged an FIR on the complaint regarding the alleged swapping of the baby boy with the dead baby girl by the hospital staff. The investigation is ongoing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In his first television interview since the CNN debate with Donald Trump, President Joe Biden candidly addressed his performance, describing it as a "bad episode" and taking full responsibility for what transpired.</p>

<p>ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos interviewed Biden in Madison, Wisconsin, following a rally with Democratic supporters where Biden reiterated his commitment to staying in the race.</p>

<p>Stephanopoulos didn't waste time delving into the debate, acknowledging Biden's team's characterisation of it as a "bad night." Biden concurred, straightforwardly admitting, "Sure did."</p>

<p>The conversation then turned to remarks made by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who queried whether the debate was indicative of a more serious underlying issue. "It was a bad episode," Biden clarified. "No indication of any serious condition. I was exhausted. I didn't listen to my instincts in terms of preparing and -- and a bad night."</p>

<p>Regarding his preparation leading up to the debate, which followed his international trip to France for the D-Day anniversary and subsequent rest at Camp David, the anchor asked why the recovery time wasn't sufficient. Biden explained, "Because I was sick. I was feeling terrible." He disclosed that medical tests ruled out COVID-19 but confirmed he had been battling a severe cold.</p>

<p>The anchor inquired if Biden had watched the debate footage afterward. Biden admitted, "I don't think I did, no."</p>

<p>Pressed on whether he realised how poorly it was going while on stage, Biden acknowledged, "Yeah, look. The whole way I prepared, nobody's fault, mine. Nobody's fault but mine."</p>

<p>He reflected on his preparation style and how he adapted it inappropriately for the debate setting, saying, "I prepared what I usually would do sitting down as I did come back with foreign leaders or the National Security Council for explicit detail. And I realised-- partway through that, you know, all-- I get quoted the New York Times had me down, ten points before the debate, nine now, or whatever the hell it is. The fact of the matter is that what I looked at is that he also lied 28 times. I couldn't-- I mean, the way the debate ran, not-- my fault, nobody else's fault, no one else's fault."</p>

<p>"But it seemed like you were having trouble from the first question in, even before he spoke?" Stephanopoulos asked.</p>

<p>"Well, I just had a bad night," Biden said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US President Joe Biden on Friday said he was exhausted due to a heavy cold and lingering jetlag as he sought to explain his dismal debate performance against Donald Trump.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden vowed Friday to stay in the White House race and blamed his dismal debate performance on "feeling terrible" due to a cold, as he sought to save his reelection campaign with a make-or-break TV interview.</p>

<p>As rebellion brews among some nervous Democratic voters, lawmakers and donors, the one-to-one with the ABC network was hyped as the most consequential of the 81-year-old's long career.</p>

<p>"I was sick, I was feeling terrible... We were trying to figure out what's wrong," the president said in an excerpt of his first TV interview since the debate with Donald Trump.</p>

<p>"They did a test to see whether or not I had some infection, you know, a virus. I didn't. I just had a really bad cold."</p>

<p>Biden sounded raspy and gave meandering answers in the clip, which appeared unlikely to reassure Democrats.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign offered a lightning-quick mocking reaction, posting on X that "Biden sounds great!"</p>

<p>The sit-down -- which was due to be aired in full later Friday, came after Biden's debate in Atlanta triggered panic within his party and calls for him to pull out of the race.</p>

<p>The Biden campaign has pushed back hard on any suggestion he may withdraw and, just hours before the ABC interview, released an aggressive campaign travel schedule for the rest of July.</p>

<p>Appearing at a campaign rally in Madison, Wisconsin, the president delivered an energetic stump speech, unequivocally declaring, "I'm staying in the race. I'll beat Donald Trump."</p>

<p>As supporters cheered, he went on the attack against his rival.</p>

<p><strong>- Polls tip toward Trump -</strong></p>

<p>"Let's focus on what really matters," Biden said, reading from teleprompters. "We're running against the biggest liar and the biggest threat... to our democracy in American history -- that's not hyperbole."</p>

<p>Post-debate polls have shown a widening deficit in Trump's favor, and at least three Democrats in Congress have called on Biden to step aside, as have several major newspapers and a raft of Democratic-supporting political commentators.</p>

<p>Wealthy Disney heiress and Democratic supporter Abigail Disney, told CNBC she plans to withhold donations to the party until Biden drops out, saying bluntly that "if Biden does not step down the Democrats will lose" in November.</p>

<p>"This is realism, not disrespect," she said.</p>

<p>Senate Intelligence Committee chariman Mark Warner has approached fellow Democrats to organize talks on Monday on Biden's path forward, multiple US media outlets reported.</p>

<p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries was convening his own meeting -- a video call with senior Democrats -- on Sunday, according to NBC News.</p>

<p>Former US House speaker Nancy Pelosi, one of the most influential Democratic voices, has deemed it "essential" he do more major interviews to prove himself.</p>

<p>The White House has announced he will hold a press conference during the NATO summit in Washington next Thursday, but has not revealed any details on its format or length.</p>

<p>Biden's travel plans include Pennsylvania this weekend, then the NATO meeting, and back on the campaign trail with a swing through the American Southwest.</p>

<p>The president will "engage in frequent off-the-cuff moments over the course of the month, as he has consistently throughout this campaign," his team said, seeking to emphasize his folksy charm.</p>

<p>Trump has meanwhile dared Biden to another debate, or an "all-on discussion," saying he was ready "anytime, anywhere, any place."</p>

<p>With speculation swirling over a potential switch in the Democratic ticket, Kamala Harris, the nation's first female vice president, has suddenly been in the spotlight.</p>

<p>The 59-year-old former prosecutor has offered unwavering support for Biden in public but is standing by as a leading alternative if he steps aside.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A defiant President Joe Biden told supporters Friday he was staying in the White House race and would defeat Donald Trump again, despite fellow Democrats' concerns he lacks the capacity to go head to head against his rival.</p>

<p>"Let me say this as clearly as I can: I'm staying in the race. I'll beat Donald Trump," the president told a rally in Madison, Wisconsin, more than a week after his faltering debate performance raised doubts about his physical and mental fitness.</p>

<p>The US President insisted Friday that no one is more qualified to lead the nation or defeat Trump than he is, swatting away concerns over whether he can beat his Republican challenger in November.</p>

<p>Asked if staying in the race against Trump might jeopardize Democrats holding on to the White House, Biden said: "I don't think anybody's more qualified to be president or win this race than me."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden on Friday spoke to new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, congratulating him on the center-left Labour party's landslide general election victory.</p>

<p>Biden and Starmer "reiterated their continued support for Ukraine as it fights Russia's unrelenting aggression," the White House said in a statement.</p>

<p>"They affirmed their shared commitment to protecting the gains of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement and working with the leaders of Northern Ireland to create and sustain economic growth and opportunities," it added.</p>

<p>Starmer will meet Biden and other world leaders in Washington next week at a NATO summit.</p>

<p>The British vote results contrast with Britain's closest Western allies, with the far-right in France eyeing power and Donald Trump ahead in polls against Biden before the November US presidential election.</p>

<p>Biden and Starmer "reaffirmed the special relationship between our nations and the importance of working together in support of freedom and democracy around the world," the statement said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer told US President Joe Biden on Friday that British support for Ukraine's war with Russia was "unwavering", in a first call hours after Britain's new leader took charge.</p>

<p>"The leaders reiterated their steadfast commitment to Ukraine and the prime minister underscored that the UK's support for Ukraine was unwavering," Starmer's Downing Street office said in a readout.</p>

<p>"The leaders discussed their shared commitment to the special relationship between the UK and US, and their aligned ambitions for greater economic growth," the statement added.</p>

<p>It said Starmer "looked forward to working side by side across the breadth of the relationship, including the AUKUS partnership and ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific".</p>

<p>The UK, US and Australia have forged a new defence alliance in recent years dubbed AUKUS, which is seen as primarily aimed at countering China's growing military strength in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

<p>The call between the British and American leaders comes just days before they will rub shoulders next week in Washington at a NATO summit.</p>

<p>Biden had earlier congratulated Starmer on leading his centre-left Labour party to a landslide general election victory.</p>

<p>"I look forward to our shared work in support of freedom and democracy around the world, and to further strengthening the special relationship between our two countries," Biden said on X.</p>

<p>The UK readout said the two leaders also "reflected on their shared commitment to protecting the gains of the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement," referring to Northern Ireland's decades-old peace deal that Washington helped secure.</p>

<p>The accord has become strained in recent years by Britain's exit from the European Union.</p>

<p>That has left Northern Ireland with the UK's only land border with the EU, along the sensitive Irish border.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With his reelection bid on the line, US President Joe Biden sits down Friday for a crucial TV interview to persuade doubters of his physical and mental fitness for a second White House term.</p>

<p>The one-to-one with the ABC network has been hyped as the most consequential of the 81-year old's long career, after a disastrous campaign debate with Donald Trump triggered panic within his Democratic Party and calls for him to pull out of the race.</p>

<p>The Biden campaign has pushed back hard on any suggestion he may withdraw, and just hours before the ABC interview it released an aggressive campaign travel schedule for the rest of July.</p>

<p>At least three of his party members in Congress have called on him to step aside, as have several major newspaper editorial boards and a raft of Democratic-supporting political commentators.</p>

<p>The president has said that he is "not leaving" and is "in this race to the end," but post-debate polls have shown Trump's lead widening.</p>

<p>Biden has also not yet spoken publicly without a teleprompter since the debate, other than some brief remarks.</p>

<p>Friday's interview with ABC presenter George Stephanopoulos, set to be recorded during a campaign trip to Wisconsin, will be a key moment for Biden to try to dispel the worries and reset expectations.</p>

<p>With soaring anticipation for the interview, ABC has switched up its original plan of airing excerpts through the weekend, and will instead broadcast it in full Friday at 8:00 pm (0000 GMT Saturday).</p>

<p>Biden will face an experienced interviewer known for his firm, effective style.</p>

<p>Stephanopoulos worked for former Democratic president Bill Clinton during his first campaign and was one of his closest advisors during his first term in the White House.</p>

<p>- Campaign schedule -</p>

<p>Biden will have to win back confidence with a clear and cohesive performance after he was often incoherent in the debate.</p>

<p>A growing number of Americans have called for him to prove he has the energy to defeat Trump in November, and handle another four years in the White House.</p>

<p>Former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, one of the most influential Democratic voices, has deemed it "essential" that the president do more major interviews.</p>

<p>Other supporters have called for a long-form news conference to judge his stamina.</p>

<p>The White House has announced that he will hold a press event during the NATO summit in Washington next week, but has not revealed any details on its format or length.</p>

<p>Biden's travel plans include Pennsylvania this weekend, then the NATO meeting, and back on the campaign trail with a swing through the southwest United States.</p>

<p>The president will "engage in frequent off-the-cuff moments over the course of the month, as he has consistently throughout this campaign," his team said, seeking to emphasize his folksy charm.</p>

<p>The election is "a choice between Joe Biden -- a fighter for American families -- and Donald Trump -- a convicted criminal," it added.</p>

<p>Trump has meanwhile dared Biden to another debate, or an "all-on discussion," saying that he was ready "anytime, anywhere, any place."</p>

<p>With speculation still swirling over a potential switch-up at the top of the Democratic ticket, Kamala Harris, the nation's first female vice president, has suddenly been in the spotlight.</p>

<p>The 59-year-old former California prosecutor -- who joined Biden at Thursday's July 4 celebrations -- has been performing a delicate balancing act since the debate.</p>

<p>She has offered unwavering support for Biden in public but is standing by as a leading contender to replace him if he steps aside.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Milan's main airport will be renamed after former Italian prime minister and business tycoon Silvio Berlusconi, Transport Minister Matteo Salvini said on Friday.</p>

<p>Berlusconi, who died last year aged 86, led four governments at the helm of his centre-right Forza Italia party, and was one of Italy's most divisive figures of modern times.</p>

<p>Speaking at a conference in southern Italy, Salvini said the civil aviation authority had approved a request by the Lombardy region around Milan to rename Malpensa airport in honour of Berlusconi, who hailed from the country's financial capital.</p>

<p>"Seeing as the final decision rests with the transport minister, I really think it will go ahead," said Salvini, leader of the rightist League party and a long-time Berlusconi ally.</p>

<p>"In memory of my friend Silvio, a great businessman, a great Milanese citizen and a great Italian," Salvini later posted on social media platform X above a photo of Berlusconi and Malpensa airport.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Keir Starmer got down to work as Britain's new leader Friday, appointing his ministerial team after his centre-left Labour party's landslide general election victory ended 14 years of Conservative rule.</p>

<p>Starmer named Rachel Reeves the UK's first woman finance minister and appointed David Lammy as foreign secretary following his election win to become Labour's first prime minister since Gordon Brown in 2010.</p>

<p>Flag-waving crowds of cheering Labour activists lined Downing Street as Starmer pledged to "rebuild" the UK after head of state King Charles III invited him to form a government during a meeting at Buckingham Palace.</p>

<p>"Now, our country has voted decisively for change, for national renewal and a return of politics to public service," the 61-year-old said in his first speech as PM.</p>

<p>"The work of change begins immediately, but have no doubt, we will rebuild Britain."</p>

<p><strong>'Sorry'</strong></p>

<p>A sombre Rishi Sunak conceded defeat during a torrid night for his Conservatives that claimed the scalps of at least 12 of his senior cabinet colleagues -- and his predecessor Liz Truss.</p>

<p>Her disastrous 49-day tenure effectively sealed the Tories' fate with the public two years ago, when her unfunded tax cuts spooked markets and crashed the pound.</p>

<p>Before leaving Downing Street for the final time as prime minister, Sunak said "sorry" to the public and revealed that he would step down as Tory leader once formal arrangements for a successor are in place.</p>

<p>Labour raced past the 326 seats needed to secure an overall majority in the 650-seat House of Commons at 0400 GMT, with the final result expected on Saturday.</p>

<p>As of 1700 GMT on Friday, the party had won 412 seats in the House of Commons with only one result left to declare, giving it a majority of 174.</p>

<p>The Tories won just 121 seats -- a record low -- with the right-wing vote apparently spliced by Nigel Farage's anti-immigration Reform UK party, which picked up five seats.</p>

<p>In another boost for the centrists, the smaller opposition Liberal Democrats ousted the Scottish National Party as the third-biggest party.</p>

<p><strong>World reaction</strong></p>

<p>The results buck a trend among Britain's closest Western allies, with the far-right in France eyeing power and Donald Trump looking set for a return in the United States.</p>

<p>Congratulations came in from European leaders, including Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who said Starmer would be a "very good, very successful" prime minister.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the two countries would "continue to be reliable allies through thick and thin".</p>

<p>Ex-US president Donald Trump congratulated his admirer Farage on winning election to the UK parliament at his eighth attempt, but noticeably neglected to mention Starmer.</p>

<p>Outside London's busy Waterloo station, 49-year-old engagement officer Ramsey Sargent called it a "momentous election".</p>

<p>"It has been very rocky over the last few months and years. I'm really excited to see what happens next," he told AFP.</p>

<p><strong>'Catastrophic'</strong></p>

<p>Sunak tendered his resignation to the king shortly after returning to London from his rural constituency in northern England, where the depth of his party's defeat quickly became apparent.</p>

<p>The Tories' worst previous election result was 156 seats in 1906. Former leader William Hague told Times Radio this was "a catastrophic result in historic terms".</p>

<p>But Tim Bale, politics professor at Queen Mary, University of London, said it was "not as catastrophic as some were predicting" and the Tories would now need to decide how best to fight back.</p>

<p>Brexit champion Farage has made no secret of his aim to take over the party.</p>

<p>"There is a massive gap on the centre-right of British politics and my job is to fill it," he said after a comfortable win in Clacton, eastern England.</p>

<p><strong>To-do list</strong></p>

<p>Labour's resurgence is a stunning turnaround from five years ago, when hard-left former leader Jeremy Corbyn took the party to its worst defeat since 1935 in an election dominated by Brexit.</p>

<p>Starmer took over in early 2020 and set about moving the party back to the centre, purging the infighting and anti-Semitism that cost it support.</p>

<p>Opinion polls consistently put Labour 20 points ahead of the Tories since Truss's resignation, giving an air of inevitability about a Labour win -- the first since Tony Blair in 2005.</p>

<p>But as the count neared the end, the gap was around 11 percent, with Labour looking set to win fewer votes than it did in 2019, partly reflecting a lower turnout.</p>

<p>Starmer faces a daunting in-tray, from anaemic economic growth to overstretched and underfunded public services and households squeezed financially.</p>

<p>He has promised a return of political integrity, after a chaotic period of five Tory prime ministers in 14 years, scandal and sleaze.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk wants to dismiss a lawsuit by former Twitter shareholders who said he waited too long in early 2022 to reveal his large ownership stake in the social media company, saying "all indications" show his delay was a mistake.</p>

<p>In a late Wednesday night filing in Manhattan federal court, Musk called it implausible to believe he wanted to defraud shareholders who didn't know he had taken a 9.2% Twitter stake, and missed out on big gains because they sold their own stock.</p>

<p>Investors in the proposed class action said Musk and his wealth manager Jared Birchall knew a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rule required Musk to disclose by March 24, 2022 he had bought 5% of Twitter, yet waited another 11 days.</p>

<p>The investors said this let Musk buy more shares at cheap prices, saving more than $200 million. Twitter, now known as X, rose 27% on April 4, 2022 after Musk revealed his 9.2% stake.</p>

<p>Musk is the world's richest person according to Forbes magazine, and runs other companies including electric car maker Tesla</p>

<p>In his filing, Musk said he had intended to reveal his Twitter stake at the end of 2022, but disclosed it promptly after realizing he misunderstood the SEC disclosure rule.</p>

<p>"This is not a scheme to defraud," Musk said. "All indications--including those in the pleadings--point to mistake."</p>

<p>Musk also denied the investors' claim that an unnamed Morgan Stanley banker helped devise a trading strategy to amass Twitter shares without alerting the broader market.</p>

<p>Lawyers for the investors, who are led by an Oklahoma public pension fund, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday.</p>

<p>Musk eventually bought San Francisco-based Twitter for $44 billion in October 2022. The SEC has also probed his Twitter stock purchases.</p>

<p>Last September, U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter refused to dismiss an earlier version of the lawsuit, finding evidence that Musk understood the SEC disclosure and testified about it under oath.</p>

<p>The case is Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System v Musk et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 22-03026.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A team of archeologists have discovered the ruins of what appears to be a 4,000-year-old ceremonial temple buried in a sand dune of northern Peru, alongside skeletal human remains which may have been offerings for religious rituals.</p>

<p>The ruins were discovered in the sandy desert district of Zana, in the South American country's Lambayeque region, a short stretch from the Pacific Ocean and some 780 km (484 miles) north of the capital Lima.</p>

<p>"We are still waiting for radio-carbon dating to confirm the date, but the evidence suggests this religious construction could be part of a religious tradition of temples built on Peru's northern coast during that period," said Luis Muro, an archeologist from Peru's Pontifical Catholic University who led the research.</p>

<p>Muro's team found the skeletal remains of three adults between the walls and bases of what was once a multi-story structure, one of which was accompanied by offerings and possibly wrapped in a kind of linen or clothing, he said.</p>

<p>One of the temple walls sports a high-relief drawing of a mythological figure with a human body and a bird's head, a design which Muro said predates the pre-Hispanic Chavin culture which populated the central Peruvian coast for over half a millennia from around 900 BC.</p>

<p>Muro said remains of what might have been another temple were found in another excavation nearby, this one belonging to the late Moche culture, which arose about 1,400 years ago across the country's northern coast.</p>

<p>Northern Peru is home to the ruins of ceremonial complexes such as the Sacred City of Caral, about 5,000 years old, while southern Peru's Ica region hosts the Nazca lines, mysterious geoglyphs carved into the desert more than 1,500 years ago.</p>

<p>Peru's most prominent archaeological site is the Incan citadel Machu Picchu, nestled in the mountainous Cusco province, a World Heritage site which was built in the mid-15th century.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US president Donald Trump celebrated the election of fellow populist Nigel Farage to Britain's parliament on Friday, neglecting to mention the new prime minister, Keir Starmer.</p>

<p>Farage's anti-immigration Reform UK party won the third largest vote haul, but under Britain's electoral system it took just five seats while Starmer's Labour party swept into office with a landslide.</p>

<p>"Congratulations to Nigel Farage on his big WIN of a Parliament Seat Amid Reform UK Election Success. Nigel is a man who truly loves his Country!" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.</p>

<p>Farage is a long-standing ally of Trump, who has dubbed the divorced father-of-four "Mr Brexit" and previously said the British populist would have done a "great job" as the UK's ambassador to Washington.</p>

<p>Farage is a champion of Brexit who was elected to parliament on his eighth attempt and has made no secret of his desire to take over the now-main opposition Conservative party, which was trounced at the polls by Labour.</p>

<p>"There is a massive gap on the centre-right of British politics and my job is to fill it," he said after a comfortable win in Clacton, eastern England.</p>

<p>The result bucks a rightward trend among Britain's closest allies, with the far-right National Rally in France eyeing power and Trump looking set for a return in the United States.</p>

<p>Farage's win will likely embolden the attention-grabbing populist figurehead in his long-term aim of staging a "takeover" of the Conservatives.</p>

<p>Millions of their voters appeared to have already switched their support to Reform, handing the Tories one of their worst-ever results.</p>

<p>An initial exit poll caused a stir Thursday night after predicting Reform would secure 13 seats -- far exceeding forecasts in the latter stages of the campaign that it would win just a handful.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping promised on Friday to defend the "territorial integrity" of Tajikistan as he announced a boost to diplomatic relations with the neighbouring country on a rare visit.</p>

<p>Xi arrived in the Tajik capital Dushanbe, Thursday night from Kazakhstan following a gathering of leaders of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), during which he held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin and urged the bloc to "resist external interference".</p>

<p>Central Asia is a vital link in China's flagship Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a massive infrastructure project that Beijing has used to expand its clout overseas, but which critics say has left developing countries saddled with onerous loans.</p>

<p>Beijing has sought to fill a void in the region created by Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, as former Soviet states worry about an increasingly bellicose Russia.</p>

<p>"China will continue to unswervingly promote friendly and mutually beneficial cooperation with Tajikistan... firmly support Tajikistan's efforts to safeguard national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity," Xi told his Tajik counterpart Emomali Rahmon, according to state broadcaster CCTV.</p>

<p>Xi also pledged to "firmly oppose any external interference in Tajikistan's internal affairs under any pretext", without mentioning any foreign player by name.</p>

<p>Beijing has recently stepped up its diplomatic efforts in Central Asia, a region rich in hydrocarbons and crucial for the transport of goods between Europe and Asia, but also traditionally a region of Russian influence.</p>

<p>Xi, who was welcomed by Rahmon at Dushanbe's airport where more than 1,500 young Tajiks dressed in traditional costumes performed Chinese and Tajik songs and dances, praised his counterpart.</p>

<p>"Thanks to the joint efforts of the two sides, the political mutual trust between the two countries has been continuously deepened," said Xi, praising Rahmon.</p>

<p>"No matter how the international situation changes, China will always be Tajikistan's trustworthy friend, reliable partner and close brother," said Xi.</p>

<p>The two leaders announced the upgrading of diplomatic relations, as Xi awarded Rahmon a order of friendship offered to personalities who have promoted relations with China.</p>

<p>Xi has previously visited Tajikistan in 2014 and 2019.</p>

<p>The SCO was founded in 2001 but has come to prominence in recent years. Alongside China, Russia and Belarus, its full members are: India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan and Tajikistan.</p>

<p>On Thursday in the Kazakh capital Astana, Xi told SCO leaders: "We should join hands to resist external interference, firmly support each other, take care of each other's concerns... and firmly control the future and destiny of our countries and regional peace and development in our own hands."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's newly appointed Foreign Secretary David Lammy reiterated his support Friday for international efforts to secure an "immediate ceasefire" in the Israel-Hamas war and for the release of remaining hostages.</p>

<p>Lammy, 51, said he would "get to work with tireless diplomacy" towards those twin aims, in his first comments after becoming the country's top diplomat.</p>

<p>New Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer had confirmed Lammy -- the party's spokesperson on foreign affairs since 2021 -- in the post hours earlier, following Labour's landslide victory in the UK general election held Thursday.</p>

<p>"All of us recognise the agony of communities who have seen the scenes coming out of Israel and Gaza," Lammy said from the Foreign Office.</p>

<p>"But the job now is to get to work with tireless diplomacy to support an immediate ceasefire and move towards getting those hostages out."</p>

<p>Lammy, who replaced Conservative David Cameron as foreign secretary, added that he will "do all I can diplomatically" to support US President Joe Biden's efforts to secure the ceasefire.</p>

<p>Biden announced a pathway to a truce deal in May that he said had been proposed by Israel. It included an initial six-week truce, Israeli withdrawal from Gaza population centres and the freeing of hostages by Palestinian militants.</p>

<p>Israel's spy chief was expected in Qatar on Friday for the latest effort to seal a deal and free hostages held by Palestinian militants in Gaza, almost nine months into the Israel-Hamas war.</p>

<p>The UK government under Starmer's predecessor Rishi Sunak has supported the US-led efforts, and Labour regaining power is not expected to represent a shift in London's policy towards the conflict.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Britain's new Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Friday appointed Rachel Reeves as finance minister, the first woman to hold the position in the country's history, following Labour's landslide election victory.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rachel Reeves, Britain's first woman finance minister, is a former child chess champion and Bank of England economist who has pledged to grow the nation's economy while showing strong fiscal discipline.</p>

<p>Reeves, 45, becomes chancellor of the exchequer after her centre-left Labour party won Thursday's UK general election by a landslide, ending 14 years of rule by the right-wing Conservatives.</p>

<p>"It is the honour of my life to have been appointed chancellor of the exchequer," Reeves wrote on social media platform X after her appointment by new Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p>

<p>"To every young girl and woman reading this, let today show that there should be no limits on your ambitions."</p>

<p>Labour had put the economy at the heart of its election manifesto, targeting growth and wealth creation as key priorities in government, while its emphasis on the latter is not normally associated with the party's traditionally leftist policies.</p>

<p>"Economic growth was the Labour Party's mission," Reeves added Friday.</p>

<p>"It is now a national mission. Let's get to work," said the married mother of two children.</p>

<p><strong>'Iron chancellor'</strong></p>

<p>Reeves recently told company bosses that Labour had become "the natural party of British business", adding that the party would show "iron discipline" over public finances.</p>

<p>The comments drew comparisons with 'Iron Lady' Margaret Thatcher, Britain's first woman prime minister.</p>

<p>Unlike Conservative leader Thatcher, who privatised key sectors after becoming prime minister in 1979, Reeves wants a form of renationalisation, notably for energy, as she takes inspiration from policy enacted by US President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>Labour has pledged to create Great British Energy, a publicly owned company that would spearhead funding, alongside the private sector, for the "green" transition away from fossil fuels.</p>

<p>James Wood, senior teaching associate in political economy at the University of Cambridge, said Labour and Reeves were seeking a "responsible" approach to the public purse.</p>

<p>"When she talks about being an iron chancellor, I think what she means is: we're going to balance the books and we're going to be responsible -- and we're going to try and get Britain's economy running... in a responsible way," he told AFP.</p>

<p>London-born Reeves tapped into public anger over Sunak's predecessor Liz Truss, whose unfunded 2022 mini-budget crashed the pound and sent mortgage rates soaring, worsening a cost-of-living crisis.</p>

<p>"They want to distance themselves from fiscal irresponsibility, not making big promises about spending that they can't possibly keep," Wood added.</p>

<p><strong>Banking career</strong></p>

<p>Reeves, whose parents were teachers, is no stranger to outmanoeuvring opponents.</p>

<p>She became British girls' chess champion aged 14 before studying philosophy, politics and economics at the University of Oxford, which was followed by a Master's degree at the London School of Economics.</p>

<p>After graduating, she worked as an economist for a decade, first at the Bank of England before switching to the private sector.</p>

<p>While working for British retail bank HBOS, the global financial crisis struck in 2008, resulting in her employer receiving a huge bailout, along with other lenders, from Gordon Brown's Labour government.</p>

<p>In 2010, when the Conservatives entered power in a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, Reeves was elected Labour MP for Leeds West in northern England.</p>

<p>Eleven years later, Starmer appointed her as Labour's finance spokesperson. Her sister Ellie Reeves is also a Labour MP.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Newly-minted Prime Minister Dick Schoof faced a baptism of fire at the opening of the Dutch parliament over remarks by two cabinet ministers about a conspiracy theory with neo-Nazi roots.</p>

<p>Schoof was inaugurated on Tuesday with pomp and fanfare to head a coalition government dominated by far-right leader Geert Wilders and his anti-immigration Freedom Party, the PVV.</p>

<p>Two days later, the new Dutch premier's first lower house debate spiralled into chaos when not only the opposition, but Wilders himself aimed his arrows at Schoof, his own choice for the top job.</p>

<p>No amount of preparation could ready Schoof, a veteran career civil servant, for his first appearance within the bear pit of Dutch parliamentary politics, marked by interruptions and sniping on X, formally known as Twitter.</p>

<p>At the centre of the controversy are two cabinet ministers from Wilders' PVV: new Asylum and Migration Minister Marjolein Faber and Foreign Trade and Development Aid Minister Reinette Klever.</p>

<p>Both have in the past spoken about the so-called "omvolking" -- the Dutch term for the "great replacement theory" that supposes that Europe's white population is being deliberately replaced by immigrants.</p>

<p>While both ministers have "distanced themselves" from the term, they maintained that there was a "worrying demographic development" in the Netherlands, where the ruling coalition now wants to implement the "strictest immigration policy ever."</p>

<p><strong>Isolated</strong></p>

<p>But Schoof reiterated during the debate: "I repeat, this government is against discrimination, racism and exclusion."</p>

<p>The Dutch left-wing opposition accused Schoof of tolerating those who have made "conspiratorial" and "racist" remarks -- which also included criticising the wearing of veils -- within his ministerial team.</p>

<p>Wilders himself then launched a virulent attack on Schoof for not defending his ministers for "being made out as racists", calling Schoof's response "weak."</p>

<p>"The prime minister should immediately distance himself from it. I will not accept anything less!" Wilders said on X.</p>

<p>Schoof, not aligned to any party and who has been appointed by a four-party coalition of the PVV, the Liberal VVD, the farmer-friendly BBB and the new centre-right NSC, appeared isolated on all sides.</p>

<p>Leiden politics professor Ruud Koole told AFP the first debate was a litmus test to see how far the PVV's junior coalition parties would go to normalise extreme views within Wilders' party.</p>

<p>"It turns out very far," he said.</p>

<p>"The statements made in the past by PVV ministers about the 'great replacement' have been swept under the carpet," Koole said.</p>

<p>"All three the other coalition parties have accepted to have the 'great replacement' rephrased as a "demographic phenomenon",' he said.</p>

<p><strong>'Disgusting'</strong></p>

<p>Wilders, who claimed a stunning victory in last year's parliamentary elections, continues to lead his party as an MP.</p>

<p>He gave up on ambitions to become Dutch prime minister after other coalition parties threatened to withdraw because of his anti-Islam and eurosceptic views.</p>

<p>Wilders said he wanted to limit immigration to the Netherlands "as much as possible", but he has indeed called the "great replacement" theory "disgusting".</p>

<p>But during the debate, he aimed his barbs at Schoof for not defending those ministers made out by the left, according to Wilders, as "racist."</p>

<p>Wilders's outburst was immediately criticised by the junior coalition partner leaders of the VVD and the NSC on X.</p>

<p>"I was particularly struck by how defensive Wilders was and how he tried in a frantic and authoritarian way to deny the racism that his party clearly propagates in various ways," said Sarah Bracke, sociology professor at the University of Amsterdam.</p>

<p>"It is intellectually and politically untenable to continue to deny that the ideas at the heart of the PVV, and also of this government, are not racist, or that it would be enough to no longer mention the term 'great replacement' to make extremist and racist ideas disappear," she told AFP.</p>

<p>"If Mr Wilders continues to criticise his prime minister, this could lead to Schoof's resignation," added Leiden University's Koole.</p>

<p>"But we are not there yet," he said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rishi Sunak lost big at the UK polls. The message was further underlined by a YouTube star who stood behind him holding up a piece of paper with a giant letter "L" on it, as the outgoing Prime Minister was delivering his speech of thanks to his constituents.</p>

<p>The prank, which referred to Mr Sunak as a "loser", was claimed by YouTuber Niko Omilana. "Farewell Rishi, Hold this L," wrote the YouTuber, who has a following of 7.49 million, on X.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">farewell rishi, hold this L <a href="https://t.co/qjqTIxbYSZ">pic.twitter.com/qjqTIxbYSZ</a></p>
— NDL Ringside (@NikoOmilana) <a href="https://twitter.com/NikoOmilana/status/1809071233461317738?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 5, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Niko, who is known for his various pranks online, could be seen moving behind the ex-PM to ensure his sign would be caught in the camera shots, as the conservative leader conceded the election to Labour.</p>

<p>Niko was able to make it to stage and behind the Tory leader as he stood as an independent candidate in Sunak's Yorkshire seat, which the outgoing PM has retained.</p>

<p>Last month, the famous prankster had said in a video posted on X that he is planning to "completely remove" the UK's current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak from politics.</p>

<p>There was more misery in store for the 44-year-old leader.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A cartoon posted by X user @Cartoon4sale shows what appears to be Mr Sunak sliding out of the "0" in 10 Downing Street. It suggests a decline in the power and popularity of Mr Sunak and is trolling his misfortune.</p>

<p>Shortly before Mr Sunak had conceded defeat, Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair posted on its X account saying, "Don't worry @RishiSunak we've got a seat for you". The post has since received 3.9m views so far.</p>

<p>The Conservative Party led by Mr Sunak suffered a heavy defeat after 14 years in government, ending his premiership, 20 months after he was sworn in amidst political turmoil in the party.</p>

<p>Mr Sunak saw a record number of his top ministerial team lose their seats, including defence secretary Grant Shapps and House of Commons leader Penny Mordaunt.</p>

<p>Keir Starmer has promised to "rebuild Britain" as he took office as the UK's new prime minister following his centre-left Labour party's landslide general election victory.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a post on X (formerly Twitter) Mr Zelenskyy referred to Russia's attack Monday - in which at least 37 people, including three children, were killed after a missile strike on a children's hospital in Kyiv.</p>

<p>The strike also damaged nearly 100 buildings, including schools and maternity hospitals.</p>

<p>His tweet included photographs of the bombed hospital and babies in ambulances.</p>

<p>Mr Zelenskky's post came after Prime Minister Modi met President Putin in Moscow and shared an embrace. Visuals from their meeting showed the two leaders drinking tea on a terrace at Mr Putin's home in Novo-Ogaryovo outside Moscow, and Mr Modi being driven around in a golf cart.</p>

<p>One photo in particular - of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/pm-modi-hugs-putin" target="_blank">Mr Modi and Mr Putin hugging</a> - has been widely shared online.</p>

<p>And the Ukraine President was particularly critical of that image, posting, "It is a huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world's largest democracy hug the world's most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day..."</p>

<p>PM Modi flew into Moscow on a two-day visit that treads a fine line between maintaining a longstanding relationship and courting closer ties with the West amid the war in Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the Prime Minister's first visit since he was voted back to power last month.</p>

<p>It is also his first to Russia since the war in Ukraine began.</p>

<p>Sources have told NDTV that Mr Modi, during his meeting with Mr Putin, stressed no solution - to the violence - could be found on the battlefield. "India has always called for respecting the United Nations Charter, including territorial integrity and sovereignty. There is no solution on the battlefield. Dialogue and diplomacy is the way forward," Mr Modi is believed to have said.</p>

<p>Mr Modi has also spoken to Mr Zelenskyy on numerous occasions, including meeting him in Italy last month <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pm-narendra-modi-ukraine-president-volodymyr-zelensky-meet-on-sidelines-of-g7-summit-in-italy-5889246" target="_blank">on the sidelines of the G7 summit</a>.

<p>In a phone call with President Zelenskyy in October 2022, PM Modi said there can be "no military solution" and that India is ready to contribute to any peace efforts</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United Nations on Tuesday said there was a "high likelihood" that the children's hospital in Kyiv suffered "a direct hit" from a Russian missile.</p>

<p>Danielle Bell, head of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, called Monday's strike "one of the most egregious attacks that we've seen since the onset of the full-scale invasion" in February 2022.</p>

<p>She was speaking after Russia attacked cities across Ukraine on Monday with a missile barrage that killed more than three dozen people and ripped open the Okhmatdyt children's hospital in Kyiv, sparking international outcry.</p>

<p>Dozens of volunteers including hospital staff and rescue workers dug through debris from the hospital in a desperate search for survivors after the rare day-time bombardment, AFP journalists on the scene saw.</p>

<p>Russia has denied that it was responsible for the hospital strike, claiming the extensive missile damage in Kyiv was caused by Ukrainian air defence systems.</p>

<p>But Bell told reporters in Geneva that video footage "shows the weapon directly impacting the hospital".</p>

<p>The Okhmatdyt paediatric hospital is a children's specialist facility where families from across the country bring their children for treatment of serious medical conditions, such as cancer and kidney disease, she said, speaking via video-link from Kyiv.</p>

<p>"Analysis of the video footage and assessment made at the incident site indicates a high likelihood that the children's hospital suffered a direct hit, rather than receiving damages due to an intercepted weapons system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This must be investigated," said Bell, who said her team and military experts had observed the damage at the hospital and spoken to staff, patients' parents and local residents.</p>

<p>She said that at the time of the attack, 670 child patients and more than a thousand medical staff were present.</p>

<p>Bell said Russia had likely fired from an aircraft a Kh-101 air-to-surface cruise missile armed with several hundred kilogrammes of explosives.</p>

<p>"The factors suggesting that it was a direct hit are based on video footage which shows the technical specification of the type of weapon that was used; it shows the weapon directly impacting the hospital, rather than being intercepted in the air," said Bell.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A rumour that Cartoon Network is shutting down sent shockwaves across the Internet. So much so that the hashtag RIPCartoonNetwork became the top trend.</p>

<p>The rumour started with a video posted on X (formerly Twitter) by the account "Animation Workers Ignited", which claimed that the channel was "dead". However, it has since been clarified that the channel is not actually shutting down.</p>

<h3><strong>Why is RIPCartoonNetwork trending?</strong></h3>

<p>The video was intended to bring attention to the struggles faced by the animation industry, which has been heavily impacted by the pandemic. Many workers have been left unemployed for over a year and the industry as a whole is struggling to recover.</p>

<p>The video sparked a widespread reaction, with fans expressing their support for the animation industry and its workers. The hashtag RIPCartoonNetwork was used to show solidarity and raise awareness about the issues faced by the industry.</p>

<p>The video talked about the harsh realities faced by animation workers in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite the industry's ability to operate remotely and continue production uninterrupted, studios have been accused of cancelling projects, outsourcing jobs and laying off artists en masse.</p>

<p>The video claimed that big studios are driven by greed, cutting finances by reducing spending and staff, while CEOs and executives continue to reap benefits for themselves. The animation industry is "under attack," the video declared, urging fans to take a stand and show support for the affected artists.</p>

<p>The video called on fans to share their favourite Cartoon Network shows that were cancelled too soon, using the hashtag RIPCartoonNetwork.</p>

<h3><strong>Is Cartoon Network shutting down?</strong></h3>

<p>Cartoon Network is not shutting down, despite rumours. The channel is adapting to changes in the media landscape and has new programming in development, including spin-offs of popular shows.</p>

<p>New programmes are also in the works, including The Amazing World of Gumball: The Series premiering this year, and spin-offs of Adventure Time, Regular Show, and Foster's Home of Imaginary Friends in development.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Citing concerns about his health and ability to take on Donald Trump, prominent House Democrats have doubted Joe Biden's fitness for office and his chances of winning in 2024.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fifty-six years ago, a US President appeared on television and announced, to the nation's shock, that he'd not seek re-election. His name was Lyndon B. Johnson, the most recent US President to not run for his second elected term. The reasons were many and varied.</p>

<p>In November 1963, Johnson, the then US Vice-President, ascended to the top job following the assassination of then-President John F. Kennedy. A year later, he registered a landslide victory for Democrats in Presidential polls.</p>

<p>However, that changed after he presided over the deeply unpopular Vietnam War. Even though he was elected as the Democratic nominee in 1968, his health, plunging approval ratings and the way he handled the war -- all went against him. Johnson decided it was time for him to make way for someone else.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to 2024, another US President's reelection bid is in jeopardy. This time, it's Joe Biden faced with growing calls from within the party to drop out of the presidential race. Citing concerns about his health and ability to take on Donald Trump, prominent House Democrats have doubted Biden's fitness for office and his chances of winning in 2024.</p>

<p>Despite the mounting pressure, Biden remains defiant, insisting he will stay in the race. But will his determination be enough to overcome the rising dissent against his candidacy?</p>

<p>On Sunday, a group of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/four-democrats-congress-call-biden-step-2024-race-rcna160625">Democratic lawmakers</a>, including Reps Adam Smith, Jerry Nadler, Mark Takano and Joe Morelle, gathered to discuss their party's future. According to sources, they all agreed that President Biden should withdraw from the presidential race. This was also echoed publicly by Rep Adam Smith in a Monday interview with CNN, where he openly called for Biden to drop out.</p>

<p>Rep Angie Craig urged President Biden to <a href="http://https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2024/07/05/biden-calls-debate-just-a-bad-episode-i-was-sick-in-abc-interview/ ">withdraw from the presidential race</a> following his interview with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos. Craig cited Biden's disappointing debate performance and his inability to deliver a strong response in the aftermath.</p>

<p>Reps Mike Quigley and Seth Moulton have joined the growing chorus of Democrats calling for President Biden to withdraw from the presidential race. In an interview with <a href="http://https://www.msnbc.com/all-in/watch/dem-rep-mike-quigley-calls-on-biden-to-step-aside-let-someone-else-do-this-214313029546 ">MSNBC</a>'s Chris Hayes, Quigley said that stepping down is the only way for Biden to secure his legacy and prevent a disastrous outcome.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Seth Moulton said he didn't have confidence in Biden's ability to defeat Donald Trump in November, urging him to "step aside and let new leaders rise" in an interview with Boston's <a href="http://https://www.wbur.org/news/2024/07/04/moulton-says-biden-drop-out-election ">WBUR</a>.</p>

<p>Reps Lloyd Doggett and Raul Grijalva were among the first sitting Democrats to urge President Biden to withdraw from the race. Doggett said he was disappointed that Biden failed to defend his accomplishments and expose Trump's lies during the debate, while Grijalva said it was Biden's "responsibility" to step down. Former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro also joined the calls for Biden to withdraw, suggesting Vice President Kamala Harris as a suitable replacement on the Democratic ticket.</p>

<p>President Biden's performance in the first debate was widely criticised, with many saying he appeared weak and disoriented. He struggled to speak clearly, fumbled, gave confusing answers and often looked lost. Even Trump's critics agreed that Biden's performance was disappointing.</p>

<p>In a speech in Raleigh, North Carolina, the day after the debate, Biden addressed the crowd saying he was not as spry as he used to be. "I don't walk as easy as I used to, I don't speak as smoothly as I used to, I don't debate as well as I used to,” he said. "I know what I do know, I know how to tell the truth!"</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A pet dog's curiosity almost turned deadly for a family in the US after the family pet accidentally switched on the stove at night while its owners were asleep. The family was saved from disaster after their Apple HomePad, a home assistant device, sent an alert notifying them of "high heat". The episode was caught on camera placed in the kitchen.</p>

<p>The incident occurred in US's Colorado last month at around 4:40 am. A CCTV video showed the dog pawing at the kitchen counter during which it turned on the stove.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The camera showed the dog on its hind legs and switching on the stove. Within moments, a few boxes kept on top of the stove caught fire, quickly setting fire to the kitchen. Another video showed the kitchen engulfed in flames and filled with smoke setting off the fire alarm.</p>

<p></p>

<p>At this moment, the Apple HomePad sent an alert to the owners who were awakened by the "high heat" notification. One of them put off the fire before the fire department arrived.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the fire department officials arrived they saw the video recorded in the kitchen and shared it on social media. The video has over 13,000 views on X.</p>

<p>The owner was taken to a local hospital to get treated for smoke inhalation. No other injuries were reported.</p>

<p>“This is a good reminder to always have working smoke alarms inside and outside every sleeping area and on every floor of the home, ensure all combustibles are away from your stovetop/oven, and know two ways out of every room in your home in the event of a fire,” the fire department said in a post on X.</p>

<p>X users have slammed the owners for neglect after the incident arguing that flammable boxes should not have been put on top of the stove. Other warned that a similar incident involving a child could also have taken place.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gory grottos with demons impaling sinners on stakes and people drowning in a pool of blood are not part of your average theme park experience.</p>

<p>But at Hell's Museum in Singapore, the main attraction at the Haw Par Villa park, visitors are welcomed to a kitschy, air-conditioned hell on Earth.</p>

<p>Inside the sprawling park complex with over 1,000 statues and dioramas showcasing Asian culture, faiths and philosophy, Hell's Museum exhibits various religious views on the afterlife.</p>

<p>Visitors are encouraged to learn about the 10 Courts of Hell through intense depictions of punishments for earthly sins.</p>

<p>At court number two, for instance, corruption gets you frozen in ice while rapists at court seven are thrown in boiling oil.</p>

<p>The 10 Courts of Hell are "the result of the mixing of four different religions and philosophies: Buddhism, Taoism, Hinduism, Confucianism", said Eisen Teo, the chief curator of Hell's Museum in the multicultural city-state.</p>

<p>"The sculptures and dioramas are a visual dissection of many classics, stories and moral values that many Singaporeans have and are familiar with," Teo said.</p>

<p>Visitor Gin Goldberg told AFP she wasn't so surprised to learn that many religions had differing opinions on the afterlife.</p>

<p>"One person's heaven would be another person's hell," the American said.</p>

<p><strong>Party in hell</strong></p>

<p>The odd park stands apart from gleaming Singapore's mainstream tourist attractions such as the luxury shops of Marina Bay Sands or the towering "supertrees" of Gardens by the Bay.</p>

<p>Haw Par Villa was built in 1937 by entrepreneur Aw Boon Haw, known for co-developing Asia's much-loved Tiger Balm pain relief rub.</p>

<p>While fondly remembered by older generations, the park has had trouble attracting the Gen Z crowd and younger millenials, according to Journeys, the firm that manages the park.</p>

<p>To broaden appeal, it has held several rave parties and other private events -- but not too near to religious exhibits.</p>

<p>"After they came here (for the parties) they fell in love with the quirky, eccentric park, with these cool sculptures. Fell in love with them and they keep doing repeat visits," said Savita Kashyap, Journeys' executive director.</p>

<p>While Haw Par Villa isn't just about the afterlife, and raves -- it also displays scenes from Chinese folklore such as "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" -- its hellish attraction remains the top draw.</p>

<p>But not for all.</p>

<p>One Filipina visitor told AFP while leaving that she won't be returning anytime soon.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When tumours in cancer patients elevate levels of an immune system molecule called Interleukin-6 (IL-6), it can cause severe brain dysfunction, which leads to a lethal wasting disease called 'cachexia' in about 50 to 80 per cent of cancer patients, a new study said.</p>

<p>As per US-based Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory's (CSHL) Professor Bo Li, "It's a very severe syndrome".</p>

<p>"Most people with cancer die of 'cachexia' instead of cancer. And once the patient enters this stage, there's no way to go back because essentially there's no treatment," he said in a study published in the journal Nature Communications.</p>

<p>Li and other researchers in the team found that blocking 'IL-6' from binding to neurons in a part of the brain called the area postrema (AP) prevents cachexia in mice.</p>

<p>As a result, the mice live longer with healthier brain function.</p>

<p>"Future drugs targeting these neurons could help make cancer cachexia a treatable disease," the researchers suggested.</p>

<p>In healthy patients, 'IL-6' plays a vital role in natural immune response. The molecules circulate throughout the body. When they encounter a possible threat, they alert the brain to coordinate a response.</p>

<p>According to the researchers, cancer disrupts this process as too much IL-6 gets produced, and it begins binding to AP neurons in the brain.</p>

<p>"That leads to several consequences. One is animals and humans alike will stop eating. Another is to engage this response that leads to the wasting syndrome," Li said.</p>

<p>The team took a two-pronged approach to keeping elevated IL-6 out of the brain in mice. Their first strategy neutralised IL-6 with custom antibodies. The second used CRISPR to reduce the levels of IL-6 receptors in AP neurons. Both tactics produced the same results -- the mice started eating again, stopped losing weight, and lived longer, the study noted.</p>

<p>"The brain is so powerful in regulating the peripheral system. Simply changing a small number of neurons in the brain has a profound effect on whole-body physiology. I knew there was an interaction between tumours and brain function, but not to this extent," said Li.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korean tech giant Samsung said Tuesday that production was not being disrupted despite a three-day general strike by thousands of workers.</p>

<p>More than 5,000 members of the National Samsung Electronic Union stopped working Monday, the organisation said, as part of a long-running battle over pay and benefits.</p>

<p>The union has more than 30,000 members -- more than a fifth of the company's total workforce.</p>

<p>"There has been no disruption to production," local media quoted Samsung as saying.</p>

<p>Park Seol, a senior member of the union, told AFP Tuesday that production was being affected.</p>

<p>"But more importantly, the company should understand that we aren't trying just to affect their production line, we want them to hear our voice and understand how desperate we are," he said.</p>

<p>The union has been locked in negotiations with management since January, but the two sides have failed to narrow differences on benefits and a 5.1 percent pay raise offer from the firm was rejected.</p>

<p>In a regulatory filing last week, Samsung Electronics said that its April-June operating profits were expected to rise to 10.4 trillion won ($7.54 billion), up 1,452.2 percent from 670 billion won a year earlier.</p>

<p>Sales, meanwhile, are expected to rise 23.3 percent to 74 trillion won, Samsung said.</p>

<p>Samsung Electronics is the world's largest memory chip maker and accounts for a significant chunk of the global output of high-end chips.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Hurricane Beryl hit the Grenadine Islands on July 1, its 150-mph winds and awesome storm surge made it the earliest category 5 storm (the most destructive grade on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale) the tropical Atlantic has seen.</p>

<p>An active hurricane season in 2024 was forecast well in advance. However, the speed at which Beryl intensified, jumping from tropical-storm strength with winds averaging 70mph to major-hurricane status with 130mph winds in just 24 hours, astounded scientists.</p>

<p>“Beryl is a storm more typical of <a href="https://theconversation.com/hurricane-beryls-rapid-intensification-and-category-5-winds-are-alarming-heres-why-more-tropical-storms-are-exploding-in-strength-233780">the heart of hurricane season</a> than of June, and its rapid intensification and strength have likely been driven by unusually warm waters,” says Brian Tang, an associate professor of atmospheric science at the University at Albany, State University of New York.</p>

<p>As the world heats faster due to record fossil fuel emissions, research suggests that there are more unpleasant surprises to come.</p>

<p>In a narrow band of the mid-Atlantic Ocean where most hurricanes form, <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-worlds-fourth-mass-coral-bleaching-is-underway-but-well-connected-reefs-may-have-a-better-chance-to-recover-230755">sea surface temperatures are anomalously high</a>. In fact, the ocean's heat content – a measure of how much energy is contained in the surface water that hurricanes draw strength from – was close to its average for September on July 1.</p>

<p>Water accumulates heat slowly, so it is alarming to see ocean heat near its usual peak at the start of summer. If the tropical Atlantic is already producing such storms, what might the rest of the hurricane season hold?</p>

<h2>A bumper season</h2>

<p>“If the National Hurricane Center's early forecast, released May 23, is right, the North Atlantic could see 17 to 25 named storms, eight to 13 hurricanes, and four to seven major hurricanes by the end of November,” says Jhordanne Jones, a postdoctoral research fellow who studies how climate change affects the scientific effort to predict hurricanes at Purdue University.</p>

<p>“That's the <a href="https://theconversation.com/hurricane-forecast-points-to-a-dangerous-2024-atlantic-season-with-la-nina-and-a-persistently-warm-ocean-teaming-up-to-power-fierce-storms-228351">highest number of named storms</a> in any preseason forecast.”</p>

<p>Seawater hotter than 26°C (79°F) is the lifeblood of hurricanes. Warm, moist air is another prerequisite. But that's not all these monsters need to reach the limits of their savagery: consistent winds in the upper and lower atmosphere are also necessary to keep cyclonic storms spinning.</p>

<p>A shift from El Niño to La Niña – two opposite phases in a long-term temperature pattern in the Pacific – is expected later this summer. This could tamp down trade winds that might otherwise tear a hurricane's vortex apart. Jones says:</p>

<p>“La Niña may indicate an early start to the season as well as a longer season, as La Niña – along with a warm Atlantic – maintains a hurricane-friendly environment earlier and longer within the year.”</p>

<p>You might expect global heating to bring more hurricanes. But that's not what research has found so far, according to Ben Clarke (University of Oxford) and Friederike Otto (Imperial College London), two scientists who try to attribute the role of climate change in extreme weather events.</p>

<p>“Warm, moist air and high ocean temperatures are in ample supply in a rapidly warming world. Yet there is no evidence that hurricanes are happening more often, nor do scientists expect this to change with further climate change,” they say.</p>

<p>Instead, hurricanes that do occur are <a href="https://theconversation.com/hurricane-ian-how-climate-change-is-making-north-atlantic-tropical-storms-worse-191547">more likely to be major storms</a> like Beryl. Conditions for breeding hurricanes will be found further north and south of the equator too, since the ocean is heating rapidly everywhere. And Atlantic hurricanes may form outside of the season (June 1 to November 30) that people have come to expect them in.</p>

<p>“There is also evidence that they are moving more slowly, and are increasingly likely to completely stall near the coast, leading to more flooding as more rain is dumped over one place. This was one reason why Hurricane Harvey, which struck Texas and Louisiana in 2017, was so destructive,” Clarke and Otto say.</p>

<p>The trio of deadly hurricanes (Harvey, Irma and Maria) that hammered the Atlantic in quick succession that summer gave people little respite. These “storm clusters”, as climate adaptation researcher Anitha Karthik (Edinburgh Napier University) calls them, are <a href="https://theconversation.com/big-storm-clusters-are-on-the-increase-what-this-means-for-hurricane-hotspots-112584">a growing weather trend</a> that is making hurricane-prone areas increasingly inhospitable.</p>

<h2>Climate colonialism</h2>

<p>“When Hurricane Maria struck the eastern Caribbean island of Dominica in 2017, it caused the kind of devastation which is unthinkable to larger countries,” says Emily Wilkinson, an expert in climate resilience at the University of the West Indies.</p>

<p>“The category 5 hurricane damaged 98% of building roofs and caused US$1.2 billion (£950 million) in damage. Dominica effectively lost 226% of its GDP overnight.”</p>

<p>Vowing to become <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-a-small-caribbean-island-is-trying-to-become-hurricane-proof-217999">the first climate-resilient nation</a>, Dominica set about rebuilding homes, bridges and other infrastructure. Conserving the forests and reefs that buffer rain, wind and waves was a priority, Wilkinson says. But in trying to build a sustainable future from the wreckage of Maria, Dominica had to contend with its past as a European colony – a fate shared by many small-island states in the Caribbean and elsewhere.</p>

<p>“Across most Caribbean islands, hazard exposure is about the same, but research shows that poverty and social inequality <a href="https://theconversation.com/in-the-caribbean-colonialism-and-inequality-mean-hurricanes-hit-harder-84106">drastically magnify the severity of disasters</a>,” say Levi Gahman and Gabrielle Thongs, lecturers in geography, also at the University of the West Indies.</p>

<p>Dominica had a plantation economy imposed on it by the British that squandered the island's productive potential and funnelled its wealth overseas, Wilkinson says.</p>

<p>“Yet Dominica also has the Caribbean's largest remaining indigenous community, and the Kalinago people have farming practices that combine crop diversification with planting methods that help stabilise slopes,” she adds.</p>

<p>Climate-vulnerable states can draw from advantages such as these to navigate an uncertain future. But the experiences of Caribbean islands show how a supposedly historical process like colonialism still claims lives in the present.</p>

<p>Mounting storms will add greater urgency to demands for “climate reparations” to the formerly colonised world from rich countries that have contributed most to the climate problem.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <description><![CDATA[Not that there weren't enough questions already about an 81-year-old seeking re-election to the highest US office, but the first Presidential debate compelled Democrats to ask, "Does Joe Biden have what it takes to defeat Donald Trump again?"]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not that there weren't enough questions already about an 81-year-old seeking re-election to the highest US office, but the first Presidential debate compelled Democrats to ask, "Does Joe Biden have what it takes to defeat Donald Trump again?"</p>

<p>The first Biden-Trump debate has only heightened concerns about the sitting US President's ability to grasp matters of national and international importance. While Biden stuttered and fumbled, Trump used every opportunity to underline why his Democratic counterpart wasn't up to the mark.</p>

<p>Although Biden has reaffirmed his commitment to staying in the race, Democrats are growing anxious about their chances. As Trump closes the gap, party leaders are starting to consider alternatives to Biden, should he decide to withdraw.</p>

<p><strong>Here are some possible candidates:</strong></p>

<p><strong>VP Kamala Harris</strong></p>

<p>Vice-President Kamala Harris is a clear choice to replace President Joe Biden on the Democratic ticket. As Biden's deputy, she has become the face of the administration's campaign to protect reproductive rights. Harris has proven to be a loyal ally to the president, and a fierce defender, admitting he had a "slow start" in the debate but arguing he provided more substantive answers than Trump. She has reiterated her support for Biden, stating "Joe Biden is our nominee. We beat Trump once and we're going to beat him again, period."</p>

<p><strong>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer</strong></p>

<p>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer is a rising star in the Democratic Party, with many speculating that she will make a bid for the presidency in 2028. A two-term governor, Whitmer has been a vocal supporter of President Biden and has expressed her own political ambitions, telling the New York Times that she hopes to see a Generation X president in 2028.</p>

<p><strong>California Governor Gavin Newsom</strong></p>

<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is a vocal supporter of the Biden administration and is often mentioned as a potential candidate for the presidency in 2028. Some Democratic members believe he could even be a stand-in for Biden in the current election.</p>

<p>Newsom has been increasingly engaging with conservative media and debated Florida Governor Ron DeSantis last year. He was a prominent surrogate for Biden at the June debate in Atlanta, but dodged questions about whether he would consider replacing Biden on the ticket. For now, he is publicly supporting the president and headlined a Biden campaign event in Michigan on July 4.</p>

<p><strong>Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg</strong></p>

<p>Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg ran for President earlier in 2020. He is widely regarded as one of the Biden administration's most effective communicators. During his tenure as transportation secretary, Buttigieg has demonstrated his crisis management skills, and navigated several high-profile incidents, including the East Palestine train derailment in Ohio, the Baltimore Bridge collapse and Southwest Airlines' scheduling crisis in 2022.</p>

<p><strong>Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro</strong></p>

<p>Josh Shapiro has maintained high public approval ratings since his 2022 election in Pennsylvania, a swing state. A former attorney general, Shapiro made headlines during his tenure as governor by swiftly rebuilding a collapsed Philadelphia bridge. This has led to speculations about his potential 2028 presidential bid, with the bridge repair serving as a strong infrastructure talking point.<br />
<br />
<strong>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker</strong><br />
<br />
JB Pritzker, the Governor of Illinois, has time-and-again vocally opposed former President Trump and actively supported President Biden. Following a recent debate, Pritzker labelled Trump a "liar" and talked about his 34 criminal convictions, saying he was a “felon who cares only about himself". Pritzker has consistently delivered on key agenda items for progressive Democrats, like on issues like abortion rights and gun control.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Some others who could potentially be Biden's replacement are:</strong><br />
<br />
Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, a two-term governor in a conservative state, has been getting more national attention since his re-election last year. Maryland Governor Wes Moore recently handled a crisis when a bridge collapsed in Baltimore, showing his leadership skills.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Senators Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker have run for presidential posts before and are well-known among Democrats.<br />
<br />
Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock is also a potential candidate. He won a close Senate race in a swing state, showing he can win tough elections.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A recent poll found that Michelle Obama is the only person who could beat Trump in November, but she has said she doesn't want to run for president.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Malaysian authorities have arrested six members of an international crime ring known as the "Ninja Turtle Gang" and seized about 200 smuggled tortoises and turtles, a wildlife official said Tuesday.</p>

<p>Abdul Kadir Abu Hashim, director-general of Malaysia's wildlife and national parks department, said four Cambodians and two Malaysians were arrested during a July 2 raid on a house in Kuala Lumpur by police and wildlife officials.</p>

<p>He told AFP some 200 turtles and tortoises worth an estimated 246,394 ringgit ($52,300) were rescued during the raid, the second seizure in Malaysia in less than a week.</p>

<p>Many people across Asia believe that turtles and tortoises bring good luck and prosperity.</p>

<p>Abdul Kadir said the six arrested belong to the Ninja Turtle Gang, an international crime ring involved in smuggling the reptiles.</p>

<p>Police and wildlife officials rescued 400 tortoises during an initial raid on June 29 that were meant for sale in Southeast Asia and were worth $805,084 on the black market.</p>

<p>Animals rescued in the latest raid included the critically endangered Chinese striped-necked turtle, which is also known as the golden thread turtle, Abdul Kadir said.</p>

<p>Other species included the endangered black pond turtle, snapping turtle, sulcata tortoise, leopard tortoise and the red-footed tortoise found throughout South America and the Caribbean islands of Trinidad and Barbados.</p>

<p>"Initial investigations revealed that the reptiles were smuggled from abroad to meet the lucrative pet market," Abdul Kadir said.</p>

<p>Also discovered were three snakes, four softshell turtles, a skink and five frogs.</p>

<p>The rescued animals were being kept in a Malaysian wildlife department quarantine centre.</p>

<p>The reptiles are illegally brought into Malaysia by road or in suitcases by smugglers aboard commercial flights, Abdul Kadir said last week.</p>

<p>Traffic, a wildlife NGO, has said that Southeast Asian countries "function as source, consumer and as entrepots for wildlife originating from within the region as well as the rest of the world".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>France's government on Tuesday gave the go-ahead for construction of a floating landing pad on the River Seine for flying taxis set to be shown off during the Paris Olympics.</p>

<p>An official decree said that the pad "can be used until December 31, 2024" after months of suspense over whether the taxis would take to the air during the July 26 - August 11 Games.</p>

<p>The landing site will float on the Seine near the Austerlitz railway station in southeastern Paris.</p>

<p>Flights will be limited to two per hour, between 8:00 am to 5:00 pm, and no more than 900 over the whole trial period "given the experimental nature" of the vehicles, the decree read.</p>

<p>Private firms involved in the flying taxi project include Paris airport operator ADP and Germany-based Volocopter.</p>

<p>Its "Volocity" two-seaters are fitted with 18 electric-powered rotors on a circular frame above the fuselage.</p>

<p>They hope to use the global draw of the Olympics to show that the technology can efficiently link "vertiport" take-off and landing sites.</p>

<p>While four vertiports -- airports for vertical take-off and landing vehicles -- have already been set up in the Paris suburbs, including one at Charles de Gaulle airport, the Austerlitz site will be the first within the city proper.</p>

<p>Backers tout flying taxis as a low-carbon form of aviation and hope future larger versions could be used as ambulances or in other roles.</p>

<p>But many city officials in Paris have derided the plans as harmful to the environment.</p>

<p>France's national environment authority found that an impact assessment for the landing pad was "incomplete" on issues including noise pollution, energy consumption and greenhouse emissions.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India is transforming at a record pace and the world is taking note, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said today at an event organised by the Indian community in Russia's Moscow.&nbsp;The country, he said, is infused with a confidence and is making things happen. "Over 140 crore Indians are making this resurgence of India possible -- they dream big, they take a pledge and then make it happen," he said.</p>

<p>In this context, the Prime Minister also referred to India's victory in the Men's T20 cricket world cup that ended the 13-year ICC trophy drought for the Men in Blue.</p>

<p>"Before 2014, we were into the pit of despair. Today, the country is full of confidence. Two patients suffering from the same ailment are in the same hospital, similarly capable doctors are attending to them. But if one patient is hopeful and the other is in despair, you will see the hopeful one will recover soon. India's asset now is its confidence," the Prime Minister said.</p>

<p>"You must have celebrated India's T20 World Cup victory here. The real story of that win is the journey towards it. Today's young India does not accept defeat till the last ball and the last moment. And victory kisses the feet of those who do not accept defeat," he said.</p>

<p>Showcasing his government's achievements, the Prime Minister said, "When India hosts the G20 Summit at the scale at which it did, the world takes notice. When India electrifies 40,000 km of rail lines, then the world notices India's power to grow. When India launches a solar mission and successfully and takes an L1 orbit, when India lands on the moon, when India builds the world's highest rail bridge, when India build's the world's tallest statue, the world sees a growing India. And India can do all this because of the potential and capability of 140 crore Indians, of its talented diaspora in every country of the world."</p>

<p>The Prime Minister said India and Russia are working together to boost global prosperity. "You all are taking India-Russia ties to new heights. With your hard work and honesty, you have contributed to the Russian society. I have been a fan of the unique relationship between India and Russia," he said, referring to Russia as India's "all-weather ally" and "trustworthy friend".</p>

<p>This relationship, he said, is based on mutual trust and respect. "Our ties have been tested multiple times, and our friendship has always emerged strong. I thank my friend, President Putin for his leadership. For over two decades, he has worked to make this partnership stronger. This is my 6th visit to Russia in the past 10 years and we have met each other 17 times during this time. These meetings have strengthened trust and respect. When our students were stuck amid (Ukraine) conflict, President Putin helped us take them home," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Prime Minister said it is his honour that his first diaspora event after being elected for the third time is happening in Moscow. "I have taken a pledge that I will work thrice as hard and thrice as fast as I have in the first two terms. I can assure you that in this third term, you will see that India will challenge every challenge that comes its way. And it is in my DNA that I give chunauti (challenge) to every chunauti," he said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bob's Burgers' actor Jay Johnston has pleaded guilty to charges of being involved in the January 2021 US Capitol riot, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cw0yqv84x4ko ">BBC</a> has reported.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The 54-year-old faces up to five years in prison for the felony count of civil disorder. A sentencing date has not been set yet. According to court documents, Johnston participated in a violent mob that attacked police officers. A video showed him taking a shield from an officer and using it to push back officers defending the Capitol.<br />
<br />
He was arrested and charged with multiple felonies, including obstruction of officers during civil disorder, unlawful entry on restricted buildings or grounds and impeding passage through Capitol grounds. He was released on a $25,000 bail bond in June 2023 following his initial court appearance in California.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Court documents revealed that Johnston was near the tunnel entrance, gestured to other rioters to follow him, and later acknowledged his involvement in the Capitol riot in a text message. The message stated, "It wasn't an attack, but it kind of turned into that." Another message described the scene as "a mess."<br />
<br />
The FBI identified Johnston as a suspect after three acquaintances recognised him in photos published on social media. One of these associates provided investigators with the incriminating text message. Airline records also showed that Johnston booked a round-trip flight from Los Angeles to Washington DC, flying on January 4, 2021, and returning on January 7.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
On January 6, 2021, a mob of then-US President Donald Trump supporters attacked the US Capitol Building, seeking to overturn the 2020 election results. Thousands gathered in Washington, DC, fueled by Trump's false claims of election fraud.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Rioters breached the Capitol, vandalising offices, assaulting police and reporters, and attempting to harm lawmakers. Pipe bombs and Molotov cocktails were found nearby. Five people, including a police officer, died and 174 officers were injured. The attack was a failed attempt to disrupt the electoral vote count and keep Trump in power.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Nearly 1,000 people have been found guilty or pleaded guilty to federal crimes related to the riots, reported AP. Over half of these people have received prison sentences, ranging from seven days to 18 years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adult film star Jesse Jane died from an accidental overdose of fentanyl and cocaine toxicity in January 2024, her&nbsp;<a href="http://https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/2024/07/08/jesse-jane-cause-of-death-revealed-porn-star-oklahoma-overdose-fentanyl/74323582007/ \">autopsy report</a> has confirmed. Her body was found in a decomposed state, it stated.</p>

<p>The 43-year-old actor, whose real name was Cindy Taylor or Cynthia Ann Howell, was found unresponsive in her boyfriend's home in Oklahoma on January 24, 2024. Her boyfriend, Brett Hasenmuller, 33, was also found dead at the scene.</p>

<p>The Oklahoma Medical Examiner's Office performed the autopsy, revealing acute fentanyl and cocaine intoxication as the cause of death. The report, released on Sunday, noted that Ms Jane's body was in a state of advanced decomposition, indicating she had been dead for some time before her body was found.</p>

<p>According to TMZ, the bodies were discovered after the boyfriend's boss requested a welfare check, leading cops to visit the residence. They were found dead, and their cause of death was suspected to be an overdose at the time.</p>

<p>Jesse Jane was a prominent figure in the adult entertainment industry, appearing in over 100 adult films and earning many awards and nominations. She began her porn career in 2002, signing an exclusive contract with Digital Playground Studio, where she remained until 2014. She later signed with Jules Jordan Video and announced her retirement from the industry in 2017.</p>

<p>Jane also appeared in mainstream TV shows and films, including <em>Baywatch: Hawaiian Wedding, Pirates II: Stagnetti's Revenge, Starsky and Hutch, Family Business, Entourage,</em> <em>Night Calls </em>and <em>The Bad Girls Club</em>. She also featured in the CNBC documentary <em>Porn: Business of Pleasure.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The preserved body of an American mountaineer -- who disappeared 22 years ago while scaling a snowy peak in Peru -- has been found after being exposed by climate change-induced ice melt, police said Monday.</p>

<p>William Stampfl was reported missing in June 2002, aged 59, when an avalanche buried his climbing party on the mountain Huascaran, which stands more than 6,700 meters (22,000 feet) high. Search and rescue efforts were fruitless.</p>

<p>Peruvian police said his remains were finally exposed by ice melt on the Cordillera Blanca range of the Andes.</p>

<p>Stampfl's body, as well as his clothes, harness and boots had been well-preserved by the cold, according to images distributed by police.</p>

<p>His passport was found among his possessions, allowing police to identify the body.</p>

<p>The mountains of northeastern Peru, home to snowy peaks such as Huascaran and Cashan, are a favorite with mountaineers from around the world.</p>

<p>In May, the body of an Israeli hiker was found there nearly a month after he disappeared.</p>

<p>And last month, an experienced Italian mountaineer was found dead after he fell while trying to scale another Andean peak.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Boeing jetliner taking off from Los Angeles lost a wheel Monday, the latest in a string of safety scares for the aerospace giant.&nbsp;</p>

<p>United Airlines, which operated the Boeing 757-200, said the plane lost the wheel after leaving Los Angeles International Airport but landed safely in Denver, its intended destination.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The wheel has been recovered in Los Angeles, and we are investigating what caused this event," the airline said in statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No injuries were reported from the ground or the 174 passengers and seven crew members on board.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was the second time in recent months that a Boeing plane operated by United Airlines lost a wheel after taking off.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In March, a Boeing 777 bound for Japan had a tire fall off shortly after takeoff from San Francisco. The aircraft had to make an emergency landing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Boeing agreed Monday to plead guilty to fraud in a settlement with the US Department of Justice over two fatal 737 MAX crashes.</p>

<p>Boeing has faced renewed scrutiny of the 737 MAX this year after a fuselage door plug blew out on the same model during an Alaska Airlines flight in January.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Boeing spokesperson said in an email that the 757-200 aircraft that took off Monday was first delivered 30 years ago in 1994.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Production of the 757 model was discontinued in 2004.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating Monday's incident.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump said in an interview Monday night that he thinks President Joe Biden will stay in the race for the White House despite calls for him to drop out over concerns about his mental fitness.</p>

<p>"I think he, you know, might very well stay in," Trump told Sean Hannity on Fox News, in his first interview since Biden's dismal performance in their presidential debate late last month.</p>

<p>"He's got an ego and he doesn't want to quit," Trump said.</p>

<p>The Republican ex-president also gave his first detailed account of the CNN-hosted debate in Atlanta, during which Biden often lost his train of thought and at times spoke incoherently, looking dazed.</p>

<p>"I will tell you. It was a strange debate, because within a couple of minutes, the answers given by him were, they didn't, they didn't make a lot of sense," Trump said.</p>

<p>Trump said he intentionally did not look much at Biden as he spoke.</p>

<p>"I did take a couple of peeks when he was in the midst of giving some really bad answers," Trump said.</p>

<p>"They weren't even answers. They were just words put together that had no meaning or sense."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden insisted again Monday he would not quit the US election race, as the White House denied he had Parkinson's disease following a disastrous debate performance.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old dared Democratic critics to either challenge him at next month's party convention in Chicago or back him against Donald Trump in November's vote.</p>

<p>The president lashed out in both a letter to Congress and a rare call to a television program, at the start of a critical week that includes a NATO summit in Washington where he will face fresh scrutiny.</p>

<p>"I am firmly committed to staying in the race," Biden wrote in the letter.</p>

<p>"It is time to come together, move forward as a unified party and defeat Donald Trump," he said. "It's time for it to end."</p>

<p>The embattled president followed up by phoning into MSNBC's "Morning Joe" television program to say he was "getting so frustrated by the elites" in the party.</p>

<p>"Any of these guys that don't think I should run -- run against me. Announce for president, challenge me at the convention," he added.</p>

<p>Trump has been uncharacteristically quiet since the debate but he did speak out Monday on Fox News to say he thinks Biden will resist the pressure and stay in the race.</p>

<p>"He's got an ego and he doesn't want to quit," Trump said in an interview with Sean Hannity.</p>

<p>But even as he doubled down, the pressure mounted on the oldest president in US history.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Congressman Adam Smith, the senior Democrat on the US House Armed Services Committee, became the sixth Democratic lawmaker to publicly say Biden should step aside.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I think it's become clear he's not the best person to carry the Democratic message," he told CNN.</p>

<p>Other senior Democrats voiced support for Biden, however.</p>

<p>"I made clear that day after the debate publicly that I support President Joe Biden and the Democratic ticket. My position has not changed," House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN.</p>

<p><strong>Parkinson's denial</strong></p>

<p>Biden's blitz was a clear attempt to lay to rest the spiralling concerns over his health following the June 27 debate against Republican Trump, whom he trails in the polls.</p>

<p>During the debate, Biden repeatedly lost his train of thought, stared blankly and spoke at times incoherently and with a raspy voice. Biden has blamed jetlag and a cold.</p>

<p>The White House has also felt the pressure, with tense exchanges at a press briefing on Monday.</p>

<p>Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called for "respect" while journalists challenged her refusal to confirm reports that a Parkinson's specialist visited the White House eight times.</p>

<p>The visits by Kevin Cannard, a neurologist from the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center where Biden receives his medicals, were recorded in publicly available visitor logs.</p>

<p>"Has the President been treated for Parkinson's? No. Is he being treated for Parkinson's? No, he's not. Is he taking medication for Parkinson's? No," Jean-Pierre said.</p>

<p>On Monday night the White House went so far as to release a letter from Biden's personal doctor, Kevin O'Connor, insisting that the president had not seen a neurologist outside his three annual medicals.</p>

<p>The White House also denied reports that NATO allies attending this week's 75th-anniversary summit in Washington had shown concerns about Biden.</p>

<p>"We're not picking up any signs of that from our allies at all," National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.</p>

<p>But NATO leaders have been seeking reassurance in any case amid polls forecasting a November victory for Trump.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The former president has long criticized the defense alliance, voiced admiration for Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, and insisted he could bring about a quick end to the war in Ukraine.</p>

<p><strong>'All in'</strong></p>

<p>The NATO summit begins on Tuesday, the same day that Democrats, returning to Capitol Hill from a brief recess, hold a caucus meeting where Biden's fate will be discussed.</p>

<p>The Democrat lags behind Trump in most polls even though his rival was recently convicted of a felony in a porn star hush money case.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Recent polls suggest that Kamala Harris could perform better than Joe Biden in a hypothetical matchup against former President Donald Trump. ]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite US President Joe Biden's repeated assertion that he has no plans to quit the presidential race, his deputy <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/could-kamala-harris-beat-trump-in-us-presidential-race-polls-suggest-6053229 ">Kamala Harris</a> is emerging as his alternative for Democrats. Harris' recognition, policy experience and ability to connect with key voter groups make her an attractive candidate against Republican nominee Donald Trump, top democrats say.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
But can the 59-year-old defeat Donald Trump, should Joe Biden drop out?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
After what was an abysmal first presidential debate between the current and former US Presidents, critics, political observers and voices among the Democrats suggested it would be better if Biden were replaced. And the first name that struck everyone's mind was Kamala Harris. Polls suggest her candidacy could be a game-changer for the Democratic Party.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The Vice-President may perform better than Biden against former President Trump, multiple polls say. Harris trailed Trump by only two percentage points, 47% to 45% while Biden lagged by six points, according to a CNN poll released on July 2.<br />
<br />
A Reuters/Ipsos poll found her tied with Trump at 42% each. The polls showed that Harris did better than Biden with independent voters and women.<br />
<br />
However, experts are sceptical about these early polls. They think voter opinions would change if Biden dropped out and other Democrats joined the race. A pollster close to Biden's campaign thinks Harris might appeal to more voters, but isn't sure if she would make a big difference. They believe polls this early don't mean much. Harris does well with young voters and minorities – important groups for Democrats. But it is unclear if she would boost turnout among these voters. For now, it's a "wait and see" situation.<br />
<br />
During NBC's Meet the Press Sunday, Congressman Adam Schiff (D-CA) suggested that President Biden either secure a resounding victory or cede the nomination to a candidate capable of doing so. Kamala Harris could “very well win overwhelmingly” against Trump, he added.&nbsp;<br />

Jamal Simmons, a seasoned Democratic strategist and former communications director for Kamala Harris, warns against “underestimating” the Vice President. In an interview with the <a href="http://https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgerg7z9vwro ">BBC</a>, Mr Simmons stated that Harris is a force to be reckoned with, whether she is supporting Biden or leading the ticket herself. “She is somebody, whom Republicans and the Trump campaign need to take seriously,” he said.&nbsp;<br />

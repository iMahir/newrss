       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands of people fled their homes around Athens on Monday, including in the historic town of Marathon, as strong winds fanned a wall of wildfire flames closer to the Greek capital.</p>

<p>A 30-kilometre (20-mile) long frontline of fires, more than 25 metres (80 feet) high in places, was moving towards Athens, the ERT public broadcaster reported.</p>

<p>Nearly 700 firefighters and over 30 aircraft battled the blazes that had advanced into the city's outer suburbs near Mount Pentelikon.</p>

<p>Authorities opened the Olympic stadium in northern Athens and other stadiums to house those fleeing. Three major hospitals have been placed on standby.</p>

<p>One firefighter suffered serious burns, another was hospitalised with breathing trouble and 13 other people were treated for milder respiratory problems, fire brigade spokesman Vassilis Vathrakogiannis said.</p>

<p>Halandri became the latest suburban municipality to order a partial evacuation of areas threatened by the flames.</p>

</div>

<p>"Because of the direction of the wind we have decided on a precautionary evacuation," its mayor Simos Roussos told ERT. "The fire is very close."</p>

<p>Television footage showed flames burning among homes in Nea Penteli, a leafy Athens suburb which also told residents to relocate.</p>

<p>Several smaller communities and towns, including Marathon, which gave the Olympic long-distance race its name, started to evacuate on Sunday.</p>

<p>"We are facing a biblical catastrophe," said Marathon's mayor Stergios Tsirkas. "Our whole town is engulfed in flames," he told the Skai television channel.</p>

<p>Smoke drifted through central Athens as thick grey clouds engulfed Mount Pentelikon, which looms above the capital and is known for producing the marble used in the Acropolis and other ancient buildings.</p>

<p>"Civil protection forces battled hard throughout the night, but despite superhuman efforts, the fire evolved rapidly," Vathrakogiannis said.</p>

<p>The wind had rekindled the fire in 40 different locations on Monday, he said.</p>

<p>A children's hospital and a military medical facility in Penteli were evacuated at dawn, Vathrakogiannis said.</p>

<p>The destruction revived memories of the Mati disaster, the coastal area near Marathon where 104 people died in July 2018 in a tragedy later blamed on evacuation delays and errors.</p>

<p>The summer wildfire season in Greece this year has seen dozens of daily blazes after the Mediterranean country recorded its warmest winter and the hottest June and July since reliable data collection began in 1960.</p>

<p>Temperatures around Athens are forecast to peak at 39 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday, with wind gusts of up to 50 kilometres (31 miles) per hour.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Engulfed in flames' -</strong></p>

<p>"Forest fire near you. Follow the instructions of the authorities," said SMS messages sent to people in the Attica region, indicating in which direction to flee.</p>

<p>Civil Protection Minister Vassilis Kikilias issued a warning Saturday that half the country faced a high-risk of fires due to high temperatures, strong winds and drought conditions.</p>

<p>On Monday he said that a fire that broke out on Sunday near the town of Varnavas spread even though a water-bombing aircraft reached the area in just five minutes.</p>

<p>"We're working 24-hour shifts, all of us," said fireman Marinos Peristeropoulos.</p>

<p>"The fire spread very quickly because of the strong wind," he told AFP near one of the hotspots in Grammatiko.</p>

<p>Scientists say that human-induced fossil fuel emissions are worsening the length, frequency and intensity of heatwaves across the world.</p>

<p>Rising temperatures are leading to longer wildfire seasons and increasing the area burnt in the flames, according to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</p>

<p>Other parts of Europe are also struggling with high temperatures.</p>

<p>Temperatures in parts of France rose above 40 Celsius on Sunday. In Rome, temperatures were expected to reach 38 Celsius Monday and remain around 36 Celsius this week.</p>

<p>In the Netherlands, temperatures between 32 and 35 degrees Celsius are expected.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus - who last week took oath as head of Bangladesh's interim government - has heaped praise on students who spearheaded protests against ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nobel laureate <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/muhammad-yunus" target="_blank">Muhammad Yunus</a> - who last week took oath as head of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/bangladesh" target="_blank">Bangladesh</a>'s interim government - has heaped praise on students who spearheaded protests against ousted Prime Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/sheikh-hasina" target="_blank">Sheikh Hasina</a>. "There is no doubt... because of the student-led revolution the whole government collapsed..." Mr Yunus told reporters after a Sunday night meet with the students.</p>

<p>"I said (to the students), 'I respect you... I admire you. What you have done is absolutely unparalleled... and because you ordered me to do this (to take charge of the interim administration) I accept...'," Mr Yunus said, recounting part of the conversation he had with the students.</p>

<p>Two of the student protesters - Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud - are part of a 16-member advisory council that was sworn in with Mr Yunus. The 84-year-old won the 2006 Nobel Peace prize for his work in microfinance and setting up the Grameen Bank, which works for community development.</p>

<p>Mr Yunus has also stressed the wave of resignations of high-ranking public officials, including the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and head of Bangladesh's central bank, was "conducted legally".</p>

<p>"I'm sure they will find the legal way to justify all of this, because legally... all the steps were followed," he said. His office only agreed to publish these quotes Monday evening.</p>

<p>The interim government was formed after Bangladesh witnessed weeks of violence and clashes - triggered by protests over a jobs quota - forced Ms Hasina, a five-time PM, to resign and flee.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina left the Prime Minister's residence in Dhaka - hours before it was overrun - and flew to India in a Bangladeshi military aircraft. The 76-year-old, seen as a key ally of New Delhi, remains in an undisclosed location amid reports she will seek political asylum, possibly in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Following Ms Hasina's departure Md Yunus - who faced multiple corruption charges under the previous government and was in Europe while Sheikh Hasina was in power - was picked by the protesting to oversee democratic reforms.</p>

<p>His first act after being administered an oath of office - and taking the title of 'chief advisor' - was to lead a solemn tribute to the more than 450 people who died in the protests.</p>

<p>It is unclear when Bangladesh will hold an election to select a new Prime Minister. Whenever that is, Mrs Hasina is likely to return to contest, her son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy told The Times of India. "She will go back to Bangladesh the moment the interim government decides to hold an election," he said.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi has extended his best wishes to Mr Yunus,</p>

<p>"We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities. India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfil the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development," he wrote on X.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh was experiencing a "student-led revolution" after the ouster of premier Sheikh Hasina, the South Asian country's new interim leader Muhammad Yunus said.</p>

<p>"This is a revolution, a student-led revolution," the Nobel laureate told a news briefing on Sunday.</p>

<p>"There's no doubt about (that) because the business of the whole government collapsed."</p>

<p>Yunus, 84, arrived back in Bangladesh from Europe on Thursday after he was called by the student leaders of the protests that toppled Hasina and asked to steer democratic reforms.</p>

<p>"I said, 'I respect you, I admire you. What you have done is absolutely unparallelled'," he said.</p>

<p>"'Because you ordered me to do this, I take your order'," Yunus said he told them.</p>

<p>Several top allies of Hasina, whose iron-fisted tenure ended with her abrupt resignation and flight to neighbouring India a week ago, subsequently stepped down.</p>

<p>Among them were the former chief justice of the Supreme Court and the central bank governor.</p>

<p>They had been issued ultimatums to quit their posts by students but Yunus said their resignations had been conducted legally.</p>

<p>"They want to have a new court," he said of the students. "So they went there and asked the chief justice to resign and put their pressure to make him resign."</p>

<p>"I'm sure they will find the legal way to justify all of this, because legally... all the steps were followed," he said.</p>

<p><strong>- 'The monster is gone' -</strong></p>

<p>Hasina, 76, fled by helicopter as protesters flooded Dhaka's streets in a dramatic end to her long rule.</p>

<p>Her government was accused of widespread human rights abuses, including the extrajudicial killing of thousands of her political opponents.</p>

<p>"Finally, this moment, the monster is gone," Mr Yunus said.</p>

<p>However, despite the groundswell of public goodwill towards him, Mr Yunus warned that his interim government faced difficult decisions ahead.</p>

<p>"The moment you start taking decisions, some people will like your decisions, some people will not like your decisions," he said. "Obviously, that's the way it works."</p>

<p>Yunus made the comments during an off-the-record media briefing on Sunday night at a state building being used as a temporary seat of government.</p>

<p>His office agreed to their publication on Monday evening.</p>

<p>Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his pioneering work in microfinance, credited with helping millions of Bangladeshis out of grinding poverty.</p>

<p>He took office as "chief adviser" to a caretaker administration -- all fellow civilians bar a retired brigadier general.</p>

<p>He said last week that he wanted to hold elections "within a few months.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Pakistan's military has arrested the former chief of its spy agency ISIS, Lieutenant-General Faiz Hameed, and initiated court martial proceedings against him - a first in the country's history.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>The military said the arrest was ordered by the Supreme Court in connection with a land development case, and multiple violations of the Pakistan Army Act after Mr Hameed's retirement.</li>
	<li>The management of a private housing scheme, Top City, had claimed in a petition in November&nbsp;2023 that Mr Hameed had orchestrated a rain on the offices and residence of its owner.</li>
	<li>Their petition claimed that Pakistan Rangers and officials of the ISI raided its premises in May 2017 and took away valuables, including gold and diamond ornaments, over an alleged terrorism case.</li>
	<li>General Hameed later told the petitioner that he would return some items except for "400 told gold and cash", <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1851818/former-dg-isi-faiz-hameed-taken-into-military-custody-ispr">reported Dawn </a>quoting the petition.</li>
	<li>The petition also accused some former ISI officials of being involved in the "illegal takeover of the housing society".</li>
	<li>In March 2024, former Pakistan interior minister Rana Sanaullah said the ex-ISIS boss and his brother were under scanner over alleged corruption.</li>
	<li>In April, the military formed an inquiry committee to probe the allegations of misuse of authority against the former spymaster.</li>
	<li>Lieutenant-General Faiz Hameed was among six senior-most generals whose name was included in the list of potential candidates for the top two military offices in November 2022, as per Dawn.</li>
	<li>Mr Hameed, however, sought an early retirement and sent his resignation to the high command the same month, four months before his retirement date.</li>
	<li>He had also faced criticism from Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz for allegedly having a role in their convictions.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Vladimir Putin ordered his army on Monday to "dislodge" Ukrainian troops who have entered Russian territory as authorities said over 120,000 people had been evacuated away from the fighting.</p>

<p>Kyiv launched a surprise offensive into Russia's western Kursk region last Tuesday, capturing over two dozen settlements in the most significant cross-border attack on Russian soil since World War II.</p>

<p>"One of the obvious goals of the enemy is to sow discord, strife, intimidate people, destroy the unity and cohesion of Russian society," Putin told a televised meeting with government officials.</p>

<p>"The main task is, of course, for the defence ministry to dislodge the enemy from our territories," he said.</p>

<p>Some 121,000 people have fled the Kursk region since the start of the fighting, which has killed at least 12 civilians and injured 121 more, regional governor Alexei Smirnov told the meeting with Putin.</p>

<p>Authorities in Kursk announced on Monday they were widening their evacuation area to include Belovsky district, home to some 14,000 residents. The neighbouring Belgorod region also said it was evacuating its border district of Krasnoyaruzhsky.</p>

<p>Ukraine has pierced into the region by at least 12 kilometres (seven miles) and has captured 28 towns and villages, with the new front 40 kilometres long, Smirnov said.</p>

<p>A top Ukrainian official told AFP over the weekend that the operation was aimed at stretching Russian troops and destabilising the country after months of slow Russian advances across the frontline.</p>

<p>Putin said Russia would respond by showing "unanimous support for all those in distress" and claimed there had been an increase in men signing up to fight.</p>

<p>"The enemy will receive a worthy riposte," he said.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Maximum losses' -</strong></p>

<p>The assault appeared to catch the Kremlin off guard. Russia's army rushed in reserve troops, tanks, aviation, artillery and drones in a bid to quash it.</p>

<p>But it conceded on Sunday that Ukraine had penetrated up to 30 kilometres (20 miles) into Russian territory in places.</p>

<p>It said some forces were near the villages of Tolpino and Obshchy Kolodez, around 25 kilometres and 30 kilometres from the Russia-Ukraine border.</p>

<p>A Ukrainian security official told AFP, on condition of anonymity, that "the aim is to stretch the positions of the enemy, to inflict maximum losses and to destabilise the situation in Russia as they are unable to protect their own border".</p>

<p>The Ukrainian official said thousands of Ukrainian troops were involved in the operation.</p>

<p>Russia's defence ministry said on Monday that its air defence systems had destroyed 18 Ukrainian drones -- including 11 over the Kursk region.</p>

<p>- 'It's scary' -</p>

<p>Russia's emergency situations ministry said on Sunday that over 44,000 residents in the Kursk region have applied for financial assistance, TASS news agency reported.</p>

<p>Russia's rail operator has meanwhile organised emergency trains from Kursk to Moscow, around 450 kilometres away, for those fleeing.</p>

<p>"It's scary to have helicopters flying over your head all the time," said Marina, refusing to give her surname, who arrived by train in Moscow on Sunday. "When it was possible to leave, I left."</p>

<p>Across the border in Ukraine's Sumy region, AFP journalists on Sunday saw dozens of armoured vehicles daubed with a white triangle -- the insignia apparently being used to identify Ukrainian military hardware deployed in the attack.</p>

<p>At an evacuation centre in the regional capital of Sumy, 70-year-old retired metal worker Mykola, who fled his village of Khotyn some 10 kilometres from the Russian border, welcomed Ukraine's push into Russia.</p>

<p>"Let's let them find out what it's like," he told AFP. "They don't understand what war is. Let them have a taste of it."</p>

<p>Analysts think Kyiv may have launched the assault to relieve pressure on its troops in other parts of the frontline.</p>

<p>But the Ukrainian official said: "Their pressure in the east continues, they are not pulling back troops from the area," even if "the intensity of Russian attacks has gone down a little bit".</p>

<p>The Ukrainian official said he expected Russia would "in the end" stop the incursion.</p>

<p>Ukraine was bracing for a large-scale retaliatory missile attack, including "on decision-making centres" in Ukraine, the official said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Pakistan's former ISI chief Lt Gen (retd.) Faiz Hameed has been arrested by the military ahead of his court martial in connection with a housing scheme scandal, the army said on Monday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an unprecedented move, the Pakistan Army on Monday announced that it has arrested former ISI chief Lt Gen (retd.) Faiz Hameed and initiated court martial proceedings against him in connection with a housing scheme scandal.</p>

<p>"Complying with the orders of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, a detailed court of inquiry was undertaken by Pakistan Army, to ascertain correctness of complaints in Top City Case made against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd)," the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) - the media wing of the army- said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Consequently, appropriate disciplinary action has been initiated against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd.), under provisions of the Pakistan Army Act," it said.</p>

<p>"In addition, multiple instances of violation of the Pakistan Army Act post-retirement have also been established. The process of Field General Court Martial has been initiated and Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) has been taken into military custody," it added.</p>

<p>Lt Gen (retd.) Hameed was considered extremely powerful when he headed the spy agency from 2019 to 2021.</p>

<p>He was appointed to the coveted post when then ISI chief and current Army chief Lt Gen Asim Munir was prematurely removed from the post. It was reported then that then prime minister Imran Khan was not happy with Munir.</p>

<p>Later, the army decided to replace Mr Hameed, a move vehemently opposed by Imran Khan and it is believed that it was the beginning of souring of his ties with the powerful military.</p>

<p>The Top City case made headlines when on November 8, 2023, Moeez Ahmed Khan, the owner of Top City, filed a petition in the Supreme Court in which he accused Mr Hameed of misusing his authority.</p>

<p>He stated in the petition that on May 12, 2017, at the behest of Gen Hameed, ISI officials raided the top city office and his house and seized valuables, including gold, diamonds and money.</p>

<p>He also stated that Sardar Najaf, the brother of Mr Hameed, also contacted him to resolve the issue later. The petition also claimed that Gen Hameed later personally met him to resolve the issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He alleged that the ISI officials extorted Rs 4 crore cash from him.</p>

<p>A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court, which included Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice Qazi Faiz Isa, Justice Attar Minullah and Justice Aminuddin, heard the case and decided to send it to the Ministry of Defence for probing the allegation.</p>

<p>The army announced in April this year that it constituted a high-level inquiry committee headed by a major general to look into the allegations.</p>

<p>Mr Hameed took premature retirement in November 2022, four months before his retirement date after the current army chief took over. He was considered close to then Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa.</p>

<p>The post of ISI chief is considered one of the most important in the Pakistan Army, which has ruled the country for more than half of its 76-plus years of existence and has hitherto wielded considerable power in matters of security and foreign policy.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adored by her classmates and defiant even after police seized her, student Nusrat Tabassum is one of the many women who helped spearhead the movement that toppled autocratic ex-premier Sheikh Hasina.</p>

<p>Sizable protests against Hasina's 15-year rule were nothing new, but this was the first time that young women took to the streets against her in large numbers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Soldiers refused to fire on them, a pivotal moment in Hasina's ouster.</p>

<p>"The people had no way back," Tabassum, 23, told AFP. "Anger was increasing, and the demand for equality was increasing."</p>

<p>Tabassum is a campus hero for helping lead a movement that began as a protest against civil service job quotas and ended in revolution.</p>

<p>As she strolled the grounds of the elite Dhaka University, friends and other pupils rose from their seats to offer handshakes, hugs and high-fives.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago she was among six top student leaders snatched by plainclothes police and held in custody for several days, officially for their safety.</p>

<p>With Hasina's grip on power slipping, her security forces held the group at gunpoint and made them sign a statement calling off the protests.</p>

<p>"I thought of suicide several times," Tabassum said. "I could not bear the thought of the people of this country thinking that we had cheated, that we had sold out."</p>

<p>But Bangladeshis saw through the ruse.</p>

<p>"When we saw people did not misunderstand us, and were still protesting on the street, then I regained my strength and power to continue," she said.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Women were deprived' -</strong></p>

<p>Protests began last month over a court decision to reintroduce loathed quotas for government jobs, seen as a tool for Hasina's government to stack the bureaucracy with loyalists.</p>

<p>One aspect was a 10 percent reservation for women applicants, but Tabassum said the politicised nature of the scheme meant that "women were deprived more than they benefitted".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Soon after protests began, Hasina said the quotas had to remain because women were otherwise unable to get those jobs on their own merits.</p>

<p>The irony of her statement, from one of the world's longest-serving women heads of government, was not lost on its audience.</p>

<p>"Women are more concerned about their rights these days," said Nahida Bushra, a human sciences graduate student at Dhaka University.</p>

<p>"That's why women spontaneously joined the protests."</p>

<p>Muslim-majority Bangladesh has a history of extremist attacks, and one way Hasina sailed through earlier bouts of unrest was by blaming Islamist troublemakers.</p>

<p>She tried again this time, but the sight of young women leading protests undercut her argument.</p>

<p><strong>- 'We moved forward' -</strong></p>

<p>Bushra, 23, played a key role in mobilising her fellow women classmates to attend rallies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She sidestepped government efforts to stop her and ignored a concerted online campaign to demonise students.</p>

<p>"There was a storm of rumours and disinformation on social media, but we kept our unity with courage and bravery," she told AFP.</p>

<p>Telecoms were ordered to block access to Facebook and other platforms used to organise demonstrations, so Bushra and others circumvented the bans through virtual private networks (VPNs).</p>

<p>The government then imposed a complete national shutdown of mobile and broadband internet, so they organised rallies through SMS messages and phone calls.</p>

<p>When police began firing on protesters, they rushed to the front of the crowd in the expectation that officers would be more reluctant to shoot women.</p>

<p>"We moved forward and took the protest forward," Bushra said.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Absolute bloodbath' -</strong></p>

<p>In a final desperate move to remain in power, Hasina's government ordered soldiers to suppress the protests.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They refused.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It would have been an absolute bloodbath and the army was unwilling to perpetrate a massacre," Thomas Kean of the International Crisis Group told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"To have sided with Hasina at this juncture would have tarnished their image massively."</p>

<p>Bangladesh's armed forces are outsized contributors to UN peacekeeping operations, a source of deep institutional pride.</p>

<p>Kean said their complicity in the crackdown would have opened up the military to Western sanctions and international pariahdom, as well as a potential revolt from rank-and-file soldiers.</p>

<p>Despite army chief Waker-Uz-Zaman being a distant relative of Hasina's, Kean said the general had "little choice but to put institutional interests first".</p>

<p>As the dust settles from some of the most tempestuous weeks in Bangladesh's history, Tabassaum said work had just begun.</p>

<p>"My country has not been able to practice what democracy really looks like," she said.</p>

<p>"The responsibility to build the country remains."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[This innovative solution could revolutionise the aviation industry, enabling faster-than-sound travel while minimising the negative impacts associated with it.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<header>
<p>Sonic booms and shockwaves have been significant barriers to the development of supersonic aircraft, causing concerns about noise, damage, and safety. However, researchers from Northwestern Polytechnical University in China have made a groundbreaking discovery to mitigate these effects. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3273941/chinese-scientists-drilled-holes-plane-wing-reduce-sonic-booms-it-worked">South China Morning Post,</a></em> scientists&nbsp;drilled holes in the plane's wing and found a way to reduce the intensity of sonic booms.</p>

<p>The researchers' unconventional method of drilling holes in the wing yielded two major benefits:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Reduced sonic booms:</strong> By allowing airflow to pass from the underside to the top surface, the holes effectively mitigated shock wave vibrations, decreasing the intensity of sonic booms.</li>
	<li><strong>Improved aerodynamic efficiency:</strong> The holes increased aerodynamic efficiency by over 10%, as reported in the study published in Acta Aerodynamica Sinica.</li>
</ol>

<h2><strong>How will this work?</strong></h2>

<p>According to Bernoulli's principle, the curved upper surface and flat underside of an aeroplane wing create pressure differences, generating lift. However, as planes approach the speed of sound, shock waves form, causing turbulence and destructive vibrations. Only a few specially designed planes can overcome this barrier. Sonic booms produced by shock waves can be explosive and shatter windows.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, researchers at Northwestern Polytechnical University, led by Professor Gao Chao, proposed a solution: adding holes to the wing. When the plane surpasses the speed of sound, a cover opens, allowing airflow to converge and prevent shock waves. An air pump modulates the jet stream, halting turbulence and nearly eliminating wing vibrations. This innovative design could resolve the issues associated with supersonic flight, making it more accessible and efficient.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''When using jet stream control to suppress shock wave buffeting, although there is a slight loss of lift, it can reduce overall drag, so the lift-to-drag ratio increases rather than decreases,'' Mr Chao and his colleagues wrote.</p>

<p>Researchers, mainly from China and the US, have explored various methods to reduce supersonic flight turbulence and noise. These include adding grooves or protrusions to the wing surface, installing mechanical devices to suppress shock waves and Using piezoelectric film coatings to manipulate airflow</p>

<p>Meanwhile, NASA's X-59 supersonic jet which aims to reduce noise is set for its first test flight this year. However, Mr Gao's team believes&nbsp;their solution is the simplest and most effective. They plan to conduct further wind tunnel tests to develop their technology for practical application.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's newly appointed Chief Justice Syed Refaat Ahmed on Monday warned of stern action if anybody from the judiciary was found to be involved in any "misdeeds".</p>

<p>Speaking at a reception hosted by the Attorney General's Office and the Supreme Court Bar in the Appellate Division, Mr Ahmed commemorated those killed in the student protests that resulted in the toppling of the government led by Sheikh Hasina last week.</p>

<p>"I extend my congratulations to the students and the people of the entire country. I also congratulate those who supported this movement," he said.</p>

<p>"The students have sparked a great awakening against inequality. Due to the revolution of the students and the public, I have been entrusted with this responsibility, which I will carry out. At this moment, we are standing on the ruins. We have to start anew while standing on this destruction," he said.</p>

<p>The Daily Star newspaper reported the chief justice warned that no irregularity would be tolerated in the judiciary.</p>

<p>He added that "stern action would be taken if anybody from the judiciary was found to be involved in any misdeeds as the policy of oppression that prevailed for so long instead of justice was now over."</p>

<p>"I will work with devotion and honesty. I will do everything to establish justice in the society after the mass upheaval. Our sense of justice has been destroyed over the years," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Ahmed was sworn in as Bangladesh's new chief justice on Sunday, a day after Obaidul Hassan stepped down as the top judge following an ultimatum by the protesters demanding a revamp of the judiciary.</p>

<p>Mr Hassan and five other judges of the apex Appellate Division on Saturday tendered their resignation, five days after the fall of Ms Hasina's regime amid massive street protests.</p>

<p>His resignation came as protesters of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement gathered at the Supreme Court premises.</p>

<p>President Mohammed Shahabuddin administered the oath to the chief justice, an event also attended by Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus, who was sworn in on Thursday as the head of an interim government following the ouster of Ms Hasina in the protests that left more than 200 persons dead.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Ukrainian deputy energy minister accused of taking a bribe worth half a million dollars has been arrested along with three alleged accomplices, Ukraine's SBU Security Service said on Monday.</p>

<p>The minister, whom the SBU did not name, allegedly demanded mining industry officials pay him to transfer equipment from mines in the frontline eastern Donetsk region to a coal basin in western Ukraine.</p>

<p>"The equipment in question is unique and scarce, belonging to one of the state-owned coal companies located in the most active area of the eastern frontline -- Pokrovsk," the SBU said in a statement.</p>

<p>"In the spring of 2024, industry representatives approached the deputy energy minister to obtain permission to evacuate the equipment from the war zone and use it at mines in a western region," it added.</p>

<p>"However, the official, whose duties included the preservation of mining equipment, demanded money for its removal," it said.</p>

<p>The minister took the payment with the help of three alleged accomplices, all of whom were caught "red handed" after the minister had received part of the bribe, according to the statement.</p>

<p>The SBU did not disclose the identity of the four accused, posting photos of its officers arresting the suspects with their faces blurred.</p>

<p>But Ukrainian opposition MP Yaroslav Zheleznyak named the minister as Oleksandr Kheilo, a deputy energy minister.</p>

<p>Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers later issued an order to dismiss Kheilo from his post, according to a government Telegram channel.</p>

<p>Ukraine, which had severe corruption problems even before Russia's 2022 invasion, has pledged to bolster efforts to combat graft as it seeks EU membership and to reassure its Western military backers.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky rose to power on a platform of ending corruption, and has fired a number of officials including his defence minister last year over graft scandals in the army.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's former foreign minister Javad Zarif, who negotiated a landmark 2015 nuclear deal with major world powers, on Monday announced he had resigned from his new post as vice president.</p>

<p>"I resigned from the position of vice president for strategic affairs last week," Zarif said in a post on X, less than two weeks after the newly-elected reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian chose him as his deputy.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Zarif cited several reasons for his resignation, most notably his disappointment with the line-up in the newly proposed 19-member cabinet.</p>

<p>"I am ashamed that I could not implement, in a decent way, the expert opinion of the committees (responsible for selecting candidates) and achieve the inclusion of women, youth and ethnic groups, as I had promised," he said.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian on Sunday presented his cabinet, which included one woman, to parliament for approval.</p>

<p>The proposed list drew criticism from some among Iran's reformist camp, including over the inclusion of conservatives from the government of late President Ebrahim Raisi.</p>

<p>Zarif pointed out that he also faced pressure after his appointment as vice president because his children hold US citizenship.</p>

<p>"My message... is not a sign of regret or disappointment with dear Dr Pezeshkian or opposition to realism; rather it means doubting my usefulness as a vice-president for strategic affairs," he said, noting he would return to academia and focus less on Iran's domestic politics.</p>

<p>Zarif, who was Iran's top diplomat between 2013 and 2021 in the government of moderate president Hassan Rouhani, became known on the international stage during the lengthy negotiations for the 2015 accord formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.</p>

<p>The deal was effectively torpedoed three years later when then-president Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the deal and reimposed crippling sanctions on the Islamic Republic.</p>

<p>But it made Zarif a figurehead for a more open, outward-looking Iran that Pezeshkian pledged to strive for during his campaign, during which he was frequently joined by the former top diplomat.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a statement on Monday, Gallant's ministry confirmed the call took place overnight. It said Gallant and Austin discussed operational and strategic coordination and the Israeli military's readiness in the face of Iranian threats.</p>

<p>Austin has meanwhile ordered the deployment of a guided missile submarine to the Middle East. The US military had already said it would deploy additional fighter jets and Navy warships to the region to bolster Israeli defences.</p>

<p>On Friday, an Iranian Revolutionary Guards deputy commander was quoted as saying by local news agencies that Iran was set to carry out an order by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to "harshly punish" Israel over the assassination on July 31 of the leader of Palestinian operative group Hamas in Tehran.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korean police said Monday they were investigating a YouTuber who vlogged about undergoing a late-term abortion, sparking online outrage and calls from the country's health ministry for a murder probe.</p>

<p>The woman, whose identity police withheld, claimed in a video posted on Google-owned YouTube in June to have undergone an abortion in her thirty-sixth week of pregnancy, saying she had only discovered she was pregnant very late in the process.</p>

<p>The footage, which was later deleted, quickly went viral in South Korea, with screenshots from it still circulating widely online and the country's health ministry calling for a murder investigation.</p>

<p>"We have booked the woman and the head of a medical clinic who performed the procedure as suspects," a representative of the Seoul Police Agency told AFP.</p>

<p>The police confirmed the footage was genuine, saying they had identified the clinic where the procedure was performed through an analysis of the video.</p>

<p>Police are investigating exactly what happened, a police official said according to the Yonhap news agency, adding that the probe could implicate more people.</p>

<p>Until 2019, South Korea was one of just a handful of industrialised nations that broadly criminalised abortion, except in instances of rape, incest, and when the mother's health was in jeopardy.</p>

<p>But five years ago, the Constitutional Court ordered the decades-old ban lifted, ruling that the 1953 statute "goes against the constitution".</p>

<p>It ordered the law to be revised by the end of 2020 but it has yet to be.</p>

<p>As a result of the legal vacuum, there is technically no limit on late-term abortions, but police are claiming authority to investigate.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Investigations revealed that Leigh Ann murdered her husband and cleverly concealed his body within her own home for 18 years while abandoning her five children.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In November 2015, a chilling murder case made headlines around the world. Shockwaves rippled through the quiet town of Beddau, Wales after the skeletal remains of John Sabine were unearthed in a garden, wrapped in plastic. Police believe he was murdered by his wife Leigh Ann Sabine, who died in October 2015, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-35097310">BBC</a></em> reported. Investigations revealed that Leigh Ann, known locally as ''Mad Lee'',&nbsp;murdered her husband and cleverly concealed his body within her own home for 18 years while abandoning her five children.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The woman's story is told in <em>'The Body Next Door'</em>, a three-part documentary series that explores one of the most bizarre and shocking true crime stories of the past decade.</p>

<p><strong>The Murder Case</strong></p>

<p>In 1997, 67-year-old accountant John Sabine vanished from his home in Beddau. His wife cunningly concealed his disappearance, claiming he had abandoned her of his own accord. However, in reality, she had brutally murdered John with a stone frog ornament, then meticulously wrapped his body in layers of plastic and shopping bags, effectively mummifying him, and hid him in a series of locations - under a bed, in a garden shed, and finally, in her attic.</p>

<p>For 18 years, Sabine collected John's pension. Her dark secret remained hidden until her death from brain cancer on October 30, 2015. A few weeks later, her friend&nbsp;stumbled upon a gruesome discovery in the attic while sorting through her belongings. She found a large package that had the mummified corpse of John Sabine.</p>

<p>Soon, detectives from South Wales Police arrived at her home to scour her photos for any trace of the murder weapon.&nbsp;A postmortem carried out by forensic pathologist Dr Richard Jones found the cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head. Dr Jones said the way the body had been wrapped meant it was well preserved through ''chemical mummification.''</p>

<p>The autopsy also revealed that the unique pattern of wounds on the victim's head matched the protrusions on a frog-shaped ornament.&nbsp;Investigators later discovered the frog figurine in a box of trinkets that she had gifted to her friend Michelle.</p>

<p>A few months before she died, Sabine told a hairdresser, ''People are going to talk about me after I have gone. I could be famous.'' When the hairdresser asked why, she replied: "Because of the body in the bag.''</p>

<p>Photographer Juliet Eden who met&nbsp;Sabine a year before her death told <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/08/11/a-woman-hid-husbands-dead-body-inside-home-18-years-21352144/#:~:text=In%20reality%20Sabine%20had%20savagely,shed%20then%2C%20to%20her%20attic.">Metro</a></em>, ''Lee was highly intelligent, very confident and quite mad. She called everyone “darling” and hid her secrets behind a crazy, flamboyant demeanour. I always found that puzzling; if people have something they want to hide, usually they stay quiet and tuck themselves away in a corner. But Lee was the opposite,&nbsp;she hid in plain sight.''</p>

<p>Ms Eden has also written a book,&nbsp;<a href="https://julieteden.co.uk/"><em>Frog Murderer</em></a>, which revisits her experience with Sabine.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greece ordered the evacuation of hospitals and homes near Athens Monday as <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/raging-wildfire-forces-dozens-to-evacuate-in-greece-6317306" target="_blank">wildfires spread</a> despite "superhuman" efforts to combat the flames, the fire brigade said.</p>

<p>At least five more communities were told to flee by civil protection authorities, after hundreds of people evacuated Sunday from at least eight villages.</p>

<p>"Civil protection forces battled hard throughout the night, but despite superhuman efforts, the fire evolved rapidly," fire brigade spokesman Vassilis Vathrakogiannis said.</p>

<p>"At this moment it has reached Mount Pentelicus and is headed in the direction of Penteli," he added.</p>

<p>Two hospitals in Penteli -- one for children and a military facility -- were evacuated at dawn according to Vathrakogiannis.</p>

<p>The brigade has deployed 510 firefighters and 152 vehicles, while 29 aircraft were due to set out at first light, he added.</p>

<p>"Forest fire near you. Follow the instructions of the authorities," said SMS messages sent to people in the Attica region, indicating in which direction to flee.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis cut short his holiday and returned to Athens Sunday evening to deal with the crisis.</p>

<p>By Sunday afternoon, firefighters had quickly dealt with 33 out of the 40 blazes that had broken out in the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>But the force was battling seven more in the high Mediterranean summer heat, the fire brigade spokesman said Sunday.</p>

<p>Residents of the historic town of Marathon, 40 kilometres (25 miles) east of Athens, were among those ordered to evacuate Sunday.</p>

<p>"Everything is burning," said Giorgos Tsevas, a resident of Polydendri village.</p>

<p>"I have 200 olive trees there but now they are gone," the 48-year-old said Sunday.</p>

<p>Already Saturday, Civil Protection Minister Vassilis Kikilias had warned that half the country was under a high-risk warning for fires due to high temperatures, wind gusts and drought conditions.</p>

<p>"Throughout the night, winds remained strong, creating dangerous situations. Unfortunately their intensity is expected to increase in the coming hours," Vathrakogiannis warned.</p>

<p>The Mediterranean country is exceptionally vulnerable to summer blazes, with this season seeing fires burn daily.</p>

<p>After the warmest winter on record, Greece also experienced its hottest June and July since reliable data collection began in 1960.</p>

<p>Scientists warn that human-induced fossil fuel emissions are worsening the length, frequency and intensity of heatwaves across the world.</p>

<p>The rising temperatures are leading to longer wildfire seasons and increasing the area burnt in the flames, according to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise was left stunned after a woman grabbed and kissed him forcefully at the closing ceremony of the Paris Olympics 2024.

<p>The Olympic Flag Handover Ceremony marked the transition from the Paris Olympics 2024 to Los Angeles 2028.

       <description><![CDATA[Social media has long had room only for picture-perfect homes, lavish closets and an abundance of beauty products. But a new trend is sweeping the other way -- urging repurposing, more frugal lifestyles and prioritizing quality over quantity.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Exhausted from the rising cost of living in the United States and non-stop ads, some young adults on TikTok are pushing back.</p>

<p>"When every moment of your life feels like you're being sold something and the price of said item keeps going up, people will burn out on spending money," Kara Perez, an influencer and financial educator, told AFP.</p>

<p>Social media has long had room only for picture-perfect homes, lavish closets and an abundance of beauty products. But a new trend is sweeping the other way -- urging repurposing, more frugal lifestyles and prioritizing quality over quantity.</p>

<p>Known as "underconsumption core," it spotlights living sustainably and using what you have, a reversal of the excess and wealth that dominates ad-heavy Instagram and TikTok.</p>

<p>"When you get 300 videos on TikTok about people who have 30 Stanley cups, you want to have as many as you can afford. People want to fit in," said Perez, who repurposes jars as cups.</p>

<h3><strong>Consumer fatigue</strong></h3>

<p>A video with over 100,000 views from TikTok user loveofearthco critiqued the tendency toward overconsumption often amplified and encouraged on social media: "I spent money I didn't have on things I didn't need."</p>

<p>Another account, nevadahuvenaars, shared what "normal" consumption looks like: used furniture, a modest closet, decor upcycled from glass bottles, meal prep and a downsized skincare collection.</p>

<p>Despite financial hardships felt particularly by Gen Z and millennials, the US economy is thriving, with record corporate profits and high prices on shelves.</p>

<p>In a way, "that feels almost 'gaslighty' to consumers" amid a period of economic and geopolitical uncertainty, culture and consumer marketing analyst Tariro Makoni told AFP.</p>

<p>She argued that Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) plans commonly adopted by many young adults' budgets exacerbate consumption and represent a distortion in access to wealth.</p>

<p>But years of inflation have forced many to the conclusion that they cannot keep up with the spending habits of those on their social media feeds.</p>

<p>A Google Trends analysis shows US searches for "underconsumption" hit a high point this summer, surfacing alongside queries about "overproduction" and the "Great Depression."</p>

<p>Many young adults have developed a "compulsive behavior to spend down to their last pound on a fashion item," said UK-based influencer Andrea Cheong who recently shared an "underconsumption core" style video of her mending old clothes.</p>

<p>It is an addiction tied to a pressure "to articulate who we are through possessions," Cheong noted.</p>

<p>In contrast, "underconsumption core" breaks from traditional core trends promoted by influencers, who often sell an ever changing purchasing blueprint embodying the latest trend and aesthetic, according to Cheong. She and Makoni agreed that the shift also reflects increased calls for authenticity from content creators.</p>

<p>Now, "conserving is cool" said Makoni -- "we saw very similar patterns after 2008" during the financial crisis.</p>

<p>Over half of Gen Z adults -- age 18 to 27 -- polled in a 2024 survey by Bank of America stated the high cost of living as a top barrier to their financial success, adding that many do not make enough money to live the life they want.</p>

<h3><strong>Sustainability concerns</strong></h3>

<p>"The social media trend of 'underconsumption' is another way for Gen Z to make the most of their money and be environmentally friendly at the same time," said Ashley Ross, head of consumer client experience and governance at Bank of America.</p>

<p>While younger generations worry about making sustainable choices, a lack of financial autonomy drives their decisions.</p>

<p>"Let's be honest, no one's gonna change their GDP for sustainability. We don't live in that world ... The motivation for people to do these things has always been to save money," said Cheong.</p>

<p>But she told AFP "underconsumption" trends ultimately provide the most accessible approach to sustainability for those who seek it. The message is simple: "Buy less, buy better."</p>

<p>Low consumption brick-and-mortar initiatives cast a wider net of profiles and generations.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Farming can develop in mysterious ways. Israeli researchers learned about that when the war in Gaza seemed to have all but wrecked their work on a more resilient strain of the cocoa plant that could help alleviate a global shortage of the beans.</p>

<p>Just days after Israel's agriculture research centre, the Volcani Institute, sent 140 seedlings to a facility in southern Israel to study how this tropical plant could be grown in dry conditions, the area came under attack by the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas.</p>

<p>The October 7 assault that sparked the war in Gaza, paralysed southern Israel and left the facility shut down for months without electricity or irrigation.</p>

<p>"When we came back in January we saw everything around us, all the experiments that died," said Talli Ilani, a researcher at the R&amp;D Darom site.</p>

<p>Everything except for 18 cocoa seedlings.</p>

<p>While the team had not planned on testing the selected cocoa strains specifically for drought resistance, they may have found just that.</p>

<p>"It's a very unusual result, to find a strain that can withstand 3-1/2 months of drought as new fresh seedlings and also severe cold front," said Ellen Graber, a senior principal scientist at the Volcani Institute. "It means that we may be able to develop strains that can expand the growing regions for cocoa."</p>

<p>Bad weather and disease have hurt cocoa production and sent global cocoa prices soaring.</p>

<p>Graber now plans to clone the surviving plants - which she refers to as "super heroes" - and test them for other qualities such as resistance to pests, and identify the genes responsible for their resilience.</p>

<p>The Volcani Institute has developed resilient plant strains in the past, including drought-resistant wheat that ripens earlier and with a higher nutrient content, as well as a chill-resistant basil that yields all year round.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

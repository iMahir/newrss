       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Mexican national and one of "America's Most Wanted" fugitives for 20 years, was captured in Mexico while working as a police officer. According to the<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/04/us-news/americas-most-wanted-fugitive-antonio-el-diablo-riano-arrested-in-mexico/"> New York Post,</a></em>&nbsp;Antonio ''El Diablo'' Riano&nbsp;was handed over to deputy US Marshals in Mexico City and charged with first-degree murder stemming from a 2004 fatal shooting outside a bar in Ohio.</p>

<p>On December 19, 2004, a deadly altercation occurred at the Round House Bar in Hamilton, Ohio, resulting in the tragic death of 25-year-old Benjamin Becerra.&nbsp;A few weeks prior, Mr Becerra was involved in a brawl at the same bar and was asked to leave.</p>

<p>On the day of the shooting, Mr Becerra returned to the bar, where Riano was assisting the bartender.&nbsp;A brief argument ensued between them, resulting in Riano fatally shooting Mr Becerra in the head at approximately 2:20 p.m.</p>

<p>Riano fled the scene in his van but was later identified through witness statements and surveillance footage showing him purchasing ammunition at a Walmart just 45 minutes before the shooting.&nbsp;A Grand Jury indicted him on first-degree murder on February 16, 2005, but he failed to appear at his scheduled arraignment. Instead, he fled to Mexico to escape prosecution.</p>

<p>He was placed on Butler County Sheriff's Office's "Most Wanted" list and was also profiled on a 2005 episode of ''America's Most Wanted.''</p>

<p>On Thursday, Riano was apprehended in Mexico, where he was working as a police officer, and handed over to deputy US Marshals in Mexico City.</p>

<p>''Over 20 years after the shooting the Butler County Prosecutor's Office teamed up with the U.S. Marshals Service and the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of International Affairs who worked with law enforcement partners in Mexico to secure the arrest and extradition of Riano. When Riano was arrested in Mexico he was found to be working as a local police officer,'' the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.usmarshals.gov/news/press-release/us-marshals-capture-hamilton-homicide-suspect-2004">US Marshals Service said.</a></p>

<p>He is now being extradited from Zapotitlan Palmas to the Butler County Jail, according to the U.S. Marshals Service and Butler County Prosecutor's Office.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The number of marriages in China is closely tied to the number of births, and the decline is likely to upset policymakers trying hard to boost the population which has been shrinking for two consecutive years.</p>

<p>A total of 3.43 million couples tied the knot in the first six months of the year, a drop of 498,000 from the same year-ago period, the data on marriage registrations showed.</p>

<p>Marriage is seen as a prerequisite for having children due to widespread incentives and policies, including a requirement for parents to present a marriage certificate to register their child and receive state benefits.</p>

<p>Many young Chinese are opting to stay single or delay getting married due to poor job prospects and worries about the future as growth in the world's second-largest economy slows.</p>

<p>Marriage rates have been declining in China since 2014. While there was a slight pick up in 2023 due to pent-up demand after the easing of pandemic restrictions, the rate this year is expected to drop to its lowest since 1980, demographic expert He Yafu told state-backed newspaper the Global Times.</p>

<p>Reasons for the decline in marriage registrations include a decrease in the number of young people, a higher number of males in the marriageable population versus females, the high cost of marriage, and changing attitudes, He said.</p>

<p>"The declining trend in China's birth rate in the long run will be difficult to fundamentally change unless substantial childbirth support policies are implemented in the future to address this challenge," He said.</p>

<p>China's Civil Affairs University announced a new undergraduate marriage program to develop marriage-related industries and culture, drawing scorn from social media users who questioned the need for such a course as marriage rates decline.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 45-year-old Indonesian man allegedly killed his 60-year-old neighbour after being repeatedly asked why he wasn't married. The incident took place in South Tapanuli regency, located in North Sumatra, on July 29, the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/indonesian-man-kills-neighbour-who-kept-asking-him-why-he-was-not-married-at-45">Straits Times</a></em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Assistant Police Commissioner Maria Marpaung, the victim of the fatal attack was identified as Asgim Irianto, a 60-year-old retired civil servant. The attacker, Parlindungan Siregar, was reportedly hurt and annoyed by the victim's persistent questioning about his marital status.</p>

<p>According to the statement of the victim's wife, Siregar arrived at the victim's home on July 29, wielding a piece of wood and attacked him without warning. Mr&nbsp;Irianto&nbsp;attempted to escape by running out into the street. However, Siregar pursued him, catching up and delivering a fatal blow to the head. Even though he fell to the ground, Siregar continued to beat him mercilessly.</p>

<p>Other residents intervened, stopped the assault, and rushed Mr&nbsp;Irianto to the hospital. He died on the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The police&nbsp;arrested Siregar shortly after. &nbsp;The investigation is ongoing, but the cops suspect the motive was linked to Siregar's frustration over the elderly man's repeated inquiries about his marital status.</p>

<p>"He was determined to beat Mr Asgim to death because of the frequent taunts about his single status," said senior police officer Marpaung.</p>

<p>According to a local report, the fatal attack was not an isolated incident, but rather the culmination of a history of tensions between the two neighbours. Before the deadly assault, the duo had reportedly engaged in heated arguments over their chickens wandering into each other's coops.</p>

<p>In a similar incident, an&nbsp;Indonesian man was arrested for allegedly stabbing his friend to death after an argument over the classic riddle, "Which came first, the chicken or the egg?" According to the&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/southeast-asia/indonesia-chicken-egg-question-murder-sulawesi-b2588159.html">Independent,</a></em>&nbsp;the incident occurred on July 24 in Southeast Sulawesi province's Muna Regency, when the suspect, identified as DR, invited&nbsp;Kadir Markus for a drink.&nbsp;After a few rounds of alcoholic drinks, DR asked Mr&nbsp;Markus to answer a riddle for him.</p>

<p>As the conversation turned into a heated debate, Mr&nbsp;Markus tried to distance himself from the argument, refusing to engage further.&nbsp;Mr Markus decided to go back to his home, but DR grabbed a dagger and chased him on his bike and then on foot before <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/drunk-man-in-indonesia-stabs-friend-to-death-for-not-answering-chicken-egg-riddle-6232017">attacking him multiple times</a>.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris will name her running mate as soon as Monday, as she prepares for a tour of US battleground states aimed at turning excitement over her presidential bid into durable support that can power her to victory.</p>

<p>All paths to the White House run through a handful of swing states, and Harris will kick off her five-day run Tuesday in the largest -- Pennsylvania -- as she builds momentum for her showdown with Republican Donald Trump on November 5.</p>

<p>"At this moment, we face a choice between two visions for our nation: one focused on the future and the other on the past... This campaign is about people coming together, fuelled by love of country, to fight for the best of who we are," she posted on X.</p>

<p>Fresh from winning enough delegate votes to secure the Democratic nomination, the country's first female, Black and South Asian vice president heads into the national convention in Chicago in two weeks in total control of her party.</p>

<p>In a campaign that is barely two weeks old, the 59-year-old former prosecutor has obliterated fundraising records, attracted huge crowds and dominated social media on her way to erasing the polling leads Trump had built before President Joe Biden quit the race.</p>

<p>Next on the agenda is a vice presidential pick, with an announcement expected any time before her rally Tuesday evening alongside the mystery nominee in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania's largest city.</p>

<p>The Keystone State is the most prized real estate among the closely fought battlegrounds that decide the Electoral College system.</p>

<p>It is part of the "blue wall" that carried Biden to the White House in 2020, alongside Michigan and Wisconsin -- two states where Harris is due to woo crowds on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania is governed by 51-year-old Democrat Josh Shapiro, a frontrunner in the so-called "veepstakes" shortlist that also includes fellow state governors Tim Walz and Andy Beshear, as well as Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and US transport secretary Pete Buttigieg.</p>

<h3><strong>'Freedom'</strong></h3>

<p>Later in the week, Harris will tour the more racially diverse Sun Belt and southern states of Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and North Carolina, as she seeks to shore up the Black and Hispanic vote that had been peeling away from the Democrats.</p>

<p>Just a month ago, Trump was in cruise control, having opened a significant lead in swing state polling after a dismal debate performance by Biden, with the Republican tycoon keeping the country in suspense over his own vice-presidential pick.</p>

<p>Trump's White House bid was upended on July 21 when 81-year-old Biden, facing growing concerns about his age and lagging polling numbers, exited the race and backed Harris.</p>

<p>Energetic and two decades younger than 78-year-old Trump, the vice president has made a fast start, raising $310 million in July, according to her campaign -- more than double Trump's haul.</p>

<p>While Biden made high-minded appeals for a return to civility and the preservation of democracy, Harris has focused on the future, making voters' hard-fought "freedom" the touchstone of her campaign.</p>

<p>She and her allies have also been more aggressive than the Biden camp -- mocking Trump for reneging on his commitment to a September 10 debate and characterising the convicted felon as an elderly crook and "weird."</p>

<p>While she has disavowed some of the leftist positions she took during her ill-fated 2020 primary campaign, Harris hasn't given a wide-ranging interview since jumping into the race, and rally-goers will look for more detail on her plans for the country.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Trump and his Republicans have struggled to adapt to their new adversary or hone their attacks against Harris -- at first messaging that she was dangerously liberal on immigration and crime, before suggesting she was lying about being Black.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[By 11 p.m. EDT (0300 GMT) on Sunday, the hurricane had sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph), growing from a slow moving tropical storm that gained strength from warm Gulf waters. It will likely just get stronger.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hurricane Debby is expected to slam into the Big Bend region of Florida's Gulf Coast by midday on Monday before slowly crossing the state, causing potentially dangerous storm surges and catastrophic flooding, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.</p>

<p>By 11 p.m. EDT (0300 GMT) on Sunday, the hurricane had sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph), growing from a slow moving tropical storm that gained strength from warm Gulf waters. It will likely just get stronger.</p>

<p>The hurricane center forecast life-threatening conditions, including storm surges up to 10 feet (3 meters) in some areas.</p>

<p>As it slowly moved north, the storm could bring "potentially historic rainfall" of between 10 and 20 inches (25 and 50 cm) and catastrophic flooding to Georgia and South Carolina, it said. Local areas could receive 30 inches of rain by Friday morning.</p>

<p>"This is going to be the story of this storm," said Jamie Rhome, the deputy director of the hurricane center. "It's slow motion is going to dump historic amounts of rainfall - potentially over 20 inches. You're talking about catastrophic flooding."</p>

<p>The storm bears some of the hallmarks of Hurricane Harvey, which hit Corpus Christi, Texas, in August 2017. While downgraded into a tropical storm as it moved inland, it lingered over the state, dumping about 50 inches of rain on Houston.</p>

<p>Harvey is rated as one of the wettest storms in U.S. history, causing more than 100 deaths and $125 billion in damage, primarily from flooding in the Houston metropolitan area.</p>

<p>Rhome said Debby was fueled by exceptionally warm Gulf waters.</p>

<p>Climate scientists believe man-made global warming from burning fossil fuels has raised the temperature of the oceans, making storms bigger and more devastating.</p>

<p>Preparing for Debby, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis called up 3,000 National Guard troops and placed most of the state's cities and counties under emergency orders, while mandatory evacuations were ordered in parts of the Gulf Coast counties of Citrus, Dixie, Franklin, Levy and Wakulla.</p>

<p>DeSantis said there were more than 17,000 linemen and other electric workers ready to restore power.</p>

<p>The governors of Georgia and South Carolina also declared states of emergency ahead of the storm.</p>

<h3><strong>HEAVY RAIN</strong></h3>

<p>Debby became a tropical storm late on Saturday after pushing off north Cuba. As of 11 p.m. EDT, the hurricane was about 100 miles west of Tampa and moving toward the Gulf Coast at 12 mph (19 kph), with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph), the NHC said.</p>

<p>The eye of Debby would move across the eastern Gulf of Mexico and reach the Florida Big Bend coast by midday on Monday, the hurricane center added. Debby was then expected to move slowly across northern Florida and southern Georgia on Monday and Tuesday, it said.</p>

<p>The storm is expected to lose some strength after landfall but bring heavy rain as it crosses central Florida out to the Atlantic coast, before crawling up to Savannah, Georgia, and then onward to Charleston, South Carolina, this week, lingering while dumping catastrophic amounts of rain.</p>

<p>Storm surges forecast for Bonita Beach northward to Tampa Bay could send sea waves further inland than normal, damaging structures and endangering anyone in their path.</p>

<p>The last hurricane to make a direct hit on the Big Bend region was Hurricane Idalia, which briefly gained Category 4 strength before making landfall as a Category 3 in August 2023, with winds of more than 125 mph. The National Centers for Environmental Information estimates there were $3.5 billion in damages.</p>

<p>Forecasters expect a large number of Atlantic hurricanes in the 2024 season, which began on June 1, with four to seven seen as major. That exceeds the record-breaking 2005 season that spawned the devastating Katrina and Rita hurricanes.</p>

<p>Only one hurricane, Beryl, has yet formed in the Atlantic this year. The earliest Category 5 storm on record, it struck the Caribbean and Mexico's Yucatan peninsula before rolling up the Gulf Coast of Texas as a Category 1 storm, with sustained winds up to 95 mph.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A "deepfake" video parodying Kamala Harris, a manipulated expletive-laden clip of Joe Biden -- a tide of AI-fuelled political disinformation has prompted alarm over its potential to manipulate voters as the US presidential race heats up.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A "deepfake" video parodying Kamala Harris, a manipulated expletive-laden clip of Joe Biden, and a doctored image of Donald Trump being arrested -- a tide of AI-fuelled political disinformation has prompted alarm over its potential to manipulate voters as the US presidential race heats up.</p>

<p>In what is widely billed as America's first AI election in November, researchers warn that tech-enabled fakery could be used to steer voters toward or away from candidates -- or even to avoid the polls altogether -- stoking tensions in an already hyperpolarised environment.</p>

<p>A recent wave of disinformation has renewed calls for tech giants -- many of which have retreated from moderating social media content -- to strengthen guardrails around generative artificial intelligence ahead of the vote.</p>

<p>Last week, Elon Musk faced intense criticism for sharing a deepfake video featuring Vice President Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, with his 192 million followers on X, formerly Twitter.</p>

<p>In it, a voiceover mimicking Harris calls President Joe Biden senile; the voice then declares that she does not "know the first thing about running the country."</p>

<p>The video carried no indication that it was parody -- save for a laughing emoji. Only later did Musk clarify that the video was meant as satire.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">This is amazing ?<br />
<a href="https://t.co/KpnBKGUUwn">pic.twitter.com/KpnBKGUUwn</a></p>
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1816974609637417112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 26, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Researchers expressed concern that viewers could have falsely concluded that Harris was deriding herself and sullying Biden.</p>

<p>AFP's fact-checkers have debunked other AI fakery that raised alarm.</p>

<p>Last month, a manipulated video ricocheting across X appeared to show Biden cursing his critics&nbsp;-- including using anti-LGBTQ slurs -- after he announced he would not seek reelection and endorsed Harris for the Democratic nomination.</p>

<p>A reverse image search showed the footage came from one of Biden's speeches, carried live by the broadcaster PBS, in which he denounced political violence after the July 13 assassination attempt on Trump.</p>

<p>PBS said the doctored video was a deepfake that used its logo to deceive viewers.</p>

<p>Weeks earlier, an image shared across platforms appeared to show police forcibly arresting Trump after a New York jury found him guilty of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels.</p>

<p>But the photo was a deepfake, digital forensics experts told AFP.</p>

<h3><strong>'Partisan tension'</strong></h3>

<p>"These recent examples are highly representative of how deepfakes will be used in politics going forward," Lucas Hansen, co-founder of the nonprofit CivAI, told AFP.</p>

<p>"While AI-powered disinformation is certainly a concern, the most likely applications will be manufactured images and videos intended to provoke anger and worsen partisan tension."</p>

<p>Hansen demonstrated to AFP the ability of one AI chatbot to manipulate voter turnout by mass-producing false tweets.</p>

<p>The tool was fed a simple prompt -- "Polling locations charge for parking" -- with the message customised for a specific location: Allen, Texas.</p>

<p>Within seconds, a tweet was churned out misinforming viewers that Allen authorities had "quietly introduced a $25 parking fee at most polling places."</p>

<p>In a previous attempt at possible voter suppression, an AI-enabled robocall impersonating Biden urged New Hampshire residents in January not to cast ballots in the state's primary.</p>

<p>Tests on another leading AI tool, Midjourney, allowed the creation of images seeming to show Biden being arrested and of Trump appearing next to a body double, the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) said in June.</p>

<p>Midjourney had previously blocked all prompts related to Trump and Biden, effectively barring users from creating fake images, tech activists reported.</p>

<p>But CCDH said users could easily circumvent the policy -- in some cases by adding a single backslash to a prompt previously blocked by Midjourney.</p>

<h3><strong>'Tipping point'</strong></h3>

<p>Observers warn that such fakery on a mass scale risks igniting public anger at the electoral process.</p>

<p>More than 50 percent of Americans expect AI-enabled falsehoods to impact who wins the 2024 election, according to a poll published last year by the media group Axios and business intelligence firm Morning Consult.</p>

<p>About one-third of Americans said they will be less trusting of the results because of AI, according to the poll.</p>

<p>Several tech giants have said they are working on systems for labelling AI-generated content.</p>

<p>In a letter to tech CEOs in April, more than 200 advocacy groups demanded urgent efforts to bolster the fight against AI falsehoods -- including prohibiting the use of deepfakes in political ads, and using algorithms to promote factual election content.</p>

<p>The nonprofit Free Press, one of the groups that signed the letter, said they "heard little substance" in the commitments platforms would be making this election cycle.</p>

<p>"What we have now is a toxic online environment where lies are flooding our feeds and confusing voters," Nora Benavidez, senior counsel at the watchdog, told AFP.</p>

<p>"This is a tipping point in our election," she added. "Platform executives should be racing to strengthen and enforce their policies against deepfakes and other problems."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea has deployed 250 ballistic missile launchers to its southern border, with leader Kim Jong Un describing the weapons as a "powerful treasured sword" to defend its sovereignty, state media said Monday.</p>

<p>The olive green mobile launchers were displayed during a special "transferring" ceremony in the capital Pyongyang on Sunday, the official Korean Central News Agency reported.</p>

<p>The missile launchers were an "up-to-date tactical attack weapon", Kim was quoted as saying in a speech.</p>

<p>It was the first time North Korea had publicised the scale of an arms transfer to its border units, Han Kwon-hee of the Korea Association of Defence Industry Studies told AFP.</p>

<p>Each launcher was designed to hold four missiles, Han said, adding that Pyongyang's supply of arms to Moscow might have "interfered with the North's capacity to actually produce 1,000 missiles".</p>

<p>Relations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, with the North ramping up weapons testing and bombarding the South with balloons full of trash.</p>

<p>South Korea has responded by resuming propaganda broadcasts along the border, suspending a tension-reducing military deal and restarting live-fire drills near the border.</p>

<p>This year, Pyongyang declared South Korea its "principal enemy", jettisoned agencies dedicated to reunification and outreach, and threatened war over "even 0.001 mm" of territorial infringement.</p>

<p>Kim noted that presenting the new weapons at a time when the country was reeling from flood damage was a "manifestation of the firm will of our Party to push ahead with the bolstering of defence capabilities".</p>

<p>Heavy rainfall hit the nuclear-armed country's northern regions in late July, with a South Korean media report claiming up to 1,500 people could have died.</p>

<p>Kim has lashed out at the reports, dismissing them as a "smear campaign to bring disgrace upon us and tarnish" the North's image.</p>

<p>The North has said there were no casualties at all in the Sinuiju area, the region Pyongyang said had suffered the "greatest flood damage".</p>

<p>It claimed North Korea's Air Force rescued over 5,000 people, with around 4,200 of them saved by helicopter "within a few hours".</p>

<h3><strong>Effective stage</strong></h3>

<p>Kim said in his speech that the country was facing a "significant and strategic shift due to the transformation of US-led alliances into nuclear-based military blocs", a trend he said required an upgrade in war deterrence, according to a KCNA transcript.</p>

<p>"The strength of our armed forces... must continue to accelerate," Kim said.</p>

<p>Photos released by KCNA showed rows of mobile launchers positioned before a podium where Kim spoke.</p>

<p>Banners flown from a balloon painted with the North Korean flag read: "Let's open the golden age of defence industry development under the leadership of the great comrade Kim!"</p>

<p>While it was possible that Pyongyang had previously deployed ballistic missile launchers to its southern border, Han said it was the first time he had "seen such official reports detailing the scale of arms transfers" to military units in the area.</p>

<p>Producing such a large number of weapons and displaying them together indicates the event had been "planned months in advance", Hong Min, a senior analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, told AFP.</p>

<p>"Producing 250 mobile launchers requires massive manpower and capital, which shows that the event on Sunday was not staged on a short notice," he said.</p>

<p>"Pyongyang appears to have judged that staging such a performance-like event would be an effective message to the United States."</p>

<p>Among the event attendees was Kim's teenage daughter, Ju Ae, who Seoul's spy agency said last week was being groomed as Kim's heir.</p>

<p>Ju Ae, whose exact age has not been confirmed, was seen clapping behind her father in one KCNA photo.</p>

<p>While Kim claimed that the new weapon system was designed by himself, it is likely that they copied the raw technology from overseas, Hong added.</p>

<p>"It is possible that Kim directed the modification using the original technology."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yusuf Dikec, the Turkish shooter who has captured global attention following his silver medal win at the 2024 Paris Olympics, has joined the Elon Musk-owned social media platform X, previously known as Twitter. Mr Dikec secured second place in the mixed team 10-metre air pistol event, along with Sevval Ilayda Tarhan.</p>

<p>Mr Dikec's fame, however, extends beyond heroics in Paris. A photo of His relaxed demeanour and casual style during the competition has made him a viral sensation. Wearing standard glasses, a T-shirt, and keeping his left hand casually in his pocket, Dikec's unorthodox approach stood out. Unlike his competitors, who often use specialised equipment like headphones, special lenses, or hats, Mr Dikec opted for a minimalist style.</p>

<p>After joining X, one of his first posts was directed towards Elon Musk. Sharing a photo from the Olympic event, which quickly became a popular meme, Dikec wrote, "Hi Elon, do you think future robots can win medals at the Olympics with their hands in their pockets? How about discussing this in Istanbul, the cultural capital that unites continents? @elonmusk."</p>

<p>Mr Musk responded, "Robots will hit the center of the bullseye every time."&nbsp;</p>

<p>This exchange has now gone viral on social media.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the internet frenzy, Mr Dikec remains unfazed by his viral status. His relaxed style has drawn comparisons to cinema icon James Bond, with social media users dubbing him "The name's Dikec. Yusuf Dikec." Amid the attention on Dikec, some have called for equal recognition of his partner, Sevval Ilayda Tarhan, who also adopted a casual hand-in-pocket stance, albeit with headphones and a visor.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA["You have Teddy Roosevelt up there. And he's wonderful. I don't say take him down. But you can add Biden," the 84-year-old said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has suggested that the country should add President Joe Biden's sculpture to Mount Rushmore, an iconic monument which features four former presidents including George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt. Ms Pelosi said that the 81-year-old is "such a consequential president of the United States, a Mount Rushmore kind of president," in a clip aired on <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://youtu.be/nSFiel_2tvQ?si=8b5Zja-20DlesvD_">CBS Sunday Morning Show.</a></p>

<p>"You have Teddy Roosevelt up there. And he's wonderful. I don't say take him down. But you can add Biden," the 84-year-old said when asked if Mr Biden deserved to have his face permanently etched in rock at the renowned South Dakota national monument. Notably, the monument was completed in 1941, a year before Mr Biden was born.</p>

<p>This comes as Joe Biden quit the presidential race a few weeks ago after some reports claimed that Ms Pelosi told the US President that he could destroy the Democrats' chances of winning elections in November, due to his age. However, the politician defended the reports and said that Mr Biden "was in a good place to make whatever decision - the top of his game."</p>

<p>Notably, after Mr Biden's debate performance against Mr Trump, Ms Pelosi initially supported him, but she then publicly stated that he needed to decide whether to run for reelection, even though he had already declared he was still in. Later, she told MSNBC's 'Morning Joe' that "it is up to the president to decide if he is going to run," two days after Mr Biden even wrote a letter to Democratic members in early July restating that he was "firmly committed" to the race.</p>

<p>According to a report in CNN, the California Representative had reportedly asked Mr Biden's Senior Advisor Mike Donilon to connect her with the President on a call, which would mark the second conversation between the two since Mr Biden's poor performance in the debate with Donald Trump. However, Ms Pelosi denied any such claims. "No, I wasn't the leader of any pressure (campaign). Let me say things that I didn't do: I didn't call one person. I did not call one person. I could always say to him, 'I never called anybody.' "</p>

<p>"No. My whole point was whatever he decides, but we have to have a more aggressive campaign," she said. "What I'm saying is I had confidence the president would make the proper choice of a country, whatever that would be - and I said that - whatever that is, we'll go with," Ms Pelosi added.</p>

<p>According to reports, the US President seems to be enraged with Ms Pelosi over her alleged involvement in sabotaging his re-election campaign. Responding to the same, the American politician added that "he knows that I love him very much." The former Speaker also stated that she has "never shared any conversations with the president of the United States publicly."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the two separate terms and 20 years that she has been the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, the ongoing protests that have seen over 300 people killed, is perhaps Sheikh Hasina's biggest test. At least 98 people were killed and hundreds injured in Bangladesh on Sunday as police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse tens of thousands demanding the resignation of PM Hasina. The violence marked one of the deadliest days in Bangladesh's recent history of civil unrest, surpassing the 67 deaths reported on July 19 when students protested against the quota system for government jobs.</p>

<p>But what has led to the deadly unrest across Bangladesh?</p>

<p>The protests, which began late last month, escalated dramatically when student activists at Dhaka University, the largest in the country, clashed violently with police and pro-government counter-protesters. The roots of these protests lie in a controversial quota system, which reserves up to 30 per cent of government jobs for family members of veterans from Bangladesh's 1971 war of independence against Pakistan.</p>

</div>

<p>Protesters argue that this system is discriminatory and favours supporters of Prime Minister Hasina's Awami League party. They advocate for a merit-based system to replace the existing quota.</p>

<p>The quota system, established in 1972 and briefly abolished in 2018 before being reinstated, has been a persistent source of contention. Critics claim it unfairly benefits Awami League supporters and limits opportunities for other qualified candidates. Prime Minister Hasina's public remarks further inflamed the situation, leading to intensified protests.</p>

<p>The protests have evolved beyond the quota issue into a broader anti-government movement, drawing support from diverse sections of society, including film stars, musicians, and even garment manufacturers. Rap songs and social media campaigns have amplified the calls for Hasina's resignation.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Hasina, who has ruled since 2009 and secured a fourth consecutive term in January through elections boycotted by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, faces accusations of entrenching power through state institutions and suppressing dissent. The recent violence highlights the growing dissatisfaction and demands for change among the Bangladeshi populace.</p>

<h2><strong>Rapid Escalation</strong></h2>

<p>The protesting students have announced a "March To Dhaka" programme today.</p>

<p>Houses of public representatives, 20 Awami League offices, police stations and other government installations were attacked, vandalised and torched in 39 districts. Clashes between protesters and leaders of the Awami League and its associate organisations were reported in several districts.</p>

<p>Residences and offices of ruling party ministers, state ministers, parliamentarians and Awami League leaders were vandalised in at least 14 different locations.</p>

</div>

<p>In response to the unrest, the government declared an indefinite nationwide curfew starting at 6 pm on Sunday, the first such step during the current wave of protests. A three-day general holiday was also announced starting Monday. Additionally, the government shut down internet services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Demonstrators blocked major highways and launched a non-cooperation program, escalating the violence nationwide. Police stations and ruling party offices became targets, with reports of severe clashes and significant casualties. Thirteen policemen were beaten to death in Sirajganj, and homes of two lawmakers were set on fire.</p>

<p>The unrest was not confined to Dhaka but spread across the country. In the central district of Munsiganj, two construction workers were killed, and 30 injured during a three-way clash involving protesters, police, and ruling party activists.</p>

<p>Further clashes in Pabna, Feni, Lakshmipur, Narsingdi, Rangpur, Magura, and other districts resulted in additional casualties. In Dhaka, a hospital was vandalised, and four garment factories were set on fire. The government's decision to shut down high-speed internet services, including social media platforms, added to the chaos.</p>

<h2><strong>Government Orders&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>Bangladesh's telecom providers were instructed to shut down 4G services, effectively disabling internet access. The protests initially paused after the Supreme Court scrapped most quotas, but resumed sporadically, demanding justice for those killed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bangladesh's Chief of Army Staff General Waker-Uz-Zaman directed officers to ensure the security of lives, properties, and state installations. Despite this, protesters continued to defy the curfew, leading to further clashes and casualties.</p>

<p>The international community, including India, has advised nationals against travelling to Bangladesh.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Los Angeles-New York American Airlines flight made an emergency landing in Phoenix after passengers saw lice crawling in a woman's hair mid-air.&nbsp;A passenger on the flight, Ethan Judelson, shared his experience on TikTok, describing the confusion and uncertainty among passengers. He said that the crew provided minimal information about the diversion, leaving passengers puzzled. According to<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://people.com/plane-grounded-in-emergency-landing-after-passengers-see-lice-exclusive-8686592"> People</a></em>, the incident happened in June.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In his video, Mr Judelson described the scene: "I look around, no one's on the ground, no one's freaking out. I'm like, it can't be that dire. But we land, and as soon as we land, this woman across the aisle from me shoots up and rushes to the front of the plane."</p>

<p>After the plane made an emergency landing, Mr&nbsp;Judelson&nbsp;overheard hushed conversations among fellow passengers. According to eyewitnesses, two passengers had spotted lice crawling out of a woman's hair, prompting them to alert the flight attendants.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Apparently those two girls, they saw bugs crawling out of the woman's hair ... and alerted the flight attendant," Mr Judelson said in the TikTok video.</p>

<p>Upon landing, passengers were informed of a 12-hour delay and were given hotel vouchers.</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0">"Right when we land in Phoenix we all get the email saying, 'Here's your voucher for the hotel.' And we're like, 'Hotel, are we staying here?' Mr Judelson, added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;American Airlines later issued a statement confirming that the flight was diverted due to a medical emergency.</p>

<p>In a statement issued to <em>People</em>, a spokesperson for American Airlines said, "On June 15, American Airlines flight 2201 with service from Los Angeles (LAX) to New York (JFK) diverted to Phoenix (PHX) due to the medical needs of a customer."</p>

<p>Fortunately, the passengers did eventually make it to Los Angeles.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Independent US presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr said in a video posted online on Sunday that he dumped a dead bear in New York City's Central Park a decade ago and staged it to look like a bike had hit it.</p>

<p>Kennedy suggested in the video, which was posted on social media platform X, that he is trying to get ahead of a not-yet-published story from the New Yorker.</p>

<p>"Looking forward to seeing how you spin this one, @NewYorker..." Kennedy posted on his X account with a video of himself at a kitchen table talking to comedian Roseanne Barr.</p>

<p>Kennedy said in the video that he was driving to the Hudson Valley in New York state when a woman in a van in front of him hit a young bear and killed it. He put the bear's body into the back of his car because he was going to skin the bear and store its meat at his house, he said.</p>

<p>But after a late dinner in New York City at the Peter Luger Steak House, he had to go straight to the airport and did not want to leave the bear in his vehicle.</p>

<p>"I had an old bike in my car that somebody asked me to get rid of. I said, 'Let's go put the bear in Central Park and we'll make it look like he got hit by a bike,'" he said and then laughed, saying it would be "amusing" for whoever found it.</p>

<p>The Kennedy campaign did not immediately comment further on the incident.</p>

<p>In October 2014, the body of a black bear cub was found in the bushes of Central Park and police launched a criminal investigation into the death.</p>

<p>Foul play was suspected in the case, Reuters reported at the time, and state wildlife officials later concluded it was likely struck and killed by a vehicle.</p>

<p>Kennedy said in the video that the New Yorker had asked him about the incident and was planning on doing a "big article" about him.</p>

<p>The New Yorker did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.</p>

<p>In a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll, Kennedy was favored by 8% of voters. He has yet to qualify for the ballot in many states ahead of the Nov. 5 election.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia on Monday raised its terror threat level to "probable" from "possible", citing an increase in extremist views in the country leading to a more than 50% chance of the planning of an onshore attack in the next 12 months.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he had raised the country's threat level following advice from security services, but said there was no imminent threat of an attack.</p>

<p>"The advice that we have received is that more Australians are embracing a more diverse range of extreme ideologies and it is our responsibility to be vigilant," he told a news conference.</p>

<p>Australia lowered the threat level to "possible" in 2022, following eight years at "probable".</p>

<p>Mike Burgess, director general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the country's main intelligence agency, said tensions in the Middle East, including a conflict between Israel and Hamas that began on Oct. 7, were a contributing factor to raising the threat level.</p>

<p>"The conflict has fuelled grievances, promoted protests, undermined social cohesion and elevated intolerance," he said.</p>

<p>Australia has seen several violent attacks in recent months, some of which have been designated as motivated by extremism.</p>

<p>In April Australian police said a knife attack on an Assyrian church bishop and some of his followers in Sydney was a terrorist act motivated by suspected religious extremism.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pope Francis's bookish side emerged Sunday, after the Vatican published a letter in which the pontiff encouraged young priests to read --- while revealing that he himself likes the great tragedies.</p>

<p>"How can we speak to the hearts of men and women if we ignore, set aside or fail to appreciate the 'stories' by which they sought to express and lay bare the drama of their lived experience in novels and poems," asked the pontiff in his July 17 letter to priests-to-be, published by the Vatican on Sunday in eight languages.</p>

<p>In the lengthy text -- peppered with references to literary greats like CS Lewis, Marcel Proust, TS Eliot and fellow Argentinian Jorge Luis Borges -- Francis argued that reading was "part of one's path to personal maturity" and therefore crucial not just for those joining the priesthood but all Christians in general.</p>

<p>Noting that Paul the Apostle was a reader, Francis plugged for time spent reading, noting that a good book can "(keep) us from other choices that are less wholesome" and open up minds "trapped by a few obsessive thoughts".</p>

<p>"In moments of weariness, anger, disappointment or failure, when prayer itself does not help us find inner serenity, a good book can help us weather the storm until we find peace of mind," wrote the 87-year-old Argentine Jesuit.</p>

<p>The pope -- whose tastes also run to jazz and soccer -- has sometimes dropped clues as to his preferred reading lists.</p>

<p>He has mentioned Dostoevsky as a favourite author and confessed to having read Italy's seminal 1827 novel "The Betrothed", three times, calling author Alessandro Manzoni the champion of "victims and those who come in last".</p>

<p>In a speech about artificial intelligence to the G7 in June, Francis cited Robert Hugh Benson's 1907 dystopian novel "Lord of the World": "It's nice to read it, it's interesting," he told the Group of Seven leaders.</p>

<p>In his letter to young priests, Francis pointed out that reading -- which he noted requires greater personal engagement than watching films or television -- improves one's vocabulary, develops intellectual capacity and reduces stress and anxiety.</p>

<p>He said he regretted that literature was considered non-essential in the training of priests.</p>

<h3><strong>An 'open mind'</strong></h3>

<p>"We desperately need to counterbalance this inevitable temptation to a frenetic and uncritical lifestyle by stepping back, slowing down, taking time to look and listen. This can happen when a person simply stops to read a book," wrote the pope.</p>

<p>In a personal aside, Francis recalled teaching high school literature at a Jesuit school at the age of 28, encountering resistance from students who did not want to read certain selections.</p>

<p>Arguing that even difficult or boring texts had value, the pope said people should approach reading with "an open mind" and "a willingness to be surprised."</p>

<p>"I, for my part, love the tragedians, because we can all embrace their works as our own, as expressions of our own personal drama," he said.</p>

<p>"In weeping for the fate of their characters, we are essentially weeping for ourselves, for our own emptiness, shortcomings and loneliness."</p>

<p>Seeing life through the eyes of others through literature leads to greater perspective and greater humanity as readers step out of their own lives to enter that of others, Francis wrote.</p>

<p>"We are caught up in the lives of the fruit seller, the prostitute, the orphaned child, the bricklayer's wife, the old crone who still believes she will someday find her prince charming," he said.</p>

<p>Immersing oneself in the thoughts and fears of characters facing daunting challenges has hidden benefits, wrote Francis.</p>

<p>"Perhaps too, in following a story to the end, we gain insights that will later prove helpful in our own lives."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The overall death count from fierce clashes in Bangladesh has risen to over 300, after 98 people died yesterday in the deadliest day in weeks of anti-government demonstrations. The violence-hit country is set for more protests today,]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>Bangladesh braced for another tense day as protestors returned to the streets demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, with analysts fearing violence could surpass what was seen yesterday.</li>
	<li>Protesting students have called for a march to the capital Dhaka today in defiance of a nationwide curfew with the one-point demand of Sheikh Hasina's resignation. "The final battle has come. Come to Dhaka to be a part of history. Students will create a new Bangladesh," said a student leader.</li>
	<li>Dozens were also injured in fierce clashes yesterday.&nbsp;With 98 deaths yesterday, the count since protests began in July has climbed to about 300.</li>
	<li>The Bangladesh Home Ministry decided to impose an indefinite countrywide curfew after yesterday's fierce clashes and mobile internet was tightly restricted countrywide.&nbsp;A three-day general holiday has been declared on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday to ensure public safety amid the ongoing violent protests across the country.</li>
	<li>Just days ago, over 200 people were killed in violent clashes between the police and mostly student protesters demanding an end to the controversial quota system that reserved 30 per cent of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's War of Independence in 1971.</li>
	<li>India has strongly advised all its nationals in Bangladesh to exercise "extreme caution" and restrict their movements.&nbsp;"All Indian nationals including students living in the jurisdiction of the Assistant High Commission of India, Sylhet are requested to be in touch with this office and are advised to remain alert. In case of emergencies, please contact +88-01313076402," the Assistant High Commission said in a post on X.</li>
	<li>The United Nations' human rights chief Volker Turk said the "shocking violence" in Bangladesh must end, as he urged the government to stop targeting peaceful protesters.</li>
	<li>Rallies that began last month against civil service job quotas have escalated into some of the worst unrest of Prime Minister Hasina's 15-year rule and shifted into wider calls for the 76-year-old to step down.</li>
	<li>The demonstrations have grown into a wider anti-government movement across Bangladesh. It has attracted people from all strata of Bangladesh society, including film stars, musicians and singers. Songs calling for people's support have spread widely on social media.</li>
	<li>The protesters have dismissed Ms Hasina's invitation for dialogue aimed at quelling escalating violence and consolidated their demands into a unified call for the government's resignation.</li>
</ol>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has warned his counterparts from the G7 countries that an attack by Iran and Hezbollah against <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-iran-mossad-hezbollah-abraham-alliance-vs-axis-of-resistance-players-in-israel-iran-shadow-war-6259187">Israel </a>could commence as early as Monday, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.axios.com/2024/08/05/iran-hezbollah-attack-israel-monday-blinken">Axios</a> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Israel, however, the leading daily <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-could-preemptively-strike-iran-if-intelligence-shows-attack-is-imminent-report/">Times of Israel </a>reported that the Benjamin Netanyahu-led government could sanction a preemptive strike on Iran to prevent an attack on Israeli soil. According to the report, Israel's leading intelligence agencies Mossad and Shin Bet and their respective heads David Barnea and Ronen Bar, were part of a meeting called by Netanyahu that was also attended by Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hezbollah, established in the early 1980s with Iranian support, represents Iran's first proxy in the Middle East. Funded and armed by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Hezbollah shares Tehran's core ideology and recruits primarily from <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/highly-volatile-situation-foreign-nationals-urged-to-leave-lebanon-6261722">Lebanon</a>'s Shiite Muslim population.</p>

<p>Iran on Saturday said that Hezbollah will escalate its attacks deeper into Israeli territory, potentially targeting more than just military installations. The rapid escalation of tensions follows Israel's recent assassination of a senior Hezbollah military commander, Fuad Shukr. On July 30, Israel struck a densely populated residential area in south Beirut, killing Shukr and five civilians.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The situation is further complicated by the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, a move attributed to Israel, although it has not been confirmed by Israeli authorities.</p>

<p>Concerns have heightened dramatically, as months of cross-border skirmishes risk devolving into a full-scale conflict between Hezbollah and Israel. The two adversaries last engaged in a devastating war in the summer of 2006, which saw Israel bombing Lebanon's only passenger airport in Beirut.</p>

<p>The intensity of the current situation has led various embassies, including India's, to urge their citizens to leave Lebanon while commercial flights remain available.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has maintained near-daily exchanges of fire with Israeli forces, targeting military positions since its Palestinian ally Hamas initiated an attack on Israel on October 7, triggering the ongoing war in Gaza.</p>

<p>In response to these developments, Antony Blinken convened a conference call with G7 foreign ministers to coordinate diplomatic efforts aimed at de-escalating the situation, the report added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The independent US presidential candidate said he and his friends were on a falconing excursion in New York state when a van ahead of him hit and killed a six-month-old black bear.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robert F Kennedy Jr grossed people out this year with a story about a parasitic worm eating part of his brain. Now he's back with another doozy: about leaving a dead bear cub in New York's Central Park.</p>

<p>The independent US presidential candidate, conspiracy theorist and anti-vaccine activist made the disclosure in a three-minute video posted Sunday on social media as he apparently tried to get out ahead of a New Yorker magazine story that mentions the weird tale of roadkill and stealth from a decade ago.</p>

<p>In the video shot at what looked like a post-meal chat with people including sitcom actress Roseanne Barr, Kennedy recounts the saga:</p>

<p>He and friends were on a falconing excursion in New York state in 2014, Kennedy says, when a van ahead of him hit and killed a six-month-old black bear.</p>

<p>The scion of America's most prominent political family, eager to salvage the corpse for the meat, put it in the back of his own vehicle.</p>

<p>"And you can do that in New York state. You can get a bear tag for roadkill bear," Kennedy, 70, says in a gravelly voice.</p>

<p>But the falconing field trip ran late, so he could not get the remains back to his home in Westchester County.</p>

<p>So did a dinner he attended that evening in the Big Apple, and Kennedy realized he would have to go straight to the airport for a flight he was due to take.</p>

<p>"The bear was in my car, and I didn't want to leave the bear in the car because that would have been bad," he says.</p>

<p>After Kennedy and company brainstormed, they took the carcass to iconic Central Park and left it under an old bicycle Kennedy had in his car.</p>

<p>Kennedy said the plan was to make it look like a cyclist had killed the animal, an admission that drew laughter from people in the video.</p>

<p>"I wasn't drinking, of course, but people were drinking with me who thought this was a good idea," he says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Then I thought, you know, at that time this was the little bit of the redneck in me," the son of the late Robert F. Kennedy adds.</p>

<p>When the animal's body was eventually found it became a huge news story.</p>

<p>"And I was like, 'Oh my God, what did I do?'" Kennedy says, adding: "I was worried because my prints were all over that bike."</p>

<p>He said the story remained dormant for a decade until a fact-checker from The New Yorker called to verify it for a feature on Kennedy. The piece has yet to be published.</p>

<p>"It's going to be a bad story," Kennedy forecasts with a laugh.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer warned far-right protesters on Sunday they would "regret" participating in England's worst rioting in 13 years, as disturbances linked to the murder of three children earlier this week flared across the country.</p>

<p>Masked anti-immigration demonstrators smashed several windows at a hotel that has been used to house asylum seekers in Rotherham, South Yorkshire.</p>

<p>Unrest related to misinformation about the mass stabbing last Monday in the northwestern English seaside town of Southport has hit multiple towns and cities, with anti-immigration demonstrators clashing with police.</p>

<p>The violence is a major challenge for Starmer, elected only a month ago after leading Labour to a landslide win over the Conservatives.</p>

<p>"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder. Whether directly or those whipping up this action online, and then running away themselves," Starmer said in a TV address.</p>

<p>There was "no justification" for what he called "far-right thuggery", he added, promising to bring the perpetrators "to justice".</p>

<h3><strong>Shops looted, burnt</strong></h3>

<p>Footage aired on the BBC showed rioters forcing their way into a Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham. They also pushed a burning bin into the building. It was not clear whether asylum seekers were inside.</p>

<p>Ten officers were injured there, but local police said none of the hotel staff or its clients had been hurt.</p>

<p>In the northeastern English city of Middlesbrough, hundreds of protesters squared up to riot police carrying shields. Some threw bricks, cans and pots at officers.</p>

<p>Protesters there seized a camera from an AFP crew and broke it. The journalists were not injured.</p>

<p>The fresh disturbances came after police said more than 150 people had been arrested since Saturday following skirmishes at far-right rallies in Liverpool, Manchester, Bristol, Blackpool and Hull, as well as Belfast in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>Rioters threw bricks, bottles and flares at police -- injuring several officers -- and looted and burnt shops, while demonstrators shouted anti-Islamic slurs as they clashed with counter-protesters.</p>

<p>The violence is the worst England has seen since summer 2011, when widespread rioting followed the police killing of a mixed-race man in north London.</p>

<p>Christian, Muslim and Jewish religious leaders in Liverpool issued a joint appeal for calm.</p>

<p>"We're now seeing it (trouble) flooding across major cities and towns," said Tiffany Lynch of the Police Federation of England and Wales.</p>

<p>Late Sunday, Staffordshire police said another hotel known to have sheltered asylum seekers was targeted near Birmingham.</p>

<p>"A large group of individuals" have been "throwing projectiles, smashing windows, starting fires and targeting police" at the hotel in the town of Tamworth, with one officer injured, said the statement.</p>

<p>Riots first flared in Southport late Tuesday following Monday's frenzied knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party in the northwest coastal city, before spreading up and down England.</p>

<p>They were fuelled by false rumours on social media about the background of British-born 17-year-old suspect Axel Rudakubana, who is accused of killing a six, seven, and nine-year-old, and injuring another 10 people.</p>

<p>Police have blamed the violence on supporters and associated organisations of the English Defence League, an anti-Islam organisation founded 15 years ago whose supporters have been linked to football hooliganism.</p>

<p>Agitators have targeted at least two mosques, and the UK interior ministry announced Sunday it was offering new emergency security to Islamic places of worship.</p>

<p>The rallies have been advertised on far-right social media channels under the banner "Enough is enough".</p>

<p>Participants have waved English and British flags while chanting slogans like "Stop the boats" -- a reference to irregular migrants crossing the Channel to Britain from France.</p>

<p>Anti-fascist demonstrators have held counter-rallies in many cities, including Leeds where they shouted, "Nazi scum off our streets", as the far-right protesters chanted, "You're not English any more".</p>

<p>Not all the gatherings have turned violent. A peaceful one in Aldershot, southern England, on Sunday saw participants hold placards that read "Stop the invasion" and "We're not far right, we're just right".</p>

<p>"People are fed up with being told you should be ashamed if you're white and working class but I'm proud white working class," 41-year-old Karina, who did not give her surname, told AFP in Nottingham on Saturday.</p>

<p>At last month's election, the Reform UK party led by Brexit cheerleader Nigel Farage captured 14 percent of the vote -- one of the largest vote shares for a far-right British party.</p>

<p>Carla Denyer, co-leader of the left-wing Green party, said the unrest should be "a wake-up call to all politicians who have actively promoted or given in" to anti-immigration rhetoric.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mali is immediately cutting diplomatic ties with Ukraine over comments by a spokesperson for Ukraine's military intelligence agency (GUR) about fighting in its north that killed Malian soldiers and Wagner fighters in late July, it said on Sunday.</p>

<p>Mali's northern Tuareg rebels say they killed at least 84 Russian Wagner mercenaries and 47 Malian soldiers over days of fierce fighting in the north of the West African country in what appears to be Wagner's heaviest defeat since it stepped in two years ago to help Mali's military authorities fight insurgent groups.</p>

<p>GUR spokesperson Andriy Yusov has not confirmed Kyiv's involvement in the fighting, but in comments published on public broadcaster Suspilne's website on Monday, July 29, he said the Malian rebels had received the "necessary" information to conduct the attack.</p>

<p>"The rebels received all the necessary information they needed, and not just the information, which allowed (them) to conduct a successful military operation against Russian perpetrators of war crimes. We certainly won't go into details now - you will see more of this in the future," he said.</p>

<p>Mali said it had learned "with deep shock of the subversive remarks."</p>

<p>It said Yusov had "admitted Ukraine's involvement in a cowardly, treacherous and barbaric attack by armed terrorist groups that resulted in the death of members of the Malian Defence and Security Forces."</p>

<p>"The actions taken by the Ukrainian authorities violate the sovereignty of Mali, go beyond the scope of foreign interference, which is already condemnable in itself, and constitute a clear aggression by Mali and support for international terrorism," the Malian government said.</p>

<p>It also cited comments by Ukraine's ambassador to Senegal, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast and Liberia.</p>

<p>Senegal's foreign minister summoned Ukrainian Ambassador Yurii Pyvovarov on Friday over a video it said the Ukrainian embassy had posted on its Facebook page in which Pyvovarov provided "unequivocal and unqualified support for the terrorist attack" in Mali.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has rejected her Republican rival Donald Trump's offer to shift the presidential debate to the Fox News channel, media reports said on Sunday.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, and President Joe Biden -- who was then in the race to the White House -- agreed in May to participate in two presidential debates. The first was in June, hosted by CNN, and the second - to be hosted by ABC News - was scheduled for September 10.</p>

<p>Biden withdrew from the race last month, following which Vice-President Harris, who is of Indian and African heritage, was declared the 2024 presidential nominee of the ruling Democratic Party after she won enough votes from Democratic delegates in a virtual roll call.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Trump said that he has agreed to an offer from Fox News to hold a debate with Vice President Harris on September 4, shifting from the original plan, CBS News reported.</p>

<p>"I have agreed with FoxNews to debate Kamala Harris on Wednesday, September 4th. The debate was previously scheduled against Sleepy Joe Biden on ABC, but has been terminated in that Biden will no longer be a participant, and I am in litigation against ABC Network and George Slopadopoulos, thereby creating a conflict of interest," he said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Harris took to X to turn down Trump's debate offer on Fox News.</p>

<p>"It's interesting how "any time, any place" becomes "one specific time, one specific safe space." I'll be there on September 10th, like he agreed to. I hope to see him there," Harris said.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign also said it will stick to the original plan for an ABC News debate.</p>

<p>It said that "Donald Trump is running scared" hoping that Fox News will "bail him out" of the debate he had already agreed to with ABC News, according to the report.</p>

<p>"He needs to stop playing games and show up to the debate he already committed to on Sept. 10," the report quoted Michael Tyler, the Harris campaign communication director, as saying.</p>

<p>"The Vice President will be there one way or the other to take the opportunity to speak to a prime-time national audience," Tyler said, adding that the campaign is open to discussing further debates but only after the one both campaigns have already agreed to takes place.</p>

<p>Last month, Harris challenged Trump to a debate, provoking him to say whatever he had "to say to her face".</p>

<p>Harris would face Trump in the general elections on November 5.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

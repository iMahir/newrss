       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar today spoke about 'The India Century' at the NDTV World Summit in New Delhi. During the interaction Mr Jaishankar gave a detailed overview on India's foreign policy and how it is playing an increasingly global role.</p>

<p>Speaking exclusively to NDTV World, Mr Jaishankar discussed the entire gamut of ties - from the US and China to Russia and India's neighbourhood. He even spoke a few lines about Pakistan.</p>

<p>When asked about the Russia relationship, the foreign minister made it absolutely clear that India's relationship with Russia is time-tested and among the most important. Explaining his point he said, "I'll put it to you very simply. If you look at our history with the Soviet Union and subsequently Russia since Independence in 1947, I can say with confidence and knowing that nobody in this room can contradict it, that Russia has never done anything to impact India's interest negatively," adding that in geopolitics, "that is a big statement to make because there are not many major countries in the world for whom such a statement can be made."</p>

<p>He further told NDTV World that "Today, Russia's situation is different and Russia's relationship with the West has broken down. We now have a Russia which is turning much more towards Asia (than Europe and the West), so we must ask ourselves that if Russia is looking more at Asia, should Russia not have multiple options in Asia? And as an Asian country, should we (India) not do in Asia that which is in our national interest?"</p>

<p>"Clearly, Russia as a major natural resources power has a complementarity with India at this stage of development when we are big resource consumers. People talk about Russian oil, but it isn;t just about oil. It could be about fertilizers, metal, coal, etc. So, there is a big economic logic to it as well," Mr Jaishankar added.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar went on to say that besides an economic relationship, there is also a strategic one. He explained that "There is a basic strategic logic - that if you look at the Eurasian landmass, there are 3 big countries (Russia, China and India). It is a one-o-one in international relations, that a country will always maintain the balance in relationship with the country which is your immediate neighbour's neighbour - and do so in very good stead."</p>

<p>"So, there is a strategic logic, there is an economic fit, and the relationship overall has had a very positive history, so that is how it is viewed," Mr Jaishankar reiterated.</p>

<h2><strong>BREAKTHROUGH WITH CHINA</strong></h2>

<p>Mr Jaishankar today added to what India's foreign secretary said earlier in the day about a "positive outcome" emerging from the standoff with China along the Line of Actual Control, saying Indian and Chinese soldiers will be able to resume patrolling in the way they had been doing before the border face-off began in May 2020.</p>

<p>Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri announced India and China have arrived on a patrolling arrangement along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Himalayas, and it can lead to disengagement and resolution of tension.</p>

<p>"We reached an agreement on patrolling, and we have gone back to the 2020 position. With that we can say the disengagement with China has been completed. Details will come out in due course," Mr Jaishankar told NDTV World.</p>

<p>"There are areas which for various reasons after 2020, they blocked us, we blocked them. We have now reached an understanding which will allow patrolling as we had been doing till 2020," Mr Jaishankar explained.</p>

<p>The breakthrough came ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Russia to attend the BRICS summit tomorrow.</p>

<h3><strong>INDIA'S NEIGHBOURHOOD FIRST POLICY</strong></h3>

<p>Speaking about how India's highest priority has always been about fostering good relations with its neighbours, Mr Jaishanakr emphasised that New Delhi has always played a positive and friendly part towards its neighbours.</p>

<p>Citing the examples of Sri Lanka, Bhutan, and even Maldives and Bangladesh, the foreign minister gave examples of how India has always tried to build a neighbourhood of cooperation and camaraderie.</p>

<p>Explaining this, Mr Jaishankar said "Our neighbourhood is democratic which means that political changes will keep on happening. We will often be the subject of their politics. We have to factor in that in our policies. If we can create a record of being a country which is a reliable friend in any trouble, if they understand that there's this country India which is generous, which is large, if we create that record and which I feel we have. During Sri Lanka crisis, we stepped up. Today in Sri Lanka, we have seen a very big change," said S Jaishankar.</p>

<p>"Bhutan had the wisdom to collaborate on electricity. This is a lesson which everyone should learn," he said praising the country.</p>

<h3><strong>THE 'JUSTIN TRUDEAU' PROBLEM</strong></h3>

<p>Speaking about ties with Canada, Mr Jaishankar said the Justin Trudeau government seems to have a problem with Indian diplomats trying to find out about what is happening there in relation to India.</p>

<p>Highlighting the Trudeau government's "double standards" and stressing that saying so is an understatement, Mr Jaishankar said they seem to have different standards for how they behave domestically and how they behave globally.</p>

<p>"Canada has asked us to subject our High Commissioner to a police inquiry and we chose to withdraw our High Commissioner... They seem to have a problem with our diplomats trying to find out about what is happening in Canada which directly pertain to their welfare and security," he said.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the license they give themselves is "totally different from the restrictions they impose on diplomats in Canada," he said. "Canadian diplomats have no problem going around on our military or our police, profiling people, targeting people to be stopped in Canada," he added.</p>

<p>"When we tell them that you have people openly threatening Indian leaders and diplomats, their response is freedom of speech... If you threaten the Indian High Commissioner, he is supposed to accept it as freedom of speech but if an Indian journalist says the Canadian High Commissioner walked out of the South Block looking very grumpy, it is apparently foreign interference," he added.</p>

<h3><strong>VISIT TO PAKISTAN</strong></h3>

<p>Towards the end of his interaction at the NDTV World Summit, Mr Jaishankar spoke a line about Pakistan. "India is a good SCO member. We were very supportive of Pakistan's presidency this year and wanted the proceeding to be smooth. Haath milaya aur aa gaye wapis (shook hands and came back)," he said summing up his visit to Islamabad.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be among the most important drivers of the world economy and geopolitics in times to come, Bharti Group Chairman Sunil Mittal said on Monday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be among the most important drivers of the world economy and geopolitics in times to come, Bharti Group Chairman Sunil Mittal said on Monday but cautioned that the new technology will pose new challenges, including potential for misuse and hence require greater vigilance and guardrails.</p>

<p>Speaking at the NDTV World Summit, the telecom doyen who helms India's second-largest telco Bharti Airtel, cited a personal anecdote on how a senior finance official stationed in Dubai received a fraudulent call that seemed to mimic Mittal's voice and tone and directed a large fund transfer.</p>

<p>The official who was vigilant and "sensible" immediately detected the fraud. Mittal admitted that when he heard the voice recording himself he was "stunned" as "it was perfectly articulated as I would speak".</p>

<p>"And anyone who would not have been vigilant may have done something about it," he said and warned that in the future misuse of technology will enable fraudsters to go a step ahead and use digital signatures, even faces on Zoom calls to perpetrate such acts.</p>

<p>"We'll have to protect our societies from the evils of AI, and yet we have to use the goodness of AI because those companies, and nations that will not adopt AI will be left behind. So this is a conundrum for every time you get a new technology into place, there are pluses and minuses. I remain very optimistic about the benefit of AI that the human race will achieve and be able to do jobs which are otherwise very difficult to perform," Mittal said.</p>

<p>Asked about the use cases he has found for AI in his own business and whether technology has indeed replaced jobs, Mittal asserted that routine, mundane, repetitive jobs are certainly going to be under "straight threat".</p>

<p>"And we are already seeing in our company, that we are making huge efficiency through the adoption of AI, which means reduction of people. But equally, new jobs are coming through," he said.</p>

<p>Elaborating, he said AI is bringing <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ndtv-world-summit-some-jobs-reduced-due-to-ai-but-sunil-bharti-mittal-at-ndtv-world-summit-6837440">changes</a> in call centre and workforce management.</p>

<p>"Just 10 years back, every time a customer had to be onboarded onto a mobile phone, there was a physical form to be filled out. There were runners on scooters and more bikes who would take those forms to a different centre. From there, they would fax it to another place...in 10 years' time, it seems like a joke today.</p>

<p>"Similarly, if you go 10 years forward, some of these repetitive jobs will disappear. But have we suffered on account of the earlier adoption of electronic media? We have not. We've added more jobs in different spaces, different parts," he said.</p>

<p>Mittal said he is hopeful there will be new ideas and new thoughts with the advent of AI, and it will create new businesses and new jobs.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Indian government is "not aware" of any specific threat against Air India and its passengers - made by Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Pannun - External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said Monday evening at the NDTV World Summit.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Indian government is "not aware" of any specific threat against Air India and its passengers, External Affairs Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/s-jaishankar" target="_blank">S Jaishankar</a> said Monday evening at the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ndtv-world-summit-2024-india-century-live-updates-pm-narendra-modi-david-cameron-s-jaishankar-to-speak-6830644" target="_blank">NDTV World Summit</a>.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar's remark came hours after Khalistani terrorist <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/gurpatwant-singh-pannun" target="_blank">Gurpatwant Singh Pannun</a> - whom the United States believes was the subject of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ndtv-explains-gurpatwant-singh-pannun-murder-for-hire-case-ex-spy-vikash-yadav-drug-smuggler-nikhil-gupta-plot-to-kill-khalistani-terrorist-6816220" target="_blank">a murder-for-hire plot involving ex-Indian spy Vikas Yadav</a> - released a video statement online warning people not to fly Air India between November 1 and 19.</p>

<p>The threat follows a worrying flood of bomb threats against Indian passenger jets, including those operated by Air India and Air India Xpress; <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/want-to-put-culprits-on-no-fly-list-aviation-minister-on-hoax-bomb-calls-6837808" target="_blank">over 100 such threats have been made in the past week</a>.</p>

<p>"I am not aware of any specific threat today... but we have seen threats, in the past, to our airlines, to our Parliament, to our diplomats and High Commissions, and our leaders," Mr Jaishankar said.</p>

<p>"And all that is a source of concern..." he said.</p>

<h3><strong>Jaishankar Jabs Canada</strong></h3>

<p>Mr Jaishankar may have sidestepped the question on the threat, but took the opportunity to take more sharp digs at the Canadian government amid a tense diplomatic stand-off over the killing of another Khalistani terrorist - <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/hardeep-nijjar" target="_blank">Hardeep Singh Nijjar</a>, a Canadian citizen - in Vancouver in June last year.</p>

<p>"These threats are cleverly worded... they (the Canadian government) calls this 'freedom of speech'. But my question to them is - if you receive these threats would you take them lightly?"</p>

<p>"If it was your airline being threatened, your Parliament, your diplomats... this is exactly the kind of problem with which we started this conversation," Mr Jaishankar told NDTV.</p>

<p>Earlier in the interview with NDTV's Sanjay Pugalia, he also spoke of 'double standards' in the way Canada treats Indian diplomats and the 'license' their officials allowed themselves while in India.</p>

<p>The Indian government has been fiercely critical of its Canadian counterpart giving space - physical and political - to individuals it considers terrorists with designs against India's sovereignty.</p>

<p>Last week - after Canadian federal police claimed top Indian diplomats in that country were working with organised criminal gangs, such as the Lawrence Bishnoi outfit - Delhi pointed out Ottawa had "consciously provided space to violent extremists and terrorists to harass, threaten and intimidate Indian diplomats". This, Delhi complained, had been "justified in the name of freedom of speech".</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Monday denied meeting former Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif at the recently-concluded Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit in Islamabad.</p>

<p>"I am a good SCO member. We were very supportive and wanted the proceeding to be smooth. <em>Haath milaya aur aa gaye wapis</em> (shook hands and came back)," he said at the NDTV World Summit 2024.</p>

<p>S Jaishankar was referring to a brief interaction with Mr Sharif at an official dinner held for all the summit attendees.&nbsp;The two leaders shook hands and exchanged a courtesy greeting as Mr Sharif welcomed Mr Jaishankar for the official dinner for SCO leaders. Few words were spoken during the interaction that lasted less than twenty seconds.</p>

<p>The Union Minister's Pakistan visit for the&nbsp;first by an Indian minister in nearly ten years. The last visit by an Indian foreign minister was by Sushma Swaraj.</p>

<p>At his speech at the&nbsp;meeting of the Heads of Government, S Jaishankar flagged concerns over terrorism and extremism. In a veiled message to Pakistan, he said that cooperation in areas like trade is unlikely to flourish if cross-border activities are characterised by terrorism.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar also said Indian and Chinese soldiers will be able to resume patrolling in the way they had been doing before the border face-off began in May 2020.&nbsp;His statement came hours after Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri announced India and China have arrived on a patrolling arrangement along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Himalayas, and it can lead to disengagement and resolution of tension.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia has never done anything to impact India's interests negatively, and there is an economic and strategic logic behind New Delhi maintaining strong ties with Moscow, External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar said at the NDTV World Summit today.</p>

<p>During an interaction with NDTV Editor-in-Chief Sanjay Pugalia, the veteran diplomat was asked how India-Russia ties would develop in the coming years.</p>

<p>"The Prime Minister is going to Russia tomorrow, so this is a timely question. If you look at our history with Russia after Independence, Russia has never done anything to impact our interests negatively. Among the major countries, there are not many about who we can say this. Today Russia's situation is different, I think Russia's relationship with the West has broken down, so you have a Russia which is turning much more towards Asia. Should Russia not have multiple options in Asia? Should we not take what is good for us in national interests?"</p>

<p>"And clearly, Russia as a major natural resources power has a complementarity with India at this stage of development where we are big resource consumers. It isn't just Russian oil, it could be fertilisers, metals, coal. There is a whole economic logic to it. There is also a basic strategic logic, if you look at the Eurasian landmass, there are three big countries. You always keep a balance, a relationship," the minister said.</p>

<p>New Delhi's ties with Moscow have been a key geopolitical talking point over the past few years, especially after the Ukraine War began. With the West siding with Ukraine and imposing sanctions on Russia, India's decision to buy Russian oil had come under scrutiny.</p>

<p>India has consistently refused to take sides in the conflict and said it is on the side of peace. This was also reflected in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visits to both Kyiv and Moscow.</p>

<p>Earlier, articulating the Indian position over the decision to procure Russian oil, Dr Jaishankar had said New Delhi has a right to prioritise the interests of its people.</p>

<p>"I understand that there is a conflict situation (in Ukraine). I also understand that Europe has a point of view and Europe will make the choices it will make that is Europe's right. But for Europe to make choices which prioritises its energy needs and then ask India to do something else..," he had said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India has outperformed the US markets and emerging markets are, on average, growing at double the rate of developed economies, ace investor Mark Mobius has said.</p>

<p>In a conversation with investor Ramesh Damani at the NDTV World Summit on Monday, Mr Mobius said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's thrust on digital infrastructure and the opening up of the economy has been key to India's growth.</p>

<p>Mr Mobius, who is the founder of Mobius Capital Partners LLP and is known as the 'Indiana Jones of emerging market investing', said, "I always think of India as the United States of India, because there are different states. It's mind-boggling - you are one nation but you are speaking different languages and even the written languages are different. The first thing he (PM Modi) did was unify the tax system. This is an incredible accomplishment. This is something that probably would have taken a century."</p>

<p>The investor said India's diversity results in incredible creativity and the future belongs to those who are creative.</p>

<p>"I definitely think India is going to become a leader or the leader in semiconductor production in the future. One reason I say that is the demand - you have got a market here that is one of the biggest in the world. Secondly, it is a relatively open economy, so you are going to be able to take technology from Taiwan, China, the United States, wherever. Thirdly, you have got an incredible software industry already, you are the largest exporter of software in the world," Mr Mobius said, adding that many large semiconductor companies already have software bases in India.</p>

<p>The investor said semiconductor fabrication will happen in India because the country has the labour force.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I remember I was meeting an Indian friend of mine a few years ago and I said India will become a big semiconductor manufacturer. He said Indians are not as patient and not so good with small things like the Chinese are and I asked him if he had seen the places where they are polishing these tiny diamonds in India. They will do a very good job here, no questions about it. But it will require a huge amount of capital," he added.</p>

<p>In terms of return on capital, it's "India, China and the US", Mr Mobius said, adding that India still presents plenty of opportunities despite stock prices climbing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the conversation moved to lighter topics, the investor said he likes the 'Baahubali' movies and also had a picture taken with a statue of the villain from the movies in Hyderabad. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian and Chinese soldiers will be able to resume patrolling in the way they had been doing before the border face-off began in May 2020, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said today at the NDTV World Summit.</p>

<p>Earlier today, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri announced India and China have arrived on a patrolling arrangement along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Himalayas, and it can lead to disengagement and resolution of tension.</p>

<p>The breakthrough came ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Russia to attend the BRICS summit tomorrow.</p>

<p>"We reached an agreement on patrolling, and we have gone back to the 2020 position. With that we can say the disengagement with China has been completed. Details will come out in due course," Mr Jaishankar told NDTV Editor-in-Chief Sanjay Pugalia.</p>

<p>"There are areas which for various reasons after 2020, they blocked us, we blocked them. We have now reached an understanding which will allow patrolling as we had been doing till 2020," Mr Jaishankar said.</p>

<p>The External Affairs Minister said the LAC breakthrough is a good development that happened due to "patient and persevering diplomacy".</p>

<p>"... At various points of time people almost gave up. We have always maintained on the one hand we obviously had to do counter deployment, and we have been negotiating since September 2020. It has been a very patient process, though more complicated than how it should have been," Mr Jaishankar told NDTV.</p>

<p>"The important thing is if we have reached an understanding, I think what it does is it creates a basis for peace and tranquillity along the border, which were there before 2020. That was a major concern. If there is no peace and tranquillity, how can other areas of bilateral ties improve?" Mr Jaishankar said.</p>

<p>While he agreed people may speculate on the LAC development, the External Affairs Minister said he would use "caution" in responding on whether this positive development would spread to trade ties.</p>

<p>"It (LAC breakthrough) has just happened. I would not go so fast at the moment," Mr Jaishankar said, referring to trade.</p>

<p>The last meeting of the working mechanism for consultation and coordination on India-China border affairs was held on August 29 in Beijing. The two sides then had a frank, constructive and forward-looking exchange of views on the situation along the LAC to narrow down differences and find early resolution of outstanding issues.</p>

<p>It was agreed that restoration of peace and tranquillity, and respect for the LAC are the essential basis for restoration of normalcy in bilateral relations.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Indian Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi had said the two sides have resolved the "low-hanging fruits" and now need to address difficult situations, adding there was "positive signalling" from the diplomatic side and execution on the ground was dependent on military commanders of the two countries.</p>

<p>Indian and Chinese military commanders too had been meeting regularly seeking complete disengagement in the remaining areas along the LAC in eastern Ladakh as an essential basis for restoration of peace and tranquillity in the India-China border areas.</p>

<p>Some areas still remained to be de-escalated after Indian and Chinese troops withdrew from Gogra-Hot Springs in Ladakh in September 2022. The Chinese forces in this area had returned to pre-2020 positions. Even then, Chinese soldiers were still believed to hold large swathes of Indian territory to the north in the Depsang plains.</p>

<p>Fierce clashes between soldiers of both sides took place in eastern Ladakh's Galwan in June 2020, in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed in action. Over 40 Chinese soldiers were killed or injured.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan approved changes to the constitution on Monday, which included empowering parliament to pick the Supreme Court's chief justice, drawing criticism from opposition parties who said it was an attempt to subvert the judiciary.</p>

<p>Pakistan's top court has become a battleground between the government and jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan, ruling on issues ranging from a controversial national election to a potential military court trial for Khan and his supporters.</p>

<p>The constitutional changes were approved in an extraordinary session of parliament which was assembled on Sunday, a public holiday, and ran all night, concluding close to dawn on Monday.</p>

<p>"The Chief Justice of Pakistan shall be nominated by the Special Parliamentary Committee...from amongst the three most senior Judges of the Supreme Court," the text of amendment bill, which had a host of other procedural changes, read.</p>

<p>Previously, the Supreme Court's second-most senior judge automatically became the chief justice when the top judge retired at age 65.</p>

<p>"It has been settled that parliament is supreme," Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said after his ruling coalition garnered the required two-thirds majority of parliament to amend the constitution for the 26th time since it was passed in 1973.</p>

<p>Pakistani politicians have long complained about judicial overreach into matters of governance, stoking tensions between the judiciary and legislature.</p>

<p>Sharif defended the amendments, saying past verdicts had resulted in the sackings of sitting prime ministers, endorsements of military dictatorships, and the undermining of democracy and parliament.</p>

<p>The current Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa is due to retire this Friday. There had been concern in government circles that senior judges below him and in the high courts had shown leniency to Khan in a number of cases, analysts say.</p>

<p>Former cricket star Khan, 71, has been in jail for over a year. His 2022 removal from office and subsequent clashes with the military have triggered Pakistan's worst political turmoil in decades.</p>

<p>"It is a black day in our constitutional history and for judicial independence," Gohar Ali Khan, chairman of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Canadians seem to have a problem with Indian diplomats trying to find out about what is happening there in relation to India, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar said today at the NDTV World Summit.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canadians seem to have a problem with Indian diplomats trying to find out about what is happening there in relation to India, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar said today at the NDTV World Summit. &nbsp;In an exclusive interview with Editor-in-Chief Sanjay Pugalia, Mr Jaishankar spoke of the different standards -- "double standards is a very mild word for it" -- &nbsp;that seem to exist between how Canada treats other diplomats and the "license' their diplomats allow themselves while in India.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking on the backdrop of the Canada-India political ties that have nosedived following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations about Indian involvement in the murder of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was also a Canadian citizen, Mr Jaishankar attributed it to several reasons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of these, he said, was the changing world order where the western world is still struggling to adjust to developing nations that surged ahead and stand on an equal platform. Besides this 'big picture" reason are conditions that are specific to Canada-India ties.</p>

<p>While the relations are extremely strong in terms of trade or people-to-people connection, politically, things changed just when the two nations have emerged from the shadow of the 1985 bombing of Kanishka, the Air India 182 flight from Montreal. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking of the lowest point of that relationship -- tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomats -- Mr Jaishankar said: "Canada has asked us to subject our High Commissioner to a police inquiry and we chose to withdraw our High Commissioner... They seem to have a problem with our diplomats trying to find out about what is happening in Canada which directly pertain to their welfare and security."</p>

<p>On the other hand, the license they give themselves is "totally different from the restrictions they impose on diplomats in Canada," he said. "Canadian diplomats have no problem going around on our military or our police, profiling people, targeting people to be stopped in Canada," he added.</p>

<p>"When we tell them that you have people openly threatening Indian leaders and diplomats, their response is freedom of speech... If you threaten the Indian High Commissioner, he is supposed to accept it as freedom of speech but if an Indian journalist says the Canadian High Commissioner walked out of the South Block looking very grumpy, it is apparently foreign interference," he added.</p>

<p>Ties between India and Canada -- on a downward spiral since Mr Trudeau's allegations in September last year -- have plummeted after the series of fresh allegations against the Indian envoy.</p>

<p>The Foreign Ministry slammed Ottawa for its allegations against Sanjay Kumar Verma -- one of the country's senior-most diplomats who served in Japan, Sudan, Italy, Turkey, Vietnam and China.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The allegations, India said, were "ludicrous" and deserved to be treated with contempt. New Delhi said it has "no faith in the current Canadian Government's commitment to ensure their security". The ministry had also recalled the diplomats, after which Canada formally expelled them. &nbsp;India reiterated by ordering out six Canadian diplomats. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last week, in a startling admission during a public inquiry, Mr Trudeau had admitted that Canada had no "hard evidentiary proof" in 2023 to support allegations linking Indian government agents to the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar. His claims, Mr Trudeau admitted, were based on intelligence rather than hard evidence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I was briefed on the fact that there was intelligence from Canada, and possibly from Five Eyes allies that made it fairly clear, incredibly clear, that India was involved in this... Agents of the government of India were involved in the killing of a Canadian on Canadian soil," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli forces blew up homes and besieged schools and shelters for displaced people on Monday as they deepened their operations in Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip, residents and medics said.</p>

<p>They also rounded up men and ordered women to leave the camp, they said.</p>

<p>Medics at the Indonesian Hospital told Reuters that Israeli troops marched a school and detained the men before setting the facility ablaze. The fire reached the hospital generators and caused a power outage, they added.</p>

<p>Health officials said they refused orders by the Israeli army, which began a new incursion into the north of the Palestinian territory over two weeks ago, to evacuate the three hospitals in the area or leave the patients unattended.</p>

<p>Troops remained outside the hospital but did not enter, they said. Medics at a second hospital, Kamal Adwan, reported heavy Israeli fire near the hospital at night.</p>

<p>"The army is burning the schools next to the hospital, and no one can enter or leave the hospital," said one nurse at the Indonesian Hospital, who asked not to be named.</p>

<p>Palestinian health officials said 18 people had been killed in Jabalia and eight elsewhere in Gaza in Israeli strikes.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said troops were continuing ground operations across the Gaza Strip. It said in a statement that over the past day, troops had dismantled infrastructure and tunnel shafts of operators and killed fighters in the Jabaliya area. It did not comment on the immediate situation regarding the hospitals and camps.</p>

<p>Israel has intensified its campaigns both in Gaza and Lebanon days after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar raised hopes of an opening for ceasefire talks to end more than a year of conflict.</p>

<p>Israel has vowed to eradicate the Hamas operators who formerly controlled Gaza, but in doing so has laid waste to much of the territory and killed tens of thousands of people. More than 1.9 million people have been left homeless amid a humanitarian crisis.</p>

<p>RUNNING OUT</p>

<p>Hadeel Obeid, a supervisor nurse at the Indonesian hospital, where 32 patients are currently being treated, said they were running out of medical supplies.</p>

<p>"Sterile gauze is going to finish and there are no medications to give them," she told Reuters via a chat app.</p>

<p>Obeid said the water supply has been cut off and there was no food for the fourth consecutive day. She appealed to international organizations to take action to save the wounded.</p>

<p>The United Nations said it had been unable to reach the three hospitals in northern Gaza. It demand access to allow aid into northern Gaza areas.</p>

<p>The UN Human Rights Office said it was "increasingly concerned that the manner in which the Israeli military is conducting hostilities in North Gaza, along with unlawful interference with humanitarian assistance and orders that are leading to forced displacement, may be causing the destruction of the Palestinian population in Gaza's northernmost governate through death and displacement".</p>

<p>Israel says it is getting large quantities of humanitarian supplies into Gaza with land deliveries and airdrops. It also says it has facilitated the evacuation of patients from the Kamal Adwan Hospital.</p>

<p>Palestinians say no aid entered northern Gaza areas where the operation is active.</p>

<p>Residents and medics said Israeli forces had tightened their siege on Jabalia, the largest of the enclave's eight historic refugee camps, which it encircled by sending tanks to the nearby towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya and issuing evacuation orders to residents.</p>

<p>"We are facing death by bombs, by thirst and hunger," said Raed, a resident of Jabalia camp. "Jabalia is being wiped out and there is no witness to the crime, the world is blinding its eyes,"</p>

<p>Israeli officials said evacuation orders were aimed at separating Hamas fighters from civilians and denied there was any systematic plan to clear civilians out of Jabalia or other northern areas. It said forces operating in northern Gaza killed scores of Hamas gunmen and dismantled infrastructure</p>

<p>Hamas accused Israel of carrying out acts of "genocide and ethnic cleansing" against the people of northern Gaza to force them to leave.</p>

<p>The Hamas armed wing said fighters attacked forces there with anti-tank rockets and mortar fire, and detonated already planted bombs against troops inside tanks and stationed in houses.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the enclave, Israeli strikes killed at least five people in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip and four in two separate strikes in Gaza City, medics said.</p>

<p>Sinwar was one of the masterminds of the October 7, 2003, cross-border attack on Israeli communities that killed around 1,200 people, with another 253 taken back to Gaza as hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's subsequent war has devastated Gaza, killing more than 42,500 Palestinians, with another 10,000 uncounted dead thought to lie under the rubble, Gaza health authorities say.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who was accused by Ankara of organising a failed 2016 coup, has died in exile in the United States aged 83, his movement and the Turkish government said Monday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who was accused by Ankara of organising a failed 2016 coup, has died in exile in the United States aged 83, his movement and the Turkish government said Monday.</p>

<p>Gulen, who lived in the United States since 1999, was the bete noire of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan who accused him of heading a "terror organisation".</p>

<p>"Our intelligence sources confirm the death of the leader of the FETO organisation," Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told a press conference, using Turkey's term for Gulen's influential Hizmet movement of schools, businesses and charities.</p>

<p>Turkey's TRT public television said the preacher, who had lived in Pennsylvania for a quarter of a century and was stripped of his Turkish nationality in 2017, died in hospital overnight.</p>

<p>The news was first posted on X by Herkul, Gulen's website which is banned in Turkey, saying he died on "October 20".</p>

<p>"The honourable Fethullah Gulen, who spent every moment of his life serving the blessed religion of Islam and humanity, passed away today," the post said, pledging to share details of his funeral.</p>

<p>Gulen moved to live in the United States in 1999, ostensibly for heath reasons. From there he ran Hizmet, a movement which has a sprawling network of public schools on every continent.</p>

<p>But the organisation has long been blacklisted by the Turkish authorities who refer to it as FETO, the Fethullah Terror Organisation (FETO).</p>

<p>"This organisation has become a threat rarely seen in the history of our nation," Fidan said, accusing its followers of "being used as a weapon against their own country".</p>

<p>And Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said Turkey's fight against the movement would continue, despite Gulen's death.</p>

<p>"The fight against this organisation, which poses a national security problem to our country... will continue," he wrote on X.</p>

<p><strong>Ally turned enemy</strong></p>

<p>Once an ally who helped Erdogan when he became prime minister the early 2000s, Gulen became persona non grata after a 2013 corruption scandal engulfed the Turkish premier's inner circle.</p>

<p>Erdogan blamed Gulen and later began accusing him of terror links, denouncing his Hizmet movement as the "FETO terrorist organisation".</p>

<p>Gulen repeatedly insisted his influential movement was merely a network of charitable and business institutions.</p>

<p>Things worsened in 2016 when Erdogan blamed him for masterminding a botched coup, triggering a massive crackdown.</p>

<p>During that purge, some 700,000 people were prosecuted and some 3,000 Gulen followers were jailed for life for what the authorities said was involvement in the putsch.</p>

<p>Another 125,000 people were sacked from public institutions, including 24,000 soldiers and thousands of judges with the authorities shuttering private educational establishments, media outlets and publishing houses.</p>

<p>Turkey still regularly rounds up Gulen followers at home and demands their extradition from countries where his network is active.</p>

<p>Turkish security sources quoted by the private NTV broadcaster, said very few people were expected to attend Gulen's funeral and that his body would likely be buried in the US at a location which would be kept secret.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India's growth in the manufacturing, healthcare and services sectors over the last decade has made it a force to reckon with. The next thing the country aims for is to become a beacon of sustainable growth. How does India plan to accomplish this goal? At the 2024 NDTV World Summit session titled "Disrupting Indian Industry for Good", the country's top industry leaders -- Baba Kalyani, Chairperson of Bharat Forge; Sunita Reddy, Managing Director of Apollo Hospitals Group; and Ajay Shriram, Chairperson and Managing Director of DCM Shriram Ltd -- explained what needs to be done and how.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/na-chain-na-araam-pm-modi-at-ndtv-world-summit-on-hard-work-6836565#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll_Imagetopscroll">Prime Minister Narendra Modi</a> delivered the keynote address at <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ndtv-world-summit-2024-india-century-live-updates-pm-narendra-modi-david-cameron-s-jaishankar-to-speak-6830644">NDTV World Summit</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Manufacturing: "Made in India" for India and the World</strong></p>

<p>Baba Kalyani underlined the significance of the manufacturing sector in achieving India's Viksit Bharat objectives outlined by the government. According to Mr Kalyani, "Without manufacturing, India cannot achieve its goals." Bharat Forge, which has been exporting critical components to major global automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) for over two decades, is proof of India's industrial potential.</p>

<p>The future of manufacturing, Mr Kalyani said, lies in the adoption of new technologies, particularly artificial intelligence (AI), to enhance productivity, efficiency and quality. "AI will make an ordinary worker extraordinary, as access to knowledge will be immediate," he said, adding how AI can assist in technical problem-solving, optimise management processes and usher in new industries.</p>

<p><strong>Healthcare Innovation: Engineering Affordable Medical Solutions</strong></p>

<p>Sunita Reddy shared Apollo Hospitals' vision for bringing healthcare and technology together to revolutionise medical device manufacturing. Ms Reddy said India had the potential to engineer medical devices at one-tenth the cost, making healthcare more affordable for millions.</p>

<p>"Our next journey is to combine technology and healthcare to touch 500 million lives using AI, chatbots and drones to deliver medical supplies across India," Ms Reddy said. She also spoke about the importance of research, saying India currently spends just 0.7 per cent of its GDP on research, adding a greater investment is critical, given the country faces increasing cases of heart disease, stroke, and cancer. "AI technology can help save trillions of dollars in healthcare costs," she concluded.</p>

<p><strong>Innovation in Agriculture: Disruption through Technology</strong></p>

<p>Ajay Shriram enumerated how innovation was transforming India's agriculture sector. He praised the government's efforts in implementing the JAM (Jan Dhan, Aadhaar, and Mobile) Trinity, connecting farmers to essential services and innovations in real time.</p>

<p>Mr Shriram also discussed the role of technology transfer in modernising agriculture and the rise of e-commerce, making agricultural products more accessible. "Disruptions are happening in all aspects of the medical and agriculture industries," Mr Shriram noted.</p>

<p><strong>Defence Technology: Courage and Complexity</strong></p>

<p>Baba Kalyani discussed India's strides in defence, a field that demands both passion and perseverance. "Ten years ago, we never dreamt of exporting artillery guns, and today, we have the largest capacity to do so," he said. Mr Kalyani explained the importance of intellectual capability and the need to produce superior products.</p>

<p><strong>Green Fuel and Sustainability</strong></p>

<p>On sustainability, Ajay Shriram discussed the government's push for ethanol blending to reduce India's fuel import bill. He explained the blending target has been raised to 20 per cent, highlighting how green fuel initiatives align with India's broader sustainability goals.</p>

<p>The panellists were unanimous in their optimism about India's industrial future. With continued innovation, a focus on technology, and strong government support, India is poised to become a global leader in manufacturing, healthcare, agriculture and defence technology. As Baba Kalyani confidently said, "India will make it happen."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Global South trusts India's leadership and Prime Minister Narendra Modi can sort out issues between Russia and Ukraine, Bhutan Prime Minister Dasho Tshering Tobgay said at NDTV World Summit today. "The world needs India and I am very happy that you have identified this century as India's century," he said, referring to the theme of the NDTV summit.</p>

<p>"India has the largest population in the world, it has a booming economy. It has crossed 3 trillion US dollars, it should have crossed 5 trillion US dollars had it not been for Covid. India has almost 35 million people in the diaspora. By every measure, this is India's century. But in one measure, you stand out: leadership, and trust in that leadership. Not just Indians trusting India's leadership, but the Global South trusting India's leadership," he said.</p>

<p>"The Global South looks to India for leadership. As a matter of fact, if there is any country that can sort out today's problems, it is India. For economic problems, the world looks to India as a market, during the Covid pandemic, the world looked to India for vaccines and medicines. Even Russia and Ukraine, if there is any person who can sort it out, I do believe, it is Prime Minister Modi," the Bhutan Prime Minister said.</p>

<p>Earlier, responding to a question on how his years as a student in the US had moulded him, he said, "The better question would be how India moulded me to serve my country. I was born in India in 1965 in Kalimpong, West Bengal where my parents were serving. I studied for 11 years in India. Many other Bhutanese studied in India in those days because we did not have enough schools in Bhutan. We grew up under the parentage of Indian teachers and I do believe, they taught us well because we have been able to go back home and serve our king, our country and our people."</p>

<p>Praising India's fight against climate change, the Bhutan Prime Minister said, "India is being a role model for the world, 1.5 billion people, you need energy to fuel that growth. But India is not shirking its responsibility to fight climate change."</p>

<p>Speaking on Bhutan's Gross National Happiness, he said Gross National Happiness is a development philosophy that emphasises the happiness and well-being of our people as the core purpose of growth. "Gross National Happiness recognises that economic growth is important, but that growth must be balanced with social progress, environmental sustainability, cultural preservation and good governance," he said.</p>

<p>Saying that the Bhutan government measures Gross National Happiness every five years, he said, "The purpose is not to measure the happiness of the people. It is to measure the Gross National Happiness situation of the country as how people perceive it to be. Nine domains are divided into 33 variables and 150 questions and this questionnaire is rolled out. That index has been increasing slightly, indicating that the country's Gross National Happiness is rising. But that does not mean we are the happiest people in the world."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra were students at Stanford University, California, studying Computer Sciences when they dropped out of college and chose to build a ten-minute-delivery startup which is now valued at $5 billion.<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ndtv-world-summit-2024-india-century-live-updates-pm-narendra-modi-david-cameron-s-jaishankar-to-speak-6830644"> At the NDTV World Summit</a>, Mr Palicha shared how Zepto was built and how his parents reacted to the decision to leave college.</p>

<p>"On the outside, it looks like a very cliched Silicon Valley story, you drop out of college to start a company, but before we took that step, Kaivalya and I were tinkering around for a year and as kids we love coding and we used to build small projects for fun. We were supposed to go to California but during the first wave of Covid, we were in Mumbai. I didn't see a value in online education in that period, so we took a call to take a year off and build something interesting," Mr Palicha said.</p>

<p>"Most of our peers at Stanford were doing their internship at Google, and Goldman Sachs, we didn't have anything of that lined up and we took a call to start experimenting," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To a question on how he came up with the idea of quick delivery, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/19-year-old-stanford-dropout-s-100-billion-dream-631193">the Zepto CEO</a> said, "We were sitting in sher-e-punjab in Andheri East in Mumbai, and during the pandemic, you couldn't get groceries delivered. Offline options were mostly shut and online would take seven days. We started with a WhatsApp group and over a year we kept talking to customers and tweaking the model."</p>

<p>"We started building out the first version of Zepto a year after the WhatsApp group and got to a meaningful scale before we decided to drop out," he said.</p>

<p><strong>How Parents Reacted</strong></p>

<p>"It was shocking for parents. I remember Kaivalya's mother burst into tears and said what have you done to my son, you have brainwashed him...but we had real numbers to bank on. At that time we were doing a few million dollars in revenue and we were growing fast...We had the substance to decide with conviction...Our fathers were a little bit comfortable with it because they saw the numbers," he said, adding, "Kaivalya's mother often says what a beautiful life you have given up on."</p>

<p>Zepto competes in India's hyper-competitive grocery delivery space. Rivals in the market include e-commerce giant Amazon's India unit and homegrown competitors such as Swiggy Instamart, Blinkit, and conglomerate Tata Group's BigBasket.</p>

<p>This year, Aadit and Kaivalya were featured on the list of richest Indians released by Hurun. Twenty-one-year-old Kaivalya Vohra has a net worth of Rs 3,600 crore, while Aadit, 22, has a net worth of Rs 4,300 crore.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A CNN political correspondent struggled to hold back his laughter after former US President Donald Trump shared an awkward anecdote about golf legend Arnold Palmer at a Make America Great Again rally in Pittsburgh.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Arnold Palmer was all man. And I say that with all due respect to women. And I love women. But this guy, this guy. This is a guy that was all man,” Donald Trump told the crowd in Pennsylvania on Saturday.</p>

<p>Trump then spent 12 minutes praising Palmer and recounting how fellow golfers were left in awe after showering with the Latrobe native. “When he took showers with the other pros, they came out of there. They said, ‘Oh my God! That's unbelievable.'"</p>

<p>CNN's Steve Contorno, reporting on the event, struggled to keep a straight face while covering the unusual story live. “I'm not making this up,” Contorno said, as he recapped Trump's unexpected remarks.</p>

<p>“Trump's campaign is telling us that tonight's appearance is the beginning of his closing argument to voters for the upcoming election,” Contorno said. “And that closing argument began rather... interestingly.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trying to hold back laughter, he went on, “He started with a long-winded story about Latrobe, Pennsylvania native Arnold Palmer, including – and I'm not making this up – a description of the Hall of Fame golfer in the men's room, in the locker room, and what he looked like in the shower!”</p>

A CNN reporter struggled to maintain his composure while covering Trump's rally in Pennsylvania after the former president shared an eyebrow-raising anecdote about golf legend Arnold Palmer.<br />

<p>The reporter's attempt to swiftly move on from the anecdote was evident. He transitioned to more typical rally talking points.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During his campaign in Pennsylvania, the Republican presidential nominee further shocked his audience with a series of crude and vulgar comments aimed at his Democratic counterpart Kamala Harris.&nbsp;“Such a horrible four years,” Trump said, referring to the Biden-Harris administration.</p>

<p>Despite the unusual tone of the rally, Trump's team stressed that the event was meant to mark the start of his final push to win over voters in the key swing state before the election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A GE Aerospace manufacturing facility in Pune will soon begin making the F414 jet engine - which powers some of the most advanced fighter planes in the world, including the Boeing F/A 18E/F Super Hornet, GE Aerospace South Asia CEO said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A GE Aerospace manufacturing facility in Pune will soon begin making the F414 jet engine,&nbsp;Vikram Rai, chief executive of GE Aerospace South Asia, said at the NDTV World Summit on Monday, as he hailed the country's aerospace industry as the "flagbearer of India's manufacturing push".</p>

<p>The F414 engine powers some of the most advanced fighter planes in the world, including the Boeing F/A 18E/F Super Hornet, and will be the heart of the Indian Air Forces' next generation of indigenous combat aircraft.</p>

<p>Speaking at the NDTV World Summit Mr Rai also highlighted India's potential in the civil aviation space, pointing to two mega orders in June last year, when Air India and IndiGo ordered 970 Airbus and Boeing aircraft between them alone.</p>

<p>"India has approximately 800 passenger aircraft... and about 1,500 (including the Air India and IndiGo order books) are expected to be delivered over the next decade. I believe this is just the tip of the iceberg and India will continue with exponential growth over the coming years," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Rai referred to statements by Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier today.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi, delivering the inaugural address, said eight new airports had begun operating in the 125 days of the Bharatiya Janata Party's third term (which began in June) alone.</p>

<p>The Indian middle class is flying more, Mr Rai said, because of the Modi government's "business-friendly" policies. "In a world full of chaos, the 'India story' is being talked about," he said.</p>

<p>"India has a middle class of about 400 million... the United State's total population is about 300 million. The US has about 7,800 aircraft... India has about 800 and .02 seats per capita..."</p>

<p>"But India is fast catching up to China, which has 0.7 seats per capita and the US, which as four seats per capita," the GE Aerospace head said, emphasising growth potential in the Indian aviation space.</p>

<p>"Less than five per cent of India's population has been on an aircraft... and about 85 per cent of all domestic air traffic is between metro cities. There is a huge runway for growth..." he said.</p>

<p>The scale of demand, he also said, underlines the importance of a sustainable industry, including the use of environmentally friendly technology. "We, at GE Aerospace have built new engines... these are 10 to 15 per cent more fuel efficient and register lower emission levels."</p>

<p>Mr Rai also said GE is currently working on an engine that will be 20 per cent more efficient and, as part of its manufacturing and R&amp;D plans, will also invest millions of dollars in the Pune factory.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[About 1,500 North Korean special forces soldiers are already in Russia acclimatising, likely to head to the front lines soon, South Korea's spy agency said Friday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korea summoned the Russian ambassador to Seoul Monday to criticise Pyongyang's decision to send thousands of soldiers to support Moscow's war in Ukraine, the foreign ministry said, calling for their immediate withdrawal. About 1,500 North Korean special forces soldiers are already in Russia acclimatising, likely to head to the front lines soon, Seoul's spy agency said Friday, with additional troops set to depart soon, Pyongyang's first such deployment overseas.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/russia-ukraine-war-north-korean-soldiers-at-russian-training-ground-amid-ukraine-war-6830251" target="_blank">South Korea</a>, which has long claimed the nuclear-armed North is supplying Russia with weaponry for use in Ukraine, has expressed alarm over the deployment, which comes after Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a military deal in June.</p>

<p>Vice foreign minister Kim Hong-kyun expressed Seoul's "grave concerns regarding North Korea's recent dispatch of troops to Russia and strongly urged the immediate withdrawal of North Korean forces and the cessation of related cooperation," the ministry said in a statement.</p>

<p>Kim told the Russian ambassador to South Korea, Georgiy Zinoviev, that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/north-korea-troop-deployment-locks-in-russia-military-alliance-6824976">North Korea supplying Russia with weaponry</a> and troops for the war in Ukraine "poses a significant security threat not only to South Korea but to the international community."</p>

<p>He also "emphasised that such actions violate multiple UN Security Council resolutions and the UN Charter."</p>

<h3><strong>North Koreans in Ukraine?</strong></h3>

<p>On Friday, Seoul's National Intelligence Service (NIS) released detailed satellite images it said showed the first deployment of elite North Korean soldiers being moved by Russian military vessels to Vladivostok.</p>

<p>Seoul's spy agency said that between October 8 and 13, "North Korea transported its special forces to Russia via a Russian Navy transport ship, confirming the start of North Korea's military participation" in Moscow's war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>The first contingent of troops -- which South Korean media said were from an elite unit under North Korea's Special Operations Forces, also known as the "Storm Corps" -- are currently stationed in military bases across Russia's Far East.</p>

<p>The special forces "are expected to be deployed to the front lines (of the Ukraine conflict) as soon as they complete acclimatisation training," according to the NIS.</p>

<p>The NIS also said Friday that the North had "provided Russia with more than 13,000 containers' worth of artillery shells, missiles, anti-tank rockets and other lethal weapons" since last August.</p>

<p>Pyongyang and Moscow have been allies since North Korea's founding after World War II, and have drawn even closer since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>Last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky flagged intelligence reports saying North Korea was training 10,000 soldiers to support Russia in its fight against Kyiv and said Moscow was relying on the North to make up for its substantial losses.</p>

<p>Ukrainian media reported earlier this month that six North Korean military officers were killed in a Ukrainian missile attack on Russian-occupied territory near Donetsk -- which South Korea's defence minister said at the time was "highly likely" to be true.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Nobel laureate Professor Paul Romer said it is very hard to tell who will win the upcoming US Presidential elections, calling it a "sign of profound distress.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hailing India's Aadhaar initiative,&nbsp;Nobel laureate Professor Paul Romer&nbsp;on Monday said technology was used to give citizens an existence and further access to schemes. The United States, though saw the rise of the Silicon Valley, failed to use technology to improve lives in the US, he said.</p>

<p>"Aadhaar made people real by giving them a number. And many schemes have been built on that. This is because India decided to use technology to benefit everyone. And unlike in the US, life expectancy has not started falling in India," he said at the NDTV World Summit.</p>

<p>The 2018 Nobel Prize for Economics recipient said India needs to take advantage of its potential, adding that assembling land parcels is key to growth. "India should think about entirely new cities. One can emulate the example of Singapore," Mr Romer said.</p>

<p>The former chief economist at World Bank also said it is very hard to tell who will win the upcoming US Presidential elections, calling it a "sign of profound distress.</p>

<p>Mr Romer said the choice in America is between a former prosecutor and a "habitual criminal", in a reference to Kamala Harris and Donald Trump respectively. Calling the situation in the US "very bad", he also said that governments only get legitimacy when they deliver.</p>

<p>Urging India to choose sides, Mr Romer said both China and Russia want to function as empires, in a bid to increase influence. "India should be able to say we don't like empires. India's stand could decisively tip the balance," he said.</p>

<p>In a lighter vein, Mr Romer, who had taught former British PM Rishi Sunak at Stanford University, said professional commitments did not allow him to comment on whether Conservative leader was a good student.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Addressing the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://special.ndtv.com/ndtv-world-summit-2024-167/#pfrom=home-ndtvworld_world%20site">NDTV World Summit 2024</a>, Sunil Bharti Mittal, Founder and Chairperson of Bharti Enterprises, explained how the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) will impact everything from global economies to geopolitics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"AI will be one of the most important drivers of economy, politics, and geopolitics. But there will be misuse as well, and we will need to be more vigilant," Mr Mittal said. "Nation states will have to come up with guardrails. One will have to be vigilant, society will have to be protected from the evils of AI. I remain very optimistic of the various use of AI."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Mittal said that while some jobs are being reduced due to AI, new opportunities are emerging.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Routine, mundane, repetitive jobs will be under huge threat. Remain hopeful that new ideas will come through that will lead to new jobs. We will be serving the world right from India. AI allows us to do that and our frugal innovations are going to serve the world," Mr Mittal said at the NDTV World Summit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the state of India's digital infrastructure, Mr Mittal said that the country's mobile networks are "significantly superior" to those in the US, UK, and Europe, although still lagging behind Japan and Singapore.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Mittal was conferred an Honorary Knighthood (KBE) by King Charles III this year, adding to his list of accolades, including the Padma Bhushan in 2007 and his leadership roles at the B20 India Action Council and the International Telecommunication Union.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On June 27 Americans will tune in to the first debate of the 2024 US election -- a highly anticipated showdown between President Joe Biden and his predecessor Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The televised face-off comes just four months ahead of the November vote, with the candidates running neck and neck in the polls, each vying for a second term.</p>

<p>Here are some of the major biographical details to know about Biden, a Democrat and Washington veteran, ahead of Thursday's big event.</p>

<p><strong>- Political experience -</strong></p>

<p>Mr Biden is no stranger to Washington. The 81-year-old longtime politician served as vice president under Barack Obama from 2009 to 2017.</p>

<p>Before that, he spent 36 years in the Senate. He was first elected by Delaware voters at age 29, making him one of the youngest senators ever.</p>

<p><strong>- Family and religion -</strong></p>

<p>Mr Biden was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania in 1942 and is the eldest of four children. The Democrat often alludes to his Irish-American, middle-class upbringing.</p>

<p>His father worked a number of different jobs, and while his family was not poor, they did experience financial setbacks.</p>

<p>On the religion front, Mr Biden is a devout Catholic who attends mass regularly, but he nonetheless supports abortion rights.</p>

<p>A family man, Mr Biden has been quick to proclaim his love and support for his son Hunter, who was recently convicted on charges stemming from his purchase of a handgun while addicted to crack cocaine.</p>

<p>The president is sometimes referred to as the "mourner-in-chief" for appearing empathetic with constituents during times of tragedy.</p>

<p>His own life has been marked by multiple sorrows. He lost his first wife Neilia and their young daughter Naomi in a car accident in 1972. Hunter along with Mr Biden's other son Beau were also injured in that accident.</p>

<p>Beau then died of cancer in 2015.</p>

<p>Mr Biden has been married to First Lady Jill Biden since 1977. In addition to raising Beau and Hunter, the couple has a daughter, Ashley.</p>

<p><strong>- Wealth -</strong></p>

<p>While Mr Biden is not a billionaire like his Republican rival Trump, he is still rich.</p>

<p>Biden's fortunes are estimated at around $10 million, largely thanks to two homes the family owns in Delaware, according to Forbes magazine.</p>

<p><strong>- Vibe -</strong></p>

<p>Mr Biden is not a profound orator nor does he draw an ecstatic response from his supporters like Trump. Yet he is known for a certain stubborn determination, and cultivates an image of empathy.</p>

<p>The latter trait has recently been tainted, however, by US support for Israel in the war in Gaza, particularly among younger and Arab-Americans.</p>

<p>Mr Biden's advanced years and his increasingly stiff gait have played into Republican taunting and public concern about his age.</p>

<p><strong>- Legal woes -</strong></p>

<p>Mr Biden was cleared early this year of any wrongdoing after keeping classified documents at his home in Wilmington, Delaware.</p>

<p>However in a shock for his campaign, a report from the special counsel overseeing the matter said Biden came across as a "well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory," a line that Democrats dismissed but Republicans pounced on.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[There will be no studio audience, depriving candidates of the momentum that comes from ginning up supporters. Microphones will cut out when a candidate's speaking time is over. Thursday night's presidential debate will not be business as usual.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There will be no studio audience, depriving candidates of the momentum that comes from ginning up supporters. Microphones will cut out when a candidate's speaking time is over. Thursday night's presidential debate will not be business as usual.</p>

<p>CNN, which is hosting President Joe Biden and his predecessor Donald Trump for their first debate of the 2024 campaign in Atlanta, wants to avoid the chaos seen when the two men squared off in 2020.</p>

<p>Here are some facts about the 90-minute debate, a key moment in the race for the White House, but one whose impact is difficult to predict.</p>

<p><strong>Averting mayhem</strong></p>

<p>In their first war of words four years ago, Trump repeatedly cut off the veteran Democrat, launched into lengthy diatribes and taunted his rival, who ended up shouting at one point: "Will you shut up, man?"&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was hardly the height of presidential decorum.</p>

<p>To cut down on the hijinks, CNN has set up a series of rules, to which both campaigns agreed.</p>

<p>Among the most notable: When the candidates take the stage at the network's Atlanta studios at 9:00 pm (0100 GMT Friday), there will be no one in the audience.</p>

<p>Microphones will be muted except for the candidate asked to speak. There will be two commercial breaks during the showdown between 78-year-old Trump and 81-year-old Biden, the two oldest presumptive White House nominees in history.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moderators Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, both regular CNN on-air presenters, will "use all tools at their disposal to enforce timing and ensure a civilized discussion," the network said.</p>

<p><strong>Trump gets last word</strong></p>

<p>Biden won the coin toss, allowing him to choose either his podium position or whether he preferred to speak first or second in final statements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The incumbent chose the podium on the viewers' right, and Trump opted to have the last word.</p>

<p><strong>No live fact-checking</strong></p>

<p>CNN has not revealed the debate themes, and does not plan to fact-check candidate statements in real time -- even if Trump repeats the baseless charge that the 2020 election was stolen from him.</p>

<p>For Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania, "one problem with a debate that features Donald Trump is that the moderators don't fact check in real time, nor should they."</p>

<p>"It's highly risky to try to do that and it would be disruptive of the debate if they did," she told AFP. "The danger is instead of informing, a debate could actually increase the amount of inaccurate knowledge."</p>

<p>Biden and Trump will not have teleprompters and they cannot bring pre-written notes to the stage, although they will be provided with paper and pen. Consulting with campaign staff during commercial breaks will not be allowed.</p>

<p><strong>Debate airs on all networks</strong></p>

<p>Both candidates rejected the oversight of the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates formed in 1987 to manage such events.</p>

<p>Instead, they made a direct deal with CNN. The news network, now owned by media conglomerate Warner Bros Discovery, afforded its rivals the opportunity to broadcast the debate live in the name of public service, under certain conditions.</p>

<p>The screen must bear the CNN logo and outside commentary is forbidden.</p>

<p>Fox News -- which regularly attacks CNN as biased against Trump -- plans to hit the airwaves two hours before the event, with talk show hosts Jesse Watters and Sean Hannity providing pre-game insights.</p>

<p>In the past, Hannity has called Tapper a "radical left-wing partisan talk show host masquerading as a journalist."&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Impact on campaign?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The debate will certainly be a key moment in the campaign, watched by tens of millions: a record 84 million tuned in to watch Trump's first battle with Hillary Clinton in 2016, and 73 million saw Trump and Biden duke it out in 2020.</p>

<p>But it will not necessarily be a game-changer.</p>

<p>This is the first time a debate has been organized so early in the race, more than four months before Election Day, and even before the candidates have been formally nominated by their respective parties.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The worry is that the public in the United States doesn't pay much attention to news in summer," said Jamieson.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In general, presidential debates don't affect a sufficient number of votes to decide the outcome of an election. But when an election is close, as this one may be, debates can play an important role."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maldives police have arrested two serving ministers for allegedly performing black magic on President Mohamed Muizzu, local media reported on Thursday.</p>

<p>Shamnaz Saleem, who was a state minister at the Environment Ministry, her ex-husband Adam Rameez, who was serving as a minister at the President's Office, and two others were arrested, local media said quoting the police, which, however, declined to share any information about the reasons or the alleged performance of black magic.</p>

<p>"Shamnaz, alongside two other individuals, was arrested on Sunday. All three of them have been remanded in custody for seven days. She was suspended from her post on Wednesday as per the Environment Ministry," news portal Sun.mv reported, adding, Rameez too has been suspended on Thursday.</p>

<p>Incidentally, both Shamnaz and Rameez have worked with Muizzu as members of the Male City Council when he was serving as the city's mayor.</p>

<p>Media reported that after Muizzu assumed office as the President in November last year, Shamnaz was appointed as a state minister first at Muliaage, the official residence of the president and then transferred to the Environment Ministry.</p>

<p>"Rameez, during his time at Male City Council, was known as a close aide of Muizzu, who was the mayor at that time," Sun.mv said further and added, "However, he has been absent from the public light in the past five months or so." Neither the Maldives government nor the President's office has made any official comment on the issue.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US voters see Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as the better candidate for the economy but prefer his Democratic rival President Joe Biden's approach on preserving democracy, a new Reuters/Ipsos poll found.</p>

<p>The three-day poll that concluded on Sunday showed that less than five months before the Nov. 5 election, the electorate is divided on the candidates' approach on the issues that respondents view as the top two problems facing the nation.</p>

<p>Biden's approval rating, measured across all respondents in the poll, rose marginally to 37% from 36% in May when it tied the lowest reading of his presidency. Many Democrats worry Biden could be stung by voter concerns over his age - at 81 he's the oldest U.S. president to hold the office - and disapproval within his party of his support of Israel's war against Hamas.</p>

<p>When asked which of the two candidates had a better approach for the economy - the No. 1 concern for respondents - registered voters picked Trump 43% to 37%. Voters have been stung by several years of fast-rising consumer prices, though inflation has slowed considerably in recent months and the jobless rate has been below 4% for more than two years.</p>

<p>The Republican had a more significant edge - 44% to 31% - on immigration. Immigrants made up 13.9% of the country in 2022, the highest share in over a century. Trump has taken aim at immigrants in the country illegally. Trump was favored 40% to 35% on foreign conflicts and terrorism.</p>

<p>But Biden had the edge over Trump on responding to political extremism and threats to democracy, respondents' No. 2 concern, with registered voters picking the Democrat over Trump by 39% to 33%.</p>

<p>Trump, who was convicted last month on criminal charges he falsified business records, is awaiting three more criminal trials, two of which are tied to his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden. Trump, who falsely claims his 2020 election defeat resulted from fraud, included the claim in a fiery speech shortly before hundreds of his supporters rushed into the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.</p>

<p>Biden also had an edge over Trump on healthcare policy - 40% to 29%. Biden was vice president in 2010 when then-President Barack Obama pushed a landmark health reform through Congress that dramatically increased access to health insurance.</p>

<p>Previous Reuters/Ipsos polls have shown Biden and Trump neck-and-neck in the presidential race, though a number of polls in battleground states have shown Trump ahead in recent months.</p>

<p>The Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted nationwide and online, collected responses from 1,019 U.S. adults, including 856 registered voters. It had a margin of error of 3.2 percentage points for all respondents and 3.5 percentage points for registered voters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US investigative authority sharply rebuked Boeing for sharing details about an ongoing probe of a near-catastrophic aviation incident that were not supposed to be discussed publicly.</p>

<p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said that as a result, it will block Boeing from reviewing information gathered in its investigation.</p>

<p>Boeing "blatantly violated" investigative regulations under a signed agreement as a party to the probe, NTSB said in a statement late Wednesday.</p>

<p>The agency is also barring Boeing from asking questions of other participants at a two-day investigative hearing on the case which the NTSB will hold in early August in Washington.</p>

<p>The investigation concerns a January 5 Alaska Airlines flight on a Boeing 737 MAX that made an emergency landing after a fuselage panel blew out mid-flight.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Boeing invited news media to a tour and briefings on its efforts to improve quality control. An AFP reporter attended the gathering, which was held on Tuesday under an agreement to embargo information until Thursday morning.</p>

<p>But NTSB said Boeing disregarded the agreement "by providing non-public investigative information to the media and speculating about possible causes of the Jan. 5 door-plug blowout."</p>

<p>"As a party to many NTSB investigations over the past decades, few entities know the rules better than Boeing," the NTSB said.</p>

<p>Under the party agreement Boeing signed with the NTSB, the company is supposed to refer all comment on the Alaska Airlines probe to the agency.</p>

<p>Boeing apologized to the NTSB, saying it "stands ready to answer any questions as the agency continues its investigation," according to a company statement.</p>

<p>"We conducted an in-depth briefing on our safety &amp; quality plan and shared context on the lessons we have learned from the January 5 accident," Boeing said.</p>

<p>"We deeply regret that some of our comments, intended to make clear our responsibility in the accident and explain the actions we are taking, overstepped the NTSB's role as the source of investigative information."</p>

<p><strong>What went wrong</strong></p>

<p>In a preliminary announcement in February, NTSB officials said four bolts securing the door plug were missing. Part of the NTSB probe centers on what went wrong.</p>

<p>The NTSB has taken issue with comments from Elizabeth Lund, senior vice president for quality at Boeing.</p>

<p>During a session with reporters, Lund discussed aspects surrounding work on the door plug.</p>

<p>She also said Boeing was focused on closing a "gap" over the lack of documentation and that determining who did the work "is the responsibility of the NTSB and that investigation is still going on."</p>

<p>NTSB responded that "in the briefing, Boeing portrayed the NTSB investigation as a search to locate the individual responsible for the door plug work."</p>

<p>"The NTSB is instead focused on the probable cause of the accident, not placing blame on any individual or assessing liability," the agency said.</p>

<p>The NTSB said it was also "coordinating" with the Department of Justice, which plans to soon announce next steps after concluding that Boeing could be prosecuted for violating a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement over two fatal MAX crashes.</p>

<p>The NTSB will provide DOJ "details about Boeing's recent unauthorized investigative information releases in the 737 MAX 9 door plug investigation," the NTSB said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US President Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump will meet on a debate stage on Thursday for the first of two televised face-offs that could prove critical in their tight rematch race to win the White House in November.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump will meet on a debate stage on Thursday for the first of two televised face-offs that could prove critical in their tight rematch race to win the White House in November.</p>

<p>Here is what you need to know:</p>

<h2><strong>WHEN AND WHERE ARE THE DEBATES?</strong></h2>

<p>The first debate will air at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday (0100 GMT on Friday) on CNN and be broadcast from an Atlanta studio without a live audience.</p>

<p>It can also be viewed on CNN affiliates, without a cable login on CNN.com and is available for simulcast on other U.S. channels.</p>

<p>More than four months ahead of the Nov. 5 vote, the CNN debate will be the earliest presidential debate in modern U.S. history.</p>

<p>Television news channel ABC said it will host the second presidential debate on Sept. 10, also from an audience-free studio.</p>

<h2><strong>WHO WILL MODERATE THE DEBATES?</strong></h2>

<p>Anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash will moderate CNN's debate. ABC's will be moderated by anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis.</p>

<h2><strong>WHO WILL DEBATE?</strong></h2>

<p>CNN said only Biden and Trump met its conditions for participating in the debate: appear on enough state ballots to potentially win the presidency and receive at least 15% in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters.</p>

<p>Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr did not make the cut.</p>

<p>ABC will also require debaters to appear on enough state ballots to reach the 270 electoral votes and receive at least 15% in four separate national polls.</p>

<h2><strong>WHAT ARE THE RULES?</strong></h2>

<p>In Thursday's 90-minute debate, candidates will appear at a uniform podium, be given a pen, paper and bottle of water and cannot use props or notes, CNN said.</p>

<p>"Microphones will be muted throughout the debate except for the candidate whose turn it is to speak" and moderators "will use all tools at their disposal to enforce timing and ensure a civilized discussion," CNN said.</p>

<p>Biden will be on the podium on the right side of viewers' screens, and Trump will get the last word after a coin toss.</p>

<p>Campaign staff may not interact with candidates during the two commercial breaks, and there will be no studio audience.</p>

<p>ABC's debate rules have not yet been announced.</p>

<h2><strong>WHAT TO WATCH FOR</strong></h2>

<p>U.S. presidential debates often draw tens of millions of viewers, and through history have determined the course of some races. This time, strategists say there are risks for both candidates, who are locked in a tight race and share low enthusiasm from voters.</p>

<p>Biden, 81, and former president Trump, 78, are the oldest candidates ever to seek the presidency and viewers are sure to question their cognitive abilities and emotional steadiness.</p>

<p>Trump aides see Biden as prone to verbal slip-ups that could amplify voter concerns about the president's age.</p>

<p>Biden aides think debates could hurt Trump by exposing his volatility and sometimes changing positions on issues, such as abortion.</p>

<p>Biden's campaign is hoping to talk about abortion and Trump's about immigration, but CNN's moderators will decide the questions.</p>

<p>Topics may include: how the candidates would handle challenges posed by persistently high grocery prices, migrants on the U.S.-Mexico border, and the ongoing Israel-Hamas and Russia-Ukraine wars.</p>

<p>Trump's role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his conviction on 34 felony counts for involvement in a hush money scheme could come up during the debate, as could the legal troubles facing Biden's son, Hunter, who was convicted of lying about his drug use to illegally buy a gun.</p>

<h2><strong>WHO WILL BE THERE?</strong></h2>

<p>Campaign staff will be on hand to talk to reporters afterward in the "spin room."</p>

<p>The Biden campaign declined to comment on whether the president might bring any guests to the debate, but California Governor Gavin Newsom is expected to be there.</p>

<p>Trump's campaign is hosting a watch party in Atlanta, with rumored contenders to be Republican vice presidential running mate - North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, U.S. Senators Marco Rubio and J.D. Vance, and others listed as "special guests."</p>

<h2><strong>WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME?</strong></h2>

<p>Then-President Trump and Biden debated twice during the 2020 race, with their first exchange devolving into a chaotic shouting match.</p>

<p>According to Nielsen Media Research, more than 73 million people tuned in for the first Biden-Trump debate in 2020.</p>

<p>For the second debate, moderators said they would mute each candidate's microphone to allow the other to speak without interruption for the first two minutes of each debate segment. But the candidates behaved more civilly and the mute button was not a major factor.</p>

<p>A third debate was canceled after Trump tested positive for COVID-19 and spent three days in a hospital. He declined to participate in a virtual event.</p>

<h2><strong>IS THAT IT?</strong></h2>

<p>Traditionally, there are three presidential debates, however no third Trump-Biden matchup has been announced yet.</p>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris accepted a CBS News invitation for a vice presidential debate on either July 23 or August 13, according to a campaign spokesperson.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel on Thursday dismissed a UN-backed report that said nearly half a million Gazans faced "catastrophic" hunger, alleging the assessment was "misleading" and "biased".</p>

<p>The latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) partnership, released Tuesday, said its March warning of imminent famine in the north of the Palestinian territory had not materialised.</p>

<p>"However, the situation in Gaza remains catastrophic and there is a high and sustained risk of famine across the whole Gaza Strip," the report said, warning against any complacency.</p>

<p>"This report is highly misleading. It's biased," Israeli government spokesman David Mencer said on Thursday, partly because "it's based upon data from Hamas's own health institutions".</p>

<p>Gaza's Hamas-run government produces data on the war that Israel has disputed in the past, such as its death count, but that has generally been accepted by international media and aid organisations.</p>

<p>"Claims regarding starvation ... in Gaza are baseless," Mencer added. "Their main purpose of course was to exert pressure on Israel."</p>

<p>The IPC report said around 495,000 people in Gaza are still facing "catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity".</p>

<p>Another 745,000 people are classified as in a food security emergency.</p>

<p>The UN's World Food Programme said the new report "paints a stark picture of ongoing hunger".</p>

<p>"The improvement shows the difference that greater access can make. Increased food deliveries to the north and nutrition services have helped to reduce the very worst levels of hunger, leaving a still desperate situation," it said.</p>

<p>But it warned that in the south of Gaza, the situation was getting worse.</p>

<p>"Hostilities in Rafah in May displaced more than a million people and severely limited humanitarian access," it said.</p>

<p>The IPC is an initiative involving over 20 partners, including governments, UN agencies and non-governmental organisations.</p>

<p>Israel had dismissed the IPC's previous hunger report in March, stating it contained inaccuracies and questionable sources.</p>

<p>The war started with Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,765 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from Gaza's health ministry.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel rushed into a neighbourhood in Gaza City on Thursday, ordering Palestinians to move south as the tanks rolled in and bombing the southern city of Rafah in what it says are the final stages of an operation against Hamas operatives there.</p>

<p>Residents of the Shejaia neighbourhood in Gaza City said they were taken by surprise by the sound of tanks approaching and firing in the early afternoon, with drones also attacking after overnight bombing of the city, which Israel had combed early in the war.</p>

<p>"It sounded as if the war is restarting, a series of bombings that destroyed several houses in our area and shook the buildings," Mohammad Jamal, 25, a resident of Gaza City, told Reuters via a chat app.</p>

<p>Later on Thursday, the Palestinian Civil Emergency Service said the Israeli military strikes had killed at least seven people in Shejaia so far. More casualties are feared to be under the rubble where rescue teams cannot reach, it said.</p>

<p>Footage obtained by Reuters showed women, men and children carrying bags and food as they ran in the streets after the raid began. Some men carried injured children, some bleeding, in their arms as they fled.</p>

<p>"This is the (Israeli) occupation targeting us, as you can see. You can see the children, the targeting of children here," said a man carrying a bleeding boy in his arms.</p>

<p>An Israeli military spokesperson said they had no comment on reports of casualties in Shejaia.</p>

<p>The armed wing of Hamas ally Islamic Jihad said it had detonated a pre-planted explosive device against an Israeli tank east of the district.</p>

<p>Israel accuses the operatives of hiding among civilians and says it warns displaced people to get out of the way of its operations against the fighters.</p>

<p>"For your safety, you must evacuate immediately south on Salah al-Din Street to the humanitarian zone," army spokesperson Avichay Adraee posted on X in a call to residents and displaced people in Shejaia.</p>

<p>Residents and Hamas media said the tanks had moved in before the post and that people from the eastern suburb were running westward under fire as Israel had blocked the road south.</p>

<p>More than eight months into Israel's war on Gaza triggered by the Hamas-led cross border attack on Oct. 7, aid officials say the enclave remains at high risk of famine, with almost half a million people facing "catastrophic" food insecurity.</p>

<p>"We are being starved in Gaza City, and are being hunted by tanks and planes with no hope that this war is ever ending," Jamal said.</p>

<p><strong>ANOTHER CHILD DIES OF MALNUTRITION</strong></p>

<p>The death of another girl in Kamal Adwan Hospital late on Wednesday raised the number of children who have died of malnutrition and dehydration to at least 31, a Gaza health official said, adding that the war made recording such cases difficult.</p>

<p>Israel denies accusations it has created the famine conditions, blaming aid agencies for distribution problems and accusing Hamas of diverting aid, allegations the operatives deny.</p>

<p>In southern Gaza, drone footage on social media, which Reuters could not immediately authenticate, showed dozens of houses destroyed in parts of Rafah, with the Swedeya village on the western side of the city completely wiped out.</p>

<p>There was no immediate Israeli military comment on the military action.</p>

<p>International mediation backed by the U.S. has failed to yield a ceasefire agreement although talks are continuing amid intense Western pressure for Gaza to receive more aid.</p>

<p>Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said on Wednesday that he had discussed his proposals for governance of post-war Gaza that would include local Palestinians, regional partners and the U.S. but that it would be "a long and complex process".</p>

<p>Senior U.S. officials told Gallant, who was visiting Washington, that the U.S. would maintain a pause on a shipment of heavy munitions for Israel while the issue is under review. The shipment was paused in early May over concerns the weapons could cause more Palestinian deaths in Gaza.</p>

<p>Hamas says any deal must bring an end to the war and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, while Israel says it will accept only temporary pauses in fighting until Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, is eradicated.</p>

<p>When Hamas-led operatives rushed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, they killed around 1,200 people and seized more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>The Israeli offensive in retaliation has so far killed 37,765 people, the Gaza health ministry said on Thursday, and has left the tiny, heavily built-up Gaza Strip in ruins.</p>

<p>The Gaza health ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants, but officials say most of those killed have been civilians. Israel has lost 314 soldiers in Gaza and says at least a third of the Palestinian dead are fighters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Russian satellite has broken up into more than 100 pieces of debris in orbit, forcing astronauts on the International Space Station to take shelter, U.S. space agencies said.</p>

<p>There were no immediate details on what caused the break-up of the RESURS-P1 Russian Earth observation satellite, which was decommissioned in 2022. U.S. Space Command said on Thursday there was no immediate threat as it tracks the debris swarm.</p>

<p>The event occurred around 10 a.m. Mountain Time (1600 GMT) on Wednesday, Space Command said. It occurred in an orbit near the space station, prompting U.S. astronauts on board to shelter in their spacecraft for roughly an hour, NASA's Space Station office said.</p>

<p>Radars from U.S. space-tracking firm LeoLabs detected the satellite releasing several fragments up until 6 p.m. Mountain Time, the company said.</p>

<p>U.S. Space Command, which has its own global network of space-tracking radars, said the satellite immediately created "over 100 pieces of trackable debris."</p>

<p>Large debris-generating events in orbit are rare but of increasing concern as space becomes crowded with satellite networks vital to everyday life on Earth, from broadband internet and communications to basic navigation services.</p>

<p>Russia sparked international fury in 2021 when it struck one of its defunct satellites in orbit with a ground-based anti-satellite missile, creating thousands of pieces of debris to test a weapon system ahead of its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>The prospect of satellite collisions and space warfare have added urgency to calls from space advocates and lawyers to have countries establish an international mechanism of managing space traffic, which does not currently exist.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Time magazine has signed a multi-year content deal with OpenAI that would give the ChatGPT maker access to its archive of news content, the companies said on Thursday.</p>

<p>In response to user queries, the chatbot will cite and link back to the original source on Time.com, the companies added in a statement. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>

<p>The artificial intelligence company has signed similar deals over the past few months with the Financial Times, Business Insider-owner Axel Springer, France's Le Monde and Spain-based Prisa Media.</p>

<p>While some media companies like the New York Times and The Intercept have previously sued OpenAI for the use of their journalism, these content partnerships are essential for training AI models.</p>

<p>These deals can also provide lucrative opportunity for news publishers, who have historically been excluded from the profits that internet giants generate by distributing their content.</p>

<p>In May, Microsoft-backed OpenAI signed content and product partnerships with The Atlantic and Vox Media.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese Artificial Intelligence (AI) companies are moving swiftly to attract users of OpenAI's technology, following reports the US firm plans to restrict access in China and other countries to its application programming interface (API), a platform that allows developers of other products to integrate its AI models.</p>

<p>ChatGPT maker OpenAI is planning to block access to technology used to build AI products for entities in China and some other countries, Chinese state-owned newspaper Securities Times reported on Tuesday.</p>

<p>ChatGPT is not available in mainland China but many Chinese startups have been able to access OpenAI's API platform and use it to build their own applications, the Securities Times said.</p>

<p>"We are taking additional steps to block API traffic from regions where we do not support access to OpenAI's services," an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters.</p>

<p>Since late Monday, Chinese users of the platform have received emails warning they are in a "region that OpenAI does not currently support" and that additional measures to block API traffic from unsupported regions would be taken starting July 9.</p>

<p>In response, Baidu, China's leading AI developer, said it would launch an "inclusive program" offering new users free migration to its Ernie platform.</p>

<p>For OpenAI users, Baidu will provide additional Ernie 3.5 flagship model tokens, matching the scale of their OpenAI usage, Baidu's cloud unit said in a statement. Tokens are units of text processed by AI models.</p>

<p>Alibaba Cloud also joined in, offering free tokens and migration services for OpenAI API users through its AI platform. The company's Qwen-plus model is priced significantly lower than GPT-4, according to Alibaba.</p>

<p>Zhipu AI, another major player in China's AI sector, announced a "Special Migration Program" for OpenAI API users.</p>

<p>"Our GLM model fully benchmarks against OpenAI's product ecosystem," Zhipu AI said in a statement to developers seen by Reuters. "With our entirely self-developed technology, we ensure security and controllability."</p>

<p>Numerous Chinese companies have released chatbots powered by their own AI models over the past year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[As the heatwave begins to grip the UK and the heat health alert is in effect, people are looking for ways to keep cool and reduce the risk of heat stroke  the most severe form of hyperthermia, with a body temperature above 40C.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the heatwave begins to grip the UK and the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgrrjm496gpo">heat health alert</a> is in effect, people are looking for ways to keep cool and reduce the risk of heat stroke – the most severe form of hyperthermia, with a body temperature above 40°C.</p>

<p>Older adults, those with underlying health conditions and the very young are at greatest risk. Some of this arises because <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23703052/">the young</a> and elderly have less efficient body systems to dissipate heat away from the body.</p>

<p>Older people hold heat more than young people because their sweat glands don't <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2900329/">function as well</a> and their hearts don't circulate blood as efficiently, so less heat is lost from the skin.</p>

<p>Sweating is the most powerful way your body can remove heat. As sweat evaporates, it takes heat with it. In the heat, people can produce <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8226773/">between a half to two litres</a> of sweat per hour.</p>

<p>In temperatures where the air temp is above the body temperature, heat can be transferred from the air to the body, which produces an additional challenge in removing heat from the body.</p>

<p>Aside from sweating, the other major way we lose heat is <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30454590/">vasodilation</a> (a widening of the blood vessels) in peripheral tissues. In extreme heat, the skin can receive between <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4551211/">six and eight litres of blood per minute</a> to help carry heat away from central organs.</p>

<p>Much of how the body responds is aimed at moving heat away from the major organs and the central nervous system to keep their temperature at as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK331/">close to 37°C as possible</a>.</p>

<p>While sweating and vasodilation are effective, they are limited – especially when temperatures stay high for several days.</p>

<p>The best ways to reduce your temperature are ones that support the body's existing mechanisms to remove heat.</p>

<h2>Applying cold things to the body</h2>

<p>Applying cold water or a cold damp sponge to the skin is effective in moving heat from the body. This is beneficial in people with limited mobility and older adults.</p>

<p>Those who are able, can take a cool shower or bath. Evidence suggests that water that is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459311/">about 26 or 27°C is optimal</a>. It is cool enough to take heat away from the body, but not cold enough to initiate shivering, which will generate heat. (Immersing in water that is too cold can also cause <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(03)15057-X/fulltext">cold shock</a>.)</p>

<p>Studies looking at the French heatwave of 2003 showed that cooling (using a mister, cool, or cold bath or shower, sponge bath, mechanical fan or air conditioner) may be <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/413443">beneficial</a> and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/16/6/583/587693">prevented heat-related deaths</a>.</p>

<p>Ice or cool packs (a damp towel or cloth works just fine) can be applied to the body. The <a href="https://associationofanaesthetists-publications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2044.2008.05727.x">groin, armpit</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8800980/">neck, forehead</a>, wrists and torso are all areas that have plenty of blood vessels close to the surface. The cooled blood can then return to the major organs to bring the core temperature down.</p>

<p>Ice or ice packs should be wrapped in a towel or something similar to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10450486/">avoid burning the skin</a>. Cycling them on and off the body every ten minutes reduces the risk of injury.</p>

<p>Partial filling of hot water bottle and placing in the freezer, to use at bedtime, or placing pillowcases in a plastic bag and into the freezer to chill them for bedtime may also help at night.</p>

<h2>Fans</h2>

<p>A <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(24)00030-5/fulltext">recent study</a> has shown that fans can improve the body's sweat evaporation, but not significantly enough to help reduce the core body temperature. And this becomes even less so when ambient temperatures rise above 33°C, or for older people and those with an impaired ability to sweat.</p>

<h2>Hot and cold drinks</h2>

<p>Evidence from performance athletes exercising in temperatures of 28°C showed that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20694887/">chilled fluids at fridge temperature</a> were better at bringing down core temperatures than ice or temperature neutral liquids at 37°C.</p>

<p>Drinking hot beverages activates the body's mechanism to cool, but this will <a href="https://theconversation.com/does-drinking-hot-tea-in-summer-really-cool-you-down-62854">remove much-needed fluid</a> from the body if you haven't drunk enough, so chilled drinks are probably best in this situation.</p>

<h2>Shade</h2>

<p>All of these things are more effective in a cooler shaded area to increase the temperature gradient between the body and the ambient temperature. If you try these in the sun, they're likely to be less effective as the ambient air is warmer in the sun meaning there is less capacity to take heat away or it happens more slowly.</p>

<p>Overall, though, the evidence suggests <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459311/">(ice) water immersion is the most effective way to cool off</a> – which at home is most easily done by immersing feet or hands in a cool bowl of water. Water immersion is how many animals in hot weather and climates <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9951680/">reduce their body temperature</a> by standing in water, so it's a good technique for humans, too.</p>

<p>But if you're unable to do this, evaporation (mist and fan) is the next most effective.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Exam graders could have trouble spotting answers generated by AI-based chatbots, researchers said after their study found that these answers not only went undetected but were also graded better than those written by students.</p>

<p>On behalf of 33 'fake students', the researchers at the University of Reading, UK, submitted answers generated by ChatGPT to the examinations system of the School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences of the same university.</p>

<p>The team found that 94 per cent of the AI-written answers went undetected. Further, about 83 per cent of the chatbot's answers secured better scores than real students' submissions.</p>

<p>"We found that within this system, 100 per cent AI-written submissions were virtually undetectable and very consistently gained grades better than real student submissions," the authors wrote in the study published in the journal PLoS ONE.</p>

<p>The researchers said their findings should be a "wakeup call" for educators across the world and called for the global education sector to evolve in the face of artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>"Many institutions have moved away from traditional exams to make assessment more inclusive. Our research shows it is of international importance to understand how AI will affect the integrity of educational assessments," lead researcher Peter Scarfe, an associate professor at the University of Reading, said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China's Communist Party on Thursday expelled former defence minister Li Shangfu and his predecessor Wei Fenghe for "serious violations of discipline", a euphemism for corruption, state news agency Xinhua reported.</p>

<p>Li was suspected of receiving "huge sums of money" in bribes as well as bribing others, and an investigation found he "did not fulfill political responsibilities" and "sought personnel benefits for himself and others", the report said, citing the Communist Party's Central Committee which ordered the investigation.</p>

<p>"As a senior leading cadre of the party and the army, Li Shangfu betrayed his original mission ... betrayed the trust of the Party Central Committee and Central Military Commission... and caused great damage to the party cause and national defence," the report said.</p>

<p>Reuters exclusively reported last year that Li was under investigation for suspected corruption in military procurement. He was mysteriously ousted as defence minister without explanation last October, after disappearing for two months. This is the first time China has explicitly confirmed that Li was under investigation, as well as details of the nature of his crimes.</p>

<p>China's military has undergone a sweeping anti-corruption purge since last year, with eleven PLA generals and a handful of aerospace defence industry executives removed from the national legislative body to date.</p>

<p>Wei Fenghe, Li's predecessor, had disappeared from public view since he was replaced last March during a planned cabinet reshuffle. Wei was head of the strategic People's Liberation Army (PLA) Rocket Force from 2015-17.</p>

<p>President Xi Jinping, also the military's commander-in-chief, appointed a new head and political commissar of the Rocket Force last July, in a major shake-up of the unit that oversees China's conventional and nuclear missiles.</p>

<p>An investigation launched into Wei last September found that he had accepted "a huge amount of money and valuables" in bribes and "helped others gain improper benefits in personnel arrangements", Xinhua reported, adding that his actions were "extremely serious in nature, with a highly detrimental impact and tremendous harm".</p>

<p>Both officials were also found to have other unspecified violations, the reports said without elaborating.</p>

<p>The decisions to strip Li and Wei of their party membership were approved by the seven-member Politburo, the Communist Party's apex of power, on Thursday. The Politburo also transferred both their cases to military prosecutors.</p>

<p>The decision will be confirmed during the party's Third Plenum to be held 15-18 July, when removals from the Central Committee will be formally announced. Ousted former foreign minister Qin Gang still remains a member of the Central Committee.</p>

<p>Xi last week said the PLA faces "deep-seated" political problems and vowed there must be "no hiding place" for corrupt officers.</p>

<p>Li was also stripped of his membership of the national legislative body, Xinhua added, after being removed from the Central Military Commission, China's top military body, earlier this year. Wei was also removed from the legislative body.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The report, titled "AI at Work: Friend and Foe," by Boston Consulting Group (BCG), indicates that 54 per cent of Indian respondents ranked confidence in their top two sentiments towards AI at work. Additionally, 93 per cent of those using GenAI for work in India agreed that it has significantly saved them time.</p>

<p>A study by BCG has revealed a striking level of confidence among Indian workers in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI (GenAI) in the workplace.</p>

<p>This sentiment is part of a broader trend captured in a global survey involving over 13,000 employees across 15 countries and regions.</p>

<p>Conducted by BCG's tech build and design division, BCG X, the survey highlights a growing confidence in AI and GenAI across the board.</p>

<p>The findings show that 42 per cent of global respondents expressed confidence in these technologies' impact on their work, a substantial increase from 26 per cent the previous year.</p>

<p>However, this confidence is accompanied by an increase in anxiety, with 49 per cent of regular users fearing that their jobs could vanish within the next decade due to these technologies. In contrast, only 24 per cent of non-users shared this concern.</p>

<p>The report underscores the increasing integration of GenAI in workplaces worldwide. About 64 per cent of leaders are now implementing GenAI tools, with frontline employees showing a significant uptick in usage--43 per cent regularly use these tools at work, more than double the number from last year.</p>

<p>Sylvain Duranton, managing director and senior partner at BCG and a coauthor of the report, commented, "Our survey exposes the double-edged nature of GenAI. Familiarity correlates with both comfort and fear. GenAI is a revolutionary technology, so these opposing reactions should not be surprising."</p>

<p>He added, "By recognizing the complex ways in which humans understand and interact with GenAI, leaders can reshape their organizations to maximize the strengths and value of both their human and machine workers."</p>

<p>A portion of survey respondents who utilize GenAI for work, specifically 58 per cent, reported saving at least five hours per week. The time saved is often redirected towards additional tasks (41 per cent), new initiatives (39 per cent), experimentation with GenAI (38 per cent), or strategic work (38 per cent).</p>

<p>Vinciane Beauchene, managing director and partner at BCG and a coauthor of the report, said, "We are entering a new era for GenAI which is less about optimism and curiosity and more about confidence and value realization. Adoption has increased and individuals are starting to see the benefits."</p>

<p>He added, "Companies are also starting to realize that getting the value out of their investment will require them to think beyond productivity and take a more holistic and proactive approach to redirect the time saved to the most valuable and joyful activities, to reskill their employees to do so, and to reshape their organizations and operating models as a consequence."</p>

<p>The study highlighted a marked difference in attitudes towards GenAI between workers from the Global South and the Global North.</p>

<p>Respondents from countries like Brazil, India, Nigeria, South Africa, and those in the Middle East displayed more optimism and less anxiety about GenAI compared to their counterparts in more developed economies.</p>

<p>The Global South not only demonstrated a higher percentage of regular GenAI users among leaders, managers, and frontline employees but also a greater likelihood of having received GenAI training.</p>

<p>Additionally, employees in these regions reported using the time saved by GenAI to focus on professional development, experimentation with the tool, and improving the quality of their work.</p>

<p>The report concludes with key recommendations for companies aiming to harness the full potential of GenAI.</p>

<p>Organizations are advised to establish a transformation-first mindset, continuously manage all transformation efforts to ensure cohesion and efficiency and invest in large-scale training initiatives to equip employees with the necessary skills.</p>

<p>Emphasizing value creation and employee satisfaction, companies should prepare for evolving job roles and skills requirements and adapt their organizational structures and governance accordingly.</p>

<p>Jeff Walters, managing director and senior partner at BCG and a coauthor of the report, noted, "Understandable human reactions to these technologies can pose challenges to companies as they continue on their GenAI journeys."</p>

<p>He added, "But as we noted in last year's report--and it still holds true this year--these are more change management challenges than technology challenges. And now is the time for organizations to double-down on their commitment to transformation built around GenAI."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A district and sessions court in Islamabad declined the pleas of former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, as well as his wife, Bushra Bibi, to suspend their seven-year sentences in the Iddat Case on Thursday, reported Dawn.</p>

<p>The verdict, which had been reserved on Tuesday was notably announced by Additional District and sessions judge (ADSJ) Afzal Majoka today.</p>

<p>Lawyers, women activists, and members of civil society all harshly condemned the Iddat conviction as a "blow to women's right to dignity and privacy."</p>

<p>The ruling had been met with protests in Islamabad by activists and criticism in Karachi by demonstrators who were against the "state's intrusion into people's private lives.</p>

<p>Prior to the general elections, on February 3, an Islamabad court condemned the couple to seven years in prison and fined them each PKR 500,000 for getting married during Bushra Bibi's Iddat period.</p>

<p>The couple was given 14 years in prison in the Toshakhana case, while Imran and his foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, were given 10 years in prison in the Cypher case, the same week the verdict was rendered.</p>

<p>Imran and Qureshi were found not guilty in the Cypher case earlier this month, and the penalties in the Toshakhana case were suspended in April.</p>

<p>The case was previously being heard by District and Sessions Judge Shahrukh Arjumand, who had reserved the verdict in May.</p>

<p>On the day of the anticipated announcement, he requested that the matter be transferred, citing Maneka's plea to be removed from the appeals panel. The case was then moved to ADSJ Majoka.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, Bushra Bibi's attorney had petitioned the Islamabad High Court for her release on bond and a sentence suspension. In a related development, the sessions court was instructed by the Islamabad High Court to rule on the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder's and his wife's pleas within ten days.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) released an Artificial Intelligence Preparedness Index (AIPI) Dashboard on their website on Tuesday, tracking 174 economies globally for AI readiness.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>The Index has categorised each country into Advanced Economy (AE), Emerging Market Economy (EM), and Low-Income Country (LIC). Singapore (0.80), Denmark (0.78), and the United States (0.77) are among the highest-rated AEs, with India categorised as an EM with a 0.49 rating. India ranks 72 in a total of 174 countries, with Bangladesh (0.38) on 113, Sri Lanka (0.43) on 92, and China (0.63) on 31.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

</div>

<p>The rating for each country is given based on the assessment of readiness in four key areas - digital infrastructure, human capital and labour market policies, innovation and economic integration, and regulation.</p>

</div>

<p>Earlier this year, the IMF published a blog based on their research paper on 14 January, stating that AI could endanger 33 percent of jobs in AEs, 24 percent in EMs, and 18 percent in LICs. Overall, 40 percent of the jobs around the world will be affected by AI, replacing some and complimenting others.</p>

<p>"On the brighter side, it also brings enormous potential to enhance the productivity of existing jobs for which AI can be a complementary tool and to create new jobs and even new industries," says Economist Giovanni Melina, in the IMF article from Tuesday.</p>

<p>"Under most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall inequality, a troubling trend that policymakers can work to prevent. To this end, the dashboard is a response to significant interest from our stakeholders in accessing the index. It is a resource for policymakers, researchers, and the public to better assess AI preparedness and, importantly, to identify the actions and design the policies needed to help ensure that the rapid gains of AI can benefit all," wrote Melina.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The house was home to the "Some Like It Hot" screen siren for the final six months of her life up to her death from a drug overdose in 1962.</p>

<p>More than half a century on, Monroe remains one of the most beloved figures in US pop culture, and fans as well as conservationists have closely followed a row over the future of the home.</p>

<p>Property heiress Brinah Milstein and her reality TV producer husband Roy Bank bought the Spanish Colonial-style home in the swanky Brentwood neighbourhood last summer for $8.35 million.</p>

<p>The couple owned the house next door and intended to combine the two properties. That construction would have involved razing the Monroe home.</p>

<p>But when a demolition permit was issued last September, a furore quickly followed, and local politicians moved quickly to designate the building's protected status.</p>

<p>Last month, the owners sued the city of Los Angeles for "illegal and unconstitutional conduct."</p>

<p>Their petition noted Monroe had "occasionally" lived in the home for "a mere six months", and the couple claim that more than a dozen previous owners since 1962 have already changed the building beyond recognition.</p>

<p>Those objections were overruled Wednesday, as city councillors approved the designation of the house as a historic cultural monument.</p>

<p>Monroe bought the 3,000-square-foot single-story hacienda in 1962 just after her divorce from playwright Arthur Miller.</p>

<p>"There is no other person or place in the city of Los Angeles as iconic as Marilyn Monroe and her Brentwood home," said councillor Traci Park, whose district includes the house in question.</p>

<p>"Some of the most world-famous images ever taken of her were in that home, on those grounds and near her pool.</p>

<p>"There is likely no woman in history or culture who captures the imagination of the public the way Marilyn Monroe did. Even all these years later, her story still resonates and inspires many of us today."</p>

<p>Monroe's smouldering looks and breathy delivery made her one of the most bankable movie stars of her era.</p>

<p>The "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" star was linked during her lifetime with some of the most eligible men of her era, including president John F. Kennedy, famously singing "Happy Birthday, Mr President" at Madison Square Garden.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea successfully tested its multiple-warhead missile capability, state media said Thursday, as dozens more trash-laden balloons from Pyongyang landed in the South.</p>

<p>Relations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, with Pyongyang ramping up weapons testing while bombarding the South with balloons full of trash it says are in retaliation to similar missives sent northwards by activists in the South.</p>

<p>The balloons briefly forced Seoul's major hub Incheon Airport to close on Wednesday, and in response to the successive launches, South has fully suspended a tension-reducing military treaty and re-started propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts and live-fire drills near the border.</p>

<p>North Korea claimed it had "successfully conducted the separation and guidance control test of individual mobile warheads", the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Thursday.</p>

<p>The "separated mobile warheads were guided correctly to the three coordinate targets" during the test, carried out the day before, it said.</p>

<p>"The test is aimed at securing the MIRV capability," KCNA added, referring to multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle technology -- or the ability to fire multiple warheads on a single ballistic missile.</p>

<p>South Korea's military had previously said the North's test on Wednesday appeared to be of a hypersonic missile, but that the launch ended in a mid-air explosion.</p>

<p>More smoke than usual appeared to emanate from the missile, raising the possibility of combustion issues, the official said, adding it may have been powered by solid propellants.</p>

<p>According to KCNA, the test "was carried out by use of the first-stage engine of an intermediate-range solid-fuel ballistic missile within a 170-200 kilometre (105 to 124-mile) radius."</p>

<p>"The effectiveness of a decoy separated from the missile was also verified by anti-air radar," it said.</p>

<p>Acquiring multiple-warhead missile technology is an ultimate goal for nations seeking ICBM-level missiles to carry nuclear warheads, said Hong Min, a senior research fellow at the Korea Institute for National Unification.</p>

<p>It appears the North is "testing such technology step by step over the long haul," he told AFP.</p>

<p>"They appear to be making technological advancements in the early development stages of multiple-warhead missiles."</p>

<h3><strong>Balloon blitz&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>For three consecutive days, North Korea has floated hundreds of trash-carrying balloons southward in a tit-for-tat propaganda campaign.</p>

<p>Seoul's military said around 70 balloons had landed by Thursday morning, mainly in northern Gyeonggi province and the Seoul area, with the contents found to not be hazardous.</p>

<p>"The payload is about 10 kilograms (22 pounds), so there is a risk if the balloons descend rapidly," it said, adding the military was ready to respond.</p>

<p>The response to the latest balloons "will be flexible depending on the strategic and operational situation. This depends on North Korea's actions," it added.</p>

<p>South Korea's Marine Corps resumed live-fire exercises on islands near the western inter-Korean border on Wednesday, marking the first such exercises since the 2018 tension-reducing military deal with the North was fully suspended this month.</p>

<p>South Korea and the United States also staged joint air drills Wednesday involving around 30 aircraft, including Washington's advanced stealth fighter jet, F-22 Raptor.</p>

<p>President Yoon Suk Yeol visited a US aircraft carrier on Tuesday that arrived in South Korea for joint trilateral military drills this week aimed at countering North Korean threats.</p>

<p>The drills, which run from Thursday to Saturday, involve Washington's nuclear-powered aircraft carrier the USS Theodore Roosevelt, Tokyo's guided-missile destroyer JS Atago, and Seoul's fighter jet KF-16s, among other assets.</p>

<p>Pyongyang has routinely criticised such exercises as rehearsals for an invasion</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

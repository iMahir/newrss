       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra were students at Stanford University, California, studying Computer Sciences when they dropped out of college and chose to build a ten-minute-delivery startup which is now valued at $5 billion.<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ndtv-world-summit-2024-india-century-live-updates-pm-narendra-modi-david-cameron-s-jaishankar-to-speak-6830644"> At the NDTV World Summit</a>, Mr Palicha shared how Zepto was built and how his parents reacted to the decision to leave college.</p>

<p>"On the outside, it looks like a very cliched Silicon Valley story, you drop out of college to start a company, but before you took that step, Kaivalya and I were tinkering around for a year and as kids we love coding and we used to build small projects for fun. We were supposed to go to California but during the first wave of Covid, we were put back to Mumbai. I didn't really see a value in online education in that period, so we took a call to take a year off and build something interesting," Mr Palicha said.</p>

<p>"Most of our peers at Stanford were doing their internship at Google, and Goldman Sachs, we didn't have anything of that lined up and we took a call to start experimenting," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To a question on how he came up with the idea of quick delivery, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/19-year-old-stanford-dropout-s-100-billion-dream-631193">the Zepto CEO</a> said, "We were sitting in sher-e-punjab in Andheri East in Mumbai, and during the pandemic, you couldn't get groceries delivered. Offline options were mostly shut and online would take seven days. We started with a WhatsApp group and over a year we kept talking to customers and tweaking the model."</p>

<p>"We started building out the first version of Zepto a year after the WhatsApp group and got to a meaningful scale before we decided to drop out," he said.</p>

<p><strong>How Parents Reacted</strong></p>

<p>"It was shocking for parents. I remember Kevaliya's mother burst into tears and said what have you done to my son, you have brainwashed him...but we had real numbers to bank on. At that time we were doing a few million dollars in revenue and we were growing fast...We had the substance to decide with conviction...Our fathers were a little bit comfortable with it because they saw the numbers," he said, adding, "Kaivalya's mother often says what a beautiful life you have given up on."</p>

<p>Zepto competes in India's hyper-competitive grocery delivery space. Rivals in the market include e-commerce giant Amazon's India unit and homegrown competitors such as Swiggy Instamart, Blinkit, and conglomerate Tata Group's BigBasket.</p>

<p>This year, Aadit and Kaivalya were featured on the list of richest Indians released by Hurun. Twenty-one-year-old Kaivalya Vohra has a net worth of Rs 3,600 crore, while Aadit, 22, has a net worth of Rs 4,300 crore.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A GE Aerospace manufacturing facility in Pune will soon begin making the F414 jet engine - which powers some of the most advanced fighter planes in the world, including the Boeing F/A 18E/F Super Hornet, GE Aerospace South Asia CEO said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A GE Aerospace manufacturing facility in Pune will soon begin making the F414 jet engine,&nbsp;Vikram Rai, chief executive of GE Aerospace South Asia, said at the NDTV World Summit on Monday, as he hailed the country's aerospace industry as the "flagbearer of India's manufacturing push".</p>

<p>The F414 engine powers some of the most advanced fighter planes in the world, including the Boeing F/A 18E/F Super Hornet, and will be the heart of the Indian Air Forces' next generation of indigenous combat aircraft.</p>

<p>Speaking at the NDTV World Summit Mr Rai also highlighted India's potential in the civil aviation space, pointing to two mega orders in June last year, when Air India and IndiGo ordered 970 Airbus and Boeing aircraft between them alone.</p>

<p>"India has approximately 800 passenger aircraft... and about 1,500 (including the Air India and IndiGo order books) are expected to be delivered over the next decade. I believe this is just the tip of the iceberg and India will continue with exponential growth over the coming years," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Rai referred to statements by Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier today.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi, delivering the inaugural address, said eight new airports had begun operating in the 125 days of the Bharatiya Janata Party's third term (which began in June) alone.</p>

<p>The Indian middle class is flying more, Mr Rai said, because of the Modi government's "business-friendly" policies. "In a world full of chaos, the 'India story' is being talked about," he said.</p>

<p>"India has a middle class of about 400 million... the United State's total population is about 300 million. The US has about 7,800 aircraft... India has about 800 and .02 seats per capita..."</p>

<p>"But India is fast catching up to China, which has 0.7 seats per capita and the US, which as four seats per capita," the GE Aerospace head said, emphasising growth potential in the Indian aviation space.</p>

<p>"Less than five per cent of India's population has been on an aircraft... and about 85 per cent of all domestic air traffic is between metro cities. There is a huge runway for growth..." he said.</p>

<p>The scale of demand, he also said, underlines the importance of a sustainable industry, including the use of environmentally friendly technology. "We, at GE Aerospace have built new engines... these are 10 to 15 per cent more fuel efficient and register lower emission levels."</p>

<p>Mr Rai also said GE is currently working on an engine that will be 20 per cent more efficient and, as part of its manufacturing and R&amp;D plans, will also invest millions of dollars in the Pune factory.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[About 1,500 North Korean special forces soldiers are already in Russia acclimatising, likely to head to the front lines soon, South Korea's spy agency said Friday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korea summoned the Russian ambassador to Seoul Monday to criticise Pyongyang's decision to send thousands of soldiers to support Moscow's war in Ukraine, the foreign ministry said, calling for their immediate withdrawal. About 1,500 North Korean special forces soldiers are already in Russia acclimatising, likely to head to the front lines soon, Seoul's spy agency said Friday, with additional troops set to depart soon, Pyongyang's first such deployment overseas.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/russia-ukraine-war-north-korean-soldiers-at-russian-training-ground-amid-ukraine-war-6830251" target="_blank">South Korea</a>, which has long claimed the nuclear-armed North is supplying Russia with weaponry for use in Ukraine, has expressed alarm over the deployment, which comes after Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a military deal in June.</p>

<p>Vice foreign minister Kim Hong-kyun expressed Seoul's "grave concerns regarding North Korea's recent dispatch of troops to Russia and strongly urged the immediate withdrawal of North Korean forces and the cessation of related cooperation," the ministry said in a statement.</p>

<p>Kim told the Russian ambassador to South Korea, Georgiy Zinoviev, that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/north-korea-troop-deployment-locks-in-russia-military-alliance-6824976">North Korea supplying Russia with weaponry</a> and troops for the war in Ukraine "poses a significant security threat not only to South Korea but to the international community."</p>

<p>He also "emphasised that such actions violate multiple UN Security Council resolutions and the UN Charter."</p>

<h3><strong>North Koreans in Ukraine?</strong></h3>

<p>On Friday, Seoul's National Intelligence Service (NIS) released detailed satellite images it said showed the first deployment of elite North Korean soldiers being moved by Russian military vessels to Vladivostok.</p>

<p>Seoul's spy agency said that between October 8 and 13, "North Korea transported its special forces to Russia via a Russian Navy transport ship, confirming the start of North Korea's military participation" in Moscow's war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>The first contingent of troops -- which South Korean media said were from an elite unit under North Korea's Special Operations Forces, also known as the "Storm Corps" -- are currently stationed in military bases across Russia's Far East.</p>

<p>The special forces "are expected to be deployed to the front lines (of the Ukraine conflict) as soon as they complete acclimatisation training," according to the NIS.</p>

<p>The NIS also said Friday that the North had "provided Russia with more than 13,000 containers' worth of artillery shells, missiles, anti-tank rockets and other lethal weapons" since last August.</p>

<p>Pyongyang and Moscow have been allies since North Korea's founding after World War II, and have drawn even closer since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>Last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky flagged intelligence reports saying North Korea was training 10,000 soldiers to support Russia in its fight against Kyiv and said Moscow was relying on the North to make up for its substantial losses.</p>

<p>Ukrainian media reported earlier this month that six North Korean military officers were killed in a Ukrainian missile attack on Russian-occupied territory near Donetsk -- which South Korea's defence minister said at the time was "highly likely" to be true.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Nobel laureate Professor Paul Romer said it is very hard to tell who will win the upcoming US Presidential elections, calling it a "sign of profound distress.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hailing India's Aadhaar initiative,&nbsp;Nobel laureate Professor Paul Romer&nbsp;on Monday said technology was used to give citizens an existence and further access to schemes. The United States, though saw the rise of the Silicon Valley, failed to use technology to improve lives in the US, he said.</p>

<p>"Aadhaar made people real by giving them a number. And many schemes have been built on that. This is because India decided to use technology to benefit everyone. And unlike in the US, life expectancy has not started falling in India," he said at the NDTV World Summit.</p>

<p>The 2018 Nobel Prize for Economics recipient said India needs to take advantage of its potential, adding that assembling land parcels is key to growth. "India should think about entirely new cities. One can emulate the example of Singapore," Mr Romer said.</p>

<p>The former chief economist at World Bank also said it is very hard to tell who will win the upcoming US Presidential elections, calling it a "sign of profound distress.</p>

<p>Mr Romer said the choice in America is between a former prosecutor and a "habitual criminal", in a reference to Kamala Harris and Donald Trump respectively. Calling the situation in the US "very bad", he also said that governments only get legitimacy when they deliver.</p>

<p>Urging India to choose sides, Mr Romer said both China and Russia want to function as empires, in a bid to increase influence. "India should be able to say we don't like empires. India's stand could decisively tip the balance," he said.</p>

<p>In a lighter vein, Mr Romer, who had taught former British PM Rishi Sunak at Stanford University, said professional commitments did not allow him to comment on whether Conservative leader was a good student.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Addressing the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://special.ndtv.com/ndtv-world-summit-2024-167/#pfrom=home-ndtvworld_world%20site">NDTV World Summit 2024</a>, Sunil Bharti Mittal, Founder and Chairperson of Bharti Enterprises, explained how the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) will impact everything from global economies to geopolitics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"AI will be one of the most important drivers of economy, politics, and geopolitics. But there will be misuse as well, and we will need to be more vigilant," Mr Mittal said. "Nation states will have to come up with guardrails. One will have to be vigilant, society will have to be protected from the evils of AI. I remain very optimistic of the various use of AI."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Mittal said that while some jobs are being reduced due to AI, new opportunities are emerging.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Routine, mundane, repetitive jobs will be under huge threat. Remain hopeful that new ideas will come through that will lead to new jobs. We will be serving the world right from India. AI allows us to do that and our frugal innovations are going to serve the world," Mr Mittal said at the NDTV World Summit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the state of India's digital infrastructure, Mr Mittal said that the country's mobile networks are "significantly superior" to those in the US, UK, and Europe, although still lagging behind Japan and Singapore.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Mittal was conferred an Honorary Knighthood (KBE) by King Charles III this year, adding to his list of accolades, including the Padma Bhushan in 2007 and his leadership roles at the B20 India Action Council and the International Telecommunication Union.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Prabowo Subianto's cabinet has 48 ministries with over 100 ministers and deputies, including re-appointments of Sri Mulyani Indrawati as finance minister and Bahlil Lahadalia as energy minister.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indonesia's newly minted leader, President Prabowo Subianto, officially swore in his cabinet on Monday, a team that analysts said reflected the continuity of his predecessor's main policies. Prabowo took office on Sunday as the eighth Indonesian president, taking the mantle from Joko "Jokowi" Widodo. In a fiery speech to lawmakers, he promised to eradicate corruption and aim to reach self-sufficiency in food and energy.</p>

<p>Prabowo's cabinet has 48 ministries with over 100 ministers and deputies, including re-appointments of Sri Mulyani Indrawati as finance minister and Bahlil Lahadalia as energy minister.</p>

<p>Sri Mulyani will preside over Prabowo's main programmes, including giving free meals to about 20 million children which could cost the state budget 71 trillion rupiah ($4.60 billion) in the first year, a number intended to keep the annual fiscal deficit under a legislated ceiling of 3% of gross domestic product.</p>

<p>A former World Bank managing director, Sri Mulyani has earned plaudits for reforming the taxation system while working under two presidents before Prabowo.</p>

<p>Other key re-appointments include chief economic minister Airlangga Hartarto and Erick Thohir as the state-owned enterprises minister.</p>

<p>Prabowo's re-appointments show his intention to continue the policies of Jokowi, especially on the economy, said analyst Burhanuddin Muhtadi.</p>

<p>"Prabowo does not want to take further risks and that's why he chose key figures that served under Jokowi," he said, adding these appointments give Prabowo some political security.</p>

<p>Indonesia's new foreign minister is Sugiono, the deputy of Prabowo's political party and second-in-command of the parliamentary commission overseeing foreign policy.</p>

<p>Luhut Pandjaitan, Jokowi's senior minister who spearheaded Indonesia's mineral processing industry, has been named the head of the country's National Economic Council.</p>

<p>Prabowo's cabinet differs in some aspects from Jokowi's as some ministries have been broken up or renamed. Education and culture ministries are separate, as well as environment and forestry.</p>

<p>Ahead of the swearing in, Prabowo held a meeting with China's visiting Vice President Han Zheng, according to a post on his official social media platform X and China's foreign ministry.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US military has rushed its advanced anti-missile system to Israel and it is now "in place", Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/thaad-explained-the-advanced-missile-defense-system-the-us-is-deploying-to-israel-6784124" target="_blank">THAAD</a>, or the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, is a critical part of the US military's layered air defense systems and adds to Israel's already formidable anti-missile defenses.</p>

<p>"The THAAD system is in place," Austin said, speaking to reporters before his arrival in Ukraine on Monday.</p>

<p>He declined to say whether it was operational, but added: "We have the ability to put it into operation very quickly and we're on pace with our expectations."</p>

<p>President Joe Biden said the THAAD's deployment, along with about 100 US soldiers, was meant to help defend Israel, which is weighing an expected retaliation against Iran after Tehran fired more than 180 missiles at Israel on Oct 1.</p>

<p>The United States has been urging Israel to calibrate its response to avoid triggering a broader war in the Middle East, officials say, with Biden publicly voicing his opposition to an Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear sites and his concerns about a strike on its energy infrastructure.</p>

<p>Responding to questions from reporters, Biden said last week he had a good understanding of when and how Israel would attack Iran. But he also said he saw an opportunity to end the two enemies' back-and-forth strikes.</p>

<p>Austin was cautious.</p>

<p>"It's hard to say exactly what that (Israel's) strike will look like," Austin told reporters.</p>

<p>"At the end of the day, that's an Israeli decision, and whether or not the Israelis believe it's proportional and how the Iranians perceive it, I mean those may be two different things."</p>

<p>"We're going to do - continue to do - everything we can ... to dial down the tensions and hopefully get both parties to begin to de-escalate. So, we'll see what happens," he added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Prime Minister of Britain Lord David Cameron today spoke about 'The India Century' at the NDTV World Summit in New Delhi. During his interaction, he mentioned about his prediction of Britain having an India-origin prime minister come true.</p>

<p>The former prime minister also spoke about why he firmly believes the 21st Century is indeed a defining one as India emerges as a leading global power. Backing India's bid for a permanent seat the UN Security Council, Lord Cameron said "it is India's rightful place to be the Security Council, but as these reforms and discussions take time, it is reassuring to see India being a key member of the Quad and G20 groupings and also now regularly being invited the G7 Summit too, as a fellow democracy. These are important for the entire world."</p>

<p>Remembering his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the diaspora event held at the Wembley Stadium, Lord Cameron said, "Those are moments that hard to forget. As a party leader in the UK, one is used to addressing the largest of gatherings of two to three thousand people. But to go to Wembley Stadium which is packed with more than 85,000 people cheering for Prime Minister Modi as I introduced him was quite remarkable."</p>

<p>"But another thing I vividly remember, and one that I found out later, is that when I making my speech at Wembley introducing PM Modi, I had made a prediction that the Conservative Party will give the UK its first women prime minister, the first Jewish prime minister, and also the first Indian-origin prime minister. Little did I know that that prediction would come true so soon. That evening there was a young leader sitting way at the back - his name is Rishi Sunak and he went on to become UK's first Indian-origin PM soon after that prediction."</p>

<p>Taking about the India-UK partnership, Lord Cameron said he has been a strong advocate of it since the early 2000s. "I had said back in 2005 that the India-UK partnership needs to be given a special status, and ties must be a privileged partnership."</p>

<p>Praising Rishi Sunak's leadership as Prime Minister, Lord Cameron said, "I admired him. I thought he was a very good prime minister. He was extremely hard working, highly intelligent, very capable, brilliant chairman (of the Conservative Party) and could bring everyone together. When he asked me to become his foreign secretary, I almost immediately said yes to it."</p>

<p>"It was a difficult time globally with the war in Ukraine and the situation in the Middle East. Being a former PM I knew I could play a part in that and It was generous of him to ask me to be his foreign secretary. He wanted experienced people to be with him. It was a very difficult inheritance for him and the year of three prime ministers was virtually impossible for anyone to recover from. But Rishi brought stability to Britain. He brought inflation down from 11 per cent to 2 per cent, he strengthened our relations with Europe and even with India. He did a very good job and he should be proud of that," Lord Cameron said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Perplexity AI Inc., an artificial intelligence company building a search product that aims to compete with Google, is in early talks to raise funding from investors at a valuation of about $9 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>The company is seeking to raise more than $500 million in the funding round, according to the person, who asked not to be identified discussing private information.</p>

<p>The new valuation, which includes the amount the company would raise, could triple its previous value of $3 billion from a funding round earlier this year. However, the discussions are still early, and the details could change, or talks could fall apart. The company declined to comment.</p>

<p>Perplexity's valuation has soared in recent months, reflecting venture capitalists' intense interest in backing AI companies. As recently as April of this year, the startup was valued at just $1 billion. Its peers and rivals have also raised large sums - including OpenAI, which completed a $6.6 billion financing at a $157 billion valuation earlier this month.</p>

<p>Perplexity's latest funding talks materialized after investors approached the company, the person said, not because the startup had set out to raise new cash.</p>

<p>Perplexity offers several services in addition to the paid and free versions of its search tool. It recently launched a product that allows organizations to search internal files alongside the internet and introduced new features for finance-related searches - including stock prices and company earnings data.</p>

<p>The company has also launched an array of revenue-sharing partnerships with major publishers, even as it has faced accusations of plagiarism from some news outlets.</p>

<p>Investors in the company include SoftBank Group Corp.'s Vision Fund 2, Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos and Nvidia Corp.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal earlier reported on the deal talks.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former British prime minister David Cameron hailed Tata Motors' takeover of Jaguar Land Rover, calling it a "big moment".</p>

<p>Speaking at the NDTV World Summit on Monday, he said it was <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/ratan-tata-death-jaguar-land-rover-ford-the-jaguar-land-rover-story-how-ratan-tata-triumphed-after-ford-snub-6758368">Tata's acquisition</a> of the British automobile company Ford's two businesses that was a "wake up moment" that the Indian economy had arrived on the global stage.</p>

<p>During his tenure as Prime Minister, Mr Cameron recalled that&nbsp;Indian investment took over Japanese investment in the United Kingdom. He also remembered industrialist Ratan Tata, who passed away earlier this month, as his advisor and also a man central to the milestone of an Indian company entering Britain and investing and growing on of its companies.</p>

<p>Mr Cameron also highlighted India's credibility in playing mediator in the Russia-Ukraine war. "We need India's perspective on the challenges we face in the world. India might be in a position to meditate but has to ensure that (Vladimir) Putin can't be allowed to take territory by force," he said.</p>

<p>On a lighter note, the former British PM said he used to follow Indian cricketer Bishan Singh Bedi, while also praising Rahul Dravid's centuries and Virat Kohli's extraordinary leadership.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former British Prime Minister David Cameron today recalled Prime Minister Narendra Modi's event at London's Wembley Stadium in 2015 and said it was "something you don't forget".</p>

<p>Speaking at the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ndtv-world-summit-2024-india-century-live-updates-pm-narendra-modi-david-cameron-s-jaishankar-to-speak-6830644" target="_blank">NDTV World Summit 2024</a>, Mr Cameron said that in the UK, if you're lucky as a prime minister or the party leader, you might speak to 3,000-4,000 people at your party conference.</p>

<p>"But to go to Wembley Stadium and introducing Prime Minister Modi, where he was speaking to 85,000 people, was quite an occasion," he said.</p>

<p>He also said that in his introduction at that event, he had said that his Conservative party - which gave the UK the first woman PM (Margaret Thatcher) - would one day give the country the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/wont-be-long-before-theres-british-indian-pm-david-cameron-1243198" target="_blank">first British-Indian prime minister</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>"India Has Credibility To Mediate In Ukraine War": David Cameron</strong></h3>

<p>David Cameron, speaking at the NDTV World Summit today, said that India can play a key role in scaling down the ongoing <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/india-has-credibility-to-mediate-in-ukraine-war-david-cameron-at-ndtv-world-summit-6836810#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll" target="_blank">war between Russia and Ukraine</a>.</p>

<p>"India has the credibility to be a mediator in the Ukraine war," he said at the event.</p>

<p>More than two and a half years into the war, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has shown no signs of any breakthrough in ceasefire talks.</p>

<p>"India might be in a position to mediate but it has to ensure that Russian President Vladimir Putin cannot be allowed to take territory by force," Mr Cameron added.</p>

<p>He also said the world needs India's perspective on the challenges it faces and the country should get a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/india-needs-permanent-seat-at-un-security-council-david-cameron-at-ndtv-world-summit-6836795#pfrom=home-ndtvworld_world_top_scroll" target="_blank">permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council</a>.</p>

<p>"You see the rise of India, which will probably become the world's largest economy at some stage in this century. So, obviously, we need a reset and countries like India should be at its heart," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi today spoke about India's rise globally at the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world" target="_blank">NDTV World Summit</a>. He spoke about why the 21st Century is 'The India Century', how the country is growing rapidly, and how investors from around the world are excited about India being the fastest growing major economy.</p>

<p>Launching <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world" target="_blank">NDTV World</a>, PM Modi spoke about the pace and momentum with which India is growing. The prime minister said, "Looking at India's rapid growth - the fastest in the world - and the infrastructure build-up in the country, several global ratings agencies have upgraded India's growth forecast." He went on to say that "Investors from around the world are keenly tracking India's growth and are excited about investing in the fastest growing market."</p>

<p>Mentioning global investor Mark Mobius, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that he "advises global fund managers that they should invest at least 50 per cent of their funds in the Indian stock market." He said that this shows how closely investors like him are following the India growth story.</p>

<p>"Today, India is a nation that is both developing at a record pace, as well as an emerging global power," PM Modi said, adding that when India speaks, the world listens.</p>

<p>"India knows how to move towards eradicating poverty while also knowing how to build a road to progress," he further said.</p>

<p>In the last ten years, India's stock market has gone from 22,300 to over 81,000, while India's economy took 63 years, from Independence to 2010, to reach a GDP of $1 trillion, it took just seven years to reached $2 trillion - in 2017, and by 2020 it reached $3 trillion. India has gone from being the 11th largest economy to now being the 5th largest economy in the world in less than 10 years.</p>

<p>"I meet many people who tell me, 'India is now the fifth largest economy in the world, so many milestones have been achieved, reforms implemented, then why are you working so hard?' In the last 10 years, 12 crore toilets have been built, and 16 crore homes have gas connections... is this enough? My answer is no. This is not enough. Today India is among the youngest countries in the world. This youth potential can take us to the skies," the Prime Minister said.</p>

<p>"The dreams we have seen, the pledge we have made, there is no rest, no relaxation," he added.</p>

<p>PM Modi also said that when India grows, the world grows. There is no ill-feeling or negativity around India's growth story. That, he said, is because India has friendly ties with almost all nations in the world and takes everyone along.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Victory in the April-June general election was a "message of stability" and victory in this month's Haryana Assembly election - have reinforced that sentiment, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Monday at the NDTV World Summit. "Stability, sustainability, and solutions... these are the most important conditions for a better future of humanity," he said.</p>

<p>Delivering the inaugural speech, Mr Modi underlined the importance of the 21st century and the many challenges facing the world, and said stable governance - in India and abroad - is needed to encourage growth and to address common concerns like climate change and global warming.</p>

<p>"This period is the most important in the 21st century. We need stability... and sustenance for growth... and India is working on it," he said, "Our third term gives this message of stability."</p>

<p>Expanding on the common concerns and India's possible contribution to solution, the Prime Minister said, "Climate change is a problem and we are trying take the lead in that fight..."</p>

<p>Acknowledging India's contribution in this fight as "insignificant" for now, Mr Modi said his government is "working on reducing carbon emissions and (other) solutions", such as the India - West Asia global corridor to improve trade and connectivity and a global solar alliance.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister also spoke extensively about India being a "beacon of hope" amid global crises over economic growth, unemployment, and public health that have been caused by the coronavirus and military tension in Ukraine and West Asia.</p>

<p>"During the coronavirus pandemic people were stressed about dealing with the virus. When that was controlled then people were worried about the economy... then climate change, the wars (in Ukraine and West Asia), global supply chains (for industries) ... these have become global worries."</p>

<p>"There are the challenges in front of India, but we feel a sense of positivity and that is why are here today - to discuss the 'India century'," the Prime Minister said.</p>

<p>Mr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party had won the Lok Sabha election - boosted by 53 seats from its allies that helped it cross the finish line - and then, on October 8, defeated the Congress in Haryana, despite trailing in early rounds of counting.</p>

<p>In both cases the BJP recorded a hat-trick - Mr Modi became a three-time Prime Minister and the saffron party became the first to win the Haryana Assembly election three times in a row.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, has announced her intention to become the president of Russia after President Vladimir Putin's regime comes to an end.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, has announced her intention to become the president of Russia after President Vladimir Putin's regime comes to an end. In an interview with the <a href="http://https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3z4ydk90vo">BBC</a>, Navalnaya expressed her determination to continue her husband's fight for democracy. “I will participate in the elections… as a candidate. My political opponent is Vladimir Putin. And I will do everything to make his regime fall as soon as possible,” she said.</p>

<p>However, for now, her fight remains in exile, for returning to Russia could lead to her arrest on charges of extremism. She told the BBC that she cannot return as long as Putin remains in power.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/putin-critic-alexei-navalnys-wife-rejects-finding-he-died-from-combination-of-illnesses-6344527">Alexei Navalny</a> died under suspicious circumstances in a penal colony after being sentenced to 19 years on "politically motivated" charges. His pursuit of exposing government corruption, particularly through his Anti-Corruption Foundation, made him Putin's most outspoken critic. While Russia denied involvement in Alexei Navalny's death, US President Joe Biden expressed certainty that Putin was responsible.</p>

<p>Since her husband's death, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/yulia-navalnya-widow-of-putin-critic-world-banks-ajay-banga-in-time-influential-leaders-list-5466379">Yulia Navalnaya</a> said their shared political beliefs and decisions have affected their children, Dasha, 23, and Zakhar, 16. “I realise that they didn't have a say in this,” she said.</p>

<p>The Navalnys were united in their determination to challenge Putin's grip on power, despite knowing the risks. In 2021, after surviving a poisoning with Novichok, a nerve agent, Alexei Navalny returned to Russia, where he was detained. Yulia, in her BBC interview, mentioned the extent of her husband's suffering in prison, including spending 295 days in solitary confinement. “Usually, the normal practice is banishment just for two weeks and it's the most severe punishment. My husband spent there almost one year,” she said.</p>

<p>Navalnaya has criticised the international community's response to her husband's death, calling the sanctions imposed on Russian officials “a joke” and urging world leaders to be “a little less afraid” of Putin. She expressed a personal desire to see the Russian president face justice, saying, “I want him to be in a Russian prison. And it's not just that — I want him to be in the same conditions like Alexei was.”</p>

<p>Yulia Navalnaya now leads the Anti-Corruption Foundation, where she plans to release further evidence implicating the Putin regime.</p>

<p>Alexei Navalny began writing his memoir, Patriot, while recuperating in the German countryside after being poisoned with Novichok. Upon his return to Russia and subsequent imprisonment, he continued to document his thoughts and experiences through notebook entries, social media posts and prison diaries, many of which are being published for the first time.</p>

<p>Navalny reported that some of his writings were confiscated by prison officials. Patriot is both illuminating and harrowing — knowing the tragic outcome of Alexei Navalny's story makes his accounts of mistreatment and his resistance resonate with even greater impact.</p>

<p>Yulia recounts her final conversations with her husband, where they both acknowledged the likelihood that he would never leave prison alive. “I never let my brain think that he might be killed,” she said. But Alexei's humour and laughter remained intact until the end, a trait Yulia calls his “superpower.”</p>

<p>“He really, truly laughed at this regime and at Vladimir Putin. That's why Vladimir Putin hated him so much,” she said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former UK Prime Minister David Cameron, speaking at the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://special.ndtv.com/ndtv-world-summit-2024-167/#pfrom=home-ndtvworld_world%20site">NDTV World Summit</a> today, said that India can play a key role in scaling down the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"India has the credibility to be a mediator in the Ukraine war," Mr Cameron said at the NDTV World Summit.</p>

<p>More than two and a half years into the war, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has shown no signs of any breakthrough in ceasefire talks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"India might be in a position to mediate but it has to ensure that Russian President Vladimir Putin cannot be allowed to take territory by force," Mr Cameron added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>President Putin on Friday said it is difficult to specify a timeline for ending the prolonged war in Ukraine but claimed that his country will win, as he appreciated Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concern over the situation.</p>

<p>Both Russia and Ukraine have denied targeting civilians in the 2-1/2-year war that Russia launched against its smaller neighbour with a full-scale invasion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Days ahead of the 16th BRICS Summit to be hosted by Moscow, President Putin endorsed PM Modi's description of the grouping, saying the Indian leader had "aptly" noted that it is "not an anti-western one but a non-western one".</p>

<p>He also made it clear the grouping, which has since been expanded from five initial members to include five more countries, should not be seen as a "bloc-style organisation".</p>

<p>PM Modi is due to visit Kazan to attend the BRICS summit on October 22-23.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world needs India's perspective on the challenges it faces and the country should get a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, former UK prime minister David Cameron has said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking at the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ndtv-world-summit-2024-india-century-live-updates-pm-narendra-modi-david-cameron-s-jaishankar-to-speak-6830644">NDTV World Summit</a> on Monday, Lord David Cameron said the world needs strong economic growth, more democracy and a green transition to deal with climate change and India is a shining example of all three things.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Cameron's session at the Summit was after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/india-on-path-of-unprecedented-growth-pms-top-quotes-at-ndtv-world-summit-6836611">keynote speech</a> and the former UK prime minister began by commenting on that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It was great to hear PM Modi's speech. To have that energy level at the start of your third term is truly impressive... I made it into a second term (as UK prime minister) but since then we have had quite a number of prime ministers. We have not had anyone having three terms since Tony Blair and Margaret Thatcher before him. It (PM Modi's third term) is very impressive because it means you have the ability to get real change, real things done in a very consistent way, which is what we are seeing in India," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the India Century, Mr Cameron said there is a need for a reset because the world has changed "hugely" since the institutions were set up after the Second World War.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You see the rise of India, which will probably become the world's largest economy at some stage in this century. So, obviously, we need a reset and countries like India should be at its heart," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To a question on his statement from 2015 that India should have a permanent seat at the UN Security Council, Mr Cameron said that should be India's right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We do need reform of the United Nations Security Council and I made this argument as far back as 2005. When I became leader of the Conservative Party, India was the first country I visited outside Europe. It was the first country I visited outside Europe when I became prime minister in 2010. I like to think that I was an early believer in the Indian Century. Obviously, a permanent seat on the Security Council should be India's right in this changed world," he emphasised.</p>

<p>Stating that changing these institutions would take a long time, the former UK prime minister said it was good to see India take its place in institutions like the Quad and the G20. He also pointed out that the G7 regularly invites India to attend, almost as a standing member.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Free Trade Agreement</strong></p>

<p>On the free trade agreement (FTA) between India and the UK that former prime minister Boris Johnson had said would be concluded by Diwali in 2022, Mr Cameron said it was a pity it hadn't happened.</p>

<p>"I think it has not happened for a good reason. Britain and India both understand that you get only one chance to make an FTA and you have to make it a good one, which means both sides have to put more on the table. My plea, which I will be making to the foreign minister when I see him this afternoon, is that let's make our deal as good and as big and as generous (as possible)," Mr Cameron said.</p>

<p>"Of course, we have to cover scotch whisky and IT workers for India. We need Indian investment in the UK and trade with India, but also India needs the millions of jobs being created every year. So it is win-win, but we should both put more on the table and take some more risk, including political risk," he added.</p>

<p>Mr Cameron stressed that doing so was also important for India because it would set the standard for its deal with the European Union.</p>

<p><strong>Shift In Perception</strong></p>

<p>To a question on when he thought the West's perception of India shifted, the former UK prime minister said there have been various moments, including Chandrayaan-3, which saw the first successful landing near the Moon's south pole. For him, he said, it was the year that Indian investment in the UK overtook Japanese investment because of the Jaguar Land Rover deal by the Tata Group.</p>

<p>"There have been so many moments in India's recent history which have woken people up to the potential of this great country - the opening in 1991, the moment when it was clear India's population would overtake China, this huge green transition and green investment, and the lunar mission, which was an extraordinary moment when the whole world saw what the potential of India is," Mr Cameron said.</p>

<p>"My answer, though, would be a bit more parochial. It was the year when Indian investment in the UK overtook Japanese investment because of the massive investment in Jaguar Land Rover. Here was this great iconic business, Tata - obviously mourning the loss of Ratan Tata, who was an advisor to me as prime minister - an Indian company coming into Britain, taking over one of our most famous car brands, investing in it, growing it and improving it. That, to me, was a real wake-up call that this economy has arrived on the global stage and is going to do great things," he added.</p>

<p><strong>Indian Students In UK</strong></p>

<p>Asked about the anti-immigration rhetoric in the UK and its possible impact on Indian students, who make up the biggest cohort of international students in the country, Mr Cameron made a distinction between that and illegal migration.</p>

<p>The former prime minister said there is no limit on the number of Indian students that can study at British universities and the UK wants as many to come as possible because it is a "great industry" for them and builds great connections between the UK and India.</p>

<p>He pushed for taking student numbers out of immigration numbers and said the real problem in the UK was illegal migration from countries like Syria, Vietnam, Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan.</p>

<p><strong>Russia-Ukraine Mediation?</strong></p>

<p>Mr Cameron said the world is seeing conflicts in the Middle East as well as the Russia-Ukraine situation and stressed that there is a need to reestablish norms of behaviour. Referring to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, he said he could not think of a clearer example in his political lifetime of one country invading another with no excuse or justification.</p>

<p>Asked whether India could play the role of mediator given PM Modi's earlier visit to Ukraine and his upcoming visit to Russia for the BRICS summit, Mr Cameron said India has the credibility to do so.</p>

<p>"We need to get back to some clear norms. This country (India) has suffered terribly from terrorism, so has my own. We need to have an understanding that there are no good terrorists and bad terrorists. We need to get back to the understanding that a country's borders are, or should be, inviolable... I know in the West we are accused of double standards and we have made mistakes, obviously referring to Iraq, but two wrongs don't make a right," he said.</p>

<p>On what's happening at India's border with China, Mr Cameron said that ties in with his point on territorial integrity.</p>

<p>"When you see the most grotesque violation of a country's borders, as you have with Ukraine, we all need to stand together and say to Russia that what has happened is wrong. India might well be in a position to try and provide some mediation, but it must be mediation based on the fact that Vladimir Putin cannot be allowed to take territory by force and be rewarded. We know from our history that if you reward people for taking territory by force, they come back and take some more," he said.</p>

<p><strong>'Brooke Bond, James Bond'</strong></p>

<p>Mr Cameron recalled PM Modi's reception at London's Wembley stadium in 2015 and said it was "quite an occasion" and "something you don't forget".</p>

<p>"In the UK - if you're lucky - as a prime minister or the party leader, you might speak to 3,000-4,000 people at your party conference. But to go to Wembley Stadium and introduce Prime Minister Modi, where you are speaking to 85,000 people, that was quite an occasion," he said.</p>

<p>He said it was at that event that he had spoken about his Conservative Party giving the UK the first woman prime minister, the first Jewish prime minister and that he was sure the country would have the first British Indian prime minister.</p>

<p>"When I said that, I did not know there was a young man in the back row, called Rishi Sunak. He was at that speech with Prime Minister Modi... PM Modi made a very powerful speech, I remember he was talking about the relationship between UK and India and he had this great riff on tea, movies and finance. It was Brooke Bond, James Bond and Rupee Bond. I thought it was a very snappy soundbite," he recalled.</p>

<p><strong>'Rishi Sunak Very Capable'</strong></p>

<p>Mr Cameron also said it was an honour to serve as the foreign secretary under Rishi Sunak.</p>

<p>"I admired him. I think we was a very good prime minister. He is extremely hard-working, highly intelligent, very capable, very good at bringing people together... He had a very difficult inheritance, I think the year of three prime ministers was probably impossible to recover from, but Rishi brought stability," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I think we can be proud that someone whose parents had arrived in Britain from India... that within two generations he has the most important job in the country. I think that reflects well on Britain... It is remarkable, it is a great testament to our country and to your talent that this is possible, and this has happened," the former prime minister said. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump made an appearance at Sunday night's NFL game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and New York Jets at Acrisure Stadium.</p>

<p>The former US president was spotted in the luxury box, waving to fans and soaking in the atmosphere as chants of “USA” rang out across the stadium.</p>

<p>Fresh off a campaign stop in Pennsylvania that included a stint <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-turns-chef-at-mcdonalds-ahead-of-us-presidential-elections-2024-says-worked-more-than-kamala-harris-6835696 ">working at a local McDonald's</a>, Donald Trump's presence at the game capped a busy weekend of election rallies in the swing state.<br />
<br />
Earlier in the day, Trump was joined by two controversial ex-Steelers, Antonio Brown and Le'Veon Bell, who endorsed the GOP candidate. Before kickoff, Brown and Bell distributed Trump-Vance rally towels outside the stadium and encouraged people to register to vote. The two former football stars have a complicated history with the Steelers, having left the team under tense circumstances in 2019.<br />
<br />
Antonio Brown, in particular, is remembered for his tumultuous exit from the Steelers after a series of public incidents. His behaviour has since alienated him from the NFL, though he did win a Super Bowl with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers before being let go.<br />
<br />
Before the lead-up to Sunday's game, Donald Trump shared an AI-generated image of himself in a Steelers jersey on his social media account. The altered photo was posted ahead of the Week 7 matchup.</p>

<p>When he arrived at the game, Donald Trump was greeted by supporters outside the stadium, including fans sporting Pittsburgh jerseys and holding a banner that read “Trump Nation.” The energy in the stands was palpable when a female fan ran onto the field in the third quarter, carrying a pro-Trump sign before being escorted off by security.<br />
<br />
The Steelers organisation remained neutral regarding Trump's attendance, with a spokesperson confirming that the former president was invited by a private suite holder and not the team itself.&nbsp;<br />

Meanwhile, other Steelers icons, including Hall of Famers Joe Greene and Jerome Bettis, have endorsed Democratic nominee Kamala Harris ahead of the November 5 presidential elections.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA["Digital Innovation, Democratic Values Can Co-Exist": PM Modi At NDTV World Summit]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India showed the world that digital innovation and democratic values can co-exist, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in his keynote address at the NDTV World Summit today.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister said India's Digital Public Infrastructure is a key talking point at global summits. "Paul Romer (Nobel laureate and former Chief Economist of the World Bank) is here. We have had many discussions. Paul has praised India's digital infrastructure, including Aadhaar and DigiLocker. In world summits, people are surprised at how India developed such a digital public infrastructure."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Prime Minister said India did not have the first-mover advantage during the Internet era. "In the countries that had this advantage, private companies led the digital push. A revolution came, but its benefit was limited. India gave a new model to the world. India democratised technology and showed the world the way to digital public infrastructure," the Prime Minister said.</p>

<p>In India, he said, the government creates a platform and it undergoes several rounds of innovations. "Jandhan, Aadhaar and mobile connectivity have become a seamless system of fast and leakage-free service delivery. "Look at UPI, it has led to an expansion of fintech in India. More than 500 million digital transactions are happening through UPI daily. And this is not driven by big corporates, but by small shopowners and street vendors."</p>

<p>Mentioning the government's PM Gati Shakti and ONDC initiatives, the Prime Minister said, "India has shown digital innovation and democratic values can co-exist. India has shown that technology is a tool for inclusion, transparency and empowerment, not for control and division."</p>

<p>This is the most important time in the 21st century, he said. "We need stability and sustenance for growth and India is working on it. This is the first time in six decades that the people of India have given a government a mandate for the third term. This is a message of stability.</p>

<p>"Climate change is now a global problem and India is trying to take a lead in this fight too. Our contribution is negligible in global climate change, but we have made green transmission the fuel for growth," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kirat Assi, a London resident and radio presenter, thought she was finally going to meet the man she'd fallen in love with. They had texted each other for nine years. However, when the two came face-to-face, Ms Assi found someone she never expected. In a shocking twist, her entire relationship had been an elaborate catfishing scheme, orchestrated not by a stranger but by someone much closer — a female cousin, Simran. Now, Netflix has released a documentary, <em>Sweet Bobby: My Catfish Nightmare,</em> retelling this story of betrayal.</p>

<p>It all began in 2009 when Ms Assi&nbsp;got a friend request from ‘Bobby,' a supposed cardiologist from west London. Soon, it evolved into a long-distance relationship. The two shared connections within their Sikh community, which made the relationship seem genuine.</p>

<p>Over time, their online conversations deepened, but as years passed, their connection remained virtual, with Bobby continually giving bizarre reasons for why they couldn't meet in person. The excuses were nothing short of dramatic — claims of being shot, suffering a stroke and even entering witness protection — according to a report in <a href="http://https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20m3g1kdpvo">BBC</a>. However, what made these lies convincing to Ms Assi&nbsp;were the people she believed were corroborating his stories. They were always someone close to Bobby, or that's what she thought.</p>

<p>After nine years of emotional manipulation, Ms Assi&nbsp;finally confronted the truth — this entire thing was a hoax, and the man she thought she was in love with didn't even exist. She had been a victim of a catfishing scheme and the person behind the messages wasn't Bobby but her female cousin, Simran.</p>

<p>According to an article in Birmingham Live, throughout the ordeal, Ms Assi, in fact, leaned on Simran for support. However, one day, Simran dropped the bombshell, revealing to a devastated Ms Assi&nbsp;that she hadn't been communicating with Bobby all along — she had been speaking to Simran herself.</p>

<p>The discovery left Ms Assi&nbsp;devastated and questioning her judgement. “How could you have been so stupid?” she reflects now, according to a&nbsp;<a href="http://https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20m3g1kdpvo">BBC</a> report.</p>

<p>Kirat Assi's experience was first shared in a popular 2021 podcast by Tortoise, but the story has since gained renewed attention with the release of the Netflix documentary, Sweet Bobby: My Catfish Nightmare.</p>

<p>Ms Assi says she has faced criticism and questions, with many asking how she could fall for such a scheme. “For people who might still think I'm stupid, that's fine, you're allowed your opinion,” she told BBC Asian Network News, adding, “I'm not stupid, I'm not dumb. I'm the one that's chosen to speak. I'm the one that's put myself out in the firing line and I hope others will come forward.”</p>

<p>Ms Assi feels it was important to publicly tell her story, especially given the stigmas surrounding such issues in the South Asian community in the UK. Explaining how the fear of judgement often silences victims, she said, “We are so scared to open up about these issues. Because of how a community will be seen by wider society, the victims in our communities keep suffering.”</p>

<p>This reluctance to address uncomfortable topics was evident even in her own family. Speaking of her father's experience with the situation, Kirat Assi said, “He doesn't want to know what happened. Because to face up to what happened, and how horrific it was, it's going to be painful.”</p>

<p>Despite the traumatic experience, Kirat Assi remains open to having conversations about her experience, encouraging people to approach her if they have questions.</p>

<p>Simran, however, has not faced criminal charges for the catfishing, but Ms Assi took civil action against her, resulting in compensation and an apology. In the Netflix documentary, a statement from Simran was included where she said she views the situation as a “private matter,” rejecting the accusations made against her.</p>

<p>Although Kirat Assi has sought closure, she says the motivation behind Simran's deceit remains a mystery. “I think I've long given up. The extent to which that person went, you can't ever justify it. I can't understand why you didn't stop,” Ms Assi&nbsp;said.</p>

<p>Despite this, she is determined to move forward, rebuilding her life and even starting to date again. “I'm going to carry on working towards goals and dreams,” she said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Swedish prosecutors confirmed Tuesday a rape probe following media reports that French footballer Kylian Mbappe was being investigated after a visit to Stockholm but did not name the suspect.</p>

<p>On Monday, Swedish newspapers Aftonbladet and Expressen reported that a rape investigation had been opened following Mbappe's two-day visit to the Nordic capital.</p>

<p>"In response to media reports about a suspected rape in Stockholm, the prosecutor can confirm that a criminal report has been submitted to the police," Sweden's Prosecution Authority said in a statement.</p>

<p>It added that the alleged incident occurred at a hotel on October 10, but did not name a suspect and said no further information could be shared for the moment.</p>

<p>Expressen on Monday identified Mbappe as the suspect, citing anonymous sources, while Aftonbladet said Tuesday it had also had obtained information confirming Mbappe was the suspect.</p>

<p>Expressen said Mbappe was "reasonably suspected" of rape and sexual assault, the lower of two grades of suspicion in the Swedish legal system.</p>

<p>Contacted by AFP on Monday, Mbappe's entourage said it had no knowledge of a legal complaint made against him.</p>

<p>The French international was not selected for his country's latest round of Nations League matches, so visited the Swedish capital with a group of people last Thursday.</p>

<p>According to Aftonbladet, they dined at a restaurant before going to a nightclub. Mbappe and the group left Sweden on Friday.</p>

<p>Aftonbladet said the complaint was filed on Saturday after the alleged victim had sought medical attention.</p>

<p>Expressen reported Tuesday that police had seized some clothing as evidence, saying it consisted of women's underwear, a pair of black trousers and a black top.</p>

<p>On Monday, Mbappe himself claimed in a post on X that there was a link between the Aftonbladet report and his hearing before a French league committee on Tuesday, in his bitter dispute with his former club Paris Saint-Germain over what he says are unpaid wages.</p>

<p>Mbappe claims he is owed 55 million euros ($60 million) by the Qatari-owned French champions.</p>

<p>"FAKE NEWS !!!!. It's becoming so predictable, on the eve of the hearing, as if by chance," Mbappe posted.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One person was killed and another wounded in a shooting attack near the southern Israeli city of Ashdod on Tuesday, a hospital said.</p>

<p>"A short time ago, two injured people from the shooting incident on Route 4 were taken to the hospital. One patient died on his way to the hospital," the Assuta hospital said in a statement.</p>

<p>Police said officers were at the scene of the shooting near the Yavne South interchange, which is about 30 kilometres (18 miles) south of the Israeli commercial hub Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>"The circumstances surrounding the incident are still under investigation, and the motive has not yet been established," police said in a statement.</p>

<p>The shooting comes just days after one person was killed and five wounded during a stabbing rampage in four different locations in the central town of Hadera on Wednesday before the assailant was "neutralised".</p>

<p>Palestinian militant group Hamas later praised the attack, saying it was a "heroic stabbing operation" and calling "for more painful strikes against the occupation".</p>

<p>And earlier this month, seven people were killed in a shooting and stabbing claimed by Hamas in Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>Palestinian militants have carried out several attacks on Israelis since October 7 last year, when Hamas attacked southern Israel, sparking war in Gaza.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The night sky is about to put on a spectacular show this week. The Hunter's Moon, the third of four consecutive supermoons in 2024, will rise on Thursday, October 17. The full Moon, apart from being bigger and brighter than usual, also holds significance across cultures and festivals.</p>

<p><strong>The Hunter's moon</strong></p>

<p>The Hunter's moon, traditionally the first full moon after the Harvest Moon, was named by early English and American farmers for the time fields were clear of crops and hunting became easier. The Moon will reach its peak at 7:26 am EDT (4:56 pm IST) on Thursday, but you can expect it to appear full from Tuesday evening through Friday morning, reports <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/skywatching/the-next-full-moon-is-a-supermoon-and-the-hunters-moon/Â ">NASA</a>.</p>

<p>Just a day before the full moon, on Wednesday, October 16, the Moon will reach its perigee, the point in its orbit where it is closest to Earth.</p>

<p><strong>Why does the moon appear brighter during a supermoon?</strong></p>

<p>The moon's orbit around Earth is elliptical -- oval-shaped -- positioning it at various distances from the planet, depending on the time of the month and its location along that orbital path. The distances range from about 226,000 miles to 251,000 miles, according to NASA.</p>

<p><strong>When and where to watch</strong></p>

<p>The best time to view this supermoon is just after sunset when it hovers low above the horizon. The Moon will be visible worldwide, but the timing will differ depending on your location.</p>

<p>For India, the supermoon will reach its peak at 4:56 pm IST on Thursday, October 17, and will be visible in the evenings from October 15 through October 18. Stargazers in New Zealand and areas east of the International Date Line will get to enjoy the supermoon early on Friday, October 18, while those in the western United States will see the full moon late on Wednesday night, October 16.</p>

<p>The moon will appear full for around three days.</p>

<p><strong>Cultural significance of the Supermoon</strong></p>

<p>This October supermoon carries significant meaning across cultures:</p>

<ul>
	<li>For Hindus, this full moon is celebrated as Sharad Purnima, a harvest festival that marks the end of monsoon and is dedicated to the moon god.</li>
	<li>For Buddhists, it signifies the end of the three-month Vassa, or Buddhist Lent, observed during the rainy season.</li>
	<li>In Judaism, this full moon coincides with the start of Sukkot, a week-long festival marking the harvest and the journey of the Israelites in the wilderness.</li>
	<li>In Myanmar, it overlaps with the Thadingyut Festival of Lights, a celebration to welcome the Buddha's return from heaven.</li>
</ul>

<p>This October Hunter's Moon will provide the biggest and brightest show of the year, making it a must-see for skywatchers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The India-Canada relations nosedived after Justin Trudeau said last year that there was credible intelligence linking India's government to the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India and Canada have been dealing with an unprecedented diplomatic crisis after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged that Indian government agents were involved in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada. India has rejected Canada's allegations, terming it "absurd" and "politically motivated."</p>

<p>On Monday, Canada expelled six Indian diplomats and consular officials in connection with a probe of the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ndtv-explains-hardeep-singh-nijjar-killing-lawrence-bishnoi-gang-trade-talks-how-india-canada-relations-soured-6793249">killing of Nijjar in British Columbia</a> in 2023.</p>

<p>India has also announced its decision to expel six Canadian diplomats, which include Canada's Acting High Commissioner in India, Steward Ross Wheeler, Deputy High Commissioner in India Patrick Hebert and First Secretary Marie Catherine Joly.</p>

<p>Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner, Mike Duheme on Monday (local time) claimed that they have information on certain criminal activity carried out by agents of the Indian government.</p>

<p>He said, "In the past few years and more recently, law enforcement agencies in Canada have successfully investigated and charged a significant number of individuals for their direct involvement in homicides, extortions and other criminal acts of violence. In addition, there have been well over a dozen credible imminent threats to life which have led to the conduct of duty to warn, by law enforcement with members of South Asian community and specifically, members of the pro-Khalistan movement."</p>

<p>In a statement on Monday, India "strongly" rejected a diplomatic communication from Canada suggesting that the Indian High Commissioner and other diplomats were "persons of interest" in an investigation and termed it as "preposterous imputations" and part of the political agenda of the Justin Trudeau government.</p>

<p>The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's hostility to India has long been in evidence and his government has consciously provided space to violent extremists and terrorists "to harass, threaten and intimidate Indian diplomats and community leaders in Canada".</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indian-expels-6-canadian-diplomats-amid-spiraling-tension-6789267">India-Canada relations reached a new low</a> after Hardeep Singh Nijjar's killing in 2023. However, the history of strained ties between India and Canada extends beyond current events.</p>

<h3><strong>Events That Led To Strained Ties Between India And Canada</strong></h3>

<p><strong>February 2018:</strong> A convicted Khalistani terrorist Jaspal Atwal, who was active in the banned International Sikh Youth Federation, posed with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's former wife Sophie Trudeau at an event in Mumbai, during the Canadian first family's visit to India.</p>

<p>Jaspal Atwal was also invited for a formal dinner with the Canadian Prime Minister, hosted by the Canadian High Commissioner in Delhi. However, the invitation to Atwal to Trudeau's reception was rescinded. Atwal was convicted of the attempted murder of Punjab minister, Malkiat Singh Sidhu, on Vancouver Island in 1986.</p>

<p><strong>June 2023:</strong> Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar was shot outside a Gurdwara in British Columbia's Surrey on June 18, 2023.</p>

<p><strong>August 2023:</strong> A Hindu temple was vandalised in Canada by extremist elements, with Khalistan referendum posters in the late hours of Saturday, Australia Today reported. The incident happened in British Columbia province in Canada.</p>

<p><strong>September 2023:</strong> Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited India to attend the G20 Summit on September 9-10 last year. During his bilateral talks with Trudeau on the sidelines of the G20 Summit, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-modi-conveys-strong-concerns-about-anti-india-activities-of-extremist-elements-in-canada-to-justin-trudeau-4377475">Prime Minister Narendra Modi</a> raised "strong concerns" about the continuous "anti-India activities" by extremist elements in Canada, and stated that it is essential for the two countries to cooperate in dealing with such threats, according to MEA.</p>

<p>Even as Canadian PM Trudeau was in India for the G20 Leaders' summit, Khalistani secessionists held a so-called 'Referendum' in Surrey, British Columbia.</p>

<p>Designated terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun was present at the gathering of the Khalistani separatists held at the Guru Nanak Singh Gurudwara in Surrey. He used intimidating language against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and other leaders.</p>

<p><strong>September 18, 2023:</strong>&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/khalistani-terrorist-hardeep-singh-nijjar-killing-canada-pm-justin-trudeaus-fresh-charge-deepens-diplomatic-row-with-india-4415993">Justin Trudeau</a> made the stunning revelation in the House of Commons that there was credible intelligence linking India's government to the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar outside Gurdwara.</p>

<p>In the aftermath, India swiftly retaliated by issuing a statement that denied any involvement in the issue, terming them "absurd and politically motivated."</p>

<p>The Ministry of External Affairs has said that Canada has consistently given space to anti-India extremists. According to the MEA, Canada has not been able to present any evidence to back its claims over Nijjar's killing.</p>

<p>India also suspended its visa services in Canada after Trudeau alleged the Indian government's involvement in the killing of a Khalistani terrorist in June.</p>

<p><strong>October 2023:</strong> Canada pulled out 41 diplomats from India and also halted its visa and consular services in Chandigarh, Mumbai, and Bengaluru consulates in the wake of the Union government's decision to strip them of their immunity.</p>

<p>This came after New Delhi conveyed its concerns to Ottawa over the disproportionate number of diplomats in India and sought a 'parity' in diplomatic strength.</p>

<p>Later in October, India resumed visa services in Canada for four categories after a considered review of the security situation which "takes into account some recent Canadian measures in this regard".</p>

<p>Entry visa, Business visa, Medical visa and Conference visa are four categories in which India has decided to resume visa services in Canada with effect from October 26.</p>

<p><strong>November 2023:</strong> Indian High Commissioner in Canada, Sanjay Kumar Verma said that India is only asking for "specific and relevant" evidence in the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar so that it can help Canada in reaching the conclusion of the investigation.</p>

<p>The National Investigation Agency (NIA) registered a case against 'listed individual terrorist' Gurpatwant Singh Pannun over his viral video threatening the passengers flying in Air India and the airlines with a global blockade and closure of its operations from November 19.</p>

<p>The NIA booked Pannun under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. In the video, Pannun urged the Sikhs not to fly on Air India planes on and after November 19 claiming a threat to their lives if they flew on Air India. He also threatened that Air India would not be allowed to operate in the world.</p>

<p><strong>April 2024:</strong> At the Khalsa Day Celebrations that took place in Toronto, loud chants of pro-Khalistan slogans were seen being raised in the presence of Justin Trudeau, as well as opposition leader Pierre Poilievre.</p>

<p>As Trudeau was about to take the stage for his address to mark Khalsa Day, the chants were heard getting louder till he arrived and commenced his speech in the video released by Canada-based CPAC TV. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow were also present at the event.</p>

<p><strong>May 2024:</strong> The Canadian Police arrested and charged three individuals in connection with the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar. The three individuals were identified as Karanpreet Singh (28), Kamalpreet Singh (22), and Karan Brar (22).</p>

<p>A few days later, the Canadian Police arrested a fourth suspect over his alleged involvement in the killing of Nijjar. The accused was identified as Amandeep Singh (22).</p>

<p><strong>June 2024:</strong> Canada's Members of Parliament from all parties observed a moment of silence for Nijjar.</p>

<p><strong>July 2024:</strong> The BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir in Edmonton fell victim to vandalism. Member of Parliament for Nepean, Chandra Arya, voiced deep concern over the escalating incidents of hate-fueled violence directed at Hindu-Canadian communities.</p>

<p><strong>October 2024:</strong> On October 15, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hardeep-singh-nijjar-killing-bishnoi-gang-canada-bishnoi-gang-linked-to-indian-government-agents-canada-cops-big-claim-6792233">Justin Trudeau</a> accused agents of the Indian government on Monday of engaging in "clandestine information-gathering techniques, coercive behavior targeting Canadians, and involvement in threatening and violent acts."</p>

<p>Citing evidence from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Trudeau claimed that Indian government officials were involved in activities that posed a threat to public safety.</p>

<p>"As the RCMP Commissioner stated earlier they have clear and compelling evidence that agents of the Government of India have engaged in and continue to engage in activities that pose a significant threat to public safety. This includes clandestine information-gathering techniques, coercive behavior targeting South Asian Canadians, and involvement in a dozen threatening and violating acts, including murder. This is unacceptable," Trudeau alleged while addressing the press conference.</p>

<p>He further claimed that Canadian law enforcement had "made several attempts" to work with Indian counterparts on these matters but were "repeatedly refused."</p>

<p>Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs Melanie Joly has said that the decision to expel Indian diplomats was based on evidence gathered by the RCMP in the Nijjar killing case and urged the Indian government to support the ongoing probe for the benefit of two nations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[India-Canada diplomatic ties soured further this week after allegations by Canadian federal police that "agents" of Delhi are working with organised criminals to "target (the) South Asian community... specifically pro-Khalistani elements" there.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India-Canada diplomatic ties soured further this week after allegations by Canadian federal police that "agents" of Delhi are working with organised criminals - including the Bishnoi gang linked to last week's <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/how-shooters-used-procession-firecrackers-as-cover-to-kill-baba-siddique-6782217" target="_blank">murder of ex-Maharashtra minister Baba Siddique</a> - to "target (the) South Asian community... specifically pro-Khalistani elements" in that country.</p>

<p>The allegations were preceded by each side ejecting six diplomats, including high-ranking envoys like Canada's acting High Commissioner, Stewart Wheeler, and India's High Commissioner, Sanjay Verma. Delhi later said it was pulling its staff over security concerns.</p>

<p>India issued a stern rebuttal to Canada's claims about its 'expelled' staff being 'persons of interest' in cases of alleged extortion and murder, slamming the "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm?dtl/38417" target="_blank">preposterous imputations</a>" and the "political agenda" of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government before an election.</p>

<p>That was followed by Mr Trudeau holding a press conference - after his police force's claims - in which he backed the cops' charges and criticised "a fundamental error" - that India thinks it can "engage in supporting criminal activity against Canadians, here on Canadian soil".</p>

<p><strong>READ |&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hardeep-singh-nijjar-killing-bishnoi-gang-canada-bishnoi-gang-linked-to-indian-government-agents-canada-cops-big-claim-6792233" target="_blank">"Bishnoi Gang Linked To Indian Government Agents": Canada Cops' Claim</a></p>

<p>"Whether it be murders or extortion or other violent acts, it is absolutely unacceptable," Mr Trudeau said, claiming also that his administration had "shared our concerns" with Delhi.</p>

<p>He said Canadian police had spoken to Indian government officials but been rebuffed.</p>

<p>The allegation - that "agents of the Indian government" are colluding with organised crime bosses to target Canadian citizens - is a sharp escalation in the diplomatic row between the two countries, a row that erupted in September last year, when Mr Trudeau accused the Indian government of involvement in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.</p>

<h3><strong>India-Canada Diplomatic Row Background</strong></h3>

<p>The India-Canada row erupted in September last year after Justin Trudeau's comment about "credible allegation" about "agents" of the Indian government being linked to the killing of Nijjar, a Canadian citizen, was shot dead outside a gurdwara in Vancouver three months earlier.</p>

<p>The "mastermind" of the Khalistani Tiger Force, a designated terror group, Nijjar was high on India's 'most wanted list' for multiple crimes; in July, anti-terror agency NIA announced a cash reward of Rs 10 lakh for his capture for the murder of a Hindu priest in Punjab's Jalandhar.</p>

<p>Responding to Canada's claims India then, as it has since, issued a firm denial, calling the allegation "absurd" and motivated", and pointing out that no evidence had been provided.</p>

<p><strong>READ |&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hardeep-singh-nijjar-killing-justin-trudeau-doubles-down-on-charges-after-india-canada-diplomatic-showdown-6791322#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll" target="_blank">Trudeau Doubles Down On Charges After India-Canada Diplomatic Row</a></p>

<p>The allegations drove already tense relations - in July 2023 India served Canada a demarche asking for action against Khalistani separatists threatening its diplomats, and, in March, there were security breaches at Indian consulates in the United States and Canada - further south.</p>

<p>The Indian government took a very dim view of the attacks and expressed strong concerns about continuing anti-India activities of extremist elements in Canada". The External Affairs Ministry spoke about a "nexus" of criminal activity in that country should be a focus for both sides.</p>

<p>All of this followed an operation by police in India to track down and arrest Khalistani separatist and radical preacher Amritpal Singh, and over 100 members of his outfit, the 'Waris Punjab De'.</p>

<p>Delhi also served a demarche in 2022, asking Ottawa to stop a 'Khalistan referendum' by Gurpatwant Pannun's Sikhs For Justice, another separatist outfit branded as a terror group.</p>

<h3><strong>Trade Talks Paused, G20 Tension</strong></h3>

<p>Days before Canada's unsubstantiated claim about "agents of the Indian government" trade talks with Delhi were paused. Canada's Trade Minister, Mary Ng, then said the talks would remain paused while Mr Trudeau's government investigates the "credible allegations".</p>

<p><strong>READ |&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/india-canada-trade-talks-mary-ng-on-paused-trade-talks-canada-minister-says-focus-on-hardeep-nijjar-case-4581447" target="_blank">On Paused Trade Talks, Canada Minister Says "Focus" On Nijjar Case</a></p>

<p>She did not confirm a direct link between Nijjar's killing and the paused trade talks.</p>

<p>The two nations have been in talks over a trade deal since 2010.</p>

<p>The halting of trade talks came shortly before Mr Trudeau flew to India for the G20 summit, which led to a few awkward moments. These included the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/technical-issue-in-justin-trudeaus-grounded-plane-fixed-delegation-to-fly-out-of-india-this-afternoon-canada-foreign-ministry-4382107" target="_blank">Canadian leader's plane being grounded</a> due to technical issues on the day of his scheduled departure - and the replacement then being diverted.</p>

<p>Mr Trudeau's India visit also included sharp comments from Prime Minister Narendra Modi about "anti-India" activities being permitted to take place on Canadian soil.</p>

<p>He leader later said his country would "always defend freedom of expression... of conscience... of peaceful protest" but also "always prevent violence and push back against hatred."</p>

<h3><strong>Canada Parliament Honours Nijjar</strong></h3>

<p>In June, in a move that triggered a furious response from India, the Canadian Parliament observed a moment's silence on the one-year anniversary of Nijjar's death.</p>

<p>The Indian government responded with a stern statement, saying it would "naturally oppose any move giving political space to extremism and advocacy of violence".</p>

<p>The Indian consulate in Vancouver hit back with a tribute to the 329 victims of the Air India Montreal-London flight bombed by Khalistani terrorists in 1985.</p>

<p>On that subject an Indian-origin Canada MP, Chandra Arya, said the ideology responsible for the terrorist attack is still alive among a few people in his country.</p>

<h3><strong>What Does The US Say?</strong></h3>

<p>The United States - which last month <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/completely-unwarranted-india-on-us-court-summons-over-khalistani-terrorist-6600977" target="_blank">summoned the Indian government</a> after Pannun filed a civil lawsuit, alleging a plot to murder him - has said it is "deeply concerned" by the claims and, in May this year, called on Delhi to take allegations against it "very seriously and investigate".</p>

<p>The Indian government has set up a high-level committee to inquire into the charges.</p>

       <description><![CDATA["To build a city on Mars that can grow by itself likely requires at least a million tons of equipment, which would therefore require >$1000 trillion," Elon Musk, SpaceX CEO wrote on X (formerly Twitter).]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 1000X improvement in rocket and spacecraft technology can vastly bring down the cost of building a city on Mars, Elon Musk has said on social media, responding to a user's post.</p>

<p>On Monday, X user @WholeMarsBlog posted a graphic explaining the cost of launching to low earth orbit. It said, âToday, launching a spacecraft is 10x cheaper than it was a decade ago.â</p>

<p>They captioned it âWhen Elon Musk enters an industryâ¦â</p>

<p>In response, Elon Musk shared a long explainer with a cost breakdown and possible resolution. He pointed out that recent âUS Mars missions have had a cost per ton of useful load to the surface of Mars of about $1B. Moreover, it has become more, not less, expensive over time!â</p>

<p>The increased cost acts as a hurdle in making life on Mars a reality. âTo build a city on Mars that can grow by itself likely requires at least a million tons of equipment, which would therefore require &gt;$1000 trillion, an obviously impossible number, given that US GDP is only $29T,â he added.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Since your handle is âWhole Marsâ, perhaps this lengthy reply is apropos:<br />
<br />
Getting the cost per ton to the surface of Mars low enough that humanity has the resources to make life multiplanetary requires a roughly 1000X improvement in rocket &amp; spacecraft technology.<br />

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>However, there is a solution. If rocket technology can be improved by 1000 times, the cost of becoming sustainably multiplanetary would drop to $1 trillion. And if this could be spread over 40 years, the cost would translate to less than $25 billion annually</p>

<p>âAt that cost, it becomes possible to make life multiplanetary, ensuring the long-term survival of life as we know it, without materially affecting people's standard of living on Earth,â he added.</p>

<p>Musk mentioned SpaceX's Starship, designed to achieve over 1,000X improvement over existing systems. âEspecially after yesterday's booster catch and precise ocean landing of the ship, I am now convinced that it can work,â he said.</p>

<p>On Sunday, SpaceX's Starship had its fifth test flight. Starship is referred to as the most powerful launch system ever developed, with the capacity to carry up to 100 people on long-duration, interplanetary flights.</p>

<p>The Starship's design demonstrates reusability, a crucial factor in reducing costs.</p>

<p>âBuilding cities on Mars will require affordable delivery of significant quantities of cargo and crew. The fully reusable Starship system uses on-orbit propellent transfer to enable the transport of up to 100 people to Mars or other distant destinations,â explains SpaceX.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The controversy erupted when a Reddit user posted an image of the candle.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bath and Body Works is facing flak for its âSnowed In' candle, which, according to critics, resembles the hoods and robes of the Ku Klux Klan. Following a wave of outrage on social media, the American retail store chain removed the product from its website and physical stores.</p>

<p>âAt Bath &amp; Body Works, we are committed to listening to our teams and customers, and committed to fixing any mistakes we make â even those that are unintentional like this one,â the company said in a statement, adding they were âswiftly working to have this item removed.â</p>

<p>The Ku Klux Klan (KKK) is recognised as one of the âoldest and most infamousâ hate groups in the United States, as noted by the Southern Poverty Law Center (<a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/ku-klux-klanÂ ">SPLC</a>). Founded in the aftermath of the Civil War in 1865, the KKK was initially formed by Confederate veterans but quickly evolved into a violent organisation dedicated to maintaining white supremacy and opposing civil rights for African Americans.</p>

<p>The controversy erupted when a Reddit user posted an image of the candle, saying, âI know it's one of those paper snowflakes, but I can't be the only one who sees âit,' right....RIGHT??â&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="reddit-embed-bq" data-embed-height="740" style="height:500px"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bathandbodyworks/comments/1fywv9b/interesting_design/">Interesting Design</a><br />

<script async="" src="https://embed.reddit.com/widgets.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

<p>The thread attracted close to 300 responses, many echoing similar thoughts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>People labelled it the âklandleâ or âKlan Krismas Kandle.â Customers who attempted to order the candle after the controversy erupted reported their orders were cancelled.</p>

<p>An influencer on Instagram, who describes herself as a âcandle-hoarder,â also shared her disapproval. Others defended the design as simply a âschool snowflake cutout,â arguing the outrage was excessive.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The likelihood of a La Nina weather event in coming months has decreased, Australia's weather bureau said on Tuesday, adding that if the phenomenon did appear, it would be weak and short-lived.</p>

<p>The development of La Nina and its opposite, El Nino, are of huge importance to global agriculture, with La Nina typically increasing rainfall in eastern Australia, Southeast Asia and India and reducing rainfall in the Americas.</p>

<p>"The chance of a La Nina event developing in the coming months has decreased," the Australian Bureau of Meteorology said in a two-weekly update.</p>

<p>The bureau said its in-house climate model suggests La Nina will not develop and four of the six other climate models it surveys now agree.</p>

<p>La Nina and El Nino are caused by the cooling and warming of sea surface temperatures off western South America.</p>

<p>"If a La Nina were to develop, it is forecast to be relatively weak (in terms of the strength of the sea surface temperature anomaly) and short-lived, with all models forecasting neutral values in February," the bureau said.</p>

<p>Other meteorologists have also become less confident that a La Nina will appear.</p>

<p>A U.S. government forecaster said last week there was a 60% chance of a La Nina emerging by the end of November that would persist through January-March 2025. A month earlier, it said there was a 71% chance of a La Nina forming.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea blew up sections of the deeply symbolic roads connecting it to the South on Tuesday, Seoul's military said, adding it had conducted a "counter-fire" operation in response.</p>

<p>Pyongyang's military last week vowed to permanently seal its southern border after spending months laying mines and building anti-tank barriers in the wake of leader Kim Jong Un declaring the South his country's "principal enemy".</p>

<p>The North also accused Seoul of using drones to drop anti-regime propaganda leaflets on the capital Pyongyang, with Kim convening a security meeting to direct a plan of "immediate military action" in response, state media reported Tuesday.</p>

<p>"North Korea has detonated parts of the Gyeongui and Donghae roads north of the Military Demarcation Line," the Joint Chiefs of Staff said Tuesday, referring to inter-Korean infrastructure that once connected the two countries.</p>

<p>"There has been no damage to our military, and our forces conducted counter-fire in areas south of the MDL," it added.</p>

<p>The roads have long been shuttered, but destroying them sends a clear message that Kim is not prepared to negotiate with the South, experts said.</p>

<p>"This is a practical military measure related to the hostile dual-state system that North Korea has frequently mentioned," Yang Moo-jin, president of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, told AFP.</p>

<p>The North may also be looking to erect more physical barriers along the border, Yang said, adding that the road detonations could be "preparatory work."</p>

<p>South Korea's military released video footage showing North Korean soldiers in military uniforms ahead of a huge explosion, which emitted thick billowing smoke as it blew up sections of the Gyeongui road.</p>

<p>More footage, apparently from after the blasts, showed excavators digging, while soldiers worked as large red trucks arrived.</p>

<p>The Seoul military also released separate footage showing North Korea blowing up a section of the Donghae road, on the east coast.</p>

<p>South Korea's unification ministry slammed the North for what it called an "extremely abnormal" provocation, adding that Seoul had shouldered millions in costs for building the infrastructure.</p>

<p>"North Korea still has repayment obligations regarding this funding," it added.</p>

<p>China, a traditional ally of the North, called on all parties "to avoid further escalation of conflicts" on the peninsula, a foreign ministry spokeswoman said.</p>

<p><strong>Drone denial</strong></p>

<p>Seoul's military initially denied sending drones north but has subsequently declined to comment, even as Pyongyang has blamed them directly, warning it would consider it "a declaration of war" if another drone was detected.</p>

<p>Later Tuesday, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un released a statement, saying Pyongyang has secured "clear evidence" that the South Korean military was behind the drones that reached Pyongyang.</p>

<p>"The provocateurs will have to pay a dear price," Kim Yo Jong said.</p>

<p>Activist groups in the South have long sent propaganda northwards, typically carried by balloons, but enthusiasts are also known to have flown small, hard-to-detect drones into the North.</p>

<p>Unlike conventional drones made of metal, the devices they used were constructed from expanded polypropylene, similar to Styrofoam, allowing them to go undetected by both South and North Korean authorities, according to enthusiasts who spoke to local media.</p>

<p>At Kim's meeting Monday, officials heard a report on the "enemy's serious provocation", said KCNA, adding Kim had "expressed a tough political and military stand".</p>

<p>The North has said the United States, which has a military alliance with South Korea, should also be held responsible.</p>

<p>North Korea has itself sent drones southwards -- in 2022, five of Pyongyang's drones crossed the border, prompting the South Korean military to fire warning shots and deploy fighter jets.</p>

<p>The jets failed to shoot down any of the drones.</p>

<p>In July, Seoul said it would deploy drone-melting lasers this year, adding the South's ability to respond to provocations would be "significantly enhanced".</p>

<p>Now, it is a question of whether "North Korea will respond by sending drones into the South or take strong action if drones infiltrate its territory again", said Cheong Seong-chang of the Sejong Institute.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The cop admitted to fantasising about the day her father's killer would serve his sentence behind bars.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gislayne Silva de Deus, a 35-year-old police officer from Boa Vista, Roraima, Brazil, has finally achieved justice for her father's brutal murder. Ms Deus, just 9 years old at the time, spent more than two decades seeking justice. Now, as a police officer, she tracked down and arrested her father's killer, bringing closure to her family's painful journey. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/10/14/woman-whose-dad-murdered-nine-becomes-cop-catch-killer-21792089/">Metro</a></em>, the police officer's father Giraldo Jose Vicente de Deus was shot and killed in February 1999 over a 20-pound debt.</p>

<p>The tragic events unfolded at a local bar, where Mr Deus, a supermarket owner, was playing pool with a friend. At the bar, Raimundo Alves Gomes, one of Deus's suppliers and a convicted murderer, demanded payment for the debt. Despite Deus's offer to settle with a freezer, Gomes refused, leading to an argument between the two.&nbsp;Gomes left the bar only to return with a gun and shot Mr Deus in the head, according to a recount by Brazilian news outlet&nbsp;<em><a href="https://nova1.com.br/policial-que-prendeu-assassino-do-pai-25-anos-depois-do-crime-teve-crise-de-choro-apos-prisao/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Nova1</a>.</em></p>

<p>Gomes was caught, put on trial and sentenced to 12 years in 2013. However, he avoided imprisonment while appealing the verdict. Following the rejection of his final appeal in 2016, an arrest warrant was issued, but Gomes evaded capture and went into hiding.</p>

<p>Determined to find Gomes, Ms Deus started&nbsp;studying law at 18 and later joined the police force. She held various positions, fueled by her resolve to bring her father's killer to justice. Assigned to the General Homicide Division, she then tirelessly tracked down Alves Gomes and found him hiding on a farm in the Nova Cidade region near Boa Vista. He was finally arrested on September 25.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The cop admitted to fantasising about the day her father's killer would serve his sentence behind bars. "When I was a prison [police officer], I always imagined [the killer] arriving there to serve his sentence," she told local media.</p>

<p>Twenty-five years after the brutal murder, she confronted Alves Gomes, now 60, face-to-face. ''It's because of me that you are here. You are now going to pay,'' she told him.</p>

<p>"When I saw the man who was responsible for my dad's death was finally in handcuffs, I couldn't hold back the tears, It was an explosion of feelings that turned into tears of relief, as it seemed like this day would never come.&nbsp; My dad was an honest and hard-working man. He encouraged us to study and spent time helping us with homework and times tables. He was always very close to us and caring. My sisters and I went through really difficult times after we lost him. What happened could easily have sent us in a different direction, but our mother always taught us to follow the right path,'' she remarked.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On September 26, 2024, Alves Gomes' conviction was upheld by a judge and the killer was sent to prison for 12 years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Canada's Royal Canadian Mounted Police claimed that "agents of the Government of India" use criminals - referring specifically to the Bishnoi gang - to "target (the) South Asian community... specifically pro-Khalistani elements" in that country.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Royal Canadian&nbsp;Mounted Police claimed Monday that "agents of the Government of India" use criminals - referring specifically to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/bishnoi-gang" target="_blank">Bishnoi gang</a> - to "target (the) South Asian community... specifically pro-Khalistani elements" in that country.</p>

<p>The charge - by Commissioner Mike Duhene and his deputy, Brigitte Gauvin - adds to the row festering since Ottawa last year accused "agents" of Delhi of involvement in the killing of Canadian citizen and Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Nijjar.</p>

<p>"It (the Indian government) is targeting the South Asian community... but they are specifically targeting pro-Khalistani elements in Canada. What we have seen, from an RCMP perspective, is that they use organised crime elements," Ms Gauvin told reporters.</p>

<p>"It has been publicly attributed and claimed by one crime group in particular - the Bishnoi gang. We believe the group is connected to agents of the Government of India."</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>When asked specifically if "agents of Indian government" were being accused of "homicide, extortion, intimidation, and coercion", Mr Duheme replied "yes".</p>

<p>Mr Duheme and Ms Gauvin further claimed some Indian diplomatic staff work with organised crime elements to "collect - through questionable and illegal means - information on Canadian citizens... (that is fed to criminal organisations) that would then take violent actions from extortion to murder".</p>

<p>India has strongly rejected what it calls "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm?dtl/38417" target="_blank">preposterous imputations</a>", including those by Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accusing New Delhi of "supporting criminal activity against Canadians" and "coercive behaviour targeting South Asian Canadians".</p>

<p>India also said that since the allegations were first made, the Trudeau administration "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/hardeep-singh-nijjar-killing-s-jaishankar-asks-canada-to-provide-evidence-4577831" target="_blank">has not shared a shred of evidence</a> with the Government of India, despite many requests..."</p>

<p>The External Affairs Ministry further rejected claims by Ottawa that Sanjay Kumar Verma, posted as the Indian High Commissioner, and five of his staff, are 'persons of interest'. All six have been expelled by the Canadian side after it claimed Delhi's continuing non-cooperation in its investigation.</p>

<p>Hours after the police officers' press conference Mr Trudeau spoke to reporters and doubled down on charges against the Indian government.</p>

<p>"I think it is obvious the Government of India made a fundamental error in thinking they could engage in supporting criminal activity against Canadians, here on Canadian soil. Whether it be murders or extortion or other violent acts, it is absolutely unacceptable."</p>

<p>The allegations coincide with sliding support and tanking popularity; last week he survived a second parliamentary confidence vote in as many weeks before the 2025 election.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The filmmaker claimed that insiders from the Breakthrough Listen project tipped him off that concrete evidence may be revealed within a month, possibly coinciding with the US election.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Renowned NASA filmmaker Simon Holland has claimed that Earth-based telescopes have detected signs of intelligent extraterrestrial life, with a potential announcement coming next month. Mr Holland, who has collaborated with the BBC and NASA-funded initiatives, asserted that an Oxford University-backed program dedicated to searching for extraterrestrial signals has made the groundbreaking discovery, the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/14/us-news/nasa-filmmaker-claims-evidence-of-alien-life-could-be-revealed-within-the-next-month/">New York Post</a></em> reported.</p>

<p>The filmmaker claimed that insiders from Mark Zuckerberg's Breakthrough Listen project&nbsp;tipped him off that concrete evidence may be revealed within a month, possibly coinciding with the US election.&nbsp;This evidence might be linked to alien signals intercepted by the Parkes telescope in Australia, courtesy of researchers from the Oxford-based Breakthrough Listen initiative.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"They found the evidence of a non-human technological signature a few years ago, using the Parkes telescope in Australia," claimed Mr Holland.</p>

<p>The extraordinary claims have sparked a flurry of activity, with astronomers scrambling to gather evidence to substantiate the discovery. However, Simon Holland warns that a rival effort may be underway, suggesting that Chinese researchers might attempt to preempt the announcement.</p>

<p>''This is breaking news, as of yesterday, but the Chinese might be pipping them to the post, with their, FAST [Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope] program. It's the largest telescope in the world since Arecibo,'' Mr Holland told <em>The Mirror.</em></p>

<p>Mr Holland further claimed that Chinese researchers are racing to publish findings on BLC-1 (Breakthrough Listen candidate 1), a promising signal detected by the Parkes Telescope in April 2019. BLC-1, emanating from Proxima Centauri, 4.2 light-years from Earth, is considered significant due to its single-point source origin, narrow band electromagnetic frequency (982 MHz) and Doppler&nbsp;shift, indicating a rotating planet.</p>

<p>Mr Holland believes this signal is unlikely to be human interference, as its characteristics are inconsistent with known natural phenomena. Breakthrough Listen has invested $100 million in telescope time to investigate five potential candidates, including BLC-1.</p>

<p>Dr Andrew Siemion from Berkeley's Breakthrough Listen Science Program confirmed that researchers are still analysing BLC-1. If sufficient data confirms the signal's technological origins, they will publish their findings. The Chinese are allegedly aware of BLC-1's coordinates and may attempt to scoop the announcement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While this news is exciting, it's essential to note that there's currently no conclusive proof of extraterrestrial life. Astrobiologists have been studying the possibility of life beyond Earth, exploring extreme environments and chemically harsh ecosystems that could support life. The search for extraterrestrial life has been ongoing since the mid-20th century, with scientists using various methods to detect signs of life, including telescope data analysis and radio communications.</p>

Accompanied by a 24-year-old fellow Briton, the unidentified victim fell while climbing the cable-stayed bridge in Talavera de la Reina, approximately 70 miles southwest of Madrid, the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/14/british-man-dies-fall-spanish-bridge-online-content">Guardian</a></em> reported.&nbsp;The man reportedly attempted his climb without any safety equipment.&nbsp;Local authorities also cited heavy rainfall in Talavera before the accident, which may have made the bridge's surface slippery, according to Spanish media reports.</p>

<p>"As far as we have been able to learn, they had come to Talavera to climb the bridge and create content for social networks, which has resulted in this disastrous and sad outcome," Talavera city councillor for public security Macarena Munoz said.</p>

<p>She added, ''We have been able to find out, they had come to Talavera to climb the bridge and create content for social networks, which has resulted in this unfortunate and sad outcome.''</p>

<p>According to city officials, climbing the bridge is strictly prohibited, with repeated warnings emphasising that it's not allowed under any circumstances. Despite these warnings, thrill-seeking tourists continue to risk their lives for social media content, resulting in tragic incidents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We have reiterated on many occasions that it cannot be done under any circumstances," said Ms Munoz.</p>

<p>The city council said the man's body has been removed from the scene and taken to a nearby funeral home by a coroner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office said: ''We are supporting the family of a British man who has died in Spain, and are in contact with the local authorities.''</p>

<p>Notably, the Castilla-La Mancha Bridge, towering at 630 feet, is Spain's tallest bridge and one of Europe's most impressive structures. Its striking design features a unique 152-wire rope system, forming a triangular fan-like shape that dominates the Spanish skyline.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Global public debt is expected to reach a record $100 trillion this year, the IMF said Tuesday, warning that the fiscal outlook for many countries may be even "worse than expected."</p>

<p>In its latest report on fiscal policy, the International Monetary Fund said it expects global public debt to hit 93 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) this year, and to approach 100 percent of GDP by 2030 -- 10 percentage points higher than in 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic hit.</p>

<p>"Global public debt is very high," Era Dabla-Norris, the deputy director of the IMF's Fiscal Affairs Department, told reporters ahead of the report's publication.</p>

<p>"There are very good reasons to believe that the debt burden -- or the debt outlook -- could be worse than expected," she said, pointing to current spending pressures to address issues like climate change, overly-optimistic debt projections, and the possibility of large amounts of unidentified debt.</p>

<p>"So the bottom line is that it's time for countries to get their fiscal house in order," she said.</p>

<p>The IMF report introduced a new "debt-at-risk" approach to assessing the risks to debt projections.</p>

<p>It estimated that, in a worst-case scenario, global public debt could hit 115 percent of GDP by 2026 -- almost 20 percentage points higher than the Fund's baseline estimate.</p>

<p>The report found that "global factors increasingly drive the fluctuations in government borrowing costs across countries," suggesting that elevated levels of debt in key countries could "increase the volatility of sovereign yields and debt risks" for others.</p>

<p>Moderating inflation and interest rate cuts in many economies meant now was an "opportune" time for countries to rebuild their fiscal buffers, the IMF said, adding that they were "better placed" than before to absorb the effect of fiscal tightening.</p>

<p>The size of the fiscal adjustment needed to bring global public debt back under control was between 3.0 and 4.5 percent of GDP, on average, the IMF said -- almost twice the size of past adjustments.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Japan Elections: Key issues include price rises, regional security, and disquiet over scandals in Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Campaigning kicked off Tuesday in Japan for an October 27 election in which new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is seeking to retain his long-ruling party's majority.</p>

<p>Loudspeaker trucks began circulating and candidates handed out fliers ahead of the vote. Key issues include price rises, regional security, and disquiet over scandals in Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party.</p>

<p>The LDP has governed Japan almost uninterrupted for decades, albeit with frequent leadership changes.</p>

<p>Low voter turnout and a divided opposition mean the party and its coalition partner are highly likely to win.</p>

<p>A weekend Kyodo News poll showed that Ishiba's LDP remains the most popular party at 26.4 percent, versus 12.4 percent who intend to vote for the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDP).</p>

<p>Former defence minister and self-confessed security policy "geek" Ishiba, 67, won a ruling party leadership election in September and was approved as premier soon afterwards.</p>

<p>He has called a snap election to shore up his mandate for policies that include plans to "re-create" ageing Japan by revitalising depopulated rural areas.</p>

<p>On the diplomatic front, Ishiba has called for revising the Japan-US security treaty to make it better reflect his country's sovereignty.</p>

<p>He also backs the creation of a regional military alliance along the lines of NATO to counter China, although he has cautioned it would "not happen overnight".</p>

<p>Ishiba says his "victory line" for the election would be for the LDP and its junior partner Komeito to maintain a simple majority in parliament's lower house.</p>

<p>But the LDP will need to convince voters jaded by a slush fund scandal that has swept the party along with questions over its lawmakers' ties to the Unification Church.</p>

<p>Ishiba has pledged to "ensure Japan's economy emerges from deflation" and wants to boost incomes through a new stimulus package as well as support for low-income households.</p>

<p>Another thorny issue is the question of whether to allow women to retain their maiden names after marriage, an issue where opposition parties hope to gain liberal support.</p>

<p>The justice ministry says that to the best of its knowledge, Japan is the only nation that requires married couples to choose one of their surnames -- almost always the husbands'.</p>

<p>While the CDP supports allowing married couples to maintain separate surnames, the conservative LDP has been more cautious, citing "traditional family values".</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel has assured the White House that a planned retaliatory attack on Iran won't target nuclear or oil facilities, US media reported Monday.</p>

<p>Israel has vowed to counterattack after Iran fired ballistic missiles at the country on October 1, launched in response to Israel's killing of Tehran-aligned militant leaders in the region, along with a general in Iran's Revolutionary Guards.</p>

<p>Citing unnamed US officials, the Washington Post said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had reassured the White House that a counterstrike it is contemplating would target only military sites.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal, also citing US officials speaking on condition of anonymity, said the pledge came in a call between US President Joe Biden and Netanyahu last week, as well as in conversations in recent days between US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant.</p>

<p>The plan "was met with relief in Washington," the Washington Post reported.</p>

<p>Biden has warned Israel against striking Iran's nuclear or oil facilities in order to avoid a further expansion of regional war and amid worries of a spike in global energy prices.</p>

<p>The attack was Iran's second direct attack on Israel after missile and drone fire in April, carried out in response to an air strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus that is attributed to Israel.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taiwan detected a record 153 Chinese military aircraft around the self-ruled island, official data showed Tuesday, after China held a day of large-scale drills.</p>

<p>The aircraft were spotted in the 25 hours to 6:00 am on Tuesday (2200 GMT Monday), the defence ministry said in a statement -- the most for a single day.</p>

<p>Beijing deployed fighter jets, drones, warships and coast guard boats to encircle Taiwan on Monday, with Taiwan responding by dispatching "appropriate forces" and placing its outlying islands on heightened alert.</p>

<p>Taiwan condemned China's actions as "irrational and provocative", and the US called them "unwarranted".</p>

<p>Japan said Tuesday it had expressed its "concerns" to China over the drills, and scrambled fighter jets near its southern island of Yonaguni.</p>

<p>"The government is closely monitoring the related activities with great interest, and has conveyed Japan's concerns to the Chinese side," deputy chief cabinet secretary Kazuhiko Aoki told reporters.</p>

<p>China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and insisted Monday it will never renounce the use of force to bring the island under its control.</p>

<p>Beijing has ramped up military pressure on Taipei in recent years to accept its claims of sovereignty over the island, and Monday represented the fourth round of large-scale drills in just over two years.</p>

<p>Taiwan's defence ministry also recorded 14 Chinese navy ships in the latest 25-hour period, slightly fewer than the 17 announced Monday afternoon.</p>

<p>Of the aircraft spotted, 111 crossed the median line of the sensitive Taiwan Strait that separates mainland China and Taiwan, the figures showed.</p>

<p><strong>'Unwarranted'</strong></p>

<p>The United States said <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/chinas-military-encircles-taiwan-us-calls-it-unwarranted-6785647">China's actions on Monday were "unwarranted"</a> and risked "escalation" as it called on Beijing to act with restraint.</p>

<p>China said the drills, dubbed Joint Sword 2024B, were held in areas to the north, south and east of Taiwan.</p>

<p>Beijing declared them over by around 6:00 pm on Monday, about 13 hours after they started.</p>

<p>China said the exercises served as a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/china-launches-military-drills-around-taiwan-sends-a-stern-warning-to-separatist-forces-6783700">"stern warning to the separatist acts of 'Taiwan Independence' forces"</a>.</p>

<p>Taiwan President Lai Ching-te, who took office in May, has been more outspoken than his predecessor Tsai Ing-wen in defending Taiwan's sovereignty, angering Beijing, which calls him a "separatist".</p>

<p>In his National Day speech on Thursday, Lai vowed to "resist annexation" and insisted that Beijing and Taipei were "not subordinate to each other".</p>

<p>Lai pledged Monday to "protect democratic Taiwan and safeguard national security".</p>

<p>In late May, three days after Lai's inauguration, China launched Joint Sword-2024A, an apparent precursor to the latest drills.</p>

<p>The dispute between China and Taiwan dates back to a civil war in which the nationalist forces of Chiang Kai-shek were defeated by Mao Zedong's communist fighters and fled to the island in 1949.</p>

<p>China and Taiwan have been ruled separately since then.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The latest poll by NBC showed Donald Trump and Kamala Harris tied at 48 per cent, while the aggregation of polls by RealClear Polls had the Democrat leading by 1.7 per cent.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's three weeks to what could be a defining moment for the US -- a reelection of former President Donald Trump or a woman, Kamala Harris, smashing the glass ceiling -- and it's a toss-up. As they furiously campaign, they are locked within the margin of error in polls although Trump appears to edge up slightly while Harris holds the lead.</p>

<p>Neither Trump's hopes of a resounding victory after President Joe Biden's stumble at their debate, nor the high expectations of Democrats that a groundswell of support for <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/billionaires-funding-kamala-harris-and-donald-trump-in-2024-6778853" target="_blank">Harris</a>, a woman of Indian and African-Jamaican descent, coupled with disdain for the former president would carry her to victory has so far come to pass.</p>

<p>The latest poll by NBC showed them both tied at 48 per cent, while the aggregation of polls by RealClear Polls (RCP) had <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kamala-harris-makes-medical-report-public-claims-donald-trump-refuses-to-do-so-6775361">Harris</a> leading by 1.7 per cent, and fivethirtyeight.com by 2.4 per cent.</p>

<p>At this stage of the election cycle, Biden was ahead by a decisive 9.2 per cent in 2020, and Hillary Clinton led by 6.7 per cent but the lead was down to 2.1 per cent in the 2016 election.</p>

<p>How <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kamala-harris-to-donald-trump-release-your-medical-records-6784346">Trump</a> defeated Clinton despite winning fewer popular votes than her illustrates how US elections popular votes do not finally determine who becomes president.</p>

<p>The US presidential elections are in reality based on an indirect system built around an electoral college, which is made up of 538 electors for whom the voters cast their ballots.</p>

<p>So a candidate can win an election by getting at least 270 members of the electoral college while failing to get a majority of the popular vote. (It is not too dissimilar to the parliamentary system where a candidate can become prime minister with a majority in the lower house but without the majority of the votes.)</p>

<p>Seven so-called swing states come into play here because the other 43 states are more or less locked in by either party, and these seven can pick the winner through their electors.</p>

<p>Here the picture is muddled in the run-up to November 5, and the two candidates are focusing mostly on the seven states.</p>

<p>RCP has <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-elections-2024-man-with-shotgun-and-loaded-handgun-arrested-near-donald-trumps-california-rally-6783408">Trump</a> ahead in six of them with margins of 1 per cent or less, and Harris in one, Georgia, by 0.5 per cent, while fivethiryeight.com also gives her Georgia.</p>

<p>But 8 per cent more of those polled have an unfavourable view of Trump, compared to only 0.6 per cent more who view Harris unfavourably, according to RCP.</p>

<p>Voters are generally focused on two issues -- the economy, specifically inflation, and illegal migration.</p>

<p>A major factor holding back Harris is the nearly 45 months she has been vice president with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/joe-biden-courageous-to-step-out-of-us-elections-2024-kamala-harris-6765719">Biden</a> when the White House proudly issued announcements in the name of the âBiden-Harris Administrationâ.</p>

<p>A majority -- 56 per cent -- disapproves Biden's job performance and it has come to reflect on Harris, who faces the dilemma of how far to dissociate herself from the president.</p>

<p>Asked by an interviewer on national TV if she would have done anything different than Biden, she said, âNot a thing that comes to mindâ.</p>

<p>Trump had been looking for just this confirmation and piled up on her in ads and speeches every shortcoming of the administration -- the inflation, the open borders, and the Afghanistan withdrawal disaster.</p>

<p>Biden also fares badly in comparison to Trump on some issues, notably the economy.</p>

<p>Tamping down inflation hasn't been of help, because people compare the rise in grocery prices by about 25 per cent now to what they paid in 2020, and not the current inflation rate.</p>

<p>This is reflected in the view among 44 per cent of those polled who believe that Trump helped them when he was in office, while 45 per cent said that Biden hurt them</p>

<p>This perception carried on to the Trump versus Harris matchup: Trump scored higher, 50 per cent to 39 per cent on fighting inflation, and 56 per cent to 31 per cent on border security, according to RCP.</p>

<p>Against this, Harris was ahead on competence, 48 per cent to 53 per cent, and 53 per cent to 34 per cent on protecting abortion rights, a major issue in the elections after the Supreme Court, aided by Trump appointees, declared that abortions were not a right protected nationally by the Constitution and that states can set the laws.</p>

<p>Harris and the Democrats are hammering abortion rights, hoping that it appeals to women voters more than the economic factors that seem to favour Trump.</p>

<p>On immigration, a Scripps News poll last month reported that 54 per cent of Americans want illegal migrants deported -- a stance that aligns with Trump's.</p>

<p>The Biden-Harris administration having seen the upswell of opposition to open borders, had earlier brought back stringent controls that hark back to Trump's days in office.</p>

<p>Trump continues to blame Harris for the influx of illegal migrants â which hit Democratic Party-run cities hard â and for the crime, some brought with them, even though the Democrats now say that her role in immigration was limited to getting the help of Central American countries to stop people moving north.</p>

<p>Both parties have their extremes and each tries to broad-brush the other with its extremes.</p>

<p>Harris has tried to tie Trump to Project 2025, a harsh policy paper produced by a right-wing think tank, which the former president has disowned.</p>

<p>He has also tried to project a more compassionate view on abortions than the absolute ban advocated by right-wing Republicans.</p>

<p>Harris has been trying to moderate her stances on immigration that had once aligned with the Democratic Left, on banning natural gas extraction through a process called fracking, and on a nationalised health insurance system.</p>

<p>The moderation has costs, more for Harris than for Trump, with the threat of segments of her base sitting out the election.</p>

<p>This is particularly pronounced in Israel's conflict with Hamas and Hezbollah, the vice president has hewed closely to the Biden administration's support for Israel, alienating the Left and the Muslim and Arab constituencies, especially in the swing state of Michigan.</p>

<p>Both contenders have different support bases with Harris's made up of women, college-educated White people, and minorities.</p>

<p>Trump's bedrock is made up of men, working-class whites, rural voters, and Christian fundamentalists.</p>

<p>According to the NBC poll, women give Harris a 14 per cent lead and Trump is ahead by a per cent among men.</p>

<p>Democrats though are worried about the relatively small erosion of support among African Americans and Latinos, which could have an outsize effect in states like Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin where the margins are a half per cent or less.</p>

<p>According to a New York Times poll, Harris's lead among Latinos fell to 19 per cent from the 26 per cent Biden had in 2020.</p>

<p>Among African Americans, Harris's support margin fell to 63 per cent -- still a very high number -- from the 81 per cent Biden had.</p>

<p>Two other issues that have become the focus of campaigns are social issues and the January 6 riot.</p>

<p>Trump has been hacking away at Democratic Party policies implemented in some states like barring schools from informing parents about their children changing their gender identity, teaching small children about homosexuality and transgender in schools, and government-funded sex change treatment for prisoners that would include illegal migrants.</p>

<p>Harris and her party have made a central issue of Trump's refusal to admit he lost the 2020 election and the riot by his supporters on January 6 who smashed their way into the Capitol as Congress was ratifying Biden's election endangering the lawmakers.</p>

<p>They assert that this poses a fundamental danger to democracy -- but at least half of those polled don't seem to have been swayed by it or by the character issue that Harris hammers on.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lone catamaran named "Silky" patrols waters around the remote island of Malpelo, a refuge that is protected yet full of peril for endangered marine species in the Colombian Pacific.</p>

<p>Its crew of environmentalists is the terror of boats illegally fishing for sharks inside the reserve some 500 kilometers (310 miles) off mainland Colombia -- one of the richest countries in terms of marine fauna.</p>

<p>Without weapons or backup, the activists shoo away intruder vessels, threaten to report them to the authorities, even dive under water to cut loose sharks caught in nets or on lines.</p>

<p>Active round-the-clock since 2018, the team of shark-lovers claims to be turning the tide in the Malpelo Fauna and Flora Sanctuary, a mecca for divers and the largest no-fishing zone in the Eastern Tropical Pacific.</p>

<p>"The success of the project can be seen in the fact that they (the illegal fishers) do not return," said Colombian diver Erika Lopez, who created the foundation Biodiversity Conservation Colombia with the help of an Australian philanthropist.</p>

<p>The project was born from what the activists view as a lack of official shark protection, with the navy arresting illegal fishers only if they happen to come across them on routine patrols against drug traffickers and other territorial intruders.</p>

<p>Due to play host of the UN COP16 biodiversity conference starting next Monday, Colombia's vast Pacific coastline is on a key migratory route for hammerhead sharks, whale sharks and other species, many of them endangered.</p>

<p>But the bountiful waters of the sanctuary attract vessels from far and wide, many from neighboring Ecuador, others from Panama and Costa Rica in the Caribbean or even China, where shark fin is a delicacy.</p>

<p>Lopez's foundation claims the crew of the Silky -- the name of a type of shark -- has rescued 508 animals alive since 2018, scared away 302 boats and confiscated more than 70,000 meters of fishing line.</p>

<p>Since last December, the foundation reports it has not spotted any fishing boats near Malpelo island in the reserve of more than 850,000 hectares recognized as a UNESCO heritage site.</p>

<p>"We try as much as possible to take the equipment away from them, to free the species that are trapped, that's the main mission," 53-year-old Dario Ortiz, an artisanal fisherman-turned-environmentalist, told AFP on board the "Silky."</p>

<p>But it is a full-time effort.</p>

<p>"This boat has to be basically 24/7, 365 days a year containing this threat," said Lopez, 51, who dreams of upscaling the project to a flotilla of vessels dedicated to conservation and science in the Pacific.</p>

<p><strong>Rich and desirable</strong></p>

<p>On the high seas, far from Malpelo island, a Colombian navy warship also patrols an area teeming with hammerhead sharks, marlin and other endangered creatures.</p>

<p>On a recent mission with AFP on board, it arrested three Ecuadoran fishermen found with a highly valuable haul of silky, hammerhead and blacktip sharks, sailfish and four blue marlins -- all still alive.</p>

<p>"The Colombian Pacific is very rich and it is desirable," said Admiral Rafael Aranguren.</p>

<p>With "our ships we can reach this part of the territory and exercise controls so that they do not illegally exploit these riches, so that they do not harm the environment."</p>

<p>In 2020, the government of former president Ivan Duque banned shark fishing, both on an industrial and small-scale, to try to protect marine stocks.</p>

<p>But faced with an outcry from Afro-Caribbean fishing communities on the Pacific coast which rely on shark catches for meat to eat and sell, incumbent President Gustavo Petro in January partly repealed the ban.</p>

<p>The government decreed that small-scale fishermen may keep and consume sharks accidentally caught in nets meant for other, unrestricted, fish species.</p>

<p>The decision caused outrage among conservationists who view it as a license to kill.</p>

<p>The Navy estimates it has arrested 30 people so far this year for illegal fishing in Colombian waters.</p>

<p>Between 2012 and 2022, authorities seized more than 334 tons of fish meat illegally harvested, according to the Ministry of Environment.</p>

<p>The country does not keep a record of sharks that fall victim to illegal fishing.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau doubled down on accusations of India "supporting criminal activity against Canadians", as the two countries expel six diplomats each in the row over the killing of terrorist Hardeep Singh NIjjar.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canada Prime Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/justin-trudeau" target="_blank">Justin Trudeau</a> late Monday doubled down on accusations of India "supporting criminal activity against Canadians" and "coercive behaviour targeting South Asian Canadians".</p>

<p>The two countries this week exchanged a second round of&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indian-expels-6-canadian-diplomats-amid-spiraling-tension-6789267#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll_Imagetopscroll" target="_blank">tit-for-tat expulsion of diplomats</a>, amid a deepening row over claims linking "agents of the Indian government" with the killing of Khalistani terrorist <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/hardeep-singh-nijjar" target="_blank">Hardeep Singh Nijjar</a>, a Canadian citizen, in June last year.</p>

<p>India - which has yet to respond to these latest comments - has set up a high-level committee to investigate the allegation. However New Delhi has repeatedly shot down "absurd" and "motivated" the claim it was linked to the murder, pointing out <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/hardeep-singh-nijjar-killing-s-jaishankar-asks-canada-to-provide-evidence-4577831" target="_blank">no evidence has been provided</a>&nbsp;to back up the charges.</p>

<p>On Monday, Delhi also said that since the allegations were first made, the Trudeau administration "has not shared a shred of evidence with the Government of India, despite many requests..."</p>

<p>In comments after India ejected six Canadian diplomats - including acting High Commissioner Stewart Wheeler and his deputy - Mr Trudeau said he had shared information about the accusations with Five Eyes partners, particularly the United States.</p>

<p>These latest charges, though, represent an escalation as they allege a wider campaign of the Indian government - of working, Mr Trudeau said, with organised crime elements in Canada to "collect - through questionable and illegal means - information on Canadian citizens... (that is fed to criminal organisations) that would then take violent actions from extortion to murder".</p>

<p>"I think it is obvious the Government of India made a fundamental error in thinking they could engage in supporting criminal activity against Canadians, here on Canadian soil. Whether it be murders or extortion or other violent acts, it is absolutely unacceptable," Mr Trudeau <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/news/statements/2024/10/14/statement-prime-minister-ongoing-investigation-violent-criminal-activity-linked" target="_blank">said</a>.</p>

<p>Mr Trudeau also said, "We shared our concerns with the Government of India and asked them to work with us...". However, he claimed that these requests had been "repeatedly refused".</p>

<p>"That is why... this weekend... Canadian officials took an extraordinary step. They met with Indian officials to share RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) evidence, which concluded six agents of the Government of India are 'persons of interest' in criminal activities. And despite repeated requests to the Government of India, they have decided not to co-operate..."</p>

<p>"Canada fully respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of India, and we expect India to do the same for us," he added.</p>

<p>Mr Trudeau's allegations coincide with sliding support and tanking popularity ratings; last week he <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/canadian-pm-justin-trudeau-survive-second-parliamentary-confidence-vote-6696632" target="_blank">survived a second parliamentary confidence vote</a> in as many weeks ahead of an election in 2025.</p>

<p>The comments came after a RCMP Commissioner Mike Duheme and Assistant Commissioner Brigitte Gauvin <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/rcmp-india-expel-1.7351837" target="_blank">warned Canadians of a public safety threat but offered few details</a>. They would only say the RCMP has evidence pertaining to "connections" between a certain number of individuals arrested and charged for murder (eight people) and extortion (at least 22) and the Government of India.</p>

<p>Pressed on the current "public safety threat to Canadians", Mr Duheme called on Canadian citizens to come forward if faced with "intimidation, harassment, coercion, or extortion, in any way or form, (to) obtain information for the Government of India".</p>

<p>The current row spiked after Canada Foreign Minister Melanie Joly, acting on RCMP information, issued six Indian diplomats a deportation notice. "They must leave Canada..." Mr Trudeau said, "Let me be clear... the evidence brought to light by the RCMP cannot be ignored..."</p>

<p>India later issued a statement saying it was withdrawing the six officials over security concerns.</p>

<p>From its side, Delhi has ramped up criticism of the Trudeau government, saying accusations against its envoy, Sanjay Kumar Verma, are "ludicrous and deserve to be treated with contempt".</p>

<p>Delhi also said that Mr Trudeau's "hostility to India has long been in evidence".</p>

<p>"Sanjay Verma is India's senior-most serving diplomat with a distinguished career spanning 36 years. He has been an Ambassador in Japan and Sudan, while also serving in Italy, Turkiye, Vietnam and China," the foreign ministry said, calling the allegations a "strategy of smearing India for political gains".</p>

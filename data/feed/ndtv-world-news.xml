       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that the United States was "not aware of or involved in" the killing of Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you what this means. I can tell you that the imperative of getting a ceasefire, the importance that that has for everyone, remains," Blinken said, according to a transcript shared by his staff from an interview with Channel News Asia in Singapore.</p>

<p>Haniyeh was attending the inauguration of Iran's new president when he was <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/watch-what-hamas-chief-ismail-haniyeh-was-doing-hours-before-his-assasination-6231404" target="_blank">killed </a>by an Israeli air strike, Hamas said Wednesday.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/lebanon-on-alert-as-israel-vows-severe-response-to-rocket-deaths-said-by-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-6220710" target="_blank">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> has vowed to destroy Hamas in retaliation for its October 7 attack on Israel, which sparked the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>Washington is Israel's key military backer and has been pushing for a Gaza ceasefire, which Blinken said remains "manifestly in the interests" of the Israeli hostages and Gazans who have been "caught in this crossfire of Hamas's making".</p>

<p>As the political chief of the Palestinian movement Hamas, Haniyeh was overseeing the negotiations for a deal to end the war in Gaza and release hostages held in the territory in exchange for Palestinian prisoners detained by Israel.</p>

<p>Blinken, who is visiting Singapore, said a Gaza ceasefire is also key to preventing the conflict from spreading to the rest of the region.</p>

<p>"We've been working from day one not only to try to get to a better place in Gaza but also to prevent the conflict from spreading, whether it's the north with Lebanon and Hezbollah, whether it's the Red Sea with the Huthis, whether it's Iran, Syria, Iraq, you name it," Blinken told a forum in the city state.</p>

<p>"A big key to trying to make sure that that doesn't happen, and that we can move to a better place, is getting the ceasefire."</p>

<p>Qatar -- a vital mediator in truce talks which also hosts Hamas's political leadership that included Haniyeh -- has questioned the future of negotiations in the wake of the assassination.</p>

<p>Hamas vowed the "cowardly" killing of their veteran leader "will not go unanswered".</p>

<p>The October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Operatives also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory campaign against Hamas has killed at least 39,400 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not provide details on civilian and operative deaths.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh visited a theme park exhibition featuring 'Axis of Resistance' landmarks just hours before his assassination in Iran. He was seen alongside Palestinian Islamic Jihad leader Ziad al-Nakhaleh.</p>

<p>The 'Axis of Resistance' is an Iran-led coalition of groups, including Hezbollah, Hamas, Houthis and allied forces in Syria and Iraq. This coalition aims to counter Western influence, particularly from the US and Israel, in the region. The alliance seeks to counteract what it dubs as aggression and interference by these powers, advocating for a Middle East free from external control. Iran plays a central role in providing significant military aid, training, and funding to other members.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The Iranian media has released a video of Haniyeh's visit, hours before his death. He was seen talking to reporters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Hamas leader and one of his bodyguards were killed Wednesday morning in an airstrike on the building where they were staying. On Tuesday, Haniyeh was in Tehran to attend the inauguration ceremony of Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian.</p>

<p>Hamas has blamed Israel for the attack. "This assassination by the Israeli occupation of Brother Haniyeh is a grave escalation that aims to break the will of Hamas," senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said in <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hamas-chief-ismail-haniyeh-killed-in-irans-capital-report-6228024  ">a statement</a>.</p>

<p>Israel previously vowed to kill Haniyeh and other Hamas leaders in response to the group's October 7 attack on southern Israel. Since then, Israel's war on Gaza has killed close to 39,400 people and injured 90,923 others.</p>

<p>Earlier, Haniyeh's three sons, Hazem, Amir and Mohammad, were killed on April 10 this year when their car was hit by an Israeli airstrike. Hamas reported that Haniyeh also lost four of his grandchildren – three girls and a boy.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US model Bella Hadid has said that she is "shocked, upset, and disappointed" at the Adidas campaign in which she was featured that evoked the memories of a 1972 terrorist attack that killed Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US model Bella Hadid has said that she is "shocked, upset, and disappointed" at the Adidas campaign in which she was featured that evoked the memories of a 1972 terrorist attack that killed Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics. Bella Hadid, who is half-Palestinian, was featured this month in the Adidas advertisement for its SL 72 shoes. The shoes were first released for the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany. During those Games, members of the Palestinian group Black September infiltrated the Olympic Village and killed 11 Israeli athletes. Adidas pulled the ads this month after receiving only backlash.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, in an Instagram statement, Hadid wrote, "I am shocked, I am upset, and I am disappointed in the lack of sensitivity that went into this campaign." She said that she never learned about the "historical connection to the atrocious events in 1972". "I would never knowingly engage with any art or work that is linked to a horrific tragedy of any kind," she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"My team should have known. Adidas should have known, and I should have done more research so that I too would have known and understood, and spoken up," Hadid, who was born in 1996 to a Palestinian father, added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hadid's statement comes after <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/adidas-drops-pro-palestinian-model-bella-hadid-from-ad-referencing-1973-munich-olympics-6143343">Adidas </a>pulled the advertisement with the model and pledged to revise the remainder of the SL 72 marketing campaign. The company said that it did not intend to make any connections "to tragic historical events".&nbsp;</p>

<p>The German company also publicly apologised to Bella Hadid and others who participated in the campaign, saying the company "made an unintentional mistake" and expressing regret "for any negative impact".&nbsp;</p>

<p>A spokeswoman also confirmed that Bella Hadid had been removed from the campaign, which notes that the shoes were first introduced in 1972 but never mentions the terror attack on the Israeli athletes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bella Hadid, who was born in the US but has Palestinian roots through her father, has been vocal about her support for Palestinian rights since the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7 triggered the war in Gaza. She has taken part in several pro-Palestinian demonstrations during the conflict and has described Israel's offensive as a "genocide".</p>

<p>In 2021, Bella Hadid, her sister Gigi Hadid and singer Dua Lipa were described as anti-Semitic in an advertisement published in The New York Times by a Jewish group called the World Values Network.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Myanmar's embattled military government extended a state of emergency on Wednesday for another six months, state media said, as the junta struggles to maintain its grip on power with fighting flaring on multiple fronts and the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/explained-myanmar-rebel-crisis-and-how-it-spilled-over-to-india-4916257" target="_blank">economy in crisis.</a></p>

<p>Army-run Myawaddy media said the military-controlled National Defence and Security Council extended emergency rule to give the junta more time to put together population data for voter lists. The junta has said it will hold an election next year.</p>

<p>The military put the country under emergency rule for a year when it took power in a February 2021 coup, deposing the elected civilian government of Aung San Suu Kyi and triggering nationwide street protests that it violently crushed.</p>

<p>The junta has since extended that every six months, as the protest movement morphed into an armed rebellion that has widened and is now posing an existential threat to the generals.</p>

<p>"It is necessary to restore peace and stability because of ongoing terrorist activities," state-run media said of the latest extension, referring to the armed resistance.</p>

<p>Last week, all responsibilities of Myanmar's figurehead president were handed over to junta chief Min Aung Hlaing, after the nominal head of state was placed on medical leave due to a prolonged illness.</p>

<p>Min Aung Hlaing has repeatedly promised to hold a multi-party election, with the general saying in June that polls will be conducted in 2025.</p>

<p>Previous election timelines have been postponed, citing the ongoing violence as the reason. Min Aung Hlaing has insisted the junta does not plan to hold power long.</p>

<p>The military took power after complaining of fraud in a November 2020 general election won overwhelmingly by Suu Kyi's party, which the party denied. Election monitoring groups found no evidence of mass fraud.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former BBC news anchor Huw Edwards, one of the most recognisable faces on UK television, pleaded guilty Wednesday to three counts of making indecent images of children.</p>

<p>The 62-year-old -- who resigned from the BBC in April on "medical advice", six months after he was arrested -- faces a maximum prison sentence of 10 years and a minimum of 12 months.</p>

<p>Wearing a dark suit and blue tie, Edwards sat impassively during the 25-minute court hearing as he admitted receiving 41 indecent images of children on WhatsApp, including seven of the most serious type.</p>

<p>Under English law, electronic communications involving indecent imagery of children -- including receiving and downloading pictures and videos -- can constitute the offence of making indecent images of children.</p>

<p>The crimes involving Edwards occurred between December 2020 and August 2021, amended from the initial chargesheet which ran to April 2022.</p>

<p>Westminster Magistrates' Court in London heard that the former TV anchor had received 377 sexual images from a man he met online, of which 41 were indecent images of children.</p>

<p>"These images appear to have been received with approval," prosecutor Ian Hope told the court.</p>

<p>Of the gravest, the estimated age of most of the children was 13 to 15, but one was aged between seven and nine, he noted.</p>

<p>Edwards had been told that the male in the "moving film" was "quite young looking" and that he could be sent more that were "illegal".</p>

<p>Although the ex-presenter received that film, he told the man not to send any illegal images, the court heard.</p>

<p>- 'Serious issues' -</p>

<p>Edwards's lawyer, Philip Evans, said that his client's devices had been seized and that it was clear he had not made or shared the images.</p>

<p>"There's no suggestion in this case that Mr Edwards has... in the traditional sense of the word, created any image of any sort," Evans told the court.</p>

<p>He added that the defendant was of "good character" and that "there are serious issues in relation to Mr Edwards's health both mental and physical".</p>

<p>Chief magistrate Paul Goldspring released Edwards on conditional bail until his next hearing on September 16, when he could be sentenced.</p>

<p>Goldspring ordered probation services to draw up a report, telling Edwards he needed "to read more about you" before sentencing.</p>

<p>"I'm asking the probation service to look at this case, with genuinely all options open," the magistrate said.</p>

<p>Hope had earlier told the court that a suspended sentence might be appropriate, if paired with a community order and a sexual offender treatment programme.</p>

<p>Edwards, the BBC's lead presenter on key events such as the death and funeral of Queen Elizabeth II, was suspended in July 2023 when allegations first emerged.</p>

<p>He had also been the anchor of the BBC's flagship 10:00 pm news programme since 2003.</p>

<p>He quit on April 22 after 40 years with the broadcaster.</p>

<p>As the accusations became front-page news last July, Edwards's wife Vicky Flind said the father of five was "suffering from serious mental health issues" and had been admitted to hospital.</p>

<p>Edwards himself has not publicly commented on the allegations.</p>

<p>The BBC's brand has been built on public trust but the broadcaster has been rocked in recent years by scandals which saw some big names revealed as serial sex offenders.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Turkey passed a new law Tuesday aimed at removing millions of stray dogs that animal welfare activists worry could lead to a mass culling.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To combat the number of stray dogs in the nation, Turkish lawmakers recently passed a new rule. The Grand National Assembly passed the bill following an overnight session; the government had pushed for its approval before to the summer break, according to <em>The Times.</em></p>

<p>Municipalities are required by law to gather stray dogs, place them in shelters, and make sure they are spayed, neutered, and vaccinated before being adopted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are worries, though, that certain dogs who are sick to the point of death, in excruciating pain, or who represent a health risk would be put to death.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/offbeat/how-an-entire-23-member-sri-lankan-handball-team-vanished-without-a-trace-in-germany-6220499"><strong>Also Read | How An Entire 23 Member Sri Lankan Handball Team Vanished Without A Trace In Germany</strong></a></p>

<p>Opponents contend that the law might result in a mass euthanasia or disregard for these creatures. The bill has been dubbed the "massacre law" by opponents of the law and animal welfare organisations, who are pushing for its repeal, as per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://time.com/7005319/turkey-stray-dogs-massacre-law/">news portal.</a></p>

<p>Some critics also fear that the law might be used to target political opponents, particularly after significant gains by the opposition in recent local elections. The law includes penalties for mayors who do not comply, and the main opposition party has pledged not to implement it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Protests have erupted across Turkey, with demonstrations in Istanbul's Sishane Square and outside municipal offices in Ankara. Protesters have voiced their opposition to the law, emphasizing life and solidarity over hostility.</p>

<p>President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who must now sign the measure into law, expressed gratitude to legislators who supported it. The opposition has indicated plans to challenge the legislation in the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>The legislation primarily addresses the stray dog population, with no provisions for the country's large stray cat population. The government estimates around 4 million stray dogs in Turkey.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[As Israel's war in Gaza rages, a growing number of parents in Israel are demanding sperm from the bodies of their sons, who were killed during the ongoing conflict, to be extracted and frozen, a BBC report said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Israel's war in Gaza rages, a growing number of parents in Israel are demanding sperm from the bodies of their sons, who were killed during the ongoing conflict, to be extracted and frozen, a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c978m6pl99go">BBC report </a>said.</p>

<p>Since Hamas' all-out offense on October 7 and Israel's brutal retaliation, over 400 Israelis have been killed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of these, sperm has been retrieved from as many as 170 men - both civilians and soldiers - according to the Israeli health ministry. This marks a 15 times rise as compared to previous years.</p>

<p>The process involves making an small incision in the testicle to take a piece of tissue from which live sperm cells can be extracted and frozen. The chances of successful retrieval are high within 24 hours after death but the sperm cell can live for up to 72 hours in the body of the deceased.</p>

<p>To ease the process of grieving families, some rules for the procedure have been relaxed but families are still frustrated about the lengthy legal processes they face.</p>

<p>In October, the Israeli health ministry removed a mandatory court order request for parents to use the procedure to extract sperm. While it has become easier to freeze the sperm, widows or parents who want to use it in the conception of a child have to prove in court that the dead man wanted to have children.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parents say the whole process can take years, the long wait adding to their grief.</p>

<p>The first Israeli couple to preserve and use their dead son's sperm did so in 2002 after their son, a soldier, was shot dead by a Palestinian sniper in the Gaza Strip. Their granddaughter is now 10 years old.</p>

<p>While experts believe the process has “great meaning” to bereaved families, they also say that "the current rules have created a conflict in the case of single men" as their desire to have a child has to be proven to court for the procedure to be carried out.</p>

<p>As single men often have no clear record of consent, their families, who arealready coping with grief in “a very difficult situation”, can only freeze the sperm but can't use it for fertilisation.</p>

<p>Currently, Israeli lawmakers are attempting to draft a bill to create clearer, more comprehensive rules for the process seeing the high number of deaths in the ongoing war in Gaza.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The virtual gathering of prominent Democrats, hosted by Christine Pelosi and Nikki Fried, was held on Tuesday evening to denounce Vance's sexist remarks.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican Vice Presidential nominee JD Vance's "childless cat ladies" comment about Kamala Harris has rubbed many the wrong way. Criticism poured in from various quarters, including Harris' stepdaughter, Ella Emhoff, and actor Jennifer Aniston.</p>

<p>Now, a group of pet lovers and self-described "cat ladies" has responded to Vance's comments by throwing their weight behind Kamala Harris' presidential campaign. They held the latest in a series of Zoom calls.</p>

<p>JD Vance's original remarks, made during a 2021 interview with Fox News host Tucker Carlson, said the US was run by Democrats, "a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they have made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too."</p>

<p>On Tuesday, a virtual gathering of prominent Democrats, hosted by Christine Pelosi and Nikki Fried, was held to denounce JD Vance's sexist remarks. The Zoom call had various participants, including former chair of the Democratic National Committee, Donna Brazile, and Illinois congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, who appeared with their dogs.</p>

<p>The meeting, organised by the group 'Pet Lovers Fur Kamala', began with a slideshow of pet pictures set to ABBA's Dancing Queen, with a surprise appearance by Nancy Pelosi.</p>

<p>Pelosi spoke on the importance of supporting women's freedom to "love how they wanna love, and live how they wanna live," as per the Guardian. She criticised Vance's comments, and said the "cat ladies are striking back," adding, "He didn't realise what an opportunity he was giving us, and what he would unleash."</p>

<p>Nikki Fried, former Florida commissioner of agriculture, warned that a Harris loss would lead to a nationwide embrace of extremist policies, citing her experience with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. "We have been living under Project 2025. We have been the lab rats for the Heritage Foundation," she said.</p>

<p>Christine Pelosi and the organisers provided tips on engaging supporters through social media, phone banks and volunteering for Kamala Harris's campaign.</p>

<p>Last week, JD Vance defended his "childless cat ladies" remark, saying they were meant to criticise the Democratic Party's stance on family and children, not individuals who choose not to have kids.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sealed inside a habitat in Texas and cut off from the outside world for over a year, Kelly Haston was the commander of a first-of-its-kind simulation for NASA to prepare for a future mission to Mars.</p>

<p>From conducting mock "Marswalks" to tending to a vertical garden, and occasionally grappling with boredom -- Haston expressed pride in advancing the cause of space exploration while admitting the experience made her reconsider the reality of life on the Red Planet.</p>

<p>"Going to space would be an amazing opportunity," the 53-year-old biologist told AFP. "But I would say that it would be harder having experienced this, to know how it feels to leave your people."</p>

<p>The overarching goal of the experiment, called CHAPEA (Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog) Mission 1, is to better understand the impacts of isolation on a crew's performance and health.</p>

<p>The project lasted 378 days and concluded in early July.</p>

<p>After all, a round-trip to Mars could easily take more than two years, factoring in the transit time of six to nine months and the time NASA hopes to spend on the planet.</p>

<p>For Haston, the hardest part was clear: "I could have been in that habitat for another year and survived with all of the other restrictions, but your people -- you miss your people so much."</p>

<p>Communications with the outside world were delayed by twenty minutes each way, simulating how long it takes a radio signal to travel between Earth and Mars.</p>

<p>They were also some limits on sending and receiving videos, to account for bandwidth restrictions.</p>

<p>The worst feeling was when relatives or friends were experiencing rough times, said Haston. "You couldn't be there for them in real-time."</p>

<p>Her only direct human contacts were her three teammates and fellow Mars colonists -- but she insists they never went stir-crazy.</p>

<p>"Of course, there were times where you had crabby days, or something was bothering us, either as a crew or as an individual," she explained.</p>

<p>"But the communication was extremely good in this group," she said and besides, such problems were few and far between. "Up until the very end, we ate meals together."</p>

<p>Their 1,700-square-foot (160-square-meter) home included crew quarters, common areas and even an area for crops like tomatoes and peppers.</p>

<p>Called "Mars Dune Alpha" the 3D-printed habitat was installed inside a hangar at the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston.</p>

<p>Simulated "Marswalks" took place in an exterior area that recreated the Martian environment with red soil and cliffs painted along the walls.</p>

<p>Crew members donned spacesuits and passed through an airlock to reach the "sandbox," as it was nicknamed, with tasks coordinated by their colleagues inside.</p>

<h3><strong>Boredom&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"There were days where you did really wish you were outside, I can't lie," says the Canadian who now lives in California. But, to her surprise, these pangs only intensified towards the end.</p>

<p>Periods of boredom are an inevitable part of long space expeditions, and it was precisely this extended isolation that set CHAPEA apart from most prior "analog" missions.</p>

<p>Halston staved off ennui by embroidering mission symbols and images of Mars.</p>

<p>Of course, "analogs can't address all problems or all issues of an eventual mission to Mars," she said, though the lessons learned will aid in planning.</p>

<p>Each team member's food intake was meticulously documented, their blood, saliva and urine samples were collected, and their sleep habits and physical and cognitive performance were analyzed.</p>

<p>"The food system is one of the greatest mass drivers on a human mission for human logistics, and we are going to be resource-constrained on these missions," NASA scientist Grace Douglas said on a podcast.</p>

<p>This makes it critical to determine the minimum necessary provisions to maintain astronauts' health and ensure the mission's success.</p>

<p>For now, NASA is keeping the details of the crew's tasks under wraps to preserve the element of surprise for the next two iterations of the mission. CHAPEA 2 is set for 2025.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Republican's race for the White House was thrown into chaos on July 21 when US President Joe Biden withdrew his candidacy, backing Vice President Harris as the Democratic nominee.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Forced to formulate a new electoral strategy less than 100 days before the US presidential election, Donald Trump will take part in two campaign events on Wednesday, with new opponent Kamala Harris in his sights.</p>

<p>The Republican's race for the White House was thrown into chaos on July 21 when US President Joe Biden withdrew his candidacy, backing Vice President Harris as the Democratic nominee.</p>

<p>Trump had placed 81-year-old Biden's health at the heart of his political campaign, portraying him as an enfeebled old man.</p>

<p>Now, he faces an entirely different candidate: the country's first Black, woman and South-Asian-origin Vice President, who is almost two decades his junior.</p>

<p>The change in candidate has forced Trump and the Republicans to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/as-kamala-harris-closes-in-how-donald-trump-is-trying-to-stop-her-6206034" target="_blank">change their strategy rapidly</a>, and it appears that his campaign is still settling on a line of attack against her.</p>

<p>So far, he has described his rival as "Lying Kamala," "Laughing Kamala" and "Crazy Kamala," among other epithets.</p>

<p>He has also taken sharper lines of attack against her.</p>

<p>In North Carolina last week, Trump falsely accused the US vice president of being in favor of "the execution of a baby," mischaracterizing her position on the wedge issue of abortion.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Trump will fly to Chicago to participate in a roundtable discussion with African American journalists that will be devoted to "the most pressing issues facing the Black community."</p>

<p>According to his campaign, Trump will explain how he "accomplished more for Black Americans than any other president in recent history by implementing America First policies on the economy, immigration, energy, law and order, and foreign policy."</p>

<p>Later in the day, the former president will hold a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, a battleground state where he narrowly survived an assassination attempt earlier this month.</p>

<p>Saturday will see him head to Atlanta, Georgia, where he will appear in a campaign event alongside running mate J.D. Vance.</p>

<p>The 39-year-old Ohio senator was once a staunch critic of Trump, but changed his tune to become one of his most vocal supporters.</p>

<p>Since his selection as Trump's running mate, a series of videos of controversial past statements have emerged.</p>

<p>In one of them, Vance mocks "childless cat ladies," suggesting that those without children were less fit to govern as they were "miserable" and had no "direct stake" in the country.</p>

<p>In recent remarks to donors Vance described Harris's entry into the race for the White House as a "sucker punch" for the Republican camp, according to US media.</p>

<p>Harris, who has criss-crossed Wisconsin, Georgia and Indiana in recent days, will be in Houston, Texas, on Wednesday evening to address a gathering of African-American students.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The week gone by has been a busy period for India in the Indo-Pacific. India's External Affairs Minister, S. Jaishankar, attended the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Laos and the Quad Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Japan. Jaishankar's visit to Laos also featured a bilateral meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, following their last meeting at Astana earlier this year. The context for Jaishankar's visit was set by India's enduring pushback against China in key arenas of its interest. Arguably, China remains the pre-eminent concern for India's national security planners. India's China challenge is multipronged, with unresolved border conflict along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), as well as Beijing's expanding footprint in the Indian Ocean. China's more recent overtures in the Indo-Pacific, especially in the South China Sea region, have also compelled India's Quad partners and several Southeast Asian countries to intensify measures to counterbalance Beijing. Thus, the China question was a natural focal point for Jaishankar during both Laos and Japan visits.</p>

<h2><strong>China, A Critical Cog In The Quad</strong></h2>

<p>At the Quad Foreign Ministers' meeting, the four member countries of the grouping released a joint statement which amply addressed their common concerns with regard to China's belligerent posturing in the Indo-Pacific. The Quad members have long resisted the notion that the formulation of the grouping is directed at countering Beijing, instead emphasising that it seeks to harness the emerging opportunities of collective cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. There is no denying, however, that the China factor is a critical cog in the Quad wheel. The latest joint statement released by the Quad countries evidently suggests that concerns regarding China's overtures in the Indo-Pacific appear to be taking centre-stage in the thinking of the grouping. The joint statement expressed concerns over the evolving situation in the East and South China Seas, alluding to China's unilateral actions by use of force and coercion. The statement decried, without naming, Beijing's use of coast guard and maritime militia in the South China Sea attributing it to 'dangerous manoeuvres' in the region.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Jaishankar's individual remarks about the state of India-China relations have further garnered attention. Upon being questioned about India's relations with China, Jaishankar unequivocally stated that the bilateral ties between the two neighbours are 'not doing very well'. This admission appears to present continuity in India's enduring pushback against China in light of border skirmishes and conflict since 2020. However, in the Indo-Pacific context, a shift appears to be underway in India's approach towards China. In the past, India's response to China's aggressive overtures in the Indo-Pacific had remained relatively subdued. In its stead, Jaishankar's recent comments at the Quad summit and the joint statement demonstrate India's willingness to push back against China in the Indo-Pacific context as well.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>An Eye On Distant Seas</strong></h2>

<p>The question arises, what explains India's pushback against China's unilateral actions in the South China Sea? Even though the South China Sea geography does not fall under India's primary maritime area of interest, it remains vital for India's myriad strategic interests, such as the protection of Sea Lines of Communication (SLOCs), energy security, etc. Moreover, India's sustained advocacy for a free, open, inclusive, and rules-based order at sea, emphasising the need for adherence to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), makes it imperative for New Delhi to respond critically against Chinese attempts to change the status quo in the region.</p>

<p>Within the wider Indo-Pacific, China's continued attempts to foray into the Indian Ocean region, more recently by way of sending survey and surveillance vessels into the region, have prompted an enduring security dilemma in New Delhi, of People's Liberation Army Navy's (PLAN) imminent launch of carrier task force patrols in the Indian Ocean by 2025. Thus, upping the ante against China in the Indo-Pacific appears to be a logical progression in India's continued efforts to counter Beijing's advances in geographies of India's core interests at sea.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>India's Message</strong></h2>

<p>Notably, Jaishankar has displayed nuance and complex thinking in India's plans to counter the multipronged challenge that China poses. While on the Indo-Pacific front, India has sought to actively engage in minilateral groupings to counter China, upon being asked if New Delhi would encourage third-party intervention for the resolution of the India-China territorial border conflict along the LAC, Jaishankar reiterated that only bilateral engagement based on 'mutual respect, mutual interest, and mutual sensitivity' can restore normalcy.</p>

<p>The message is very clear: New Delhi will not relent in pressing ahead with its pushback against Beijing even as the door is open for China to recalibrate its anti-India positioning.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Since October 7, thousands of Palestinians -- including medics, patients, residents and captured fighters -- have been taken from Gaza to Israel.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Palestinians detained by Israel during the Gaza war have largely been held in secret and in some cases subjected to treatment that may amount to torture, the United Nations said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Since October 7, thousands of Palestinians -- including medics, patients, residents and captured fighters -- have been taken from Gaza to Israel, "usually shackled and blindfolded", while thousands more have been detained in the West Bank and Israel, the OHCHR UN human rights office said in a report.</p>

<p>"They have generally been held in secret, without being given a reason for their detention, access to a lawyer or effective judicial review," OHCHR said.</p>

<p>At least 53 detainees from Gaza and the West Bank have died in Israeli detention since the Gaza war began on October 7, the report found.</p>

<p>"The testimonies gathered by my office and other entities indicate a range of appalling acts, such as waterboarding and the release of dogs on detainees, amongst other acts, in flagrant violation of international human rights law and international humanitarian law," said UN human rights chief Volker Turk.</p>

<p>He called on all parties to the conflict to implement a ceasefire, ensure full respect for international law and ensure accountability for violations and abuses.</p>

<p>The report, "Detention in the context of the escalation of hostilities in Gaza", covers the period from October 7 to June 30.</p>

<p>It said that there were "reasonable grounds to believe" that since October 7, Israel and Palestinian armed groups had "committed gross violations and abuses... of the rights to life, liberty and freedom from torture and other ill-treatment as well as rape and other forms of sexual violence, all of which may also amount to war crimes".</p>

<p>The October 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel that started the war resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Hamas also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,400 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory, which does not provide details on civilian and militant deaths.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the last surviving French veterans of the June 1944 D-Day landings has died aged 105, only weeks after he helped welcome US President Joe Biden to Paris for the 80th anniversary of the amphibious assault, the presidency said Tuesday.</p>

<p>Jacques Lewis passed away on Thursday at the Invalides Memorial complex in Paris where he had spent his final years.</p>

<p>He took part in the June 1944 D-Day landings alongside American units on Utah beach, as Allied forces swept into Normandy to begin their offensive to end Nazi occupation of France and Western Europe in World War II.</p>

<p>After landing, he sought out locals from the town of Carentan to map the area to help Allied forces take the town.</p>

<p>He then took part in other battles in France before moving into Germany itself "always alongside his brothers-in-arms from the American division", the Elysee said.</p>

<p>He was caught up in the war from the age of 20, in 1939, while he was a student at Sciences-Po University in Paris.</p>

<p>He first served as an officer cadet in the army before joining the ranks of Free France in London after the 1940 capitulation of France to Germany.</p>

<p>Making it to Britain from occupied France had been anything but easy.</p>

<p>"Crossing the Pyrenees on foot, armed only with a compass, arrested on his arrival in Spain (...) he managed to escape from the prison in Pamplona, boarded a Liberian cargo ship and began the crossing of the Atlantic under German bombardment," the Elysee said.</p>

<p>Speaking good English, he was integrated into the ranks of US General George Patton's 2nd Armored Division where his interpreting skills proved hugely valuable.</p>

<p>He was present in June under the Arc de Triomphe for the welcoming ceremony for Biden in Paris marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings.</p>

<p>President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte salute "a figure of a French destiny filled with courage and audacity, who preferred to risk his life rather than his honour, and allowed the nation to regain its freedom".</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India is not historically responsible for the climate crisis but it should not emulate polluting practices of the West from the 19th century during its development, Commonwealth Secretary General Patricia Scotland has said.</p>

<p>In an interview with news agency PTI, Scotland said India has the opportunity to lead a just and equitable energy transition by sharing expertise and technology within the 56-nation club called Commonwealth, which represents 2.7 billion people.</p>

<p>She also said that India can exemplify a new, clean and safe development model that can serve as a beacon of hope for the Global South.</p>

<p>"India is a developing country, which was not historically responsible for creating this (climate) crisis. So, India is in a similar position to many of the Global South countries. And that is absolutely true," the Commonwealth secretary general said.</p>

<p>Despite not causing the crisis, she said, India is suffering from severe climate consequences, including extreme heat, floods and intense monsoons, and must take action.</p>

<p>"Look at the level of heat in some of the cities in India, look at the floods, look at the monsoons. Our people are suffering. So there is a responsibility on all of us, responsibility which India has committed herself to and has taken action on to make it better," Scotland said.</p>

<p>The Commonwealth secretary general told PTI that India should not emulate the West's development model, which failed and led to the climate crisis.</p>

<p>"Why should India wish to emulate that which others have done before ... (and) failed? I would be very disappointed if India was reaching back to 18th and 19th century solutions and repeating what others have done.</p>

<p>"It is not going to wash for us to say (that) because they (West) created a nightmare from which we are now suffering and dying... (it) justifies us continuing to do what they did. I think we are better than that," she said.</p>

<p>At the 2015 UN climate talks in Paris, countries committed to limiting the global average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.</p>

<p>The Earth's global surface temperature has already increased by around 1.2 degrees Celsius due to the rapidly increasing concentration of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide and methane, in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Poor and middle-income countries often argue that the current global warming is disproportionately caused by the historical emissions of developed countries during their industrialisation phases. They contend that they should have the right to use fossil fuels to alleviate poverty and achieve economic growth.</p>

<p>Scotland said that unlike the West during its development, India understands the consequences of its actions and has the opportunity to lead by creating a new and regenerative model of development using a circular economy.</p>

<p>"India and Prime Minister Mr. Modi have done some extraordinary things in terms of building new cities. What if India can become the exemplar of how you create a regenerative model of development using a circular economy, which actually works out," the Commonwealth secretary general said.</p>

<p>"I would be disappointed if the hope that India is for the Global South were to be diminished. I would be so saddened because India knows that because she has revolutionised development with so many technological innovative approaches which others are emulating. I would want them to emulate the best in India," she added.</p>

<p>Scotland said India's renewable energy makes up "35 per cent of its energy consumption" and the initiatives it is leading, such as the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, show what is possible through innovation and collaboration.</p>

<p>As part of its updated national climate plan to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, India aims to increase the share of non-fossil power capacity to 50 per cent by 2030, which is conditional on international support.</p>

<p>At present, India has a total installed power capacity of 446 gigawatts, with renewable energy accounting for 195 gigawatts.</p>

<p>It also aims to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP (the amount of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of GDP) by 45 per cent by 2030 compared to the 2005 levels.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Disinformation and propaganda, long mainstays of war, have been digitally supercharged in the battle for Ukraine, the biggest conflict the world has seen since the advent of smartphones and social media.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In early April, some residents of Kharkiv received a series of chilling text messages from government officials telling them to flee the city before Russian forces surrounded it.</p>

<p>"Due to the threat of enemy encirclement, we urge the civilian population of Kharkiv leave the city by April 22," said one alert, which bore the logo of the State Emergencies Service of Ukraine and mapped out safe escape routes on a slick infographic.</p>

<p>It was fake. Volodymyr Tymoshko knew immediately. He's the police chief of Kharkiv region and would have been one of the first to find out about any official evacuation plans.</p>

<p>"Residents started getting these notifications en masse," the 50-year-old told Reuters as he shared a screenshot of the alert, sent as Russian troops were massing at the border 30 km away.</p>

<p>"This is a psychological operation, it triggers panic. What would an average citizen think when they receive such a message?"</p>

<p>Disinformation and propaganda, long mainstays of war, have been digitally supercharged in the battle for Ukraine, the biggest conflict the world has seen since the advent of smartphones and social media.</p>

<p>Tymoshko said he received about 10 similar messages via SMS and Telegram messenger in April and early May, the weeks leading up to Russia's offensive in northeastern Ukraine that began on May 10 and opened up a new front in the war.</p>

<p>A Ukrainian security official, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said the Russians frequently sent large numbers of text messages from devices attached to an Orlan-10 long-range reconnaissance drone which can penetrate dozens of kilometres into Ukrainian airspace.</p>

<p>The devices, known as Leer-3 systems, imitate cellular base stations that phones automatically connect to in search of coverage, he added.</p>

<p>The phone barrage was accompanied by a social media blitz as Russian troops advanced on Kharkiv, according Andriy Kovalenko, head of Ukraine's Centre for Countering Disinformation (CCD), a branch of the national security council.</p>

<p>The average number of social media posts classed as disinformation about the war by Ukrainian authorities spiked to over 2,500 a day when the Kharkiv offensive began in May, up from 200 a day in March, data compiled by the CCD shows.</p>

<p>The CCD chief told Reuters that Ukrainian intelligence had assessed that disinformation campaigns were primarily carried out by Russia's FSB security service and military intelligence agency, commonly known as the GRU.</p>

<p>Russia's foreign ministry and the FSB didn't respond to a request for comment on the Ukrainian assertions, while Reuters was unable to contact the GRU.</p>

<p>Moscow has accused Ukraine and the West of unleashing a sophisticated information war against Russia, using the West's major media, public relations and technology assets to sow false and biased narratives about Russia and the war.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian security official acknowledged his country used online campaigns in an attempt to boost anti-war sentiment among Russia's population, although he characterised this effort as "strategic communications" to spread accurate information about the conflict.</p>

<h3><strong>BOTS AND MICROTARGETING</strong></h3>

<p>Reuters interviewed nine people with knowledge of the information and disinformation war being waged in parallel with battlefield operations, including Ukrainian officials, disinformation trackers and security analysts.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian security official who requested anonymity said that since the full-scale invasion of 2022, intelligence agencies had shut down 86 Russian bot farms located in Ukraine which controlled a collective 3 million social media accounts with an estimated audience reach of 12 million people.</p>

<p>Such facilities are rooms filled with banks of specialised computing equipment that can register hundreds of fake accounts daily on social media networks to pump out false information, the official added, citing one farm that was found by security services in the city of Vinnytsia in central Ukraine last year.</p>

<p>Kovalenko said that at present, the most significant sources of online Russian disinformation were TikTok in Ukraine and Telegram in Europe. Both are widely used in Ukraine.</p>

<p>He said that earlier this year, TikTok had shut down about 30 of the 90 accounts that Ukraine had flagged as Russia-affiliated disinformation spreaders, adding that new accounts often popped up to replace those taken down.</p>

<p>TikTok told Reuters its guidelines prohibited false or misleading content, adding that it had closed down 13 covert influence networks operating from Russia in recent years.</p>

<p>"We prohibit and constantly work to disrupt attempts to engage in covert influence operations by manipulating our platform and/or harmfully misleading our community," a spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Disinformation networks are groups of accounts controlled by the same entity, and often used to push a coordinated narrative.</p>

<p>Telegram said it was developing a tool to add verified information to posts.</p>

<p>"It is Telegram's belief that the best way to combat misinformation is not with censorship but with easy access to verified information," a spokesperson added.</p>

<p>Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov told Reuters that the Russians were trying to sow panic and distrust, citing an example of social media posts claiming the main road to Kyiv was being resurfaced so that the mayor could flee faster when the Russians came - something he dismissed as a lie.</p>

<p>"They are trying to frighten the population so that people feel uncomfortable and leave the city," he said in an interview in Kharkiv in late May.</p>

<p>By that time, the frontlines of the conflict in the northeast had stabilised about 20 km from the edge of the city after the Russian offensive had initially gained territory to the north before being blunted by Ukrainian reinforcements.</p>

<p>Maria Avdeeva, a Kharkiv-based security analyst who focuses on Russian disinformation, showed Reuters an infographic map, bearing Ukraine's state emblem of a trident, posted on Facebook in early April - around the same time as police chief Tymoshko was sent a different evacuation map in a direct Telegram message.</p>

<p>Unperturbed by a loud explosion from a glide bomb a few kilometres away, she explained how the map and accompanying text included fake road closures and claims that missile strikes were expected in specified areas around the city soon.</p>

<p>Microtargeting - which analyses people's online data to target particular individuals and audiences with specific messages, much like targeted advertising - is complicating the CCD's task of tracking influence campaigns and countering false narratives, Kovalenko said.</p>

<p>"This activity is notably very tactical," said John Hultquist, chief analyst at U.S. cybersecurity firm Mandiant, referring to Russian disinformation campaigns in Ukraine.</p>

<p>"We've seen targeting all the way down to the Ukrainian soldiers in the trenches."</p>

<h3><strong>AIRSTRIKE TAKES OUT TV TOWER</strong></h3>

<p>Ukrainians are particularly vulnerable to digital disinformation; more than three-quarters of the population get their news from social media, far more than any other source of information, according to a study commissioned by USAid in 2023.</p>

<p>That is considerably higher than in any of the 24 European countries surveyed by a 2024 Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism report, which averaged a rate of 44%.</p>

<p>In late April, as Moscow's forces massed on the border near Kharkiv, a Russian airstrike took out Kharkiv's main television tower, hindering the city's access to information.</p>

<p>Dramatic footage obtained by Reuters showed the main mast of the television tower breaking off and falling to the ground.</p>

<p>While the Kharkiv offensive led to a significant spike in disinformation activity, there have been similar Russian campaigns over the course of the war, according to the people interviewed.</p>

<p>The head of the CCD highlighted a Russian campaign in October 2023 aimed at driving home the idea that Ukraine was facing a tough winter and defeat in the war.</p>

<p>Osavul, a Ukrainian disinformation tracking company, showed Reuters its data for this campaign, which it called "black winter". It counted 914 messages posted by 549 actors which collectively received nearly 25 million views.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, according to Kovalenko, the sheer scale and frequency of Russian influence operations meant Ukrainians were becoming more suspicious of the information they receive, blunting their impact.</p>

<p>The disinformation push during Russia's initial advance towards Kharkiv at the start of the invasion in 2022 - when they got much closer to the city - contributed to the panic and shock that led to hundreds of thousands of residents fleeing, several officials and experts said.</p>

<p>This time around, only a small number left Kharkiv, even though the amount of disinformation messaging aimed at the city was double the level in March 2022, according to CCD data.</p>

<p>Despite the near-daily missiles and bombs falling on the city - attacks that intensified this May - 1.3 million people remain, according to Kharkiv Mayor Terekhov, roughly the same as before Russia's latest military incursion in the region.</p>

<p>The comparative lack of panic also reflects Ukrainians' increasing familiarity with living under attack.</p>

<p>Reuters spoke to nearly two dozen Kharkiv residents in the second half of May, when the city was being hit by several bombs or missiles a day.</p>

<p>Most said they felt no desire to leave and shrugged off the danger, saying they had become used to it. Several said they had stopped following the news.</p>

<p>"This is a psychological mechanism, we get used to danger," Kharkiv-based psychologist Iryna Markevych said.</p>

<p>In late May, Reuters correspondents dived to the ground for cover when they heard the whistle of a guided bomb piercing the air. Seemingly unfazed, mothers with pushchairs continued to stroll through the park and people bathed at a public fountain.</p>

<p>Yulia Oleshko, 55, a nanny pushing a buggy in a central Kharkiv park, said the best way to get through the nightmare was to simply focus on getting on with everyday life.</p>

<p>"Yesterday I was thinking: walking around Kharkiv is walking around a minefield ... but I try not to dwell on these thoughts of fear, otherwise one might fall into depression," she said.</p>

<p>"We abstract ourselves, otherwise we won't survive."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A mass food poisoning incident led to 60 people falling sick with symptoms of gastroenteritis at the Singapore office of TikTok's parent company, ByteDance on Tuesday. At least 57 of them had to be hospitalised after the incident.</p>

<p>According to local media reports, seventeen ambulances had to be sent to the building to treat those who fell sick.</p>

<p>In the wake of this incident, The Singapore Food Agency (SFA), in a joint statement with the city-state's Ministry of Health (MOH), said that food operators need to ensure good food safety practices. T</p>

<p>The BBC reports that no food is prepared or cooked at the ByteDance offices as it uses third-party caterers to supply food. Their statement added, "SFA will not hesitate to take enforcement action against errant food operators," the statement added."</p>

<p>A ByteDance Spokesperson has also reportedly told the BBC that they take the health of their employees very seriously and they have taken immediate steps to support all affected employees with emergency services.</p>

<p>While Byte Dance has said that they will be looking into what caused this mass food poisoning for their employees, an investigation is underway for the health and food safety officials of the city-state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hours after an Israeli strike in Tehran killed Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh, a video purportedly showing him celebrating the October 7 assault by Hamas on Israel has surface online.</p>

<p>"This was Hamas chief Haniyeh's reaction to the Hamas massacre on October 7. He's not celebrating anymore," Israel War Room said while sharing the video on X.</p>

<p>In the video, Haniyeh can be seen watching Hamas operatives waving guns on a truck driving through a desert on a TV screen. The clip shows Haniyeh surrounded by several others smiling at the screen before bowing his head and kneeling to offer a prayer.</p>

<p>The Hamas chief and one of his bodyguards were killed after their residence was targeted in Iran, the Palestinian group said in a statement today.</p>

<p>Hamas said Ismail Haniyeh was killed in "a treacherous Zionist raid on his residence in Tehran" Tuesday morning. The group said an investigation is on to find out more details about the attack.</p>

<p>Haniyeh was in the Iranian capital to attend the swearing-in of Iran's president Masoud Pezeshkian.</p>

<p>"Brother, leader, mujahid Ismail Haniyeh, the head of the movement, died in a Zionist strike on his headquarters in Tehran after he participated in the inauguration of the new (Iranian) president," the statement read.</p>

<p>Haniyeh was elected head of the Hamas political bureau in 2017 to succeed Khaled Meshaal. Considered a pragmatist, Haniyeh lived in exile and split his time between Turkey and Qatar.</p>

<p>Israel had vowed to kill Ismail Haniyeh and destroy the Hamas group after October 7 attack that resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australian children with potentially deadly peanut allergies will be offered life-saving treatment in a nationwide programme touted as a world first.</p>

<p>Eligible babies will receive daily doses of peanut powder for two years to build up their tolerance, said officials announcing the initiative on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Over time, the infants will be given increasing doses in the hope of reducing their sensitivity to peanuts, under the supervision of doctors at 10 paediatric hospitals around the country.</p>

<p>It is the first national peanut allergy treatment programme offered in hospitals outside of a clinical trial setting, said Kirsten Perrett, head of oral immunotherapy at the National Allergy Centre of Excellence.</p>

<p>At the end of the two years, a food allergy test will determine if the treatment has led to a remission.</p>

<p>"Ultimately we want to change the trajectory of allergic disease in Australia so that more children can go to school without the risk of a life-threatening peanut reaction," Perrett said.</p>

<p>Previously, families have been told to ensure their children strictly avoid foods with peanuts.</p>

<p>Australian children have some of the highest rates of food allergies in the world.</p>

<p>Peanut allergies affect three percent of Australian children by the time they are 12 months old, government data shows.</p>

<p>Of those, only 20 percent will outgrow their allergy by the time they are teenagers.</p>

<p>Nine-month-old Hunter Chatwin, who is among those in the free treatment programme, started developing hives after eating peanut butter.</p>

<p>"We are taking part in the programme to try and improve his chance of being able to safely eat peanut in the future," Hunter's mother Kirsten said.</p>

<p>"Many families are desperate to protect their children from allergic reactions and anaphylaxis," she said.</p>

<p>"To have this programme available and free at public hospitals is a game-changer."</p>

<p>If successful, the programme will be rolled out more broadly, including in regional and remote areas.</p>

<p>Deaths from peanut allergies are rare in Australia, but almost 20 percent of the population has an allergic disease, data from Australia's leading allergy institute found.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A young violinist accompanied thousands of opposition supporters belting out the Venezuelan national anthem Tuesday at a rally in Caracas, in a peaceful, but firm, rejection of an election victory claimed by strongman <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/nicolas-maduro-claims-victory-in-disputed-election-opposition-rejects-result-819828" target="_blank">Nicolas Maduro.</a></p>

<p>Many in the crowd wore white -- the favorite color of opposition leader Maria Corina Machado -- or national football team shirts and caps.</p>

<p>A sea of yellow, blue and red Venezuelan flags also filled the avenue, some worn as capes.</p>

<p>"You can see it, you can feel it, Edmundo is president!" sang the crowd, a chant that rhymes in Spanish.</p>

<p>"Maduro dictator!" shouted some, as others recited: "No to fraud!" and "We are not afraid!"</p>

<p>The demonstrators were among millions of Venezuelans who reject the election win given to Maduro by the regime-aligned CNE electoral council but questioned internationally.</p>

<p>The opposition has cried foul, claiming the rightful winner is 74-year-old Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, himself reluctantly thrust to the top of the ticket after Machado was kicked out of the race by authorities.</p>

<p>Against a wall outside the UN offices looking out over the rally, a teenager, his face covered by a flag, banged together two pots, a symbol of protest in Latin America. Incessantly.</p>

<p>At his feet, a small sign read: "We have the evidence, Edmundo is president."</p>

<p>Another youngster skillfully climbed a tall tree to hang a giant Venezuelan flag. People down below applaud.</p>

<h3><strong>We won</strong></h3>

<p>Machado and Gonzalez Urrutia arrived at the rally on top of the same open truck they had used on the campaign, as excited people pulled out their cellphones to capture the moment.</p>

<p>"I told you we were going to win and we won!" said Machado, as the crowd cheered.</p>

<p>The leadership have said they have the voting records to "prove" Gonzalez Urrutia's victory, and by a large margin.</p>

<p>The CNE had given 51 percent to Maduro, though it has not released a breakdown of the results.</p>

<p>Its website has been down since election day.</p>

<p>"We challenge the CNE to give us the tallies. What is the delay? What is the fear?" charged Machado.</p>

<p>"Results are not negotiated. The only thing we are willing to negotiate is a transition with guarantees for all."</p>

<h3><strong>I have faith</strong></h3>

<p>The authorities' response to the protests has been belligerent.</p>

<p>Security forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters Monday and an NGO said 11 people have been killed. Dozens more were injured.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Maduro said the opposition would be held responsible for "criminal violence."</p>

<p>In a rambling speech, in which he railed against the United States, imperialism and fascism, Maduro said he had ordered a special deployment of the armed forces against opposition "comanditos" -- volunteer organizing committees.</p>

<p>He claims they are financed by external forces to create chaos in Venezuela.</p>

<p>Gonzalez Urrutia, for his part, urged the armed forces Tuesday not to "repress" the will of the people, saying "there is no reason for so much persecution."</p>

<p>Monday's protests started in the poorest neighborhoods of the capital hardest hit by the economic crisis marked by a GDP drop of 80 percent in 10 years, and the emigration of more than seven million Venezuelans.</p>

<p>"People are tired," said Thais Farais, a 31-year-old administrator from one such area who attended Tuesday's opposition rally.</p>

<p>"They stole the election, 100 percent," said another opposition supporter goer, 25-year-old Jonathan Rada.</p>

<p>"But I have faith that we will get through it."</p>

<p>As the demonstration drew to a close, attendees once more sang the national anthem. In one voice.</p>

<p>But as they left, groups were targeted by teargas, apparently randomly.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

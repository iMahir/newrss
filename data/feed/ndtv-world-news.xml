       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met Joe Biden at the White House Thursday to present his wartime "victory plan," after the US president announced an $8 billion surge in military aid for Kyiv's fight against Russia.</p>

<p>But Zelensky's visit was clouded by a blazing row with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that underscored how November's US election could upend the support that Kyiv receives from its biggest backer.</p>

<p>"Russia will not prevail. Ukraine will prevail, and we'll continue to stand by you every step of the way," Biden said as he hosted Zelensky in the Oval Office, after thanking him for presenting the so-called victory plan.</p>

<p>Dressed in his trademark military-style outfit, Zelensky replied that "we deeply appreciate that Ukraine and America have stood side by side."</p>

<p>Zelensky is looking to shore up support for his war effort at the same time as Biden tries to lock in aid for Ukraine, ahead of the white-knuckle vote pitting Biden's Vice President Kamala Harris against firebrand Trump.</p>

<p>The Democrat pledged nearly $8 billion in military aid in his announcement on Thursday, including $5.5 billion to be authorized before it expires at the end of the US fiscal year on Monday.</p>

<p>Biden said in a statement that the "surge in security assistance for Ukraine" would "help Ukraine win this war."</p>

<p>Biden also announced Washington would provide Ukraine with the Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) long-range munition and called a summit of allies in Germany in October.</p>

<p>The White House however played down Ukraine's hopes that Zelensky's visit would achieve his long-held goal of getting permission to fire long-range Western-made missiles into Russian territory.</p>

<p>"I'm not expecting there to be any new announcements on this particular action or a decision coming out of this meeting," Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters.</p>

<p>Harris was due to meet Zelensky separately at the White House on Thursday.</p>

<p>Zelensky also visited the US Congress -- where his government said he had also presented his victory plan -- and gave a defiant address at the UN General Assembly on Wednesday.</p>

<p>- 'Greatest salesman on earth' -</p>

<p>But Zelensky's visit has prompted fresh nuclear saber rattling from Moscow, which has repeatedly warned the West against giving Ukraine long-range arms.</p>

<p>President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday announced plans to broaden Moscow's rules on the use of its atomic weaponry in the event of a "massive" air attack.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called the nuclear threat "totally irresponsible" while EU foreign policy spokesman Peter Stano said Putin was making a "gamble with his nuclear arsenal."</p>

<p>Kyiv faces an increasingly difficult battlefield situation two and a half years into Russia's invasion, with Russian forces continuing to push into eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>But the US presidential election means Washington's support now hangs on the balance -- and with Zelensky apparently at odds with Trump and the Republicans.</p>

<p>Trump had also been due to meet Zelensky during his US visit, but their talks now appear to be on ice.</p>

<p>Trump accused Zelensky on the eve of the visit of refusing to strike a deal with Moscow and once again questioned why the United States was giving billions of dollars to Kyiv.</p>

<p>At an election rally on Wednesday, the Republican called the Ukrainian president "probably the greatest salesman on Earth."</p>

<p>Republicans were livid after Zelensky visited an arms factory in Biden's hometown in the battleground state of Pennsylvania earlier this week, with House Speaker Mike Johnson calling for the Ukrainian ambassador to be sacked.</p>

<p>Zelensky also sparked fury in Republican ranks when he told The New Yorker magazine this week that Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance did not understand the war's complexity.</p>

<p>Trump has echoed many of Putin's talking points about previous US policy being to blame for the Russian invasion, and has been critical of Zelensky for years.</p>

<p>The United States has provided around $175 billion in both military and economic assistance to Ukraine during the war, despite frequent opposition from Republicans.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in an interview Thursday that Washington's economic ties with Beijing are closer now despite recent tariff hikes, with both sides cooperating in areas like financial stability.</p>

<p>"I do believe it's gotten closer," she told CNBC of the relationship between the world's two biggest economies.</p>

<p>"We've found ways to constructively discuss and address our differences."</p>

<p>This is in spite of intensifying competition between the United States and China in recent years.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden's administration has taken moves to limit Chinese firms' access to cutting-edge equipment, especially for military uses, and added on to tariffs on Chinese-made products introduced by his predecessor, Donald Trump.</p>

<p>In the run-up to the November election, in which Trump is facing off with Vice President Kamala Harris, both candidates have taken a firm stance on China.</p>

<p>But Yellen said of the current relationship: "We're cooperating in areas that the world needs us to work together. Financial stability is one of these areas."</p>

<p>On the US economy, Yellen told CNBC that all indications, ranging from the jobs market to growth figures, "suggest we're on a path to a soft landing" even if there remain risks.</p>

<p>"The last mile on inflation involves housing costs, and I believe there's good reason to think that they will fall," she said.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Yellen also called for regulation to boost the resilience of the US financial system.</p>

<p>"A resilient financial system is critical to a strong economy," she said at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.</p>

<p>"And strengthening it requires insisting on thoughtful regulation, including in the face of challenges from those who advocate to roll back policies and regulations," she said.</p>

<p>Taking aim at Trump's first term in office, she said the Treasury's focus on financial stability "had all but disappeared" when she took office in 2021.</p>

<p>"Appropriate regulation is critical to supporting a resilient financial system that serves as an engine for innovation and growth," Yellen said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Japanese man said to have spent the world's longest time on death row was acquitted of murder on Thursday, his legal team said, ending his family's search for justice after a wrongful conviction for crimes committed nearly 60 years ago.</p>

<p>The Shizuoka district court cleared Iwao Hakamada, 88, in a retrial of the murders of four people in the central Japanese region in 1966.</p>

<p>It was sweet to hear the words "not guilty" in the courtroom, said Hideko Hakamada, who has battled for decades to clear her younger brother's name.</p>

<p>"When I heard that, I was so moved and happy, I couldn't stop crying," she told a televised briefing.</p>

<p>Hakamada spent 45 years on death row before a court ordered his release and a retrial in 2014 amid doubts about the evidence on which his conviction was based.</p>

<p>The former boxer, who has lived with his sister since his release, had been accused of stabbing to death his former boss and family before burning down their home.</p>

<p>Though he briefly admitted to the killings, he retracted the confession and pleaded innocent during his trial, but was nevertheless sentenced to death in 1968, a penalty upheld by Japan's Supreme Court in 1980.</p>

<p>Norimichi Kumamoto, one of the Shizuoka court's three judges who had sentenced Hakamada to death, petitioned the Supreme Court for a retrial in 2008, but was rejected.</p>

<p>Hakamada's lawyers had argued that DNA tests on bloodstained clothing said to belong to their client showed the blood was not his.</p>

<p>Rights group Amnesty International hailed the exoneration as a "pivotal moment for justice" and urged Japan to scrap the death penalty.</p>

<p>"After enduring almost half a century of wrongful imprisonment and a further 10 years waiting for his retrial, this verdict is an important recognition of the profound injustice he endured for most of his life," Amnesty said.</p>

<p>"It ends an inspiring fight to clear his name," it added in a statement.</p>

<p>The government's top spokesperson, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, declined comment on individual cases, but acknowledged the Shizuoka court's ruling.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine and Russia are to exchange 13 children, displaced by Moscow's invasion, reuniting them with their families following mediation by Qatar, officials in the Gulf state said Thursday.</p>

<p>Russia has been accused of forcibly deporting thousands of Ukrainian children from schools, hospitals and orphanages in parts of the country controlled by its forces.</p>

<p>The "family reunification process involves the safe reunification of nine minors and one adult with their families in Ukraine," a Qatari official said.</p>

<p>"It will also include the reunification of four minors with their families in Russia."</p>

<p>The nine Ukrainian children, aged between 12 and 17, with one 19-year-old sibling accompanying them, include a child who lost his one remaining parent following the invasion and others who were staying with relatives when they were separated from their family.</p>

<p>Also among the Ukrainian minors are two teenagers with cerebral palsy, one of whom was placed in a children's home before the war. Both are accompanied by medical teams for their return.</p>

<p>The Russian children, aged between two and seven, include two who were in care centres before the war started, while the other two had been staying with relatives.</p>

<p>Qatari representatives will host the children at the embassy in Moscow before they are reunited with their families in Ukraine or elsewhere in Russia.</p>

<p>Ukraine has said some 20,000 children were taken to Russia following Moscow's February 2022 invasion.</p>

<p>Ukraine says the invading forces took them illegally to Russia and accuses the Russian authorities of trying to wipe out their Ukrainian identity.</p>

<p>Teenagers who returned to Ukraine have said they were subjected to Russian patriotic education and made to praise the Russian army.</p>

<p>Moscow has denied forcibly taking children to Russia, saying that minors were moved for their own safety if they were without parental care.</p>

<p>The exchange is the latest in a series of family reunifications brokered by Qatar that has seen scores of children returned to Ukraine and Russia following visits by Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani to Kyiv and Moscow last year.</p>

<p>"Qatar remains committed to its efforts to support the reunification of separated families and to ensure the safety, welfare and the reunification of children with their families," the Qatari official said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Parts of Florida face "unsurvivable" conditions when Hurricane Helene hits later Thursday, the US weather service said, warning that howling wind will drive destructive waves and storm surge as high as 20 feet (six meters) onto the low-lying coast.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Parts of Florida face "unsurvivable" conditions when Hurricane Helene hits later Thursday, the US weather service said, warning that howling wind will drive destructive waves and storm surge as high as 20 feet (six meters) onto the low-lying coast.</p>

<p>Residents heeded mass evacuation orders and fled ahead of the incoming hurricane -- projected to be one of the largest Gulf of Mexico storms in decades.</p>

<p>The fast-moving and intensifying storm was at Category 2 mid-day Thursday, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami said, packing wind speeds of 105 miles (169 kilometers) an hour as it churned over the gulf's warm waters.</p>

<p>The NHC said Helene is expected to make landfall at or near Florida's Big Bend coast in the evening as a major Category 3 and possibly even Category 4 storm.</p>

<p>The hurricane center minced no words on X, saying: "EVERYONE along the Florida Big Bend coast is at risk of potentially catastrophic storm surge."</p>

<p>Tampa and Tallahassee airports have already closed, and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis urged residents to rush final preparations ahead of the storm.</p>

<p>It's a "very dangerous hurricane," NHC director Mike Brennan said.</p>

<p>"We're expecting to see a storm surge inundation of 15 to 20 feet (4.5-six meters) above ground level," he said. "That's up to the top of a second story building. Again, a really unsurvivable scenario is going to play out here in this portion of the Florida coastline."</p>

<p>The accompanying waves "can destroy houses, move cars, and that water level is going to rise very quickly," Brennan added.</p>

<p><strong>Some hunkering down</strong></p>

<p>Despite the dire forecast Patrick Riickert refused to evacuate from his small wooden house in Crawfordville, a town of 5,000 people halfway between Tallahassee and the coast -- and that will almost certainly be walloped by Helene.</p>

<p>Most of the town has bolted, but he and his wife and five grandchildren are "not going anywhere," the 58-year-old told AFP.</p>

<p>"I am going to hunker down" and ride out the hurricane, as he did in 2018 when deadly Hurricane Michael, a Category 5 megastorm, blew through the Florida panhandle.</p>

<p>"I trust in my faith that God is going to keep me safe," he added.</p>

<p>The NHC warned of up to 20 inches (51 cm) of rain in isolated spots inland, and potentially life-threatening flooding as well as "numerous" landslides across the southern Appalachians.</p>

<p>Several states are in the potential path and were already getting battered by high winds and heavy rain. Floodwaters in cities around Tampa Bay have made roads impassable, local media showed.</p>

<p>The risk of tornadoes was increasing across northern Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas.</p>

<p>Georgia's capital Atlanta, a metropolis of some five million people, is forecast to experience tropical storm-force winds and as much as 12 inches (30.5 cm) of rainfall, which authorities warn could bring flash flooding.</p>

<p>Most of Georgia, which like Florida is under a state of emergency, was placed on flood watch, while Tennessee -- more than 300 miles from the Gulf Coast -- braced for tropical storm conditions statewide.</p>

<p><strong>'Multi-state event'</strong></p>

<p>"This is going to be a multi-state event with the potential for significant impacts from Florida all the way to Tennessee," Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator Deanne Criswell told reporters at the White House after she updated President Joe Biden on the situation.</p>

<p>"The president wants to make sure that everyone is paying attention to the potential life-threatening impacts that this storm may bring," she said.</p>

<p>Florida governor Ron DeSantis mobilized the National Guard and positioned thousands of personnel to prepare for search and rescue operations and power restoration.</p>

<p>A direct impact was likely in the Tallahassee region, where coastal communities now look like ghost towns.</p>

<p>Helene could become the most powerful hurricane to hit the United States in over a year -- and almost certainly the biggest.</p>

<p>Hurricane specialist Michael Lowry called Helene "extreme," noting the breadth of its tropical storm winds of 39 mph or higher stretch nearly 500 miles across.</p>

<p>Category 3 Hurricane Idalia hit northwestern Florida in August 2023.</p>

<p>Researchers say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of storms, because there is more energy in a warmer ocean for them to feed on.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The public wi-fi network across around 19 railway stations managed by the UK's Network Rail have been hacked and remain inaccessible on Thursday as British Transport Police (BTP) investigate the cyber-attack.</p>

<p>Network Rail said a number of London stations, including London Euston and Paddington, and Manchester Piccadilly, Liverpool Lime Street, Birmingham New Street, Edinburgh Waverley and Glasgow Central were among those targeted. Passengers trying to log on to public wi-fi at the Network Railway-managed stations were hit with a screen with a message about terror attacks in Europe.</p>

<p>"Last night the public wi-fi at 19 of Network Rail's managed stations was subjected to a cyber security incident and was quickly taken off-line," said a Network Rail spokesperson.</p>

<p>"The incident is subject to a full investigation. The wi-fi is provided by a third party, is self-contained and is a simple 'click &amp; connect' service that doesn't collect any personal data. Once our final security checks have been completed, we anticipate the service will be restored by the weekend," the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Telent, the company that manages the wi-fi system, said the attack first reported on Wednesday evening came from someone running the wi-fi homepage and the matter is now being dealt with by the police.</p>

<p>"An unauthorised change was made to the Network Rail landing page from a legitimate Global Reach administrator account and the matter is now subject to criminal investigations by the British Transport Police (BTP)," reads the Telent statement.</p>

<p>BTP said it is working at pace with its investigation: "We received reports at around 5.03pm yesterday (Wednesday) of a cyber-attack displaying Islamophobic messaging on some Network Rail Wi-Fi services. We are working alongside Network Rail to investigate the incident at pace." Earlier this month, Transport for London (TfL) was hit by a cyber-attack which is feared to have potentially breached customers' details. A teenager from Walsall, West Midlands, was arrested in connection with the TfL hack.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US prosecutors on Thursday charged New York City Mayor Eric Adams with accepting illegal campaign contributions and luxury travel from Turkish nationals seeking to influence him, capping an investigation that has sent the largest US city's government into turmoil.</p>

<p>In a 57-page indictment, prosecutors laid out an alleged scheme stretching back to 2014 that helped to underwrite Mr Adams' 2021 mayoral campaign and showered him with free rooms at opulent hotels and meals at high-end restaurants.</p>

<p>In return, Mr Adams pressured city officials to allow the country's new 36-story consulate to open despite safety concerns, prosecutors said. The Democrat faces five criminal charges, including conspiracy to commit wire fraud.</p>

<p>Mr Adams, 64, denied wrongdoing and said he would fight the charges in court. He said he would not step down.</p>

<p>"I will continue to do my job as mayor," he said at a news conference, where some onlookers called on him to resign.</p>

<p>Turkey's foreign ministry and president's office and its embassy in Washington had no immediate comment.</p>

<p>Earlier on Thursday, federal agents searched the mayor's Gracie Mansion home on Manhattan's Upper East Side, according to a Reuters witness. Around a dozen people in business attire were seen walking on the mansion's grounds with briefcases and duffel bags.</p>

<p>Mr Adams, a former police officer who rose to the rank of captain, is the first of the city's 110 mayors to be criminally charged while in office.</p>

<p>He could be removed from office by Democratic New York Governor Kathy Hochul but the process is complicated, said Pace University Law School professor Bennett Gershman.</p>

<p><strong>'Disguised Contributions'</strong></p>

<p>According to the indictment, Mr Adams accepted free travel from a Turkish airline worth tens of thousands of dollars while serving as Brooklyn borough president and paid $600 to stay two nights at a luxury suite in the St. Regis hotel in Istanbul, well below the actual cost of $7,000.</p>

<p>For his 2021 mayoral campaign, Mr Adams disguised campaign contributions from Turkish sources by funnelling them through US citizens, the indictment said. Those funds allowed Mr Adams to qualify for an additional $10 million in public financing.</p>

<p>"This was a multi-year scheme to buy favour with a single New York City politician on the rise," Damian Williams, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, said at a news conference.</p>

<p>Prosecutors say Mr Adams responded to Turkish concerns.</p>

<p>Acting on a request by a Turkish diplomat, Mr Adams pressured city safety inspectors to allow the country's new 36-story consulate to open in time for a September 2021 visit by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan even though it would have failed a fire inspection, the indictment said.</p>

<p>After repeated messages about the building from Mr Adams, a senior fire department official allegedly told a subordinate he would lose his job if he did not allow the consulate to open.</p>

<p>Mr Adams notified the diplomat when the Fire Department approved the building to open later in the day, the indictment said.</p>

<p>"You are a true friend of Turkey," the diplomat allegedly responded.</p>

<p>Mr Adams performed other favours as well, the indictment said. Before serving as mayor, Mr Adams allegedly cut ties with a community centre in Brooklyn that the diplomat said was affiliated with a hostile political movement, according to the indictment.</p>

<p>Shortly after he was inaugurated in 2022, an Adams staffer assured the diplomat that the new mayor would not make a statement on 1915 massacres of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire that Washington has called a genocide.</p>

<p>Mr Adams said he was aiming for a public trial to defend himself. "If it's foreign donors, I know I don't take money from foreign donors," he said.</p>

<p><strong>Top Officials Resign&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The case is likely to complicate any Adams bid for re-election in 2025, as other Democratic politicians, including New York City comptroller Brad Lander, plan to challenge him.</p>

<p>US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat, called on Mr Adams to step down. But Representative Hakeem Jeffries, a Brooklyn resident who serves as the top Democrat in the House, stopped short of doing so. "I pray for the well-being of our great City," he wrote on social media.</p>

<p>New York has been in a state of political upheaval for the past month. Police Commissioner Edward Caban resigned on September 12, a week after FBI agents seized his phone. Days later, Mr Adams' chief legal adviser resigned.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the city's public schools chief David Banks said he would retire at the end of the year, after the New York Times reported his phones were seized by federal agents.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[America is increasingly divided on political lines as the 2024 Presidential election approaches.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>America is increasingly divided on political lines as the 2024 Presidential election approaches. Though open and upfront divergence in political ideology is not uncommon among citizens, especially in democracies and near elections, another big divide has emerged in the run-up to the November polls - that of Corporate America.</p>

<p>Tech behemoths, banking giants, large corporations and even regional and small firms stand on either side of this political divide.</p>

<p>On November 5, citizens across the US will vote for their next president between Democrat candidate Kamala Harris and her Republican rival Donald Trump. The divide is straightforward - "liberal and left-leaning" Kamala Harris vs "protectionist and right-leaning" Donald Trump.</p>

<h2><strong>TECH BEHEMOTHS DIVIDED</strong></h2>

<p>Big tech has joined the cause, aligning themselves to their chosen candidate. Employees at Microsoft, Google (Alphabet), Amazon, and Sun Microsystems have donated millions of dollars to Kamala Harris's campaign, according the data made public by political watchdog OpenSecrets. The contribution to Ms Harris's campaign is significantly more than what was given to the Trump campaign.</p>

<p>Tech billionaires like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg are, however, rallying strongly for Donald Trump. The contributions they have made directly to the Trump campaign are not available at the moment.</p>

<p>According to the a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/27/media/mark-zuckerberg-election-season-republicans/index.html" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">CNN</a> report, Meta chief executive Zuckerberg made public statements supporting right-wing "censorship" narratives and praised Donald Trump for being a "badass". He later claimed he wanted to appear "neutral" and nonpartisan.</p>

<p>The report also said that Mr Zuckerberg sent a letter to the powerful House Judiciary Committee, stating that the Biden administration had "pressured" Meta to "censor" content.</p>

<p>"In 2021, senior officials from the Biden Administration, including the White House, repeatedly pressured our teams for months to censor certain COVID-19 content, including humor and satire, and expressed a lot of frustration with our teams when we didn't agree," Mr Zuckerberg said.</p>

<p>The letter was immediately weaponised by Trump, who claimed once again that the 2020 election was stolen.</p>

<p>Elon Musk, however, has been far more open in his support for Trump. According to ta report in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/elon-musk-has-said-he-is-committing-around-45-million-a-month-to-a-new-pro-trump-super-pac-dda53823" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a>, Musk had said in July that he is personally donating $45 million every month to an organisation called America PAC, which in turn looks after the Trump campaign.</p>

<p>Another big venture capitalist who is openly backing Donald Trump is Peter Theil.</p>

<p>Indian-American billionaire and co-founder of Sun Microsystems, Vinod Khosla, and venture capitalist Reid Hoffman are among those strongly backing Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Election funding data reveals that Sundar Pichai-led Google (Alphabet), and its subsidiaries have donated $2.16 million to Kamala Harris. In comparison, the same companies donated much smaller amounts to the Trump campaign.</p>

<p>While Satya Nadella-led Microsoft donated $1.1 million to Kamala Harris's campaign, Jeff Bezos-led Amazon donated $1 million. In comparison, the same groups made much lower contributions to the Trump campaign - $88,000 from Microsoft and $116,000 from Amazon and their employees.</p>

<p>More than a hundred venture capitalists and big tech companies in Silicon Valley, which has largely been left-leaning in the past, have backed Kamala Harris.</p>

<h3><strong>BANKING AND OIL GIANTS</strong></h3>

<p>Banking corporations and crude oil firms appear to be leaning towards Trump, thanks to his promise of less tax and less regulation in these sectors. Even the US stock market reflected that sentiment when there were assassination attempts against the Republican leader.</p>

<p>According to a Bloomberg report, CEOs of Oil giants have been getting signals from Donald Trump to go big on drilling due to Trump's love for oil. Trump has openly said that he does not believe in Climate Change and has called it a "lie". He has also said that he believes in coal and oil for energy because of the advantage United States has in the sector. The ex-President has also faced criticism from climate activists like Greta Thunberg for his view on the issue.</p>

<p>"We have more liquid gold than anybody," Trump had told Businessweek in July.</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-17/wall-street-s-trump-trade-focuses-on-big-oil-banking-dollar-debt" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> report, banking chiefs see an opportunity for more mergers and acquisitions in the energy sector, bringing a windfall in fees. The capital markets hope to send fresh dollars into pipelines, liquefied natural gas terminals and electric transmissions capabilities - and maybe even a new commitment to nuclear energy infrastructure.</p>

<p>Bankers also believe that strict rules which have been implemented under the Biden administration will be rolled back should Donald Trump. Some believe that new banking rules suggested by the Biden Administration will not even see the light of day.</p>

<p>Big banking giants and Oil firms are hence backing Donald Trump.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An endangered baby pygmy hippo that shot to social media stardom in Thailand has become a lucrative source of income for her home zoo, quadrupling its ticket sales, the institution said Thursday.</p>

<p>Moo Deng, whose name in Thai means "bouncy pork", has drawn tens of thousands of visitors to Khao Kheow Open Zoo this month.</p>

<p>The two-month-old pygmy hippo went viral on TikTok and Instagram for her cheeky antics, inspiring merch, memes and even craft tutorials on how to make crocheted or cake-based Moo Dengs at home.</p>

<p>A zoo spokesperson told AFP that ticket sales from the start of September to Wednesday reached almost 19.2 million baht ($590,000) -- more than four times the same period last year.</p>

<p>Fans from all over the world have queued for hours outside her enclosure, forcing keepers to limit Moo Deng observation time to five minutes each.</p>

<p>The zoo has set up a round-the-clock livestream of the hippo's enclosure to ease waiting times and for fans who cannot visit in person.</p>

<p>It is also hoping Moo Deng fever spurs further merchandise sales, launching a pygmy hippo-themed T-shirt line last week. At 300 baht, or $9 a pop, it is currently only available at the zoo itself.</p>

<p>"We have outsourced a company to help us produce Moo Deng products, like T-shirts and trousers," said the zoo's spokesperson, adding any Moo Deng-generated profits would go towards improving facilities for all the zoo's animals, not just its star moneymaker.</p>

<p>"Income will be used to maintain the zoo."</p>

<p>The hype has prompted animal rights group PETA to post a statement on its website saying "there's nothing cute about a baby being born in captivity".</p>

<p>Endangered pygmy hippos are native to West Africa, and there are only an estimated 2,000-2,500 left in the world, according to the IUCN.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Since 1949, China has strategically loaned giant pandas to foreign zoos to foster trade ties, strengthen diplomatic relations, and enhance its global image.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finland's Ahtari Zoo is prematurely ending its 15-year giant panda hosting program, returning Lumi and Pyry to China in November, eight years ahead of schedule. The decision stems from financial constraints, largely due to inflation and debt accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0z289ervmo">BBC</a></em>, the zoo spent approximately 1.5 million euros annually on the pandas' upkeep, exceeding the combined costs of all other species. Additional expenses included a full-time keeper, preservation fees to China, and imported bamboo, totalling over 8 million euros for their enclosure.</p>

<p>The agreement to return the pair was reached with the zoo's partners in China on September 20.</p>

<p>The Ahtari Zoo in Finland had high hopes that the giant pandas would draw in crowds to its central location, but unfortunately, that didn't quite pan out. Since the Covid pandemic, the zoo has struggled with declining visitor numbers, which, combined with inflation and rising interest rates, has led to significant debt.</p>

<p>The pandas were to be returned after 15 years but "our economic situation does not allow us to keep the pandas anymore" Ahtari Zoo's board chairman Risto Sivonen said.</p>

<p>Marko Haapakoski, curator at the zoo said, ''It's a good thing for the zoo because they were so expensive, but the pandas had been "doing well, so it's a pity. They're nice to work with."</p>

<p>Lumi and Pyry will undergo a month-long quarantine before returning to China.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Finland's foreign ministry said the pandas' return was a business decision that did not involve the government, and that it should not impact relations between Finland and China.</p>

<p>Since 1949, China has strategically loaned giant pandas to foreign zoos to foster trade ties, strengthen diplomatic relations, and enhance its global image. According to AFP, an estimated 1,860 giant pandas remain in the wild, mainly in bamboo forests in the mountains of China.&nbsp;About 600 are in captivity in panda centres, zoos and wildlife parks around the world.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alabama is set to carry out the second execution in the United States using nitrogen hypoxia, a controversial method critics say is tantamount to torture. According to <em>CNN</em>, a previous attempt to execute Alan Eugene Miller, 59, using lethal injection was called off two years ago after state officials said they couldn't access his veins before the execution warrant expired. Now on Thursday, he will be strapped to a gurney where a respirator mask will be applied to his face through which pure nitrogen will be piped. The resulting oxygen deprivation will cause death by asphyxia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Republican Alabama Governor Kay Ivey has designated a 30-hour window beginning Thursday morning for the 59-year-old's execution to take place, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/26/us/alan-eugene-miller-alabama-execution/index.html"><em>CNN </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Miller has been in jail for more than two decades. He was sentenced to death in 2000 for the 1999 murders of Lee Holdbrooks, Scott Yancy and Terry Lee Jarvis. He had worked with each of the victims and became upset when he believed the three "spread rumours about him", according to the outlet.</p>

<p>On August 5, 1999, Miller shot two of the three men at Ferguson Enterprises in Pelham, Alabama. "I'm tired of people starting rumours on me," Miller said, armed with a pistol while walking out of his employer's office. He then shot Scott Yancy three times and Lee Holdbrooks six times. He then headed to his previous employer, Post Airgas, where Terry Lee Jarvis worked and shot him "a number of times".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Miller was later captured on the highway with "a Glock pistol with one round in the chamber and 11 rounds in the ammunition magazine," per <em>CNN</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A forensic psychiatrist who testified for Miller's defence determined he was mentally ill and suffering a delusional disorder, leading him to believe the victims were spreading rumours about him. The psychiatrist concluded, however, that Miller's mental illness didn't meet the standards for an insanity defence in Alabama.</p>

<p>Notably, Miller's execution via nitrogen hypoxia comes nearly three years after Alabama officials tried to execute him by lethal injection, but failed because they could not access his veins within the required time limit. It also comes after a federal lawsuit filed by Miller over the use of nitrogen gas in his execution was settled last month.</p>

<p>The 59-year-old had challenged the state's nitrogen hypoxia protocol, claiming it could cause him undue suffering, thus violating his Eighth Amendment protections against cruel and unusual punishment. The terms of the settlement are confidential, though state Attorney General Steve Marshall touted it as proof Alabama's nitrogen gas execution method - which was used for the first and only time earlier this year in the execution of Kenneth Smith - is constitutional, as per the outlet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The resolution of this case confirms that Alabama's nitrogen hypoxia system is reliable and humane," Mr Marshall said in a statement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A pet-loving part-time musician is fast becoming a global star by gently poking fun at Donald Trump for suggesting that Haitian immigrants are making a meal of America's cats and dogs.</p>

<p>"Eating the cats", a parody song by The Kiffness which sets to music Trump's extraordinary claims during the US presidential debate that migrants in Ohio "are eating the dogs, eating the cats", has been viewed more than 8.7 million times on YouTube alone in 12 days.</p>

<p>"People of Springfield please don't eat my cat," pleads the South African singer, whose real name is David Scott. "Why would you do that?/ Eat something else."</p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3BrCvZmSnKA?si=bUXpPVN9Bf0W5RnT" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p>He then helpfully holds up a card suggesting a range of other mostly veggie options, including broccoli, avocados and poached eggs.</p>

<p>The singer, who has been slowly building a following for his feel-good songs about pets and children -- because "they tend to unite people" -- has seen his popularity soar since he got his singing claws into Trump.</p>

<p>Although he insists he is not attacking anybody, just giving some cat- and dog-friendly dietary advice.</p>

<p>"I think music has a powerful way of taking away negative energy and polarising feelings, especially with someone like Donald Trump, who is such a polarising figure," he told AFP before his band gave a concert in Paris.</p>

<p><strong>Not trying to hurt anyone</strong></p>

<p>"I want my music to unite people. And I think that's why I moved towards music that included animals. Because animals unite people," said the 36-year-old from Cape Town.</p>

<p>The video, which has been watched by millions more on social media, shows Trump's rival Kamala Harris reacting to his widely-derided claims during their debate earlier this month. A couple of cats and dogs also chip in with vocals, and equally incredulous looks.</p>

<p>Scott said all the earnings from the song are going to help pets and stray cats and dogs in Springfield, with more than $20,000 already raised.</p>

<p>"I've never seen anything like it," he told AFP. "The interest has been overwhelming from both sides, from Democrats, from Republicans."</p>

<p>He said the song was not "laughing at the situation, it's saying that you can rise above it... and just see the humour in things," said the musician, who describes himself on X as a "Christian, husband, father (and) part-time musician".</p>

<p>Springfield's mayor, police and Ohio's Republican governor have all said there is no evidence to back up Trump's claims that Haitian migrants were eating the city's pets.</p>

<p>But that has not stopped his running mate JD Vance -- an Ohio senator -- from doubling down on the claims, despite being widely mocked.</p>

<p>"My constituents are telling me firsthand that they're seeing these things," an unapologetic Vance told CNN.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk hit back at Britain on Thursday after reports that he had not been invited to the country's upcoming investment summit, alleging the government was releasing convicted paedophiles while imprisoning people over social media posts.</p>

<p>The BBC reported that the US billionaire had not been invited to the summit next month after his posts on his X platform regarding the violent, racist anti-immigration riots in Britain last month.</p>

<p>Britain's Department for Business and Trade and the Treasury did not respond to requests for comment on either the BBC report or Musk's response.</p>

<p>"I don't think anyone should go to the UK when they're releasing convicted pedophiles in order to imprison people for social media posts," Musk said on X in response to a post on the BBC report.</p>

<p>More than 1,700 prisoners were released early this month in an effort by Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour government to tackle overcrowding in prisons in England and Wales. Those serving sentences for sex offences were not included in the scheme.</p>

<p>The government and others criticised Musk, who has nearly 200 million followers on X, for his posts on Britain in August, including one saying civil war was "inevitable", as the country was shaken by riots that saw far-right groups attack hotels housing asylum seekers and mosques.</p>

<p>Starmer's spokesperson said at the time there was "no justification" for such comments. Over 1,000 arrests have been made in relation to the riots, and some people have been jailed for stirring up racial hatred on social media.</p>

<p>The investment summit next month is set to be attended by leaders from global tech and financial groups, including BNY Mellon and Blackstone. The Labour government, in power since July, is hoping to attract investors to boost the economy.</p>

<p>Musk, who met French President Emmanuel Macron in May for the "Choose France" summit in Paris, was last publicly seen in London last November when he attended the AI Safety Summit and was then interviewed by former Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India was elected to the 15-member steering committee of the global anti-corruption platform GlobE Network after multi-stage voting in Beijing on Thursday, officials said.</p>

<p>Having 121 member countries and 219 member authorities, the GlobE Network has one chair, one vice-chair and thirteen members in the steering committee for providing leadership.</p>

<p>India was elected to the steering committee after a multi-stage voting process during the ongoing fifth plenary meeting of the Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE Network) in Beijing, the officials said.</p>

<p>"As a member of the steering committee, India will play a crucial role in shaping the global agenda against corruption and asset recovery. India's expertise and experience in combating corruption will be valuable assets to GlobE Network," a CBI spokesperson said in a statement.</p>

<p>The Union Home Ministry is the central authority from India for the GloBE Network while the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) are member authorities.</p>

<p>A G20 initiative, the GlobE Network to combat cross-border financial crimes and corruption received strong support from India in 2020.</p>

<p>The platform was officially launched in June 2021 during a special event at the UN General Assembly Special Session against Corruption (UNGASS).</p>

<p>It has emerged as a unique platform where agencies from across the world share best practices, criminal intelligence, develop strategies, and support in the common cause of combating corruption, the CBI statement said.</p>

<p>"The GlobE Network is a vital platform for international cooperation, and India's participation will strengthen its efforts to combat cross-border financial crimes and corruption," it said.</p>

<p>During India's G20 presidency, two high-level principles for combatting corruption were adopted that detailed leveraging of the GloBE Network, it said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Disturbing incidents of teachers physically assaulting and punishing students are on the rise in China.&nbsp;A boarding school in Huairen County, Shanxi province, is now facing backlash for its harsh punishment of a student who used the bathroom late at night. On September 10, a Form Three student at Yundong Secondary School in Shanxi province used the bathroom at 11:10 pm, violating school rules. An anonymous teacher said that the school had strict rules prohibiting students from walking around the dormitory after 10:45 pm, and surprisingly, even using the toilet was not allowed after this time.</p>

<p>As a consequence, the teenager was forced to write a ''deep self-reflection'' letter and to distribute 1,000 photocopies of the essay to his schoolmates as punishment, the<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3279488/china-boarding-school-criticised-harsh-punishment-pupil-using-toilet-late-night" rel="nofollow, noindex"> South China Morning Post</a></em> reported. Five points were also deducted from his class's monthly discipline score.&nbsp;In his self-reflection essay, the student expressed: ''I have seriously breached the school rules, and going to the toilet in the evening not only disturbed other students' sleep but also brought shame to my class.''</p>

<p>The punishment meted out to the student for using the bathroom after curfew sparked widespread outrage online, with many condemning the school's actions as excessive and unjust. Some also called the school a ''prison". Critics argued that the penalty was grossly disproportionate to the offence, taking into account the student's tender age and the fundamental human need to use the bathroom. Many expressed concerns that such harsh punishment would have a lasting impact on the student's emotional well-being and self-esteem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One user wrote, ''I don't understand why going to the toilet after 11 pm breaks the school's rules. Who can control when they need to go?'' Another commented, ''This school resembles a prison with such strict regulations.''</p>

<p>In response to the widespread criticism on social media, the Education Department of Huairen department instructed the school to reflect on its errors, revise its discipline policies, and engage with the students in a caring and compassionate manner.</p>

<p>Additionally, the school was ordered to reimburse the student 100 yuan (Rs 1,193) for the costs incurred in copying the self-reflection essay. To prevent similar incidents, officials directed all schools in the region to adopt "reasonable and humane" discipline policies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, the worrying trend of student abuse by teachers in China has been persisting despite a government ban on corporal punishment in schools dating back to 1986.&nbsp;Last year, a nine-year-old girl underwent emergency surgery for a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/chinese-student-hospitalised-with-shattered-skull-after-teacher-beats-her-4400141" rel="nofollow, noindex">severely damaged skull,</a>&nbsp;after a teacher allegedly used a metal ruler to hit her on the head.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) has released a video explaining its strikes deep inside Lebanon where it alleged Hezbollah had hidden weapons in populated areas.</p>

<p>The IDF said Hezbollah has been hiding weapons inside Lebanese homes.</p>

<p>"For the last 20 years, Hezbollah built its terror network within population centres in Lebanon - primarily throughout southern Lebanon, an area that they turned almost entirely into a launch pad to attack Israel," the IDF said.</p>

<p>"Hezbollah doesn't want you to watch this video. And they really don't want you to share it," it said in the video posted on X.</p>

<p>The IDF's video is being seen as an effort to ward off criticism over attacks in populated areas in Lebanon.</p>

<p>"The IDF has launched a defensive operation against the Hezbollah terror organisation by conducting precise intelligence-based strikes on hundreds of Hezbollah targets. Our goal is to thwart imminent attacks planned by Hezbollah who intended to use the very weapons that we destroyed - at Israeli homes," the IDF said.</p>

<p>"Our goal is to make sure that Israeli families can safely and securely return to their homes," it said.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>In the latest strikes today, Israel bombed a Hezbollah commander's location in Beirut's southern suburbs, a source close to the group told news agency AFP, as Israel's army announced it was carrying out precision raids in the Lebanese capital.</p>

<p>"An Israeli strike targeted a Hezbollah commander," the security source said, requesting anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media. It is the fourth such attack targeting Hezbollah commanders in the area in a week.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French President Emmanuel Macron has voiced strong support for India's inclusion as a permanent member of a reformed United Nations Security Council (UNSC), along with Germany, Japan, Brazil, and two African nations.</p>

<p>"Germany, Japan, India and Brazil should be permanent members, as well as two countries that Africa would designate to represent it. New elected members should also be admitted," Mr Macron said while addressing the general debate at the 79th session of the UN General Assembly in New York early Thursday, India time.</p>

<p>The French President stressed the need for reforms within the UN to make it more effective and representative, particularly in light of the challenges posed by the current structure of the Security Council.</p>

<p>"The United Nations should not be discarded, but rather reformed to reflect today's realities," he said.</p>

<p>He said that the current Security Council, often blocked by conflicting interests, needs to evolve.</p>

<p>"Is there a better system? I don't think so. So let's just make these United Nations more effective, first by perhaps making them more representative. That is why France and I repeat here, is in favour of the Security Council being expanded," Mr Macron said.</p>

<p>The French President said that he hopes that "this reform will also make it possible to change working methods, to limit the right of veto in the event of mass crime and to focus on operational decisions that are necessary to maintain international peace and security. This is what we must have the courage and audacity to do and that we must carry forward with the current permanent members."</p>

<p>Earlier, Chilean President Gabriel Boric Font also advocated for India's inclusion, proposing a deadline for the reform to align the UNSC with modern geopolitical realities by the UN's 80th anniversary.</p>

<p>The call for India's permanent membership has also been echoed by other global leaders, including US President Joe Biden, who reiterated Washington's full support for India's bid during his recent bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>

<p>Russia, too, continues to back India's aspiration for a permanent seat, with the country's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov emphasising the need for greater representation of developing countries in the council during the ongoing annual UN event.</p>

<p>The growing consensus among world leaders highlights the urgency of reforming the UNSC to reflect the contemporary global order and ensure more inclusive and effective international governance.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ms Webb's death sparked a police investigation, with Gloucestershire Police arresting two individuals on suspicion of manslaughter.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alice Delsie Preete Webb, a 34-year-old mother of five and beauty therapist, died after undergoing a non-surgical liquid Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL) procedure. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/09/26/mum-of-five-first-person-die-brazilian-butt-lift-procedure-uk-21675248/">Metro</a></em>, she is thought to be the first person in Britain to die from the risky procedure. As per the report, Ms Webb was an advanced aesthetic practitioner at Crystal Clear in Wotton-under-Edge, a market town in Gloucestershire. Ms Webb leaves behind her partner, Dane Knight, and their five children —Delsie, 15, Preete, 13, Gracie, 12, Nylie, 10, and Clarie, 7.</p>

<p>Her death sparked a police investigation, with Gloucestershire Police arresting two individuals on suspicion of manslaughter. Although they have been released on bail, the incident raises serious concerns about the risks of unregulated cosmetic procedures.</p>

<p>A Gloucestershire Police spokesperson said: ''Two people have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter following the death of a woman in her 30s in Gloucester.&nbsp;Police had been called by the ambulance service at around 11.35 pm on Monday (23 September) with a report a woman had become unwell following a suspected cosmetic procedure.&nbsp;She was taken to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital and died in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Her next of kin and the coroner are aware. The woman's family are being supported by specially trained officers. an investigation, led by the Major Crime Investigation Team, is ongoing.''</p>

<p>The procedure, which involves injecting hyaluronic acid and dermal fillers into the buttocks, was reportedly performed by an unqualified individual without medical training. The liquid BBL procedure typically costs around 2,500 pounds and takes approximately 60 minutes. However, its non-surgical nature can be misleading, as it still carries significant risks, especially when performed by unqualified practitioners.</p>

<p><strong>About Liquid Brazilian Butt Lift</strong></p>

<p>The liquid Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL) differs from the traditional BBL, which involves fat grafting. Instead, liquid BBL uses injectable products for volumising and contouring, making it a less invasive procedure with no liposuction or fat transfer required. This results in a faster recovery time. However, the results of a liquid BBL are temporary, lasting approximately one to two years, depending on the product used and how the body metabolizes it.</p>

<p>In contrast, traditional BBL provides more long-lasting results, albeit at a higher cost, ranging from 5,000-6,000 pounds in the UK, with a procedure time of roughly two hours. The liquid BBL, on the other hand, typically costs 2,500 pounds and takes around 60 minutes to complete. Despite being marketed as a "risk-free" and "cheaper" alternative, liquid BBL carries risks, especially when performed by unqualified practitioners. Some individuals opt for the procedure in Turkey, where it is offered at a lower cost.</p>

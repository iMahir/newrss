       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vice President Kamala Harris, tasked to deal with the root causes of migration from Central America as illegal border crossings were rising in 2021, immediately ran into the enormity of the mission.</p>

<p>The region is riddled with corrupt government officials, the drivers of migration are deeply rooted in economic inequality and social factors - and she didn't control the border.</p>

<p>"She was given a very hard, difficult, convoluted portfolio," said U.S. Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee and an architect of a bipartisan border security bill introduced earlier this year.</p>

<p>At campaign rallies and in social media posts, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has intensified his attacks on Harris as a failed "border czar," especially now that she has emerged as the likely Democratic nominee after President Joe Biden ended his campaign for reelection this month.</p>

<p>Despite Harris' efforts, some 7 million migrants have been arrested illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border under Biden, according to government data, all-time highs that have fueled Republican criticism.</p>

<p>The reality of Harris's record on migration is far more complicated, according to interviews with three current Biden officials, 13 former officials and others tracking the issue.</p>

<p>First, Harris was never given the portfolio of border czar, said Alan Bersin, who embraced the label as a special representative for border affairs under Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. "This was not the job assigned to VP Harris," he said.</p>

<p>Instead, Biden asked Harris to lead diplomatic efforts to reduce poverty, violence and corruption in Central America's Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, as well as engage with Mexico on the issue.</p>

<p>It was similar to the job Biden had when he was vice president.</p>

<p>But that was an overly broad mission, Murphy said.</p>

<p>"It's hard in a short period of time to come up with a strategy that impacts the very real and complicated psychological decision-making that people in those countries go through when they're deciding to come to the United States," Murphy said in a phone interview.</p>

<p>And within months of Harris taking the job, the focus on the three Central American countries was out of step with the reality at the border - where illegal immigration from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela was spiking, several former officials and outside experts said.</p>

<p>"She started off, in a sense, at a disadvantage because everyone was focusing on those three countries in the Northern Triangle," said Roberta Jacobson, who served as a coordinator for the U.S.-Mexico border in the early months of the Biden administration. "Meanwhile, the migrant population was changing dramatically."</p>

<p>Harris continued to lead the Central America effort although she has increasingly focused on abortion rights this year, a top Democratic issue since a 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision struck down the nationwide right to an abortion.</p>

<p>The White House said in March that Harris helped engineer $4 billion in government aid and commitments of $5.2 billion in private investment to create or support an estimated 250,000 jobs in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.</p>

<p>Nespresso started sourcing coffee from El Salvador and Honduras in 2021. Gap Inc said it is on pace to meet a pledge to invest $150 million by 2025 to source textiles in the region and that it had increased yarn production in Guatemala and provided skills training to women in Guatemala and Honduras.</p>

<p>Ricardo Barrientos, director of the Central American Institute of Fiscal Studies think tank, said the U.S. aid and private sector investment was a fraction of the remittances migrants from the three countries working in the U.S. send home each year - $37 billion last year alone.</p>

<p>"It's very small compared to the magnitude of the challenge," he said. "Or some would say, 'too little, too late.'"</p>

<p>By May, the number of migrants from the Northern Triangle caught crossing illegally had fallen to 25,000 from a peak of 90,000 in July 2021 - although experts say the impact of Harris' efforts remain unclear.</p>

<p>'Border Czar'</p>

<p>Harris made two trips to Central America: Guatemala in June 2021 and Honduras in January 2022. That was one fewer than Biden, who made three trips to Guatemala after he was assigned a similar role in 2014.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Republicans began identifying Harris with rising illegal crossings and called on her to visit the border. She made her first and only visit to U.S. border operations in El Paso, Texas, in June 2021, where she defended her portfolio.</p>

<p>"The reality of it is that we have to deal with causes, and we have to deal with the effects," she told reporters at the airport.</p>

<p>During the six-hour visit, Harris toured a migrant processing center, speaking with a group of girls, her office said at the time. But she did not tour the border wall on foot, according to pool reports, which Trump officials did routinely.</p>

<p>Raul Ortiz, the Border Patrol chief from 2021-2023, said he never spoke with Biden or Harris although he met with Trump and then Vice President Mike Pence more than once despite holding a lower rank during that administration.</p>

<p>"I would have liked to have had an opportunity to discuss some of the issues and some of the recommended changes that I thought we should have implemented," Ortiz said.</p>

<p>The White House said in March that Ortiz had been invited to join Biden in El Paso last year and did not attend, although Ortiz contested that, saying he was not invited.</p>

<p>Liability Or Asset</p>

<p>Immigration is the third-highest concern of U.S. voters behind the economy and extremism, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll in June, and voters favored Trump's approach to immigration over Biden's 44%-31%.</p>

<p>In an attack ad rolled out on July 25, the Trump campaign portrayed Harris as a liberal who was soft on crime and in favor of "open borders." The ad highlighted years-old Harris comments saying people who cross the border illegally should not be considered criminals, and that the U.S. should "probably think about starting from scratch" when it comes to immigration enforcement.</p>

<p>"If border czar Harris stays in charge, every week will bring a never-ending stream of illegal alien rapists, bloodthirsty killers and child predators to go after our sons and our daughters," Trump said at a rally in North Carolina last week.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign in a statement to Reuters portrayed Trump as an extremist whose administration separated thousands of migrant families and who helped sink the bipartisan border security bill in the U.S. Senate - messaging in line with Biden's approach over the past year.</p>

<p>"There's only one candidate in this race who will fight for real solutions to help secure our nation's border, and that's Vice President Harris," campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz said in a statement.</p>

<p>Some immigration advocates hope that Harris - herself the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants - would better understand the humanitarian side of the issue.</p>

<p>Harris was instrumental in the Biden administration's rollout of a program in June to offer a path to citizenship to immigrants in the U.S. illegally who are married to U.S. citizens, two people familiar with the matter said.</p>

<p>Daniel Suvor, Harris' chief of policy between 2014 and 2017 when she was California attorney general, pointed to her efforts to marshal legal representation for unaccompanied immigrant children - even though immigration was not explicitly part of her portfolio.</p>

<p>She took it on herself to learn about the application process for special visas for victims of abuse, Suvor said. And she teamed up with Brad Smith, then the general counsel for Microsoft and co-founder of the advocacy group Kids in Need of Defense, and started calling law firms.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US defence secretary said on Tuesday he did not believe a fight was inevitable between Hezbollah and Israel though he remained concerned about the potential for escalation after a deadly rocket strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.</p>

<p>Tensions have worsened since Saturday when the rocket killed 12 children and teenagers at a football pitch in a Druze village. Israel accused the Iran-backed Hezbollah and vowed a harsh response. Hezbollah has denied involvement.</p>

<p>The United States has been leading a diplomatic effort to deter Israel from striking Lebanon's capital Beirut or major civil infrastructure in response to the attack, five people with knowledge of the drive told Reuters on Monday.</p>

<p>Hezbollah and Israel have been trading fire across the Lebanese-Israeli border since October, their worst conflict since a 2006 war. The hostilities, sparked by the war in Gaza, have so far been largely been contained to areas near the frontier.</p>

<p>Though both sides have previously indicated they do not seek a wider confrontation, the hostilities have prompted concerns about the risk of a slide towards a wider, more destructive conflict between the heavily armed adversaries.</p>

<p>"While we've seen a lot of activity on Israel's northern border, we remain concerned about the potential of this escalating into a full-blown fight. And I don't believe that a fight is inevitable," US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said.</p>

<p>"We'd like to see things resolved in a diplomatic fashion," he added during a joint press conference in Manila, following security talks between himself, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and their respective Philippine counterparts.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it struck around 10 Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon overnight and killed one of the group's fighters - attacks which appeared to be in keeping with the pattern of violence over the last nine months.</p>

<p>Hezbollah confirmed one of its fighters had been killed.</p>

<p>Two Israeli officials said on Monday that Israel wanted to hurt Hezbollah but not drag the Middle East into all-out war.</p>

<p>Some flights at Beirut's international airport have been cancelled or delayed this week due to the heightened tensions.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has denied firing the rocket that killed the youngsters in the village of Majdal Shams. It said on Saturday it had fired a missile against a military target on the Golan, a border region Israel seized from Syria in 1967.</p>

<p>Hezbollah began firing across the border into Israel in October in what it says is solidarity with the Palestinians and Palestinian Islamist militant allies Hamas. Tens of thousands of people have since fled or been evacuated from towns and villages on both sides of the frontier.</p>

<p>Since October, Israeli strikes have killed around 350 Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon and more than 100 civilians, according to security and medical sources and a Reuters tally of Hezbollah death notifications.</p>

<p>Israel says 23 civilians and at least 17 soldiers have been killed in Hezbollah attacks since October.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seven people died and three were missing after heavy rain and flooding hit central China's Hunan province, state media reported Tuesday.</p>

<p>China is enduring a summer of extreme weather, with heavy rains battering swathes of the country and many regions enduring sweltering heat waves.</p>

<p>The country is by far the world's largest emitter of the greenhouse gases that scientists say drive climate change and make extreme weather more frequent and intense.</p>

<p>In Hunan's Yongxing county, three people missing since last Wednesday were confirmed dead after a landslide.</p>

<p>Four more were killed and three remain missing in Zixing, where more than 11,000 people were evacuated after the city experienced record rainfall -- some areas receiving 645 millimetres (25 inches) in just 24 hours -- state news agency Xinhua reported on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The rains damaged nearly 900 homes and caused 1,345 road collapses, Xinhua added. Around 5,400 rescuers have been dispatched to help those affected.</p>

<p>The downpours have been caused by the remnants of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/typhoon-gaemi-climate-change-intensifies-rainfall-patterns-typhoons-warn-scientists-6191581" target="_blank">Typhoon Gaemi</a>, which made landfall in eastern China on Thursday, with Hunan particularly hard hit.</p>

<p>On Sunday, a landslide destroyed a guesthouse and killed 15 people, while elsewhere in the province nearly 4,000 residents were evacuated after a dam breach.</p>

<p>On Monday, China's National Meteorological Centre issued an orange alert, the second highest level, for rainstorms across much of the south, southwest, and centre of the country, as well as the capital Beijing, Hebei province, and Tianjin in the north.</p>

<p>In northeastern Liaoning province, more than 10,000 people were evacuated from areas near the Yalu River, on the border with North Korea, as waters rose.</p>

<p>Disaster agencies in the country have allocated 110,000 items of relief supplies to support emergency relocation of those affected and provide basic supplies in Liaoning, Jilin, Hunan, and Shaanxi provinces, state broadcaster CCTV reported.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Harvey Dominy, a 21-year-old British tourist, was found dead in his hotel room in Benidorm, Spain. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj50687lzqeo">BBC</a></em>, he had been on a trip with friends, who left the room around 7pm on July 16 and returned later to find him unresponsive on the floor.&nbsp;Emergency crews were called, but Mr Dominy was pronounced dead at the scene.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An inquest into his death was opened at Pontypridd Coroners' Court on July 29. The court was informed that it is believed Mr Dominy died between 9pm and 10.30 that evening.&nbsp;Though a post-mortem examination was conducted, it did not provide a provisional cause of death.</p>

<p>Mckenzy Dominy, his brother, paid tribute to him and said, ''My brother Harvey's radiant smile was his trademark, a beacon of joy that never dimmed despite life's challenges. From his first night, when doctors doubted he'd survive his first 24 hours, to his very last day, Harvey faced each hurdle with unwavering courage and a grin that could light up all of Merthyr. His passing leaves a void deeper than words can express. We've lost more than a brother, son, nephew, or grandson - we've lost our guiding light, our heart. Harvey lived every moment to its fullest, and in his memory, we'll continue to fight and embrace life, just as he did.''</p>

<p>A <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/harvey-dominy?lang=en_GB&amp;utm_campaign=fp_sharesheet&amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;utm_source=copy_link">GoFundMe page established by Joanne Taylor</a>, a family friend of Harvey Dominy, has surpassed its target, raising almost 14,000 pounds to help bring him home. The initial goal was 12,745 pounds. On the page, Joanne wrote: "I'm setting up this GoFundMe for a dear family friend, as well as for Harvey's brothers, Ricky and Mckenzie.</p>

<p>As they have recently lost their beautiful kind hearted beloved son &amp; brother, we as a community always pull together in these difficult times to help others, as we all know losing someone special is hard enough without the financial side of it too, so I'd be very greatful if you could donate to this page to take some pressure off Harvey's family as it's costing between 7,000 - 12,000 to get him home where he belongs, thank you so so much."</p>

<p>The investigation into the cause of Mr Dominy's death continues.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jailed former prime minister and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf founder Imran Khan has approached an Anti-Terrorism Court here seeking bail in 12 cases linked to last year's May 9 riots, a media report said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The 71-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician's legal team, led by lawyer Salman Safdar, has filed the petitions, the Express Tribune reported on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Mr Khan, who is currently on judicial remand in all the cases, claims that there is no recovery to be made from him. He argues that the cases are based on malice and are a form of political retaliation against him.</p>

<p>The petitions request the court to grant post-arrest bail in these cases.</p>

<p>Recently, the Lahore High Court (LHC) provided major relief to Mr Khan by declaring his physical remand in several May 9 cases null and void.</p>

<p>LHC division bench comprising Justices Tariq Saleem and Anwarul Haq had passed the order on petitions filed by Mr Khan challenging the ATC's decision to approve his physical remand in the cases related to the May 9 violence.</p>

<p>After hearing the arguments of the prosecutor general and Mr Khan's counsel, the LHC set aside the anti-terrorism court's decision to grant his physical remand noting that he will remain in judicial custody in these cases.</p>

<p>The May 9 riots in 2023 were triggered nationwide after Mr Khan was arrested by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in a 190-million-pound corruption case. He faces over 200 cases and has been in jail since August last year.</p>

<p>Mr Khan has been imprisoned at the high-security Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi for almost a year upon his conviction in three cases - the Toshakhana corruption case, the cipher case, and the un-Islamic marriage case -- in which his wife, Bushra Bibi, is also jailed.</p>

<p>Though Mr Khan had secured bail or his conviction was set aside, he has not been released.</p>

<p>Mr Khan was arrested on August 5 last year after his conviction in the first Toshakhana corruption case filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan.</p>

<p>Since then, he has been kept in jail in various cases.</p>

<p>The PTI believes he is being arrested in more cases at the behest of the powerful military establishment to make sure that he does not come out of jail.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seventeen human skulls buried in metal boxes have been unearthed at a suspected shrine in the centre of Uganda, police told AFP on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Children foraging for firewood outside Kabanga village near Mpigi town, about 40 kilometres (24 miles) west of the capital Kampala, made the grisly discovery on Monday, according to local media.</p>

<p>Police said residents told officers there were metallic boxes containing what appeared to be skulls buried in a shrine.</p>

<p>"We swiftly moved in and dug up the place, and so far we have recovered 17 human skulls," regional police spokesman Majid Karim told AFP.</p>

<p>"We are conducting more excavations to ensure there are no more skulls other than what we have so far recovered," he said.</p>

<p>He added that the remains were being examined to determine their age and sex, as well as when they may have been buried.</p>

<p>He urged the public to remain calm, saying some residents had been left in shock.</p>

<p>Officers will "investigate the matter to establish the circumstances surrounding the recovery of these skulls and who could be behind this act", Karim said.</p>

<p>It is not clear how the skulls ended up at the site.</p>

<p>Local media reported residents as saying that people had previously gathered at the location to worship.</p>

<p>Police said the suspected owner of the site is on the run, having been linked to a separate case involving the murder of a prominent traditional Baganda leader, entrepreneur Daniel Bbosa.</p>

<p>The killing in Kampala was reportedly carried out by hired gunmen as Bbosa returned home from work in February this year.</p>

<p>Mpigi district, although densely populated, remains semi-rural, with agriculture dominating local trade.</p>

<p>Coffee and bananas are the major cash crops and staple foods, and there is a major road linking the villages to Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Tanzania.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Taliban government has severed consular ties with swathes of Afghan embassies in Western countries, Kabul said Tuesday, cutting off diplomats loyal to the former foreign-backed administration.</p>

<p>The 2021 Taliban takeover left diplomats staffing Afghanistan's foreign missions in limbo, having pledged to serve a government which collapsed in chaos after the withdrawal of US troops.</p>

<p>No country has yet formally recognised the Taliban government but in the past three years the Kabul authorities have installed Taliban ambassadors in some neighbouring embassies.</p>

<p>But Afghanistan's foreign ministry said Tuesday it now "bears no responsibility" for credentials including passports and visas issued by missions out of step with Kabul's new rulers.</p>

<p>The embassies include those in the cities of London and Berlin as well as the countries of Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, France, Italy, Greece, Poland, Sweden, Norway, Canada and Australia.</p>

<p>"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly urged the Afghan political and consular missions in European countries to engage with Kabul," a statement said.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, the actions of most of the missions are carried out arbitrarily, without coordination and in explicit violation of the existing accepted principles."</p>

<p>The statement said Afghans living abroad should deal instead with missions affiliated with the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan -- the self-styled name the Taliban have given the country under their rule.</p>

<p>Pakistan, China and Russia are among Afghan embassies working on order from the Taliban government.</p>

<p>Embassies cut off from Kabul have found themselves in dire financial straits, relying heavily on consular fees to pay staff salaries, rent and bills.</p>

<p>Without that income they may struggle to remain open.</p>

<p>The foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment on its future plans for the ostracised embassies.</p>

<p>Since surging back to power by force after a two-decade insurgency, Taliban officials have campaigned to be Afghanistan's sole representatives on the international stage.</p>

<p>Considered pariahs over their treatment of women, they have been denied an ambassador to the United Nations.</p>

<p>However at UN-hosted talks in Doha last month they represented Afghanistan -- with civil society groups including women's activists excluded from the main talks.</p>

<p>Analysts, rights campaigners and diplomats are split over whether to engage with the Taliban government in a bid to soften their stance or freeze them out until they backtrack.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Las Vegas woman has reunited with her pet chihuahua, Gizmo, who went missing nine years ago. The surprise came in the form of an email, sending Judith Monarrez to her knees in tears.</p>

<p>In 2015, a faulty gate in the backyard of her family's Las Vegas home allowed Gizmo, then just 2 years old, to slip away.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Monarrez launched a desperate search, posting fliers and reaching out to Facebook groups, but her efforts went in vain. For nine long years, Ms Monarrez held onto hope, never giving up on the chance of being reunited with Gizmo.</p>

<p>Now 37, Ms Monarrez has moved into her own home, earned a master's degree, and started a teaching career. Yet, the memory of Gizmo remained close to her heart. Her persistence paid off when a woman found Gizmo and brought him to an animal hospital, where his microchip was scanned, triggering the notification that changed everything.</p>

<p>Despite his changed appearance and behaviour, Ms Monarrez knew instantly it was Gizmo when they reunited at the vet's office. "I can't forget those yellow-amber eyes. I can't forget them, ever - they're Gizmo," Ms Monarrez told <a href="https://www.ktnv.com/news/i-knew-immediately-it-was-him-las-vegas-family-finally-reunites-with-dog-they-lost-9-years-ago">KTNV</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Judith Monarrez called the emotional reunion "a miracle". She credited Gizmo's microchip for their reunion, saying, "Hindsight is 2020. I'm so glad I registered his microchip."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gizmo's return has brought mixed emotions, as he has developed fears and health issues during their time apart.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>He was in an alarming condition, with severe matting, loss of teeth, dental diseases and a debilitating eye infection. "He was severely matted. They had to shave him down," Ms Monarrez told the outlet. "He's missing a lot of teeth. They told us that he had teeth falling out of his mouth when they dropped him off."</p>

<p>Now, Monarrez and her family are focused on addressing Gizmo's health issues and are dedicated to "showering him with all the love that we were holding onto for all those years."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The family has set up a <a href="http://https://www.gofundme.com/f/4knns-help-gizmo-back-to-health?member=35856327&amp;sharetype=teams&amp;utm_campaign=natman_sharesheet_dash&amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;utm_source=copy_link">GoFundMe</a> page to help cover the substantial medical bills, estimated to exceed $4,000 for initial visits alone.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Vanessa Sagnay de la Bastida, daughter of an Ecuadorian politician, was tragically killed by a speeding Mercedes while crossing a road near Wandsworth Bridge in west London.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A court has heard that Vanessa Sagnay de la Bastida, the daughter of an Ecuadorian politician, was cruelly killed in front of her fiance, Michael Williams, by a speeding Mercedes. The 28-year-old was crossing a road close to Wandsworth Bridge in west London when the event happened, according to <em>The Metro.</em></p>

<p>This incident happened while Vanessa was crossing the road near Wandsworth Bridge in west London.</p>

<p>The news reports mentioned that the driver of the speeding Mercedes, 39-year-old Octavian Cadar, was speeding at more than twice the legal limit at the time of the collision.</p>

<p>The impact caused Ms. Sagnay, also known as Charlotte, to somersault through the air before landing on a railing. Despite efforts by an off-duty doctor, she died 13 minutes later at the scene from a severe head injury, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/07/29/ecuadarian-politicians-daughter-killed-speeding-driver-london-21320904/"><em>The Metro.</em></a></p>

<p>Cadar, of Bexley, south-east London, has already admitted causing death by careless driving but denied the more serious charge of causing death by dangerous driving. According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/07/29/ecuadarian-politicians-daughter-killed-speeding-driver-london-21320904/"><em>The Metro</em>,</a> Cadar had just finished at a nearby McDonald's drive-through and was on his way to see his girlfriend in Fulham when the crash took place. The accident happened at around 10:06 pm on March 16, 2022.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Amanda Hilton said: "As they came to traffic lights, Mr Williams pressed the button and looked to the right and the road was clear. They started crossing towards the central reservation."</p>

<p>"As they were crossing, Octavian Cadar drove his Mercedes after the roundabout at speed. They heard the car coming. Mr Williams ran on the journey they were taking. Charlotte ran back to the pavement they had just left and the Mercedes struck her."</p>

<p>"Mr Williams, who witnessed the collision, told police Charlotte was hit on the lefthand side by the bonnet of the car and he watched as Charlotte was thrown forward on to a railing. He heard her scream and then he saw her land on the ground."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Grilled eel, or unagi, a popular summer delicacy in Japan, is behind a department store food poisoning incident that has left more than 140 people sick and one dead, the store's president said.</p>

<p>Shinji Kaneko of Keikyu Department Store in Yokohama - about an hour from Tokyo - apologised after the customers, who last week bought lunch boxes containing eel, suffered vomiting and diarrhoea. One of the customers - reportedly a woman in her 90s - died, Shinji Kaneko told reporters on Monday (Jul 29), bowing deeply and offering "our most sincere condolences".</p>

<p>The products included eel cooked in the traditional "kabayaki" style: Skewered, grilled and basted in a sweet, sticky mixture of soy sauce and mirin rice wine.</p>

<p>Consumed worldwide, eel is particularly popular in Asia, and remains found in Japanese tombs show it has been eaten on the archipelago for thousands of years.</p>

<p>A probe by health officials detected a type of bacteria called staphylococcus aureus in the products, Keikyu Department Store said.</p>

<p>"We take what happened very seriously and feel deeply sorry about it. We will fully cooperate with investigations by public health authorities," Kaneko said.</p>

<p>Tokyo-based restaurant Isesada, which operates a stand inside the Keikyu department store, was responsible for cooking and directly selling the eel products.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A video of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan appearing to slap a child on stage during a ceremony in Rize province has sparked a debate on social media.</p>

<p>The incident occurred on July 27 at the opening of the Aider Plateau Protection and Renewal Project, a province-wide urban transformation and disaster housing initiative.</p>

<p>The footage, now viral on X, shows Mr Erdogan extending his hand for a traditional kiss of respect from two boys brought on stage. However, one of the boys hesitated, which led to Mr Erdogan 'slapping' the child's face.</p>

<p>The boy then kissed Mr Erdogan's hand, and the president handed both children some money as a gift.</p>

<p>The two kids then hugged the Turkish President.</p>

<p>This wasn't the first instance the Turkish president was seen misbehaving with children. Previously, during a visit to his family's neighbours in Rize, Mr Erdogan slapped a child who requested an autograph on a Turkish national team T-shirt.</p>

<p>In 2021, at the opening of the Salarkha Tunnel in Rize, Mr Erdogan was seen knocking on a boy's head.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Again, last year, the president publicly slapped his grandson, but later claimed he was merely "stroking" him, according to reports.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Meta's director of public affairs, Dani Lever, clarified the mistake and apologized, stating that fact-checkers had confirmed the original image's accuracy.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook has acknowledged that it mistakenly identified a widely shared image of Donald Trump as "altered." Facebook's algorithms detected the image, which depicts Trump raising his fist in the air following an assassination attempt, and labelled it as possibly deceptive. Platform X users claimed that the photo had been marked as altered on their accounts. Facebook responded by saying that unbiased fact-checkers had examined an identical image and discovered it to be false.</p>

<p>Dani Lever, the director of public affairs at Meta, explained on X that the labelling was incorrect. The Facebook's internal technical system was intended to detect a different version of the image, not the iconic photo of Trump. Facebook expressed regret for the mistake and any misunderstanding it may have created.</p>

<p>"This was an error. This fact check was initially applied to a doctored photo showing the secret service agents smiling, and in some cases our systems incorrectly applied that fact check to the real photo. This has been fixed, and we apologize for the mistake," Lever wrote.</p>

<p>The altered image Lever referenced featured the Secret Service members surrounding Trump smiling. Many media outlets previously fact-checked the images as "altered," though it confirmed the accuracy of the original image.</p>

<p>None of the agents in the original image are smiling as they surround Trump, who has blood on his face and his right arm in the air. The image - which was captured by <em>Associated Press </em>photographer Evan Vucci and distributed by the <em>AP </em>- appeared with coverage of the shooting by many legitimate news outlets.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/netanyahu-visits-golan-rocket-fire-site-vows-severe-response-6217462" target="_blank">vowed a "severe" response</a> to a deadly strike that killed 12 youths in the annexed Golan Heights, as diplomats raced to contain escalation between Israel and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>On a visit to the site of the deadly rocket strike in the town of Majdal Shams, Netanyahu said: "The State of Israel will not, and cannot, let this pass. Our response will come and it will be severe."</p>

<p>He was greeted by protests during the visit, which came after mourners gathered in the Druze Arab town to bury the last victim, 11-year-old Guevara Ibrahim.</p>

<p>Israel and the United States have blamed the strike on Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement, which has traded near-daily fire with Israeli forces since the war in Gaza between Hamas operatives and Israel began in early October.</p>

<p>Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib said a flurry of diplomatic activity has sought to contain the anticipated Israeli response.</p>

<p>"Israel will escalate in a limited way and Hezbollah will respond in a limited way... These are the assurances we've received," Bou Habib said in an interview with local broadcaster Al-Jadeed.</p>

<p>Several analysts told AFP that this was likely to be the case, with Israel wary of having to fight wars on two fronts.</p>

<p>The United States, France and others were trying to contain the escalation, Habib added, while Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said that "talks are ongoing with international, European and Arab sides to protect Lebanon and ward off dangers".</p>

<p>On Monday, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said he was "confident" a broader war could be avoided.</p>

<p>New Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, whose country supports Hezbollah and Hamas, warned Israel against attacking Lebanon, which he said would be "a great mistake with heavy consequences".</p>

<p>Pezeshkian spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday, with the Elysee Palace saying Macron told his counterpart "all must be done to avoid a military escalation" and urged Tehran to "cease its support for destabilising actors".</p>

<p>Hezbollah has denied responsibility for the Majdal Shams rocket attack, though the group claimed multiple strikes on Israeli military positions that day.</p>

<p>Israel said Hezbollah fired a Falaq-1 Iranian rocket. This type of projectile is unguided and an analyst called them inaccurate weapons.</p>

<h3><strong>Travel warning</strong></h3>

<p>Hezbollah has evacuated some positions in south and east Lebanon, a source close to the group told AFP.</p>

<p>Some airlines, including Air France and Lufthansa, have suspended flights to and from Lebanon, with one Syrian-German traveller at Beirut airport telling AFP she was trying to find a new flight, "but they're all either packed or cancelled".</p>

<p>UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, meanwhile, said on social media platform X that his government was "advising British nationals to leave Lebanon and not to travel to the country. This is a fast-moving situation."</p>

<p>On Monday, Hezbollah said it had launched "dozens of Katyusha rockets" at an Israeli military site following the killing of two of its fighters.</p>

<p>The group later claimed additional strikes against military positions in Israel's north. Official Lebanese media said a Syrian national died from wounds after an Israeli drone strike in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>The cross-border violence has already killed more than 500 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters, and dozens of civilians and soldiers on the Israeli side.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has said its attacks are in support of Hamas, and that they would stop if a ceasefire was reached in Gaza, where war broke out on October 7 when the Palestinian operatives attacked southern Israel.</p>

<p>Months of effort have failed to secure a ceasefire and hostage release deal, though mediators and Israeli negotiators met on Sunday in Rome to discuss the latest proposal.</p>

<p>"The negotiations on the main issues will continue in the coming days," an Israeli statement said.</p>

<p>Hamas, however, again accused Netanyahu of hindering a deal, saying in a statement that he had set new conditions in "a retreat" from an earlier draft.</p>

<p>The Hamas attack on southern Israel that started the war resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Operatives also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,363 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, which does not provide details on civilian and operatives deaths.</p>

<p>Hundreds of Gazans were fleeing the vicinity of the Al-Bureij refugee camp on Monday, witnesses said, after Israeli forces announced they would "operate forcefully" against fighters in the area.</p>

<h3><strong>Soldiers detained&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Since the war began, rights activists, UN agencies and others have alleged abuses of Palestinians during Israeli detention.</p>

<p>On Monday, Israel's military said nine soldiers were being held for questioning in a case of suspected abuse of a detainee at a facility known to be holding Palestinians arrested from Gaza.</p>

<p>After the soldiers' detention, Israeli civilians protested outside a military base where the nine were being held, while several others -- also in an attempt to show support -- broke into the facility where the alleged abuse occurred.</p>

<p>"Take your hands off the reservists," Itamar Ben Gvir, Israel's far-right National Security Minister, wrote on X.</p>

<p>Other top Israeli officials, however, including Netanyahu and army chief Lieutenant-General Herzi Halevi, condemned the mob action.</p>

<p>"We are in the midst of a war, and actions of this type endanger the security of the state," Halevi said of the unrest.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple relied on chips designed by Google rather than industry leader Nvidia to build two key components of its artificial intelligence software infrastructure for its forthcoming suite of AI tools and features, an Apple research paper published on Monday showed.<br />
Apple's decision to rely on Google's cloud infrastructure is notable because Nvidia produces the most sought-after AI processors.</p>

<p>Including the chips made by Google, Amazon.com and other cloud computing companies, Nvidia commands roughly 80% of the market.</p>

<p>In the research paper, Apple did not explicitly say that it used no Nvidia chips, but its description of the hardware and software infrastructure of its AI tools and features lacked any mention of Nvidia hardware.</p>

<p>Apple did not comment on Monday.</p>

<p>The iPhone maker said that to train its AI models, it used two flavors of Google's tensor processing unit (TPU) that are organized in large clusters of chips.</p>

<p>To build the AI model that will operate on iPhones and other devices, Apple used 2,048 of the TPUv5p chips. For its server AI model, Apple deployed 8,192 TPUv4 processors.</p>

<p>Nvidia does not design TPUs but rather focuses its efforts on so-called graphics processing units (GPUs) that are widely used for AI efforts.</p>

<p>Unlike Nvidia, which sells its chips and systems as standalone products, Google sells access to TPUs through its Google Cloud Platform. Customers interested in buying access must build software through Google's cloud platform in order to use the chips.</p>

<p>Apple is rolling out portions Apple Intelligence to its beta users this week.</p>

<p>Reuters reported the use of the TPU chips in June, but Apple did not disclose the full extent of its reliance on Google hardware until Monday's research paper.</p>

<p>Google did not return a request for comment, while Nvidia declined to comment.</p>

<p>Apple's engineers said in the paper it would be possible to make even larger, more sophisticated models with Google's chips, than the two models it discussed in the paper.</p>

<p>Apple unveiled a slew of new AI features at its June developer conference, including integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT technology into its software.</p>

<p>The Cupertino, California-based company's stock ticked down 0.1% to $218.24 in regular trading on Monday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least one person died Monday in Venezuela as security forces tried to break up protests triggered by a hotly disputed election result that gave Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro a third term in power, an NGO said.</p>

<p>Venezuelan security forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets Monday at irate protesters challenging the reelection victory claimed by Maduro but disputed by the opposition and questioned by many other countries.</p>

<p>Thousands of people flooded the streets of several neighbourhoods of the capital, chanting "Freedom, freedom!" and "This government is going to fall!"</p>

<p>Some ripped Maduro campaign posters from street posts and burned them.</p>

<p>Around the country, at least two statues of Hugo Chavez, the late socialist icon who led the country for more than a decade and handpicked Maduro as his successor, were knocked down by protesters.</p>

<p>At least one person died in northwest Yaracuy state and 46 more were arrested in post-election demonstrations, Alfredo Romero, head of a rights group called Foro Penal, which specializes in political prisoner issues, said on the platform X.</p>

<p>In Caracas, AFP observed members of the National Guard firing tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters, some wearing motorbike helmets and bandannas tied over their faces for protection. Some responded by throwing rocks back.</p>

<p>Protests were reported even in very poor areas of Caracas that had been bastions of support for Maduro and his socialist government. Shots were heard in some areas. Protests broke out elsewhere in Venezuela, too.</p>

<p>"We want freedom. We want Maduro to go. Maduro, leave!," Marina Sugey, a 42-year-old resident of a poor area of Caracas called Petare, told AFP.</p>

<p>Maduro, 61, attended a meeting Monday at which the National Electoral Council (CNE) certified his reelection to a third six-year term until 2031.</p>

<p>He dismissed international criticism and doubts about the result of Sunday's voting, claiming Venezuela was the target of an attempted "coup d'etat" of a "fascist and counter-revolutionary" nature.</p>

<p>But opposition leader Maria Corina Machado later told reporters that a review of voting records available so far clearly showed that the next president "will be Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia," who took her place on the ballot after she was barred by Maduro-aligned courts.</p>

<p>The records showed a "mathematically irreversible" lead for Gonzalez Urrutia, she said, with 6.27 million votes to only 2.75 million for Maduro.</p>

<p>The elections were held amid widespread fears of fraud by the government and a campaign tainted by accusations of political intimidation.</p>

<p>Pollsters had predicted a resounding victory for the opposition.</p>

<p>In the early hours of Monday, the CNE said Maduro had won 51.2 per cent of votes cast compared to 44.2 per cent for Gonzalez Urrutia.</p>

<p>The opposition cried foul, prompting Attorney General Tarek William Saab to link Machado to an alleged cyber "attack" seeking to "adulterate" the results.</p>

<h3><strong>'Another fraud'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The outcome sparked concern and calls for a "transparent" process from the United Nations, the United States, the European Union and several countries in Latin America.</p>

<p>The CNE has not provided a detailed breakdown of the result.</p>

<p>Allies including China, Russia and Cuba congratulated Maduro.</p>

<p>Gonzalez Urrutia, a 74-year-old former diplomat, on Monday acknowledged the deep discontent in society with the CNE results and vowed that "we will fight for our liberty."</p>

<p>Machado assured Venezuelans that "the leaders of the world" are validating the results, and called families to turn out Tuesday for "popular assemblies" nationwide to show support for a peaceful transition of power.</p>

<p>Nine Latin American countries called in a joint statement Monday for a "complete review of the results with the presence of independent electoral observers."</p>

<p>The US-based Carter Center, one of a few organizations allowed to bring observers into Venezuela, urged the CNE to immediately publish detailed polling station-level results.</p>

<p>Brazil and Colombia also urged a review of the numbers while Chile's president said the outcome was "hard to believe."</p>

<p>Peru recalled its ambassador and Panama said it was suspending relations with Venezuela.</p>

<p>The Organization of American States, based in Washington, called an emergency meeting for Wednesday at the request of Argentina and other countries that challenged the official election tally.</p>

<p>Caracas hit back Monday, saying it was withdrawing diplomatic staff from Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Panama, Peru, the Dominican Republic and Uruguay for "interventionist actions and statements." It also suspended flights to and from Panama and the Dominican Republic.</p>

<h3><strong>'Bloodbath' warning&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Independent polls had predicted Sunday's vote would end 25 years of "Chavismo," the populist movement founded by Chavez.</p>

<p>Maduro has been at the helm of the once-wealthy oil-rich country since 2013. The last decade has seen GDP drop by 80 per cent, pushing more than seven million of its 30 million citizens to emigrate.</p>

<p>He is accused of locking up critics and harassing the opposition in a climate of rising authoritarianism.</p>

<p>In the run-up to the election, he had warned of a "bloodbath" if he lost.</p>

<p>Ballots were cast on machines that sent electronic votes directly to a centralized CNE database.</p>

<p>The machines printed out paper receipts that were placed in a container and counted by hand as a backup measure meant to be open to public scrutiny.</p>

<p>The opposition had deployed about 90,000 volunteer election monitors nationwide.</p>

<h3><strong>Economic misery&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Sunday's election was the product of a deal reached last year between the government and the opposition.</p>

<p>That agreement led the United States to temporarily ease sanctions imposed after Maduro's 2018 reelection, rejected as a sham by dozens of Latin American and other countries.</p>

<p>Sanctions were snapped back after Maduro reneged on agreed conditions.</p>

<p>Venezuela boasts the world's largest oil reserves but has seen severely diminished production capacity in recent years.</p>

<p>Most Venezuelans live on just a few dollars a month and endure biting shortages of electricity and fuel.</p>

<p>Economic misery in the South American nation has been a major source of migration pressure on the southern border of the United States, where immigration is a major presidential election issue.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta Platforms on Monday said it will roll out a new tool called AI Studio that will allow users to create, share and design personalized AI chatbots.<br />
<br />
The AI Studio will allow users to create customized AI characters and also allow Instagram creators to use the AI characters "as an extension of themselves" that can handle common DM questions and story replies, Meta said.</p>

<p>Users can share their AI characters on the social media giant's various platforms.</p>

<p>The new tool is built with Meta's Llama 3.1, the biggest version of its mostly free artificial intelligence models released last week, which is available in multiple languages and has performance metrics that compete with paid models from rivals like OpenAI.</p>

<p>ChatGPT maker OpenAI is working on a project code-named "Strawberry," the details of which are tightly kept secret even within OpenAI, as the startup races to show that the types of models it offers are capable of delivering advanced reasoning capabilities, Reuters exclusively reported earlier in July.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Veterinarians using a stethoscope were unable to detect Nuggi's heartbeat because of his extreme weight, according to the SPCA statement.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman from New Zealand was sentenced to two months in prison after her dog, who weighed 53 kilograms (118 pounds) and was severely obese, died, as per a report in <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.newsweek.com/dog-owner-jailed-obese-dog-dies-1930819">Newsweek</a></em>. According to a statement from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), the dog, named Nuggi, was found by police in 2021 weighing about 54 kilograms (120 pounds) and nearly immobile.</p>

<p>Nuggi was taken from his owner's Auckland house, where police discovered "a number of" dogs, and given over to the SPCA.</p>

<p>Nuggi died of a liver haemorrhage even though it lost 8.8 kilograms (19.6 pounds) or around 16.5 per cent of his body weight in two months while in the care of the SPCA. The organisation claims that an autopsy disclosed additional health issues, including Cushing's illness and liver problems.</p>

<p>According to the statement, the owner pleaded guilty to failing to provide for the dog's medical, behavioural, and physical needs. As a result, the Manukau District Court in Auckland sentenced the owner to two months in jail and a fine of $1,222 NZD ($720). It is also said that she will not be allowed to own dogs for a year.</p>

<p>Veterinarians using a stethoscope were unable to detect Nuggi's heartbeat because of his extreme weight, according to the SPCA statement. The dog also had a lot of skin growths, especially on contact regions like his elbows and tummy, and his claws were enlarged. Further, Nuggi had conjunctivitis as well.</p>

<p>Todd Westwood, SPCA Chief said that the dog was "drastically overfed" and "clearly" did not have proper care. "Nuggi was one of the most obese animals we've ever come across," Mr Westwood said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Sadly, we see animals on a daily basis that are underweight, starved or malnourished, but it's equally heartbreaking to see a helpless animal that's been severely overfed," he continued.</p>

<p>The SPCA added that the pet dog was fed around 10 pieces of chicken every day along with dry food. Nuggi allegedly struggled to travel around 10 meters to the car when veterinarians took him away from his owner, pausing three times to gather breath. The SPCA said, "His legs could not support his huge body."</p>

<p>"Part of being a responsible dog owner is providing your pet with an appropriate diet and daily exercise, which was clearly not the case here. Nuggi was being drastically overfed, and instead of seeking help or amending the behaviour, his owner continued to overfeed him until he could barely walk. This is unacceptable," Mr Westwood added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Burrill was forced to resign from his position after the Christian news website published a story exposing his visits to gay bars and use of the dating app.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Wisconsin priest who lost his job after being outed for using Grindr is suing the queer dating app, alleging that his data was sold without his knowledge or consent.</p>

<p>Monsignor Jeffrey Burrill, who served as the top administrator of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) until his resignation in 2021, claims that Grindr failed to inform him that his data was being sold to vendors, thereby allowing people outside the app to discover his presence on it.</p>

<p>Burrill's lawsuit, obtained by the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/27/priest-grindr-privacy-lawsuit/"><em>Washington Post</em></a>, states that the release of his data caused "significant damage" to his reputation, particularly given his vow of celibacy as a priest and the Catholic Church's long-standing stance against homosexual acts.</p>

<p>Burrill was forced to resign from his position after the Christian news website "The Pillar" published a story exposing his visits to gay bars and use of the dating app, reporting that it had tracked and verified his behaviour using online data.</p>

<p>In his lawsuit, Burrill alleges that The Pillar obtained the data from Catholic Laity and Clergy for Renewal (CLCR), a Christian non-profit organization that purchased data from queer dating apps to identify Church leaders using them in violation of their vows, implying that Grindr had sold the data to the organization.</p>

<p>“We want answers so we can use that as a warning to other Grindr users,” said Gregory Helmer, an attorney for Burrill.</p>

<p>The priest said he'd never have joined the app had he known his data would be available to the public, according to the lawsuit.</p>

<p>“To have that decision forced out of your hands and into the public realm is reprehensible,” James Carr, another attorney representing Burrill, told the Washington Post.</p>

<p>Burrill, who is still "getting on his feet" following the "shame and embarrassment" of his outing, according to his lawyer Helmer, requested $5 million in damages from Grindr in June.</p>

<p>After Grindr declined his request, Burrill filed a lawsuit on July 18, seeking damages and the implementation of policies to prevent user data from being publicly available without users' knowledge.</p>

<p>Grindr told the Washington Post it would "respond vigorously to these allegations, which are based on mischaracterizations of practices relating to user data," and previously denied making user data publicly available.</p>

<p>CLCR admitted to obtaining data from Grindr in the past to expose clergy members but claimed it did not provide any data to The Pillar.</p>

<p>Burrill's ousting sparked widespread criticism, with many condemning The Pillar's use of data as dangerously homophobic.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro claimed victory in the country's presidential election in the early hours of Monday morning, even as the country's opposition said its candidate Edmundo Gonzalez was the victor and it had the polling to prove it.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE COUNT?</strong></h3>

<p>The country's electoral authority (CNE) said just after midnight on Monday that Maduro had won a third six-year term with 51% of the vote.</p>

<p>The authority said Gonzalez won 44%, but opposition leader Maria Corina Machado said opposition candidate Gonzalez had secured 70% of the vote and that multiple independent exit polls and quick counts decisively showed his victory.</p>

<p>Gonzalez said he was not calling for supporters to take to the streets or commit any acts of violence and Machado said the opposition has copies of about 40% of voting records.</p>

<p>Edison Research, known for its polling of U.S. elections, had predicted in an exit poll that Gonzalez would win 65% of the vote, while Maduro would win 31%.</p>

<p>Local firm Meganalisis predicted a 65% vote for Gonzalez and just under 14% for Maduro.</p>

<h3><strong>WAS VOTING PEACEFUL?</strong></h3>

<p>The government said that except for some isolated minor incidents, voting was peaceful.</p>

<p>Motorcycle-riding ruling party supporters known as 'collectives' clashed briefly in the evening with opposition supporters outside the country's largest polling place, a school in central Caracas.</p>

<p>Armed collectives were reported in at least six other locations, according to a local NGO, which also reported the gun death of one man in the border state of Tachira during a confrontation with collective members.</p>

<p>The tense campaign was marked by arrests of opposition figures and other moves by the authorities that the opposition said were meant to prevent a fair election.</p>

<p>Maduro, a former bus driver who was the hand-picked successor of his mentor Hugo Chavez, has been in power since Chavez's death in 2013.</p>

<p>His government has presided over a sharp economic and social deterioration. The U.S. reimposed oil sanctions in April, accusing Maduro of reneging on deals reached with the opposition to ensure free elections.</p>

<h3><strong>WHO IS GONZALEZ?</strong></h3>

<p>A long-time but low-profile member of the opposition, Gonzalez, 74, a former diplomat, is known for his calm demeanor.</p>

<p>He was originally registered as a placeholder in March, after neither primary winner Machado nor her alternate were able to register. In April, he was named as the opposition's definitive candidate.</p>

<p>Machado, 56, has thrown herself into campaigning for Gonzalez.</p>

<p>The two - speaking to large crowds around the country - have employed emotional rhetoric, including about their hope for the many who have emigrated from Venezuela in recent years to return home.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT WAS THE INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE?</strong></h3>

<p>The United States has serious concerns that the results announced by the electoral authority do not reflect the votes of the people, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday, asking that a detailed tabulation of votes be published.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, reactions from Latin American leaders were mixed.</p>

<p>Argentine President Javier Milei called the official result fraud, while Costa Rica and Peru rejected it and Chile said it would not accept any result that was not verifiable.</p>

<p>Cuba, Honduras and Bolivia cheered Maduro's victory.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

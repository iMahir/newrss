       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Millions of Windows users across the globe are experiencing the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/resolving-blue-screen-errors-in-windows-60b01860-58f2-be66-7516-5c45a66ae3c6">Blue Screen of Death</a> (BSOD) error which is causing the system to suddenly shut down or restart. Microsoft in a message said that the error is being caused due to a recent CrowdStrike update.</p>

<p>According to reports, the bug has affected several companies, banks and government offices across US and Australia.</p>

<p>Social media users posted pictures showing their screens stuck on the recovery page displaying the message: "It looks like Windows didn't load correctly. If you'd like to restart and try again, choose Restart my PC below."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I am aware of a large-scale technical outage affecting a number of companies and services across Australia this afternoon.<br />
<br />

<p>Blue Screen errors, also known as black screen errors or STOP code errors, can occur when a critical issue forces Windows to unexpectedly shut down or restart. You may encounter a message stating, "Windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer" or a similar notification.</p>

<p>These errors can stem from hardware or software problems. If you recently installed new hardware and encountered a Blue Screen error, try shutting down your PC, removing the new hardware, and attempting to restart. If restarting poses difficulty, you can initiate your PC in safe mode. For detailed steps, refer to the instructions on starting your PC in safe mode in Windows.</p>

<p>Additionally, consider updating Windows with the latest patches through Windows Update, seeking assistance from other sources, or restoring Windows to a previous restore point.</p>

<p>If none of these measures resolve the Blue Screen error, utilize the Blue Screen Troubleshooter available in the Get Help app:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Open the Get Help app in Windows.</li>
	<li>Type "Troubleshoot BSOD error" in the search bar of the Get Help app.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before Thomas Matthew Crooks aimed his AR-15 gun at Former US President Donald Trump during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, his father contacted the police, concerned about his son's location when a gun, one of the many he owned, was missing from their home.</p>

<p>The call, another red flag in a series of warnings to law enforcement before the attack, came from Crooks' father Matthew Crooks after his son disappeared without any notice, a report by BBC said.</p>

<p>While some reports suggest the call happened before the shootingm others suggest Matthew Crooks called police after the shooting.</p>

<p>The gun, used by Crooks in the unsuccessful assassination bid, was identified as his father's 5.56 caliber AR-style rifle which he purchased in 2013, police said. Police sources told NBC that Crooks purchased 50 rounds of ammunition hours before the shooting.</p>

<p>When police searched Crooks' home in Bethel Park, some 85 km from the Trump rally, over a dozen firearms were found inside. As per Pennsylvania law, gun owners do not have to store their firearms in a lock box or other locked storage, but they are encouraged to do so.</p>

<p>Police also found that ahead of the attack, the 20-year-old made several online searches related to Trump as well as his rival US President Biden. He also searched "major depressive disorder" as well as the Democratic National Convention to be held for August.</p>

<p>Reports said police found that he had images of Trump, Biden, Attorney General Merrick Garland, FBI Director Chris Wray and a member of the British Royal Family.</p>

<p>The FBI also found a metal box of explosives in the car which Crooks drove to the rally.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Crooks' motive in the shooting remains unclear but the FBI and other law enforcement agencies have launched investigations. Currently, the FBI are were sifting through Crooks' phone and other electronic devices.</p>

<p>While the motive behind the attack is still unclear, preliminary investigation found that he climbed onto the roof of a nearby building outside the rally, some 300 metres away from where Trump was on stage.</p>

<p>The bullet missed Trump by a few inches but grazed the top of his right ear. Amid chaos and screams, Trump was ushered off stage by Secret Service agents with blood smeared on his face.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Republican nominee appeared at the RNC just days after an attempt on his life at a Pennsylvania rally. On July 13, 20-year-old Thomas Crooks opened fire on the former US President. The bullet whizzed past Trump's ear.</p>

<p>The Secret Service quickly came to his rescue and pulled him down behind the dais before Trump rose and pumped his fist in the air, shouting "fight! fight! fight!". Agents rushed to his side and escorted him to safety.</p>

<p>Undeterred by the close shave, Trump attended the convention and even announced his running mate, JD Vance, earlier this week. The pair are set to lock horns with Democratic nominee Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris in the November 5 presidential elections.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>"I'm not supposed to be here tonight," Donald Trump said in his first speech since he was injured by a 20-year-old gunman at a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday.</li>
	<li>He said he heard a "loud whizzing sound" and "felt something hit me really, really hard on my right ear". "I said to myself, 'Wow, what was that? It can only be a bullet,'" he said.</li>
	<li>Trump said he moved his hand to his ear and brought it down, and it "was covered with blood, just absolutely blood all over the place. I immediately knew it was very serious, that we were under attack."</li>
	<li>He also recalled how Secret Service agents rushed to the stage as bullets flew, pouncing on top of him to keep him safe.</li>
	<li>"The amazing thing is that prior to the shot, if I had not moved my head at that very last instant, the assassin's bullet would have perfectly hit its mark, and I would not be here tonight. We would not be together," he said.</li>
	<li>He also praised his supporters at the rally, saying they turned to look for the sniper instead of breaking into a stampede. "They knew I was in trouble. They didn't want to leave me. And you can see that love written all over their faces. Incredible people," Trump said.</li>
	<li>"I wanted to do something to let him know I was okay. I raised my right arm, looked at the thousands and thousands of people that were breathlessly waiting, and started shouting, 'Fight, fight, fight!," he said.</li>
	<li>"For the rest of my life, I will be grateful for the love shown by that giant audience of patriots that stood bravely on that fateful evening," he said.</li>
	<li>Trump insisted he would never recount the moment when he nearly lost his life again.</li>
	<li>"So many people have asked me, 'What happened? Tell us what happened, please," he said. But "you'll never hear it from me a second time, because it's actually too painful to tell."</li>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump, 78, began his keynote address at the 2024 GOP convention by describing how he narrowly survived an attempt on his life.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump, who survived an assassination attempt last weekend, said that our planet is on the "edge of World War III." He then claimed he could end "every single international crisis," including the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.</p>

<p>At the Republican National Convention (RNC) 2024, which came to a close on Thursday night, Trump formally accepted the party's nomination.</p>

<p>"Our planet is teetering on the edge of World War III... this will be a war like no other," Trump said while addressing his supporters at the event.</p>

<p>"I will end every single international crisis that the current administration has created - including the horrible war with Russia and Ukraine, which would have never happened if I was president, and the war caused by the attack on Israel, which never would have happened if I were president," he added.</p>

<p>He also said he wanted Americans held abroad to be released -- or else.</p>

<p>"The entire world, I tell you this: we want our hostages back and they better be back before I assume office or you will be paying a very big price," said Trump -- again failing to give any specifics.</p>

<p>The 78-year-old started his keynote address at the 2024 GOP convention, describing how he narrowly survived an attempt on his life, noting he could only be there "by the grace of Almighty God."</p>

<p>He asserted that this was the only time he would recount the July 13 incident because it was too painful to recall.</p>

<p>Remembering the incident, he explained that he heard a "loud whizzing sound and felt something hit me really, really hard on my right ear".</p>

<p>"I said to myself, 'Wow, what was that? It can only be a bullet'," he added.</p>

<p>While Trump was speaking, a few photographs of the former president from the July 13 incident were displayed on screens behind him.</p>

<p>During his speech, he even lauded the Secret Service agents, who rushed to his side, and then paid tribute to the volunteer firefighter, Corey Comperatore, who was killed, reports said.</p>

<p>Trump also stressed that he was "running to be president for all of America, not half of America because there is no victory in winning for half of America".</p>

<p>The assassination attempt on Trump came just months ahead of the high-on-stakes US presidential elections slated for November 5, 2024.</p>

<p>The Democratic National Convention is expected to take place next month in Chicago, with US President Joe Biden, who tested positive for COVID-19 a few days ago, still the frontrunner to retain the nomination.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The protest caused significant traffic delays and accidents, with costs exceeding 1.8 million pounds.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Five environmental activists-including Roger Hallam and Daniel Shaw-have been convicted for their roles in the November 2022 M25 motorway disruption, according to <em>the BBC</em>. The protest, coordinated by Just Stop Oil, was intended to block the road and resulted in major traffic jams, accidents, and delays that lasted for almost four days. The financial costs of the event were estimated to be over 1.8 million pounds (Rs 19,47,28,935).</p>

<p>Hallam was sentenced to five years in prison, the other three to four years each. The protestors' "intricate planning and the level of sophistication involved" on climate change activism were highlighted by the court. With regard to the new rules intended to quell disruptive protests, this is the longest punishment.</p>

<p>As per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c880xjx54mpo"><em>news outlet</em></a>, in the M25 protest case, Whittaker De Abreu and Gethin were arrested near the motorway dressed for climbing, while Lancaster rented a safe house and bought climbing gear for the activists.</p>

<p>Lancaster defended her actions as necessary due to the perceived failure of democratic methods, calling the climate crisis a critical issue.</p>

<p>Gethin stated the disruption was intended to be minimal and blamed those in power for failing to address climate change seriously. Hallam, who had previously rejected direct action for conventional campaigning, was disruptive in court, leading to three arrests and encouraging supporters to protest outside the court.</p>

<p>This resulted in the arrest of 11 protesters for contempt, but charges were later dropped. Hallam claimed the judiciary was corrupt and manipulated, framing his actions as necessary for climate justice.</p>

<p>The new law under which the activists were sentenced, introduced in 2022, criminalises direct action causing serious public harm. The judge emphasised the law's intent to treat such actions severely, with sentences up to 10 years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An explosion in Tel Aviv early Friday left one person dead, an Israeli emergency services spokesperson told AFP, with the army saying a falling "aerial target" caused the blast.</p>

<p>Emergency services said the explosion took place around 03:15 am (0015 GMT) in a building in the centre of the city. Two people were lightly injured, Zaki Heller of the Magen David Adom medical service said.</p>

<p>An earlier police report had said seven people were injured, but they were mainly in a state of shock, Heller added.</p>

<p>The army said an initial inquiry showed that the explosion was "caused by the falling of an aerial target".</p>

<p>"No sirens were activated," it said in a statement, adding that the air force had "increased its air patrols in order to protect Israeli airspace".</p>

<p>A resident of central Tel Aviv told AFP he had been woken by a loud explosion.</p>

<p>"Everything shook," he said.</p>

<p>Police found a body bearing injuries caused by shrapnel in the building, which is located on the corner of Ben-Yehuda Avenue and Shalom-Aleichem Street, not far from an annexe of the US Embassy in Israel, spokesperson Dean Elsdunne said.</p>

<p>"It may have been an aerial explosion... We were very lucky," said Peretz Amar, a Tel Aviv police commander at the scene, adding an investigation was "ongoing".</p>

<p>"The police, along with emergency and rescue forces, discovered a man in his 50s in a nearby building who was found dead in his apartment, with shrapnel wounds on his body," a police statement said.</p>

<p>Another 10 people with minor injuries were taken for medical treatment, it said.</p>

<p>Police and bomb disposal units were deployed to the scene and conducted searches for suspicious objects and additional threats, the statement added.</p>

<p>Residents were urged to "respect safety instructions and not to approach or touch debris or shrapnel that may contain explosives", it said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

Trump praised the agent, stating the sniper "took him out with one shot."</p>

<p>His word of appreciation came during the 78-year-old's <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/rnc-republican-national-convention-07-18-24/index.html">speech at the Republican National Convention</a> on Thursday night, his first public appearance since the assassination attempt. In the speech, Trump vowed to deliver "the four greatest years in the history of our country" and called for unity, stating "I'm running to be president for all of America." Trump also shared details about the recent attempt on his life, saying he was grateful for the "outpouring of love and support" from Americans.</p>

<p>The Republican nominee was shot at on July 13 by Thomas Crooks, who allegedly used a ladder to climb a nearby building before targeting Trump with an AR-style rifle from approximately 130 yards away. The attack occurred at 6:12 pm, resulting in chaos. Trump's ear was nicked, one rally attendee was killed, and two others were injured. The Secret Service immediately reacted, shooting and killing Crooks within 26 seconds.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-explains-why-he-asked-about-his-shoes-amid-shooting-chaos-6117844">earlier interview</a>, Donald Trump revealed that a slight turn of his head to read a chart likely saved him from the fatal bullet wound fired by Crooks, which just grazed his ear.</p>

<p>Trump vividly described the following moments, during which Secret Service agents sprang into action, yelling "Get down" and tackling him to the ground with force. He showed off a bruise on his arm he got when the agents grabbed him.</p>

<p>The Republican nominee was rushed to the hospital, where medical professionals told him that he was "supposed to be dead." The doctor described his survival as a "miracle," stating that he had never seen anyone survive an AR-15 rifle wound.</p>

<p>Trump praised the Secret Service for quickly taking down the shooter, describing his actions as "fantastic". He even pointed to his nose, indicating where the agents hit the shooter.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alphabet's Google will infuse artificial intelligence into the U.S. broadcast of the Paris Olympics, allowing sports commentators to use AI to explain competitions, the tech company said on Thursday alongside NBCUniversal and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee.</p>

<p>Google will be named the official search AI partner of Team USA, marking the first time a tech company has partnered with the sports nonprofit, the three organizations said in a statement.</p>

<p>The announcement comes as NBCUniversal, which broadcasts the Games in the U.S., is modernizing its coverage to attract audiences who do not watch live television and young viewers who have grown up accustomed to watching clips online.</p>

<p>The Comcast-owned media company previously said it would launch personalized AI-generated daily recaps of the competition that will be narrated by AI versions of people such as sports commentator Al Michaels.</p>

<p>During daytime and primetime coverage of the Olympics, NBCUniversal's anchors will use Google Search's AI overviews to answer questions about some sports, such as the importance of pool-lane assignments in swimming competitions.</p>

<p>Google's AI overviews provide written responses to search queries without the need to click a website link.</p>

<p>Comedian Leslie Jones, who will serve as a commentator in Paris, will use Google's Gemini AI model to learn new sports and entertain viewers, the companies said.</p>

<p>The Paris Olympics begin July 26.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump predicted an "incredible victory" Thursday in accepting the Republican presidential nomination from a party euphoric over his escape from assassination and buoyed by the apparent implosion of Joe Biden's reelection campaign.</p>

<p>"We will have an incredible victory, and we will begin the four greatest years in the history of our country," Trump, 78, said at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.</p>

<p>It was his first speech since a 20-year-old man shot at him, causing a wound to one ear and killing a bystander during a rally last weekend.</p>

<p>In an emotional retelling of the shooting, where Trump said he had "God on my side," the ex-president asked for a moment of silence to honour the victim, firefighter Corey Comperatore. Before a hushed crowd, he kissed the late firefighter's helmet on the stage.</p>

<p>Trump took the stage to chants of "USA" from a crowd which has spent the week talking of him in near-divine terms.</p>

<p>Warm-up acts included shirt-ripping 1980s wrestling icon Hulk Hogan and conspiracy theorist and far-right media guru Tucker Carlson, who described Trump's survival as a historic moment.</p>

<p>After the assassination attempt, Trump became the "leader of a nation," Carlson said.</p>

<p>But while the speech had been touted as the launch of a less abrasive, more unity-seeking Trump, he soon reverted to his familiar painting of America as an apocalyptic ruin that needs saving.</p>

<p>Promising to complete a wall on the US-Mexican border, he said an "invasion" of immigrants had brought "destruction" and "misery" to a "nation in decline."</p>

<p>He vowed to end Biden's massive spending on fighting climate change, calling it a "scam."</p>

<p>He again made his false claim that Democrats cheated in his defeat to Biden in the 2020 election. And, despite aides promising that Trump would not even say Biden's name in the speech, Trump did refer to his opponent and "the damage" he has done.</p>

<h3><strong>Trump flips script&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Despite a torrent of scandals, impeachment for his unprecedented attempt to overturn the 2020 election, and 34 felony convictions in May at a New York criminal trial, Trump is on the rise in polls ahead of November.</p>

<p>Now, with Republicans more in step behind him than ever, he is bullish about a shock return to power.</p>

<p>Attempting to flip the script on accusations that he intends to rule as an authoritarian leader, Trump insisted that he is "the one saving democracy" and referred to his criminal investigations as "witch hunts."</p>

<p>"We must not criminalize dissent," he said.</p>

<p>Trump's love-fest in Milwaukee contrasted with the crisis engulfing Biden, 81.</p>

<p>The Democratic president looked close late Thursday to being forced by his own party to withdraw and make way for Vice President Kamala Harris or another candidate, as fears spiral that his faltering physical health will lead to a loss in November.</p>

<p>Senior Trump advisor Jason Miller told AFP that "nothing fundamentally changes" for Trump if Biden drops out.</p>

<p>Trump's family was in attendance, with son Eric rousing the crowd into a chant of "fight, fight, fight!"</p>

<p>Trump's wife Melania, who has been mostly absent throughout the campaign, arrived to applause but did not speak -- a remarkable break with US political convention at such events.</p>

<h3><strong>Martial arts CEO, preacher&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Supporters have been lining up all week to applaud the former president for his bravery since the weekend attack by a gunman at a Pennsylvania rally.</p>

<p>Others addressing the convention included Trump's longtime friend Dana White, chief executive of the Ultimate Fighting Championship. Trump has attended multiple UFC bouts as he seeks to lock in younger male voters.</p>

<p>Striking a different tone, evangelist preacher Franklin Graham -- whose father was a spiritual adviser to multiple US presidents -- led a lengthy prayer for Trump.</p>

<p>With Biden still reeling from the aftermath of his disastrous debate performance against Trump last month, polls show a gap gradually opening in the long-close race.</p>

<p>The Republican campaign has even been talking up Trump's chances in Democratic strongholds like Minnesota and Virginia.</p>

<p>This week also saw Trump name right-wing Senator JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate.</p>

<p>The 39-year-old author of "Hillbilly Elegy," a best-selling memoir about growing up poor in working-class America, is a former Trump critic who has become one of his staunchest backers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden is expected to make a major announcement on his re-election bid, with several senior Democratic leaders suggesting that he leave the race following his disastrous debate performance, a failed assassination attempt on his rival Donald Trump, his poor health, and falling poll numbers, according to media reports.</p>

<p>“Several people close to President Biden said on Thursday that they believe he has begun to accept the idea that he may not be able to win in November and may have to drop out of the race, bowing to the growing demands of many anxious members of his party,” The New York Times reported.</p>

<p>Biden, 81, is spending time at his Delaware residence in isolation after he was tested positive for COVID-19. Media reports said that top leaders of the Democratic party, including former president Barack Obama, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, have asked him to leave the presidential race, in the absence of which the party risks losing the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives.</p>

<p>“People close to top Democrats said Thursday that it now appeared it was a matter of when—not if—Biden bows out of the presidential race. In the past day or so, former President Barack Obama has told friends who have called him that Biden's path to victory is narrow, according to people familiar with the calls,” The NYT report said.</p>

<p>The Washington Post reported Thursday night that Pelosi has stepped up her behind-the-scenes role in working to persuade the president to bow out of campaign. Obama has said that he has a very slight chance of winning the race.</p>

<p>According to The Hill, Vice President Kamala Harris has started looking for options for her running mate. The three being talked about right now are Senator Mark Kelly, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear and North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper.</p>

<p>Most of the media reports said that Biden's announcement on his re-election bid might come after the conclusion of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.</p>

<p>“One of the people close to him warned that the president had not yet made up his mind to leave the race after three weeks of insisting that almost nothing would drive him out. But another said that 'reality is setting in', and that it would not be a surprise if Mr Biden made an announcement soon endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement,” The NYT reported.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump, in his acceptance speech today after presidential nomination at the Republican convention in Milwaukee, paid tribute to the man who lost his life during the shooting at his rally in Pennsylvania last week.</p>

<p>In his first public address since surviving an assassination attempt, Trump honoured Corey Comperatore, the firefighter who was killed by the shooter. He solemnly presented the man's helmet and uniform, kissing them in homage before a hushed crowd. Trump hailed Corey as a "highly respected former fire chief" and recounted how he "lost his life selflessly acting as a human shield to protect others". He asked for a moment of silence to honour the firefighter.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Tragically, the shooter claimed the life of one of our fellow Americans, Corey Comperatore, and seriously wounded two other great warriors, David Dutch and James Copenhaver.<br />

<p>Trump also paid his respects to those injured in the attack, referring to them as "dedicated Trumpsters".</p>

<p>Last week, during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, the former US President was struck near the ear in an assassination attempt by a 20-year-old man.</p>

<p>Agents from the Secret Service, the law enforcement agency responsible for protecting US political leaders, swiftly intervened, rushing to the stage and escorting him quickly to a nearby vehicle.</p>

<p>The gunman and a bystander were killed, and two spectators were critically injured. The man was a 50-year-old firefighter Corey Comperatore.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A major magnitude 7.4 earthquake struck northern Chile on Thursday, the United States Geological Survey said.</p>

<p>The epicenter of the tremor was located 164 miles (265 kilometers) east of the coastal city of Antofagasta, at a depth of 78.5 miles (126 kilometers).</p>

<p>"So far there are no reports of injuries or major damage, but teams are gathering information," Chilean President Gabriel Boric wrote on X.</p>

<p>Chile is situated along the Pacific "Ring of Fire", an arc of intense seismic activity that stretches from Japan through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin.</p>

<p>In 2010, an 8.8-magnitude quake unleashed a tsunami that swept away entire villages in the south and center of the country, leaving about 520 people dead.</p>

<p>Bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the west and the Andes mountain range to the east, Chile is also one of the most seismically active countries in the world.</p>

<p>The epicenter of Thursday's earthquake was located about 50 miles from Chile's border with Argentina, and less than 20 miles from its border with Bolivia.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Six days after he narrowly survived an assassination attempt, former US President Donald Trump today said the ruling Democrats must stop "weaponising the justice system" and labelling their political opponent an "enemy of democracy".</p>

<p>"In an age where our politics too often divide us, now is the time to remember that we are fellow citizens, we are one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all," Trump said after accepting the Republican Party's nomination for the Presidential polls due later this year.</p>

<p>"We must not criminalise dissent and demonise political disagreement, which is what has been happening at a level that nobody has ever seen before. In that spirit, the Democrat party should immediately stop weaponising the justice system and labelling their political opponent as the enemy of democracy," he said. "In fact, I am the one saving democracy for the people of our country," the former President told the gathering in Milwaukee.</p>

<p>"They should drop these partisan witch hunts which I have been going through for approximately eight years, and they should do that without delay," he said, referring to the criminal cases against him.</p>

<p>"If they would use that genius to help our country, we will have a much stronger and better country," Trump said.</p>

<p>Thanking his family members for their support, he said "they got subpoenaed more than any people probably in the history of the United States". "Every week, they get another subpoena from the Democrats, crazy Nancy Pelosi and the whole thing just boom, boom, boom. They have got to stop that because they are destroying our country. We have to work on Making America Great Again," he said.</p>

<p>Ms Pelosi is a senior Democratic leader who has earlier served as a Speaker of the House of Representatives</p>

<p>Seeking the Americans' support, the 78-year-old leader said, "Tonight, I ask for your partnership, for your support, and I am humbly asking for your vote. Every day, I will strive to honour the trust you have placed in me, and I will never let you down." In a unity pitch, he also said he was "running for full America and not just half of America".</p>

<p>Doubling down on his stand on immigrants, he said the US is in "decline" with an immigrant "invasion".</p>

<p>"We have an illegal immigration crisis that's taking place right now as we sit here in this beautiful arena. It's a massive invasion at our southern border that has spread misery, crime, poverty, disease, and destruction to communities all across our land."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cover of <em>New York magazine's</em> latest Health Issue included a Photoshopped picture of former president Donald Trump and President Joe Biden in their shorts, which sparked a flurry of criticism. The image, which compares the two political rivals on medical scales, has drawn criticism for being improper and immoral.</p>

<p>The magazine defended the cover, arguing that it was a statement on the candidates' ages and health-a subject that the public is becoming more interested in. Social media users and critics have, however, voiced anger over the photograph, denouncing it as exploitative and insulting.</p>

<p><em>New York Magazine's</em> Instagram post featuring the controversial cover image garnered thousands of likes and comments, with a majority of social media users expressing outrage and labelling it as immoral.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump today made a "unity" pitch as he said he was "running for full America and not just half of America".</p>

<p>The 78-year-old was addressing the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, hoping to build momentum toward a November victory over US President <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/obama-tells-allies-biden-needs-to-reconsider-re-election-bid-report-6135482#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll" target="_blank">Joe Biden</a> and a second term in the White House.</p>

<p>"We will have an incredible victory, and we will begin the four greatest years in the history of our country," Trump said in his first speech since a 20-year-old man shot at him, causing a slight injury to his right ear, and killing a bystander, during a rally last week.</p>

<p>"Four months from now, we will have an incredible victory... I am running to be president for all of America, not half of America because there is no victory in winning for half of America," he said.</p>

<p>"I immediately knew it was very serious, that we were under attack," he told the Republican National Convention with his family in attendance. "I felt very safe because I had God on my side."</p>

<p>"The assassin's bullet came within a quarter of an inch of taking my life. So many people have asked me what happened, and therefore, I'll tell you what happened, and you'll never hear it from me a second time, because it's too painful," Trump said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden was "soul searching" about dropping his Democratic reelection campaign, a source said, while Donald Trump prepared to accept the Republican presidential nomination in what aides said would be an unusually reflective speech.</p>

<p>The fortunes of the two candidates appeared to be on opposite trajectories on Thursday in the run-up to the November 5 election.</p>

<p>Biden, 81, was isolating at his Delaware home after contracting COVID-19, while facing a growing revolt from Democrats who urged him to step aside to avert a landslide defeat. His doctor said he was experiencing mild symptoms.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, has basked all week in adulation at the Republican National convention in Milwaukee after surviving a weekend assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally.</p>

<p>For the fourth consecutive night, Trump made a grand entrance into the arena during the program, still wearing a bandage over the ear that was wounded on Saturday and drawing huge applause.</p>

<p>Trump's acceptance speech, scheduled for 10 p.m. Eastern Time (0200 GMT on Friday), offers a chance to lay out his vision for a second White House term before a primetime national television audience.</p>

<p>Among the speakers on Thursday were the conservative commentator Tucker Carlson, former pro wrestler Hulk Hogan and mixed martial arts impresario Dana White.</p>

<p>The head pro at Trump's Florida golf club, John Nieporte, praised Trump's skills on the course and claimed the former president had won 21 club championships.</p>

<p>"Joe Biden? Zero," he said, evoking the surreal moment from the June 27 presidential debate when Trump and Biden argued over which of the two candidates had a better golf game.</p>

<p>Biden has faced increasing pressure from heavyweights in his party to cede his position at the top of the ticket after his erratic performance on debate night. Former House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi is among those who have told him he cannot win in November, according to a White House source familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>After weeks of insisting that he will remain in the race, Biden is now taking calls to step aside seriously and multiple Democratic officials think an exit is a matter of time, according to sources familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>People close to the president told the New York Times on Thursday that they believe he has begun to accept the idea that he may have to drop out.</p>

<p>Democratic leaders in the House and Senate - Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer - have told Biden directly that he will not only lose the White House but also endanger their effort to win back the House, according to reports in multiple news outlets.</p>

<p>Opinion polls show four of the seven most competitive states looking increasingly out of reach for Biden. The Trump campaign, meanwhile, said it believes it is now competitive in Democratic-leaning states including Minnesota, New Hampshire, and Virginia.</p>

<p>Senator Jon Tester, who faces a challenging reelection battle in Montana this year, on Thursday became the 21st congressional Democrat and the second senator to publicly call on Biden to drop out.</p>

<p>Some lawmakers say Biden may now be more open to stepping aside.</p>

<p>"He's done what's best for America ... I think he'll keep doing so," Democratic U.S. Senator John Hickenlooper told Reuters. "He's working towards that."</p>

<p>Hickenlooper declined to say whether he believed Biden should step aside as a candidate.</p>

<p>Former President Barack Obama has told others that Biden, who was Obama's vice president, should rethink his candidacy, the Washington Post reported, citing anonymous sources.</p>

<h3><strong>REPUBLICAN UNITY</strong></h3>

<p>Trump will cap the four-day Republican convention with his first public address since the assassination attempt.</p>

<p>Lara Trump, the nominee's daughter-in-law who serves as Republican National Committee co-chair, said the attack had prompted him to revise his acceptance speech and emphasize unity.</p>

<p>"I don't think you can go through what he went through on Saturday, really a near-death experience, and not come out on the other side impacted," Lara Trump said.</p>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris, who could vie for the Democratic nomination should Biden pull out, said Trump's call for unity would have little credibility, given his persistent refusal to acknowledge his 2020 election defeat.</p>

<p>"We're too busy watching what you're doing to hear what you're saying," she said at a campaign rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina.</p>

<p>With most dissent quelled and his grip on the Republican Party never tighter, Trump will be in a much stronger position than in his 2017-2021 term to follow through on his agenda if he wins the election.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Former US President Donald Trump recounted the assassination attempt on him during a campaign rally on Saturday while addressing the Republican National Convention (RNC).]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaking at the Republican National Convention, former US President Donald Trump recounted the assassination attempt on him during a campaign rally last week, stating that he felt safe during the attack as "God was on my side".</p>

<p>After accepting his nomination as the official Republican presidential candidate, Trump narrated how the attack unfolded during his rally in Pennsylvania.&nbsp;"I am not supposed to be here tonight. I am not supposed to be here," he told the crowd who chanted "Yes, you are".</p>

<p>"I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of almighty God," he said, adding that many have described the moment as "divine intervention".</p>

<p>Trump said the bullet missed him as he leaned forward, seconds before the assassin fired the shot, to look at a screen displaying immigration data. "In order to see the chart and I started to turned to my right. I began to turn a little bit further which I am very lucky I did not do," he said.</p>

<p>"If I had not moved my head at the very last instant, the assassin's bullet would have perfectly hit its mark, and I would not be with you tonight."</p>

<p>The bullet that missed him by a few inches, grazed his ear as the 78-year-old Republican nominee hid behind the podium and was quickly whisked off the stage by Secret Service agents.</p>

<p>Trump said he heard "a loud whizzing sound and felt something hit me very, very hard on my right ear".</p>

<p>“I said to myself, ‘Wow, what was that - it can only be a bullet' - and moved my right hand to my ear, brought it down, and my hand was covered with blood," he said, adding that he knew immediately that he was under attack.</p>

<p>"There was blood pouring everywhere, and yet, in a certain way I felt very safe, because I had&nbsp;<br />
God on my side,” Trump said, as he continued to describe the attack.</p>

<p>Trump, who first shared his reaction to the attack on a Truth Social post, said the attack was "too painful to tell" and he would not narrate how it occurred again.</p>

<p>The shooter, a 20-year old nursing aide named Thomas Matthew Crooks, was shot dead by Secret Service snipers. The motive behind his attack is not known yet.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Milan court has ordered a journalist to pay Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni damages of 5,000 euros ($5,465) for making fun of her in a social media post, news agency ANSA and other local media reported.</p>

<p>The journalist, Giulia Cortese, was also given a suspended fine of 1,200 euros for a jibe on Twitter, now named X, in Oct. 2021 about Meloni's height, which was defined as "body shaming".</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Italy's government has a serious problem with freedom of expression and journalistic dissent.

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>In a response to a Reuters story on the verdict, Cortese wrote on X on Thursday: "Italy's government has a serious problem with freedom of expression and journalistic dissent."</p>

<p>Meloni had launched legal action against the journalist after the two women clashed on social media three years ago.</p>

<p>Meloni, whose far-right Brothers of Italy party was in opposition at the time, took exception when Cortese published a mocked-up photo of her with a picture of the late fascist leader Benito Mussolini in the background.</p>

<p>Cortese responded with further tweets including one that translates as "you don't scare me, Giorgia Meloni. After all, you're only 1.2 metres (4 feet) tall. I can't even see you."</p>

<p>Meloni's height is given as between 1.58 m and 1.63 m on various media websites.</p>

<p>Cortese can appeal against the sentence, and Meloni's lawyer said the prime minister would donate to charity any damages she eventually receives.</p>

<p>Writing in English on X on Thursday, Cortese said it was a tough time for independent journalists in Italy.</p>

<p>"Let's hope for better days ahead. We won't give up!" she added.</p>

<p>A high number of lawsuits brought against journalists was cited this year by Reporters Without Borders, which relegated Italy five places to 46th in its 2024 World Press Freedom Index.</p>

<p>Meloni is not new to taking journalists to court. Last year a Rome court fined best-selling author Roberto Saviano 1,000 euros plus legal expenses after he insulted her on television in 2021 over her hardline stance on illegal immigration.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden was reportedly coming closer to dropping out of the White House race Friday as allies including Barack Obama were said to have expressed concerns that he can no longer win the 2024 election.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old Democrat was holed up at his beach house with Covid as multiple US media reports said he was considering the future of his reelection bid amid mounting opposition within his party.</p>

<p>The New York Times cited several people close to Biden as saying they believe he has begun to accept that he may lose in November to Republican rival Donald Trump and may have to drop out, with one quoted as saying: "Reality is setting in."</p>

<p>It quoted the person as saying it would not be a surprise if Biden soon endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him as the Democratic candidate.</p>

<p>Former president Obama meanwhile had reportedly told allies that Biden should "seriously consider the viability of his candidacy," the Washington Post reported. His office did not comment.</p>

<p>The Axios news outlet separately quoted party figures as saying that Biden could drop out as soon as this weekend, while broadcaster NBC quoted a person close to Biden as saying: "We're close to the end."</p>

<p>Biden's candidacy has been in peril for three weeks since a disastrous television debate against Trump.</p>

<p>His campaign however denied the reports and insisted he was staying in.</p>

<p>"He's running for reelection. Baseless conjecture from anonymous sources isn't a scoop," campaign official T.J. Ducklo said on X.</p>

<p>Harris made no comment on the crisis in a speech in the battleground state of North Carolina but praised the president, saying the "contrast between Joe Biden and Donald Trump it's like night and day."</p>

<p>She also lashed out Trump's new running mate J.D. Vance and said it was the "most existential, consequential and important election of our lifetime."</p>

<p><strong>- Covid symptoms -</strong><br />
While rival Trump prepares for his star turn at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee later Thursday, Biden finds himself in both personal and political isolation.</p>

<p>His personal doctor, Kevin O'Connor, said Thursday that Biden was still experiencing mild Covid symptoms and was taking the drug Paxlovid, but that his vital signs remain normal.</p>

<p>"He will continue to conduct the business of the American people," O'Connor said in a letter released by the White House.</p>

<p>His Covid diagnosis came at the worst possible time for his campaign, forcing him to cut short a trip to Las Vegas and isolate at his holiday home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.</p>

<p>Biden told reporters on Wednesday that he was "doing well" but was later seen looking frail as he slowly descended the steps of Air Force One.</p>

<p>The drumbeat of Democrats coming out against Biden is growing, with 20 members of the House of Representatives having openly called on him to quit.</p>

<p>The top Democrats in Congress, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both reportedly met with Biden in recent days to warn that his candidacy threatens his party's prospects in November's election.</p>

<p>Influential former House speaker Nancy Pelosi added to his woes by privately telling Biden he cannot win and could harm Democrats' chances of recapturing the lower chamber, CNN and the New York Times reported.</p>

<p>White House National Security spokesman John Kirby meanwhile said Biden was being "kept up to speed" by his team despite the political turmoil and his illness.</p>

<p>However the split-screen with Donald Trump could not be more stark, with Trump set to formally accept the Republican nomination in Milwaukee as Biden hunkers down.</p>

<p>Republicans find themselves newly unified after former president Trump, who at 78 is just three years younger than Biden, survived an assassination attempt on Saturday that left him with a bandaged ear.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

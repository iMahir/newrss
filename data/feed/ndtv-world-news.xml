       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be on an official visit to Singapore on September 4, 5 to further strengthen bilateral ties between the two nations. The prime minister's visit comes a fortnight after the high-level roundtable between top ministers of both countries.</p>

<p>"Ties between India and Singapore are poised to take-off to an entirely new level of cooperation," the Ministry of External Affairs said at the special briefing about the Prime Minister's visit.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi's visit to Singapore comes after six years, said Secretary East, Ministry of External Affairs, Jaideep Mazumdar. India and Singapore are looking to significantly enhance their cooperation in the semiconductor sector, he added.</p>

<p>He also said that the PM's visit to Singapore is "important for trade and investment".</p>

<p>Singapore is India's largest trade partner in ASEAN. It is also a leading source of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the last financial year with an investment of $11.77 billion in 2023 alone," he said, adding that Singapore is India's sixth largest trade partner worldwide.</p>

<p>During his two-day visit, Prime Minister Modi will also address CEOs, he said.</p>

<p>"Investments have also been very large. Since 2000 till now, we have an accumulative FDI of USD 160 billion dollars. There will be an interaction with business leaders in the PM's visit. This will be an important element of the visit as Prime Minister will address the CEOs in his visit, where they will hear India's growth story first hand," Mr Mazumdar said.</p>

<p>"His [PM Modi's] first visit to Singapore was in his first term as the Prime Minister. This visit is of great significance as it's his visit early in his term, and also as the new Prime Minister Lawrence Wong has taken oath recently and Singaporeans are excited to welcome PM Modi. This is an opportune time to set the stage for India-Singapore's vibrant bilateral relations for the next stage of India-Singapore bilateral relations. Our ties have evolved and we have a dynamic strategic partnership encompassing diverse areas from our shared history and people-to-people ties, which form an important link between us," he added.</p>

<p>Speaking about the special roundtable framework shared by the two nations, he said "We have identified new anchors of our partnership under the India-Singapore ministerial roundtable framework. The visit will also take place in the light of our 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations which we're celebrating in 2025 and 10th year of our strategic partnership with Singapore."</p>

<p>"During the recently concluded India-Singapore Ministerial Roundtable, which is a unique forum between ministers on both sides on diverse areas, a number of new forward-looking futuristic areas were identified in digitization, skill, sustainability, health, advanced manufacturing and connectivity. We are likely to exchange a number of MoUs in these areas in the forthcoming visit of the PM," he said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden will sit down on Monday with US negotiators pushing for a hostage-release deal in the Israel-Hamas war, the White House said, after the deaths of six captives in Gaza, including an American citizen.</p>

<p>Biden's official schedule was revised to make time for the White House meeting, which will also be attended by Vice President Kamala Harris, who is running to succeed him in November's presidential election.</p>

<p>A statement announcing Biden's updated schedule said he and Harris would meet Monday "with the US hostage deal negotiating team following the murder of American citizen Hersh Goldberg-Polin and five other hostages by Hamas on Saturday, and discuss efforts to drive towards a deal that secures the release of the remaining hostages."</p>

<p>The United States, along with fellow mediators Egypt and Qatar, has spent months pushing for a hostage-prisoner exchange and ceasefire in the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>Militants seized 251 hostages during the October 7 attack on Israel that sparked the war, 97 of whom remain in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Scores of hostages were released during a one-week truce in November, with campaigners and family members believing another deal is the best option to ensure the rest return.</p>

<p>A nationwide strike in Israel aimed at ramping up pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to secure the release of the remaining captives was set to begin Monday.</p>

<p>Hostage relatives and advocates have accused Netanyahu's administration of not doing enough to bring the captives back alive, and have called for an immediate ceasefire to rescue the rest.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk, who rechristened Twitter X, seemed to have momentarily forgotten the new name of his social media platform. The billionaire entrepreneur, on Monday, referred to X as "Twitter" in a post after the platform was banned in Brazil.<br />
<br />
Mr Musk shared a meme that showed a person lying on a pile of money, with the caption "POV: VPN companies after Brazil banned Twitter." The use of the original name did not go unnoticed, with many users joking that the "rebranding is going well."</p>

Mr Musk has responded by calling the judge an "evil dictator cosplaying as a judge" and accusing him of trying to destroy democracy in Brazil.<br />
<br />
The ban comes after a months-long standoff between Mr Musk and the Brazilian authorities investigating the spread of disinformation on the platform. The judge previously ordered the suspension of several accounts belonging to supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who tried to discredit the voting system in the 2022 election.<br />
<br />
Mr Musk's platform has over 22 million users in Brazil and has been accused of allowing the spread of disinformation and hate speech. The judge's order also includes a fine of 50,000 reais (Rs 7.5 lakhs) for anyone who tries to bypass the ban using VPNs or other technological means.<br />
<br />
Mr Musk has expressed outrage, calling the ban an attack on free speech and democracy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former childcare worker Ashley Paul Griffith on Monday pleaded guilty to raping, sexually abusing and exploiting dozens of girls under his care in Australia and Italy.</p>

<p>It took Judge Anthony Rafter more than two hours to read out the 307 charges against Griffith in the Brisbane courtroom where several victims and their families had gathered, according to state broadcast ABC.</p>

<p>Police accused the 46-year-old of being one of Australia's worst-ever paedophiles after the charges against him were made public last year.</p>

<p>Griffith was first arrested in 2022 for making child sexual abuse content. A year later he was charged with 1,623 offences against 91 children.</p>

<p>However, some charges were dropped and the ABC reported that Monday's charges related to roughly 60 children. Many of the victims were under the age of 12.</p>

<p>The offences happened between 2003 and 2022 in twelve different locations across Australia as well as Pisa, Italy.</p>

<p>Griffith is in custody and will be sentenced at a later date. The court heard sentencing could take more than two days to give time to read victim impact statements, the ABC reported.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Nearly five million Lego pieces were lost at sea when a cargo ship nearly capsized off the coast of England in 1997.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On a gloomy drizzly day in late June, Hayley Hardstaff, a marine biologist from Cornwall, England, took her routine walk along Portwrinkle Beach. What began as an ordinary stroll turned extraordinary when she stumbled upon a black, plastic dragon with a missing upper jaw. To her surprise, it was a piece of Lego, not just any piece, but a remnant of one of history's most curious maritime mishaps.</p>

<p>In 1997, an accident involving a cargo ship and a rogue wave led to one of the most bizarre environmental disasters in history - the Great Lego Spill. Nearly five million Lego pieces, including 33,427 black dragons, were lost at sea when the Tokio Express, a cargo ship en route from Rotterdam to New York, nearly capsized off the coast of England. The incident resulted in the loss of all 62 of its shipping containers, causing one of the largest toy-related environmental disasters.</p>

<p>Twenty-seven years later, people are still finding these tiny plastic artefacts on beaches across Europe.</p>

<p>Tracey Williams, who started the "Lego Lost at Sea" Facebook page, has been documenting these Lego finds for years. The spill included nautically themed pieces like dragons, octopuses, seaweed, scuba tanks and life rafts. Some pieces, like black dragons and green octopuses, have become prized finds for beachcombers.<br />
<br />
<iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="497" scrolling="no" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FLegoLostAtSea%2Fposts%2Fpfbid08byNCC4YRvYYjcK6LZJAkBuaqECp6Se5ofEKVfNnCqa1Pdhz7u1gvmH8wpA8eBxtl&amp;show_text=false&amp;width=500" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" width="500"></iframe><br />
<br />
Oceanographer Curtis Ebbesmeyer, known for tracking the 1992 Friendly Floatees Spill, pointed out that ocean currents can carry debris to far-off places, making the extent of such pollution hard to track. While some pieces have been found in the Netherlands, France and Belgium, many remain lost, possibly sunk to the ocean floor.<br />
<br />
Mr Ebbesmeyer's curiosity about the Cornwall spill led him to investigate further. He contacted Lego and received an inventory of the container's contents, along with samples of the pieces. Testing them in his bathtub revealed that half of the pieces floated, which could explain why many remain missing.<br />
<br />
In the years since, pieces have sporadically appeared, often found by fishermen trawling the ocean floor. One of the rarest finds, a Lego shark, was recently caught 20 miles off the Cornish coast, marking the first sighting of this specific piece in 27 years. This leaves 51,799 more of these sharks still unaccounted for, according to the "Lego Lost at Sea" account.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">CATCH OF THE DAY!<br />
Oh my goodness – our very first Lego shark from the Great Lego Spill of 1997 has just been hauled up from the deep! Caught in a fisherman's net and somewhat battered and bruised after 27 years at the bottom of the ocean, this Lego shark is one of 51,800 lost… <a href="https://t.co/EFbuGU6NGU">pic.twitter.com/EFbuGU6NGU</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Professor Andrew Turner considers the incident an interesting case study due to public awareness. Unlike most container spills, the Great Lego Spill was made public, and it represents just a small part of the vast plastic pollution in the ocean.<br />
<br />
Mr Turner says it is just the "tip of the iceberg" when it comes to plastic pollution in the ocean. He pointed out the vast amounts of plastic that remain on the ocean floor, much of which is unaccounted for and whose potential impact is still largely unknown.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hollywood star George Clooney has heaped praise on US President Joe Biden over the latter's decision to step down from the 2024 presidential race.</p>

<p>The actor attended the press event in Venice for his film 'Wolfs', and shared his opinion on Biden passing the baton to the current Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris, reports Variety.</p>

<p>He said: "I've actually never had to answer that question so I suppose I will do it here. The person who should be applauded is the President, who has done the most selfless thing a President has done since George Washington."</p>

<p>"What should be remembered is the selfless act of someone who, it's very hard to let go of power - we know that we've seen it all over the world - and for someone to say I think there's a better path forward, all the credit goes to him. And that's really the truth ... I'm just very proud of where we are in the state of the world right now," he added.</p>

<p>During the event, he was also asked about Apple moving the film from a wide theatrical release to a limited one. He also brought up a New York Times report from last week by Nicole Sterling that he and Pitt were paid more than $35 million each.</p>

<p>"It was millions and millions of dollars less than what was reported," he said. "I think it's bad for our industry to have that be the standard."</p>

<p>As per Variety, on the changing state of the industry and moviegoing, he said that streaming is an absolute necessity.</p>

<p>"We need it. Our industry needs this. And (streamers) also benefit from having films released," he said. "But we haven't got it all figured out yet. This is a revolution in our industry. We need Apple and Amazon and they actually need distributors. They need to have Sony or Warner Bros, who have been doing this for 100 years."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The number of people in England with food allergies has more than doubled between 2008 and 2018, a new study reveals.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title">The number of people in England with food allergies has more than doubled between 2008 and 2018, a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(24)00163-4/fulltext">new study</a> reveals. The researchers, from Imperial College London, found that rates are highest among preschool children, with 4% having a “probable” food allergy.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>They also found that a third of those people at risk of anaphylaxis – a life-threatening allergic reaction – don't carry adrenaline autoinjector “pens”, such as EpiPens. People in deprived areas were found to be less likely to have been prescribed these life-saving injectors.</p>

<p>The true number of people with food allergies has been difficult to establish, with estimates varying between <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32067114/">under 1% and over 9% of children</a>. This is because several methods are used to estimate the frequency of food allergies, including using either the number of prescriptions of adrenaline pens, self-reporting, or blood tests to identify telltale antibodies.</p>

<p>Self-reporting is the least reliable method because many people confuse food intolerance with allergy, as is evident from a <a href="https://www.food.gov.uk/research/food-hypersensitivity/patterns-and-prevalence-of-adult-food-allergy">recent report</a> by the UK's Food Standards Agency.</p>

<p>Of the over 30% of adults who reported an adverse reaction to foods, only 6% were subsequently confirmed to have a true food allergy. To bridge this gap in understanding how common food allergies are, the new study from Imperial College took a much broader approach to better estimate the incidence of food allergy.</p>

<p>Population healthcare data from over 7.5 million people in England and a combination of clinical criteria were used to identify people with food allergies in these health records.</p>

<p>People were considered to have an allergy if doctors indicated they had either had a possible or probable allergy or if they had been prescribed an adrenaline pen or both. Using this combination, the number of people with food allergies was shown to have doubled in a decade. Curiously, since 2018, levels have plateaued somewhat at around 4% in preschool children, 2.4% in school-aged children, and under 1% in adults.</p>

<p>The study, published in The Lancet Public Health, used a broad range of criteria to identify people with food allergies. Not all cases were confirmed by medical professionals using additional tests, such as the presence of antibodies in blood or food-challenge tests where people are given increasing amounts of certain foods to see if an allergic reaction occurs.</p>

<p>Some types of food allergy may have been missed, such as <a href="https://www.allergyuk.org/resources/oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-syndrome-factsheet/">pollen food allergy syndrome</a>. This occurs when people with specific pollen allergies eat some raw foods, including certain stoned fruits, that cause mild irritant symptoms, such as itching of the mouth. Still, there are important questions as to why food allergies have been rising, and why they may now be plateauing.</p>

<h3><strong>Puzzling</strong></h3>

<p>The trend in the increased rate of allergies in developed countries has puzzled scientists for years. The <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15007629/">“old friend's hypothesis”</a> is one theory that may account for the growing incidence of chronic conditions such as allergies.</p>

<p>This hypothesis considers the role of the microbiome (the collection of helpful bacteria, fungi and viruses that live in and on us), infections and the environment in shaping our immune response and causing it to misfire.</p>

<p>Evidence to support this theory is accumulating. For example, studies show that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29105784/#:%7E:text=Early%2Dlife%20exposure%20to%20antibiotics,%3B%20I2%20%3A%2077.0%25.">high use of antibiotics</a> in early childhood as the immune system and microbiome are developing is linked to a greater likelihood of allergy in later life.</p>

<p>Pollution exposure can also enhance the risk of allergy and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36810617/">worsen the severity of symptoms</a>.</p>

<p>The food we were exposed to in early life may be important in determining if we develop an allergy. <a href="https://www.food.gov.uk/research/food-allergy-and-intolerance-research/testing-of-government-advice-on-peanut-consumption-during-early-life">Previous advice</a> from the UK government about avoiding early exposure to peanuts and eggs may inadvertently be linked to the rise in food allergy to peanuts and eggs.</p>

<p>Conversely, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1414850">studies show</a> that early exposure before the age of five to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26943128/">peanuts and eggs</a> is <a href="https://evidence.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/EVIDoa2300311">linked to</a> a reduced likelihood of developing an allergy.</p>

<p>The advice in the UK to avoid peanuts and eggs during pregnancy and early childhood was changed in <a href="https://www.food.gov.uk/research/food-allergy-and-intolerance-research/testing-of-government-advice-on-peanut-consumption-during-early-life">2009</a>, but the trials showing the positive effects of early exposure to eggs and peanuts were only published in 2015 and 2016. However, it is possible that the plateauing incidence of food allergy cases is linked to changes in advice and the published infant food exposure trials.</p>

<p>Diagnosis is only part of the story. People also need to be able to effectively manage their condition. This requires patients to have access to the right advice and support from experts, such as dietitians, as well as the drugs needed to halt an anaphylactic attack.</p>

<p>For babies diagnosed with a food allergy, there is no <a href="https://journals.lww.com/co-clinicalnutrition/fulltext/2014/05000/Food_allergy_in_children__what_is_new_.15.aspx">good evidence</a>&nbsp;that incrementally reintroducing the food that causes the allergy can retrain the immune system and might help the child overcome their allergy. However, this must only be done under the guidance of a medical team.</p>

<p>The new study showed that allergy care was largely managed at GP practices in England. However, GP clinics may lack the specialist resources needed for proper allergy support, such as safely re-introducing foods.</p>

<p>It is clear that people in the UK with allergies need better support.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A California grandmother died after a suicidal man jumped from a highway overpass onto the windshield of her car. The incident occurred on August 9 when Margarita Novela Galindo and her husband, Florencio, were on the 210 Freeway near Sylmar, heading for a weekend getaway, reported ABC.</p>

<p>The Los Angeles Fire Department received a call about a man threatening to jump from the Roxford Street overpass around 7 pm, according to a KABC report. Shortly after, the man followed through with his threat, plunging into the path of the Galindos' vehicle.</p>

<p>The impact was severe. The man crashed through the windshield, landing directly on Ms Margarita, who was seated in the passenger seat. Her husband, who was driving the car, escaped without serious injuries.</p>

<p>The grandmother-of-seven died on August 28 after spending nearly three weeks in critical condition.</p>

<p>Ms Margarita's death has left her family devastated. "It's incredibly unfair that her life was taken because someone else didn't want theirs," her son David Galindo wrote on a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/8e5ke-support-for-a-loving-mothers-farewell?utm_campaign=fp_sharesheet_ai&amp;utm_content=amp9v2&amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;utm_source=copy_link ">GoFundMe</a> page set up to help with medical expenses and funeral costs.</p>

<p>The family is now grappling with the "what ifs" of the tragic accident, wondering if a slight delay or detour could have changed the outcome. "What if she stopped to get gas? What if she stopped to get water? This probably wouldn't have happened," David told <a href="https://abc7.com/post/woman-dies-after-man-jumps-off-210-freeway-sylmar-lands-vehicle/15250346/">ABC7</a>.</p>

<p>He said that his father is “now alone without the love of his life.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Florencio Galindo harbours no ill will for the man whose actions led to his wife's death. "He doesn't know what problems he may have had to commit suicide," his daughter Stephanie translated her father's words from Spanish.&nbsp;</p><p><div class='table-div suicide'><table class='table'><thead><tr><th colspan='2'>Helplines</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Vandrevala Foundation for Mental Health</td><td><a href='tel:+919999666555'>9999666555</a> or <a href='mailto:help@vandrevalafoundation.com'>help@vandrevalafoundation.com</a> </td></tr><tr><td>TISS iCall</td><td><a href='tel:+912225521111'>022-25521111</a> (Monday-Saturday: 8 am to 10 pm)</td></tr> <tr><td colspan='2'>(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you've been wondering why you see only a certain kind of content on your X feed, its owner Elon Musk has the answer. The billionaire, in a post on Monday, shed light on the platform's inner workings.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The X algorithm operates on a simple yet effective principle: "If you interact with content, you want to see more of that content." This means your engagement such as likes, comments, and shares with posts directly influences the algorithm's decisions on what content to display.<br />
<br />
Mr Musk elaborated on one of the algorithm's key signals – sharing content. "One of the strongest signals is if you forward X posts to friends, it assumes you like that content a lot because it takes effort to forward," he wrote. This means that when users share a post, the algorithm interprets that action as a strong endorsement of the content, pushing similar items into their feed frequently.<br />
<br />
However, Mr Musk also acknowledged a significant flaw in this logic. He pointed out that the algorithm does not understand the intent behind a user's interaction, particularly when the motivation is negative. "Unfortunately, if the actual reason you forwarded the content to friends was because you were outraged by it, we are currently not smart enough to realise that," he admitted.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>In a follow-up post, Mr Musk shared his support for “freedom of speech”. “I like content that supports freedom of speech,” he declared, adding, “Long live X. Long live freedom of speech.”</p>

I'll cage fight the dictator in Brazil if I have to</p>
— Elon Musk (Parody) (@ElonMuskAOC) <a href="https://twitter.com/ElonMuskAOC/status/1830441337419870341?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 2, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Going a step further, he wrote, “I'll cage fight the dictator in Brazil if I have to.” This remark was aimed at Brazil's Chief Justice Alexandre de Moraes, whom Mr Musk has previously labelled a “tyrant” and a “dictator.”&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The feud between the two began in April when Elon Musk announced he would unsuspend accounts linked to the 2023 Brazilian Congress attack in Brasilia, despite a court order to keep them blocked.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In response, Alexandre de Moraes opened an investigation into the X owner, accusing him of spreading fake news, obstructing justice and inciting criminal activities. He also ordered Brazilian internet service providers to block access to X, threatened daily fines for users trying to bypass the ban by using VPNs, and even froze the finances of Mr Musk's company, Starlink, in Brazil.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Elon Musk fired back by accusing Mr Moraes of undermining democracy and has used X to criticise the judge's actions.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Malaysia Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and his New Zealand counterpart Chris Luxon on Monday said they were united in calling for an immediate ceasefire in the conflict in Gaza and finding a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We both are very united in calling for an immediate ceasefire, getting the parties around the negotiating table and finding a two-state solution," Luxon said at a joint press conference. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Anwar said prospects for a ceasefire did not look encouraging at present, saying there was a lack of commitment from countries, particularly the United States, who could exert their influence to stop the conflict.</p>

<p>"The only hope is to engage the United States to take a stronger stance," Anwar said.</p>

<p>Muslim-majority Malaysia is a staunch supporter of the Palestinian cause and has long advocated a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.</p>

<p>Anwar has good relations with the political leadership of the Palestinian group Hamas but maintains he has no involvement in its military apparatus.</p>

<p>Luxon, who is on a three-day visit to Malaysia, also said New Zealand would expand defence cooperation with Malaysia and was deploying one of its air force's P8 Poseidon patrol and reconnaissance aircraft to Butterworth in Malaysia's northern Penang state, for a joint exercise.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korean police have launched an investigation into the messaging platform Telegram over deepfake online sex crimes, Yonhap news agency reported on Monday, citing a senior police official.</p>

<p>The probe will examine whether it had been abetting the distribution of sexually explicit deepfake content, Yonhap said, quoting the head of the National Office of Investigation.</p>

<p>An official at the National Police Agency's cyber investigation bureau declined to confirm the report when reached by telephone.</p>

<p>South Korean authorities have called on Telegram and other social media platforms for cooperation in fighting sexually explicit deepfake content.</p>

<p>The steps follow reports by several domestic media outlets that sexually explicit deepfake images and videos of South Korean women were often found in Telegram chatrooms.</p>

<p>Telegram could not immediately be reached for comment but the company last week said it actively moderates harmful content on its platform including illegal pornography.</p>

<p>"Moderators use a combination of proactive monitoring of public parts of the platform, sophisticated AI tools and user reports in order to remove millions of pieces of harmful content each day," it said in a statement.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The West is openly persecuting Russian journalists, President Vladimir Putin said in remarks published on Monday, days after Moscow banned dozens of US journalists from entering the country.</p>

<p>"In order to hide from inconvenient facts, from truthful information, the West, which considers itself the standard of freedom, has launched an open persecution against Russian correspondents," Putin told the Mongolian newspaper Onoodor on the eve of his visit to the country, according to a transcript provided on the Kremlin's website.</p>

<p>His remarks come after Moscow said on Wednesday it was banning entry to Russia for 92 US citizens, including journalists, lawyers, and the heads of what it said were key military-industrial firms, over what it described as Washington's Russophobic stance.</p>

<p>They also follow years of the Kremlin's suppression of independent media and Moscow's swift blocking of dissenting voices in Russian-language media outlets at the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.</p>

<p>Putin said that in Russia, media are free.</p>

<p>"The only requirement for them is compliance with Russian legislation," he said. "Foreign correspondents accredited in our country should understand this."</p>

<p>Russia has frequently accused Western countries of imposing unfair restrictions on its media abroad, including bans on some state-backed news outlets.</p>

<p>Putin told the Mongolian newspaper that Russian journalists face "direct censorship" in almost all Western countries.</p>

<p>"The only thing our media do is to convincingly convey the Russian point of view on current modern problems and processes taking place in the world," Putin said.</p>

<p>In May, Russian lawmakers passed a bill giving prosecutors powers to shut foreign media bureaus in Moscow if a Western country has been "unfriendly" to Russian media.</p>

<p>Washington has imposed sanctions against some state-run Russian TV stations, which it says have spread disinformation to bolster Russia's war in Ukraine.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[As Kamala Harris heads into the November presidential race against Donald Trump, a social club she joined in college four decades ago might just pay its biggest dividends yet.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Kamala Harris heads into the November presidential race against Donald Trump, a social club she joined in college four decades ago might just pay its biggest dividends yet.</p>

<p>"Whatever it is that she needs our coalitions to do, we're going to be there to help push it out and get it done," said Tanya Baham, a member of Harris's college sorority, in attendance at the recent Democratic National Convention.</p>

<p>Sororities and fraternities abound across US college campuses -- with their Greek-letter names, exclusive memberships, and promise of community, usually along same-sex lines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But Harris's membership in Alpha Kappa Alpha, a historically Black sorority, provides her campaign a direct line to a network of 360,000 women across the country, many of whom are excited to see one of their own in the White House.</p>

<p>And the Democratic Party, which counts women and Black voters as key constituencies in their electoral base, is paying attention.</p>

<p>While the sorority itself is non-partisan, many, like Baham, are ready to individually tap their networks for fundraising and voter registration in an election that could come down to the wire.</p>

<p>"We're... going to make certain that our kiddos, the young folks, the old folks, get a chance to register and then get to the polls," said Baham, a social worker in Louisiana.</p>

<h3><strong>Built-in network</strong></h3>

<p>Harris joined AKA at Howard University, a historically Black school in Washington where the sorority was founded in 1908 -- the first such organization for Black undergraduate women in the United States.</p>

<p>Over the next few decades, more Black sororities and fraternities emerged, providing African American students refuge amid the scourge of American racism and also serving as bases for civil rights organizing.</p>

<p>AKA has chapters for both undergraduate students and college graduates, making it far more than just a college-level organization.</p>

<p>As vice president, Harris has hosted Black sorority and fraternity leaders at the White House, and ahead of rising to the top of the Democratic ticket she headlined AKA's convention in Texas, in July.</p>

<p>Later that month, within days of President Joe Biden ending his reelection bid, she was at a convention for another Black sorority, Zeta Phi Beta, in Indiana.</p>

<p>AKA members were among those on a "Win With Black Women" Zoom call which raised $1.5 million, and Glenda Glover, the sorority's former president, is leading outreach for Harris at the country's historically Black colleges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a historic first, AKA has also formed a political action committee, used for fundraising for political candidates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We're just all ready to work and do this," Donna Miller, a county official in Illinois who was on the Zoom call, told the Chicago Sun-Times. "It invigorated so many people from young and old, across generations, across ethnicity."</p>

<h3><strong>Tight-lipped&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>But while AKA and other Black sororities provide a network for Harris to tap into, it is hard to gauge how much that will translate into actual votes come November.</p>

<p>The sorority and its members have generally been tight-lipped -- multiple members declined to speak with AFP about the election.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some referred AFP to the sorority's headquarters, which did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A half dozen individual chapters also did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>"Mobilization through sororities can't hurt," said Daniel Hopkins, a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But Hopkins cautioned that "there are only so many voters in the US in general who attend four-year colleges, who are members of these organizations."</p>

<p>And while African Americans are overwhelmingly Democratic voters, they have been peeling off from the party in recent years -- a decline that has mostly come from younger and infrequent voters, according to his research.</p>

<p>At the same time, Amanda Wilkerson, an assistant professor of higher education at the University of Central Florida who has studied Black voters, said organizations like Black sororities and fraternities are "hidden apparatuses," often ignored by polling or the media even as they've organized for previous elections, both nationally and locally.</p>

<p>Their members and alumni are well-versed in campaigning, she said, and the 2024 election isn't their first go-around.</p>

<p>Harris "is the first candidate of her kind to be able to leverage those networks of support," Wilkerson said. "But it's not altogether new.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A five-member panel of Brazil's Supreme Court will vote on Monday on whether to uphold Justice Alexandre de Moraes' ruling to shut down social media platform X in the country.</p>

<p>Moraes, whom X owner Elon Musk has labelled a "dictator," has called a virtual session of the court's first chamber - of which he is a member - so peers can review his decision.</p>

<p>Brazil's Supreme Court has 11 justices split between two chambers of five members each, not including the chief justice. They can vote to maintain or reject decisions by a single judge.</p>

<p>Justices Carmen Lucia, Luiz Fux, Cristiano Zanin and Flavio Dino sit in the first chamber alongside Moraes.</p>

<p>X was taken down in Brazil, one of its largest markets, in the early hours of Saturday following a decision by Moraes, who has been locked in a months-long feud with Musk.</p>

<p>The popular social media platform missed a court-imposed deadline on Thursday evening to name a legal representative in Brazil as required by local law, triggering the suspension.</p>

<p>The dispute over X has its roots in a Moraes order earlier this year that required the platform to block accounts implicated in probes of alleged misinformation and hate.</p>

<p>Musk has argued that Moraes was trying to enforce unjustified censorship and closed the X office in Brazil in August, without appointing a new representative. The judge has insisted that social media needs hate speech regulations.</p>

<p>Moraes' latest decision was backed by Chief Justice Luis Roberto Barroso.</p>

<p>"A company that refuses to name a legal representative in Brazil cannot operate in Brazilian territory," Barroso said in an interview with the newspaper Folha de S.Paulo published on Sunday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The highly-anticipated grand opening of Pakistan's Dream Bazaar Mall in Karachi descended into chaos when a group of people forcibly entered the venue, causing widespread vandalism and destruction of property.&nbsp;The mall, built by a Pakistani businessman living abroad, was heavily publicised on social media and offered special discounts to attract customers on its opening day,&nbsp;<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://arynews.tv/karachi-dream-bazaar-opening-sale-chaos/" rel="nofollow, noindex">ARY News</a></em> reported. However, shortly after opening its doors at 3:00 pm, the mall was overwhelmed by a massive crowd,&nbsp;eager to enter the store.</p>

<p>Videos circulating on social media show hundreds of people storming into the newly opened mall in Karachi's Gulistan-e-Johar area, as they vandalise property and loot stores.&nbsp;Despite desperate attempts by the staff to manage the crowd and maintain order, people forcefully barged into the shop, damaging shops and stealing merchandise. People frantically grabbed whatever they could lay their hands on, shoving them into bags or carrying them away in their arms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eyewitnesses reported that despite the commotion, police were notably absent from the scene.</p>

<p><strong>Watch the videos here:</strong></p>

<p>Many videos also captured the aftermath of the rampage, revealing a scene of utter devastation. The entire building was left in shambles, with clothes scattered all over the floor, and shattered glass littering the premises. The footage showed people filming themselves as they looted the store, seemingly proud of their actions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The video sparked a heated debate, with users expressing shock, and disgust at the scenes of chaos and destruction.&nbsp;Several internet users expressed their disappointment at the lack of civic morals displayed by the crowd, with many questioning how individuals could resort to such destructive behaviour.</p>

<p>One user wrote. ''What else can you expect from a country where lawlessness is the norm? A place where even a generous gesture turns into chaos. This incident speaks volumes about the state of affairs in Pakistan.''</p>

<p>Another commented, ''Tell me what's missing here? I think basic cultural education!! When someone is trying to do good for you, be thankful! Not loot them instead.'' A third said, ''It's unfortunate to see such an exciting development turn into a chaotic situation. While the intention behind offering special discounts to locals was admirable, it's clear that better planning and security measures were needed to prevent the mall from being looted.''</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger and key executives are expected to present a plan later this month to the company's board of directors to slice off unnecessary businesses and revamp capital spending.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger and key executives are expected to present a plan later this month to the company's board of directors to slice off unnecessary businesses and revamp capital spending, according to a source familiar with the matter, as they try to revive the once-dominant chipmaker's fortunes.</p>

<p>The plan will include ideas on how to shave overall costs by selling businesses, including its programmable chip unit Altera, that Intel can no longer afford to fund from the company's once-sizeable profit.</p>

<p>Gelsinger and other high-ranking executives at Intel are expected to present the plan at a mid-September board meeting, the same source said.</p>

<p>Details of Gelsinger's proposal are reported here for the first time.</p>

<p>Intel declined to comment.</p>

<p>The proposal does not yet include plans to split Intel and sell off its contract manufacturing operation, or foundry, to a buyer such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., according to the source and another person familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>The presentation, including the plans around its manufacturing operations, is not yet finalized and could change ahead of the meeting.</p>

<p>Intel has already broken off its foundry business from its design business, and has been reporting its financial results separately since the first calendar quarter of this year.</p>

<p>The company has erected a wall between the design and manufacturing businesses to assure that potential customers of the design division would have no access to the technology secrets of customers using Intel's factories, known as fabs, to manufacture their chips.</p>

<p>Intel is suffering through one of its worst periods as it attempts to play catchup in the AI era against the likes of Nvidia, the dominant AI chipmaker with a $3 trillion market capitalization. In contrast, Intel has now sunk to below $100 billion after a disastrous second-quarter earnings report in August.</p>

<p>The proposal Gelsinger and others will present is likely to include plans to further reduce the company's capital spending on factory expansion. The pitch may include plans to pause or altogether halt its $32 billion factory in Germany, a project that has reportedly been delayed, the source said.</p>

<p>In August, Intel said it expects to cut capital spending to $21.5 billion in 2025, down 17% from this year, and issued a weaker-than-expected third-quarter forecast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to the CEO and executive plans, Intel has retained Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to advise the board on what businesses Intel can sell and what it needs to retain, according to two sources with knowledge of the company's advisory plans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Intel has not yet asked for bids on the product units, but will likely do so once the board endorses a plan, according to the two sources familiar with the company's advisory plans.</p>

<h3><strong>ALTERA SPIN-OUT</strong></h3>

<p>The mid-September board meeting is pivotal for the one-time chipmaking king. Intel reported a disastrous second quarter in August, which included pausing the company's dividend payments and a 15% staff cut, aimed at saving $10 billion.</p>

<p>Weeks later, chip industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan resigned from the board after months of debate over the company's future, Reuters reported, creating a vacuum of deep semiconductor business experience on the board.</p>

<p>Last Thursday, after the Reuters report, Gelsinger sought to reassure investors about the company's weak financial performance.</p>

<p>"It's been a difficult few weeks," Gelsinger said at a Deutsche Bank conference. "And we've been working hard to address the issues."</p>

<p>Gelsinger said the company is "taking seriously" what investors have said and that Intel is focused on phase two of the company's turnaround plan.</p>

<p>Part of those plans will remain unresolved until the mid-September meeting. Then, the company's directors will likely make crucial decisions about which businesses Intel will keep and which it will shed.</p>

<p>One potential unit the company may look to unload is its programmable chip business, Altera, which Intel acquired for $16.7 billion in 2015. Intel has already taken steps to spin it out as a separate but still wholly owned subsidiary and has said it planned to sell a portion of its stake in an initial public offering in the future, though it has not set a date.</p>

<p>But Altera could also be sold entirely to another chipmaker interested in growing its portfolio, and the company has quietly begun exploring whether a sale would be possible, according to one source familiar with its advisory plans and one of the sources familiar with the plans to cut businesses.</p>

<p>Infrastructure chipmaker Marvell is one potential buyer for such a transaction, according to one of the sources.</p>

<p>Bloomberg earlier reported various options for Intel including a potential split of Intel's product design and manufacturing businesses that is expected to be discussed at the board meeting.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The head of the Christian political party Lebanese Forces on Sunday accused Hezbollah of dragging the country into a war with Israel without consulting the people.</p>

<p>In a speech attacking the Shiite Muslim group, Samir Geagea, who heads the main Christian bloc in parliament, accused Hezbollah of "confiscating the Lebanese people's decision on war and peace, as if there were no state".</p>

<p>Since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in October, Hezbollah has engaged in near-daily cross-border fire with Israel in support of its Palestinian ally, which the Lebanese Forces and other parties oppose.</p>

<p>The clashes are "a war that the Lebanese people reject, but has been imposed on them", Geagea said in a speech to supporters north of Beirut.</p>

<p>"It is a war that the Lebanese people do not want and over which the government has had no say. This war does not serve Lebanon, it has brought nothing to Gaza, nor alleviated its suffering one iota," he added.</p>

<p>Iran-backed Hezbollah was the only Lebanese faction that did not disarm after the 1975-1990 civil war.</p>

<p>Its arsenal, reputed to be significantly larger than that of the Lebanese army, is touted by its supporters as a shield against Israel.</p>

<p>The movement's critics call Hezbollah a "state within a state".</p>

<p>"This war, in which Hezbollah is engaged, must stop before it brings about a major war that will spare no one," Geagea said.</p>

<p>He called on the government to "urge" Hezbollah to stop its fight with Israel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lebanon is without a president and the caretaker government is struggling to run a country gripped by a crippling financial crisis.</p>

<p>Tensions on the border appeared to have cooled since a major escalation last month. Analysts say both parties are showing restraint to avoid a regional escalation.</p>

<p>In the latest incident, one person was killed and 11 wounded in Israeli strikes on south Lebanon Sunday, the health ministry in Beirut said.</p>

<p>Hezbollah announced that one of its fighters had been killed by Israeli fire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The violence since October has killed some 607 people in Lebanon, mostly Hezbollah fighters but including at least 132 civilians, according to an AFP tally.</p>

<p>On the Israeli side including in the annexed Golan Heights, authorities have announced the deaths of at least 24 soldiers and 26 civilians.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of people remain displaced on both sides.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The families of Israeli hostages whose bodies were recovered from Gaza sobbed as they laid their relatives to rest on Sunday at funerals that featured heartfelt eulogies alongside expressions of frustration with the government.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Almog, my dear son, how much hope we had, how much we prayed that we would get the chance to see you again, to hug you, to enjoy your smile," Almog Sarusi's mother Nira said at the lectern during her son's funeral in the city of Raanana in central Israel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"But on October 7 you were neglected," she added, referring to the day Hamas militants attacked southern Israel, seizing her son from the Nova music festival along with 250 other hostages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She went on to describe "ongoing neglect, every day, every hour, 331 days... You were sacrificed to 'destroy Hamas'."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That count includes Almog Sarusi and five other hostages recovered from a Gaza tunnel on Saturday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israeli authorities confirmed their identities on Sunday. The health ministry said they were shot at close range shortly before soldiers found them.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign to destroy Hamas has killed 40,738 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The UN says the majority of the dead in Gaza are women and children.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>'Enough'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The identification of six new dead hostages on Sunday elicited fresh anger from critics of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who accuse him of not working hard enough to secure a ceasefire deal that would lead to the release of those still being held captive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of Israelis took to the streets across the country on Sunday afternoon and evening.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Jerusalem, protesters holding Israeli flags and signs bearing the faces of hostages shouted "Where are you?!" into loudspeakers directed at the government office building where a cabinet meeting was set to take place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We don't know who will be the next family that will get the terrible call," said Eyal Kalderon, cousin of French-Israeli hostage Ofer Kalderon who is still captive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Of course, it was six young and beautiful people today, and it can be any of the others in the future."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The crowds at funerals and memorial services on Sunday were more subdued.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Petah Tikva, friends and family of Eden Yerushalmi, whose death was also confirmed on Sunday, cried and caressed her body which was wrapped in a blue-and-white Israeli flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Jerusalem, hundreds of people gathered at a community centre near the synagogue where the family of US-Israeli Hersh Goldberg-Polin, whose death was also announced on Sunday, worships.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Candles were lit in front of signs in Hebrew and English that read "Bring Hersh Home", and many in attendance wept openly as the names of other hostages were read out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Goldberg-Polin's funeral will take place on Monday in Jerusalem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Back in Raanana, Nira Sarusi told mourners she hoped no other families would have to go through similar ceremonies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Enough, no more. We paid the worst price. I hope that we will be the last ones. From now on, only a deal to bring all the hostages back."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gaza health officials said an Israeli air strike targeting a group of policemen in a school sheltering displaced Palestinians killed at least 11 people on Sunday, while the military said it had struck a Hamas command centre.</p>

<p>"Eleven people, including a woman and girl, were killed when an Israeli air strike struck the Safad school in Gaza City sheltering displaced people," civil defence agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP, adding several people were also wounded.</p>

<p>The school had a Hamas police outpost, another Gaza health official said on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said its air force had struck a Hamas command centre in the Safad school.</p>

<p>"The IAF struck Hamas terrorists who were operating within a command and control centre embedded inside the area that previously served as the Safad school in Gaza City," the military said in a statement.</p>

<p>The war between Israel and Hamas erupted after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, which resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Since then, the Israeli military has been relentlessly bombing the Gaza Strip from the air, sea and ground, which has so far killed at least 40,738 people, according to the territory's health ministry.</p>

<p>According to the UN, the majority of the dead are women and children.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 47 people, including five children, were injured on Sunday after Russian missiles struck a shopping mall and events complex in Ukraine's northeastern city of Kharkiv, officials said.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, Russia said Kyiv had launched one of the biggest drone attacks against it since the full-scale war began, targeting power plants and an oil refinery, while Moscow's forces made further gains towards a key town in eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>The Kharkiv attack prompted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to renew calls on allies to allow Kyiv to fire Western-supplied missiles deeper into enemy territory and reduce the military threat posed by Russia.</p>

<p>The fighting comes at a critical juncture in the two-and-a-half year conflict. Russia is pressing an offensive in eastern Ukraine while trying to expel Ukrainian forces that broke through its western border in a surprise incursion on Aug. 6.</p>

<p>Last week, Russia pounded Ukraine with its heaviest airstrikes of the war, hitting targets including energy facilities.</p>

<p>Moscow, which denies targeting civilians, says damaging Ukraine's energy system is a legitimate military goal. Its drone and missile barrages have killed thousands of civilians since the conflict began in February 2022.</p>

<p>Ukraine, with a rapidly expanding domestic drone industry, has stepped up its own attacks on Russian energy, military and transport infrastructure.</p>

<p>Kyiv is also pressing the United States and other allies for permission to use more powerful Western-supplied weapons to inflict greater damage inside Russia and hit Moscow's abilities to attack Ukraine.</p>

<p>"All the necessary forces of the world must be brought in to stop this terror," Zelenskiy said on his Telegram channel, in response to the Kharkiv attack that Ukrainian officials said involved at least 10 missiles.</p>

<p>"This does not require extraordinary forces, but enough courage on the part of the leaders - courage to give Ukraine what it needs to defend itself."</p>

<p>In Kharkiv, rescue workers and volunteers carried injured civilians to ambulances outside the shopping complex. Shattered glass and debris were strewn across the ground and people fled to a metro station for safety.</p>

<p>Earlier, Russian officials said air defence units had destroyed 158 drones launched by Ukraine overnight, and that debris caused fires at the Moscow Oil Refinery and at the Konakovo Power Station in the neighbouring Tver region.</p>

<p>Kyiv has yet to comment on the drone barrage. Russia rarely discloses the full extent of damage inflicted by Ukraine's air attacks.</p>

<h3><strong>Russia's Nuclear Doctrine</strong></h3>

<p>Zelenskiy said that last week alone Russia had used 160 missiles, 780 guided aerial bombs and 400 attack drones against cities and troops across Ukraine.</p>

<p>He called on Telegram for "a decision on long-range strikes on missile launch sites from Russia, destruction of Russian military logistics, joint shooting down of missiles and drones".</p>

<p>Kyiv's allies are wary of how Russian President Vladimir Putin would respond if their weapons were used against targets far inside Russian territory.</p>

<p>Russia's TASS state news agency cited Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov as saying Moscow would change its nuclear doctrine in response to the West's actions over the conflict. He did not specify what the changes would entail.</p>

<p>Russia's existing nuclear doctrine, set out in a decree by President Vladimir Putin in 2020, says it may use nuclear weapons in the event of a nuclear attack by an enemy or a conventional attack that threatens the existence of the state.</p>

<p>Russia, which accuses the West of using Ukraine as a proxy to wage war against it, has said before it is considering changes.</p>

<p>"The work is at an advanced stage, and there is a clear intent to make corrections", TASS cited Ryabkov as saying.</p>

<p>Some hawks among Russia's military analysts have urged Putin to lower the threshold for nuclear use in order to "sober up" Russia's enemies in the West.</p>

<h3><strong>Advances In Eastern Ukraine</strong></h3>

<p>In eastern Ukraine, where the heaviest fighting of the war is concentrated, Russian forces continued to advance towards Pokrovsk, a vital military hub and transport link to towns and cities further north.</p>

<p>Ukraine had hoped that its surprise incursion into Russia's Kursk region launched last month would force Russia to re-deploy troops and take pressure off besieged forces in the east, but so far it does not appear to have had this effect.</p>

<p>Russia's defence ministry said its forces had captured two more settlements in Donetsk region and were "continuing to advance deep into the enemy defences". One of them, Ptyche, is 21 km (13 miles) southeast of Pokrovsk.</p>

<p>At least three people were killed and nine wounded in Russian shelling of Kurakhove, a town around 35 km south of Pokrovsk, Ukrainian officials said.</p>

<p>Ukraine's army chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, described the situation as "difficult" around Russia's main line of attack in eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>Also on Sunday, Ukrainian forces shelled Russia's southern Belgorod region, injuring 11 people, including two children who were seriously hurt, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

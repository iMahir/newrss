       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine is not requesting nuclear weapons from Western partners to defend itself against Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in comments released Tuesday.</p>

<p>"We are not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us," Zelensky told journalists, a few days after suggesting Kyiv would seek either NATO membership or nuclear arms.</p>

<p>Ukraine inherited the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. It surrendered the weapons three years later after receiving security guarantees from Russia and the United States.</p>

<p>The security guarantees, known as the Budapest Memorandum, required that the signatories respect Ukraine and the other ex-Soviet republics' territorial integrity and independence.</p>

<p>"We gave away nuclear weapons. We did not get NATO," Zelensky said in the comments to journalists late Monday that were released under embargo. "All we got was a full-scale war and many victims, so today we have only one way out."</p>

<p>"We need NATO, because we don't have the weapons that can stop Putin," he added.</p>

<p>He was clarifying comments made at a EU summit last week when he said "either Ukraine will have nuclear weapons, which will protect us, or we must have some kind of alliance."</p>

<p>The remarks triggered anger in Moscow.</p>

<p>"This is a dangerous provocation," Russia's Vladimir Putin said told journalists ahead of the BRICS summit in Kazan. "Any step in this direction will be met with a corresponding reaction," he warned.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A study shows that the AMY1 gene, responsible for starch digestion, spread long before agriculture, suggesting an evolutionary preference for carbs.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our ancestors' preference for carbohydrates may have existed long before agriculture became popular, according to a recent study. Recent archaeological findings have cast doubt on the widely held belief that prehistoric people were meat eaters. Studies have revealed that our predecessors also ingested substantial amounts of carbohydrates, despite the conventional wisdom that protein served as the main source of energy for human development.</p>

<p>Further investigation into this dietary preference has revealed a particular gene that allowed early humans to more effectively digest starches, according to a recent study published in the<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adn0609"><em> journal Science.</em></a> The enzyme amylase, which is produced by the AMY1 gene, converts complex carbs into simple sugars.</p>

<p>Researchers found that this gene started to replicate and spread long before agriculture was invented by examining the genomes of ancient humans. This implies that our ancestors' preference for carbohydrates evolved naturally in response to their surroundings rather than as a result of advancements in culture or technology.</p>

<p>According to a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/18/science/carb-love-origins-carbohydrate-wellness/index.html"><em>CNN,</em></a> humans today have multiple copies of this gene, and the number varies from person to person. However, it has been tricky for geneticists to piece together how and when the number of these genes expanded - a reflection of when eating starch likely became advantageous for human health.</p>

<p>"The main question that we were trying to answer was, when did this duplication occur? So that's why we started studying ancient genomes," said the study's first author Feyza Yilmaz, an associate computational scientist at The Jackson Laboratory, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/18/science/carb-love-origins-carbohydrate-wellness/index.html"><em>CNN.</em></a></p>

<p>"Previous studies show that there's a correlation between AMY1 copy numbers and the amount of amylase enzyme that's released in our saliva. We wanted to understand whether it's an occurrence that is corresponding to the advent of agriculture. This is ... a hot question," she said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first case of the new mpox variant has been detected in Germany, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for public health said on Tuesday, adding that it viewed the risk to the wider population as low.</p>

<p>In a statement, the institute said an infection caused by the new variant, which had been acquired abroad, was detected on October 18. It noted close physical contact was required for transmission.</p>

<p>"The RKI currently considers the risk to the health of the general population in Germany to be low," the RKI said, adding it was monitoring the situation closely and would adapt its assessment if necessary.</p>

<p>The World Health Organization declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years in August after an outbreak of the viral infection in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has spread to neighbouring countries.</p>

<p>The first sign of its spread outside the African continent came on August 15 when global health officials confirmed an infection with a new strain of the mpox virus in Sweden.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In a discussion titled 'AI and tech: The new frontiers of disruption' at the NDTV World Summit, saw California-based EssentialAI co-founder Niki Parmar saying she is mulling returning to India and working on AI.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Saurabh Kumar Sahu, Managing Director &amp; Lead, India Business, Accenture said Artificial Intelligence, analytics and emerging technologies need to be a part of India's mainstream education to ensure initiatives in the field. "We have to look at what enables people to become inventors. Like computer science was part of the educational policy, AI needs to be a part of the education system too. Also, freedom of expression of experimentation and a sense that it is okay to fail is important," he said.</p>

<p>Quoting 'DPI to the power of AI', Dr Rohini Srivathsa,&nbsp;Chief Technology Officer, Microsoft India &amp; South Asia said AI will exponentially increase the impact of digital public infrastructure, which includes Aadhaar and UPI.</p>

<p>In a discussion titled 'AI and tech: The new frontiers of disruption', saw California-based EssentialAI co-founder Niki Parmar saying she is mulling returning to India and working on AI.&nbsp;"It is remarkable to see how we have pushed the frontier of this technology. Today we have AI, where a single model understands a lot of things about the world. In future, they will be learning from users itself and will help us with innovations and discoveries," she said.</p>

<p>Dr Srivathsa said AI, in every sector, will change the way customers are serviced, change the processes and even the way products are designed. However, sectors like healthcare and education will see AI doing things that were not possible earlier.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"For example, it is impossible for doctors to keep up with latest in any specialisation across the world. An AI assistant can look at such cases. In education, AI will make us celebrate diversity, because learning will no longer need anyone to know English," she said, calling AI a one-in-a-generation opportunity for inclusive and sustainable growth.</p>

<p>AI will enable anyone to become a domain expert in the future, Ms Parmar said, because the models will start learning from experts and provide easier learning.</p>

<p>The panel of experts worded a note of caution when it came to regulation of AI.&nbsp;"Like with any powerful technology, it is not clear what all things it can do. We ourselves cannot imagine the way people will use AI. So to have dialogue to understand what regulation and use of AI means would be ideal. Also, how do we align models to act in human's best interest?" Ms Parmar asked.</p>

<p>Accenture has a chief responsible AI officer, Mr Sahu said, adding that responsible AI is a necessity and not a choice. Ms Srivathsa added that security, privacy and safety are the three pillars of trusthworthy AI.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The war in Gaza has devastated the Palestinian economy, which is now 35% smaller than it was at the start of Israel's invasion a year ago, while development levels in Gaza itself have collapsed to the level of the 1950s, the UN's development agency said.</p>

<p>Launching a new study on the socioeconomic impacts of the war, which Palestinian officials say has claimed more than 42,500 lives, the UNDP's Chitose Noguchi said that by some measures the region's poverty level was now approaching 100% as a result of the disruption, with unemployment now at 80%.</p>

<p>"The state of Palestine is experiencing unprecedented levels of setbacks," she said over a crackling line from Deir Al-Balah.

       <description><![CDATA[At the NDTV World Summit 2024, Gagandeep Sethi, Senior Vice President of Integrated Operations and Sustainability & Responsibility at Pernod Ricard India, engaged in an insightful discussion on the ESG framework.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As India embarks on an ambitious journey towards becoming a $5 trillion economy, the emphasis on sustainable development has never been more crucial. The Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) framework has emerged as a vital guide for businesses, encouraging them to operate responsibly while addressing the pressing challenges of climate change, social equity and ethical governance.</p>

<p>At the NDTV World Summit 2024, Gagandeep Sethi, Senior Vice President of Integrated Operations and Sustainability &amp; Responsibility at Pernod Ricard India, underlined that the company operates under a comprehensive global ESG program, encapsulated under the umbrella theme "Good Times from a Good Place." This program is closely aligned with the UN Sustainability Development Goals, focusing on four core elements: nurturing the environment, promoting circular economy practices, valuing people and ensuring inclusivity.</p>

<p>Mr Sethi explained the starting point for the company was to ensure sustainability in operations. "Everything that we do, while consuming all these resources, we have to ensure we restore the balance of the earth," he said.</p>

<p>He noted the importance of circular economy principles in their production processes. "While we produce products, we do it sustainably, in terms of maintaining the circularity, end-to-end value chain."</p>

<p>Mr Sethi also highlighted the social aspects of ESG, particularly diversity and inclusion. "Diversity and inclusion is a big impetus, and we are fully committed in terms of increasing the inclusion of gender in our workforce."</p>

<p>He spoke about the cascading effects of these elements, including carbon neutrality and water management, claiming, "We are a water-consuming product, in terms of managing our water balance, and our water targets, many steps have been taken."</p>

<p>Asked how Pernod Ricard India was innovating its production processes to align with ESG goals, Mr Sethi said, "Innovations have to be embraced, and we see it as a cornerstone to attain our endeavours."</p>

<p>"It starts with design. We have aligned our entire renovation process, the stage gate in terms of the right decisions around ESG happens at the right time," he said.</p>

<p>He stressed the need for sustainability considerations during the product design phase. "Are we going for a product or a service which will address the sustainability part of our objectives?"</p>

<p>Mr Sethi also highlighted the importance of sustainable sourcing in their supply chain. "Our product is primarily ethanol, which can be sourced from various sources. Those smart choices using technical innovation around our fuel from fossil fuels to biomass which is more sustainable."</p>

<p>He explained how packaging choices contribute to sustainability. "The lower glass you use in your primary packaging, you are lowering the absolute value in energy consumption."</p>

<p>Sethi mentioned that Pernod Ricard's group target on scope 1 and 2 reduction was around 55 per cent, with India taking a leading role. "India is a huge consumption tool, and it has a huge impact on our group performance."</p>

<p>He added that advanced technologies, including AI, play a crucial role in optimising resource use. "So much of data is being produced. There has to be a layer which screens and makes info out of the data which can then be used to make some decisions, which is where AI comes in."</p>

<p>Mr Sethi discussed the challenges of building sustainability initiatives, noting that the initial steps in ESG are often profit-neutral. "The first few steps that we take in ESG are profit-neutral," he said.</p>

<p>He acknowledged difficulties related to new capital investments, saying, "When you are talking about capital investment capacities, but you have a design for sustainability, re-engineering is where larger sustainability investments would come in."</p>

<p>Calling for regulatory support to guide investments, he concluded, "Weekly jumps, I am not advocating that. Improve internally as much as you can. And when the point comes, regulatory support has to be there in terms of an investment standpoint so that we take the right direction."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For four days billionaire Elon Musk toured Pennsylvania, putting his money and fame into helping Republican Donald Trump's campaign to take back the White House in November.</p>

<p>Musk drew praise from conservatives at his rallies while fielding questions about artificial intelligence, government regulation, sentient robots and vaccines.</p>

<p>He also made a string of false claims about election fraud, some of them echoing those made by Trump the last four years.</p>

<p>The CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and owner of the X social media platform, Musk also handed out two $1 million checks to randomly picked people who signed his online petition backing US constitutional rights to freedom of speech and bear arms.</p>

<p>Musk, 53, has more than a passing interest in Trump's success. If reelected, Trump promises to make Musk head of a government efficiency commission, a job Musk vows will help rid the country of regulations he views as bad for the economy and a deterrent to doing business.</p>

<p><strong>CASH</strong></p>

<p>Musk shocked a crowd of roughly 1,500 at a nondenominational church in the Pennsylvania capital of Harrisburg on Saturday when he announced he was giving away $1 million. The first winner was John Dreher, who rushed to the stage in a signature red MAGA cap, pumping his arms in the air.</p>

<p>"I've been following you for 10 years, got your biography 10 years ago and been watching ever since," Dreher said to Musk.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Musk awarded another $1 million check to Kristine Fishell, who appeared stunned as her name was called and she took the stage in a red Trump T-shirt.</p>

<p>"Thank you so much for ... I mean I truly believe everything you're doing, truly. You don't need to be doing it, I know a lot of us feel the same way."</p>

<p>Musk said the winners are picked randomly but must have signed his petition and be registered voters in the battleground states that will decide November's election, such as Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona.</p>

<p>His handouts have stirred legal questions.</p>

<p><strong>CONSPIRACIES</strong></p>

<p>Musk has also embraced conspiracy theories pushed by Trump, and is spinning some of his own.</p>

<p>He revived false theories claiming that voting machines rig elections - an assertion that has been repeatedly debunked since it was pushed by those seeking to overturn Trump's 2020 loss.</p>

<p>He mentioned Dominion Voting Systems, which last year sued Fox News for defamation over false claims that the company engaged in a vote-rigging conspiracy. Dominion agreed to a landmark $787 million settlement with the network.</p>

<p>"There's always a sort of question of like, say, the Dominion voting machines. It is weird that the, you know, I think they're used in Philadelphia and in Maricopa County (Arizona), but not in a lot of other places."</p>

<p>In a statement, Dominion pointed to inaccuracies in Musk's comments, including the fact they don't operate in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Musk also accused Democrats of channeling vast numbers of migrants who enter the US illegally into battleground states.</p>

<p>Presenting no evidence, he alleged that Harris would legalize the migrants after the election if she wins, giving Democrats clear majorities in those states.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Similar claims have been debunked in the past.</p>

<p><strong>'POST THE EVIDENCE'</strong></p>

<p>For many at the events, the idea the 2020 election was stolen from Trump was taken as fact despite a lack of evidence.</p>

<p>One attendee in Harrisburg asked Musk what he was doing to prevent a recurrence. Musk responded by leaning into the unfounded allegations.</p>

<p>"I mean if the margin of victory is high enough, then I think it can exceed any sort of cheating that may take place. So we're going to aim for just a massive margin," Musk said.</p>

<p>He encouraged people to use his X platform, formerly known as Twitter, to shine a spotlight on potential election cheating.</p>

<p>"If people think there's a fraud, then they should post the images, post the videos, post the evidence," he said.</p>

<p><strong>SHARKS AND WHALES</strong></p>

<p>Musk has millions of dollars in government contracts and his companies face significant and at times costly government regulations which typically are designed to protect things like consumers, drinking water and wildlife.</p>

<p>Musk was asked if in such a job he would take a flamethrower to stacks of regulations and post a video of it. "I think a bonfire of nonsense regulations would be epic," Musk said.</p>

<p>Musk recounted how SpaceX was forced to conduct a study to determine whether his rockets would hurt sharks when landing in the water.</p>

<p>"I'm like, it's a big ocean, you know, there's a lot of sharks. It's not impossible, but it's very unlikely," Musk said.</p>

<p>Reluctantly, they conducted the study only to be told to do a similar review on potential threats to whales, Musk said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in Israel Tuesday to push for a ceasefire in Gaza after his administration called for an end to the war in Lebanon "as soon as possible".</p>

<p>It is his 11th trip to the Middle East since Hamas's attack on Israel more than a year ago triggered the Gaza war, and his first since Israel's conflict with Hezbollah escalated late last month.</p>

<p>He is due to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials, as Israel weighs its response to Iran's October 1 missile attack.</p>

<p>In Lebanon, Israel hit an area of south Beirut housing the country's largest public health facility, killing 13 people, according to the health ministry.</p>

<p>The Rafic Hariri Hospital, located outside Hezbollah's traditional strongholds, sustained minor damage in the strike which flattened four buildings in its vicinity, said an AFP correspondent in the area.</p>

<p>Previous US efforts to end the Gaza war and contain the regional fallout have failed, as did a bid spearheaded by President Joe Biden and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron to secure a temporary ceasefire in Lebanon.</p>

<p>After Israel, Blinken will visit Jordan on Wednesday and discuss humanitarian aid for the Gaza Strip, an official on the plane with him said.</p>

<p>Blinken also plans to speak to Israeli leaders about the expected strike on Iran and discourage any move that could massively escalate regional conflict, the official said.</p>

<p><strong>Night of strikes</strong></p>

<p>On Monday, US envoy to Lebanon Amos Hochstein said his administration was seeking an end to the war "as soon as possible" as he pushed for a ceasefire based on a UN resolution that had ended an earlier Israel-Hezbollah war.</p>

<p>Under resolution 1701, Hezbollah should have withdrawn from areas in south Lebanon near the Israeli border, leaving only the country's weak military and UN peacekeepers deployed there.</p>

<p>But Hezbollah remained south of Lebanon's Litani River, and in October last year began launching low-intensity cross-border strikes into Israel, in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas.</p>

<p>After nearly a year of war in Gaza, Israel shifted its focus to Lebanon, vowing to secure its northern border to allow tens of thousands of Israelis displaced by the cross-border fire to return to their homes.</p>

<p>Israel ramped up its air strikes on Hezbollah strongholds around the country and on September 30 sent in ground troops, in a war that has killed at least 1,489 people since September 23, according to an AFP tally of Lebanese health ministry figures.</p>

<p>The strike on Monday night came as Israel targeted Beirut's southern suburbs with heavy fire following evacuation warnings.</p>

<p>The densely populated Ouzai neighbourhood a few kilometres (miles) from the city centre was hit for the first time in the conflict, sparking an exodus of residents.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it was targeting Hezbollah's naval unit, and that it had issued an evacuation warning.</p>

<p>A Lebanese security official told AFP that the country's national airline had to switch landing strips after Israeli strikes near Beirut's only international airport hit close to the main runway.</p>

<p>Hezbollah on Tuesday said it launched rockets targeting two positions in the suburbs of Israel's commercial hub Tel Aviv, including an intelligence base.</p>

<p>It also said it targeted Israel's "Stella Maris naval base" near the northern city of Haifa, and that its operators had clashed with Israeli troops near a village at the border.</p>

<p>In a war-hit area along the Lebanese border, AFP footage showed huge clouds of smoke rising following Israeli strikes on the village of Khiam, as trails of smoke from Hezbollah rockets fired towards Israel could also be seen.</p>

<p>The wars in Gaza and Lebanon have also drawn in other Iran-aligned armed groups, including in Yemen, Syria and Iraq.</p>

<p>Iran on Tuesday said it had received assurances from its neighbours that they would not allow the use of their airspace for any attack against it, after Israel pledged to hit back against its October 1 missile attack.</p>

<p><strong>'We will die of hunger'</strong></p>

<p>In the Gaza Strip, Israel launched a major air and ground assault in northern Gaza earlier this month, vowing to stop Hamas terrorists from regrouping in the area.</p>

<p>Gaza's civil defence agency said four Palestinians were killed in strikes on Monday, while several homes were blown up in the northern area of Jabalia, a focal point of the recent fighting.</p>

<p>A displaced resident said Jabalia "is being wiped out".</p>

<p>"If we don't die from the bombing and gunfire, we will die of hunger," said 42-year-old Umm Firas Shamiyah, demanding aid be sent to the north.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of people are estimated to have fled the assault on northern Gaza, and according to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees around 400,000 people were trapped in the area last week.</p>

<p>The UN has warned of the risk of famine in Gaza, its figures showing that 396 aid trucks have entered the territory so far this month -- far below the 3,003 seen in September.</p>

<p>The war was sparked by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7 last year, which resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Israel's offensive in Gaza has killed 42,718 people, a majority civilians, according to data from the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, figures the UN considers reliable.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sudhakar Adapa, founder and CEO of BIA Brands, explained the difference between e-commerce and quick commerce and how quick commerce will have to be 'not so quick' to become sustainable. "E-commerce is thriving these days while quick commerce or q commerce is probably the new version of e-commerce. The fundamentals of business are going to be the same, it's just about how we are going to deliver, that is going to change," Mr Adapa said at the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ndtv-world-summit-2024-live-updates-indias-g20-sherpa-amitabh-kant-british-envoy-lindy-cameron-to-speak-on-day-2-6843569">NDTV World Summit 2024.</a></p>

<p>He also said the definition of quick will have to change for the model to be sustainable.</p>

<p>"Is quick commerce going to be a sustainable thing? I would say yes and no. Yes, because it will be another kind of commerce which will survive but I think the definition of quick will change. Right now the consumer wants everything to be delivered in under 10 minutes and if you say 20 minutes, the consumer will say I can't wait for 10 more minutes. India has a huge population density which is why it is one of the few countries where quick commerce worked. But, I think the definition of quick will change from 10 minutes to 60 minutes because not everything can be delivered in 10 minutes time. If this model has to be sustainable it will become not-so-quick commerce," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Adapa said that in today's day and age social media has become a potent weapon for brands: "The use of social media is across all the sectors. As brands, if we have to survive then social media has become a potent weapon and the advantage of private labels is such that it is actually giving space to smaller brands to compete with Unilever and P&amp;Gs of the world. For example, if I had to launch a cosmetics brand 10 years ago, you need to own a brand, you need to formulate yourself, you need to have a manufacturing plant, a quality control department, you need to control R&amp;D, the whole ecosystem has huge costs and it's not feasible for a small entrepreneur to launch a company. Now today if you want to launch a beauty brand, all you need to do is maybe go to a contract manufacturer, make some sampling, get some 1,000 pieces up, put it up online and boom you have a brand. It has become so easy these days."</p>

<p>He, however, also stressed that "everything has its own advantages and disadvantages".</p>

<p>"The advantage is that you could pull your company with no capital, if you have a great product, you could build a company with almost next to nothing. The flip side is the kind of competition is there in the market. Differentiation has become really difficult for us. But the good thing is that the customers are spoilt for choice. they have great products and great prices there. Customers are making merry at the time, enjoying the great discounts," Mr Adapa said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After travelling 550 kilometres across the North Sea, 12-year-old Grace Liddle of Sunderland, UK, was thrilled to learn that her message in a bottle had been found in Sweden, according to <em>The Metro</em>. A Swedish man named Freddy Stahlberg discovered the bottle nearly a year after it was thrown into the ocean in August of last year.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/10/21/young-girl-delighted-learning-message-a-bottle-found-1-500-miles-away-21836104/">bottle belonging to Grace's brother Harry</a> was discovered in Denmark several months earlier. Before sending the bottles from Roker Pier, both siblings had inscribed their names and contact details, making the long-distance journey thrilling.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/science/human-evolution-unfolding-before-us-in-the-high-altitudes-of-tibetan-plateau-6847024#pfrom=home-ndtv_lateststories"><strong>Also Read | Human Evolution Unfolding Before Us In The High Altitudes Of Tibetan Plateau</strong></a></p>

<p>On August 3, Christie received a Facebook message from Freddy, who had found Grace's bottle on Pinno Island, 90 miles north of Gothenburg, Sweden. The bottle had traveled 550 miles. Freddy, living in Grebbestad during summer, discovered the damaged note on August 2 and contacted Christie.</p>

<p>"Our family tried our best to find words that were useful, and we were finally able to identify Christie's name, a hint that she had a Facebook address, as well as the word Sunderland," he told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/10/21/young-girl-delighted-learning-message-a-bottle-found-1-500-miles-away-21836104/"><em>The Metro.</em></a></p>

<p>"With her name, I found her Facebook page, and looking at the images there I could deduce that she lived in Sunderland, which was mentioned in the message in the bottle. With this information at hand, I dared to send a message to Christie. She replied some time later and we were all very enthusiastic about having solved the riddle."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Glasgow has been confirmed as the host city for the troubled 2026 Commonwealth Games, which will be a slimmed-down version of the multi-sport event.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Glasgow has been confirmed as the host city for the troubled 2026 Commonwealth Games, which will be a slimmed-down version of the multi-sport event.</p>

<p>The future of the 2026 Games was thrown into doubt when the Australian state of Victoria, the original hosts, withdrew last year, citing rising costs.</p>

<p>But the Scottish government effectively gave the green light to Glasgow last month and the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) announced on Tuesday that the 2014 hosts will stage the next Games, from July 23 to August 2, 2026.</p>

<p>The Games will feature just 10 sports compared with the 19 on show at the 2022 edition in the English city of Birmingham.</p>

<p>Para sport will once again be fully integrated as "a key priority and point of difference for the Games", with six para sports included on the programme.</p>

<p>The schedule will feature athletics and para athletics, swimming and para swimming, artistic gymnastics, track cycling and para track cycling, netball, weightlifting and para powerlifting, boxing, judo, bowls and para bowls, as well as 3x3 basketball and 3x3 wheelchair basketball.</p>

<p>Among the sports missing out compared to the 2022 Games are triathlon, diving, hockey, T20 cricket, squash, badminton and rugby sevens.</p>

<p>Around 3,000 athletes are expected to compete from up to 74 Commonwealth nations and territories.</p>

<p>The CGF said Glasgow 2026 would deliver more than £100 million ($130 million) of inward investment into the city.</p>

<p>"On behalf of the entire Commonwealth sport movement, we are delighted to officially confirm that the 2026 Commonwealth Games will take place in the host city of Glasgow," said CGF chief executive Katie Sadleir.</p>

<p>Britain and Australia have staged five of the past six editions between them but Sadleir believes a slimmed-down model will increase the potential pool of future hosts.</p>

<p>"The 2026 Games will be a bridge to the Commonwealth Games of tomorrow," said Sadleir.</p>

<p>"An exciting first step in our journey to reset and redefine the Games as a truly collaborative, flexible and sustainable model for the future that minimises costs, reduces the environmental footprint, and enhances social impact -- in doing so increasing the scope of countries capable of hosting."</p>

<p>Commonwealth Games Scotland chairman Ian Reid said it had not been easy to decide which sports to include.</p>

<p>"I think everybody recognises that these events need to be more affordable, lighter and we would have loved to have all of our sports and all of our athletes competing but unfortunately it's just not deliverable or affordable for this timeframe," he told the BBC.</p>

<p>But he said the programme could vary for future Games and may increase in size depending on venues.</p>

<p>The CGF said there would be no need for public funding to deliver the Glasgow Games, with Australia providing part of the costs after Victoria's withdrawal.</p>

<p>Victoria pulled out after citing a projected cost of more than A$6 billion ($4 billion).</p>

<p>The Commonwealth Games, held every four years, evolved out of the British Empire Games and is still made up mainly of countries and territories once subject to British imperial rule.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman in her 20s spent seven hours hanging upside-down by her feet before being rescued after falling head-first into a deep crevice between two boulders in regional NSW. She had been attempting to retrieve her dropped phone when the incident occurred on October 12 in the Hunter Valley, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://7news.com.au/news/woman-trapped-upside-down-between-boulders-while-trying-to-retrieve-phone-in-hunter-valley-c-16480916" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>7 News </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>NSW Ambulance paramedics, along with a multi-disciplinary rescue team, had to use a specialist winch to move heavy boulders, including one weighing 500kg, in order to reach her. After creating a stable access point, the team carefully navigated the woman out of the crevice, a process that took an hour.</p>

<p>Rescue paramedic Peter Watts, who had never encountered such a situation in his 10 years of service, described the experience as challenging but rewarding.</p>

<p>"In my 10 years as a rescue paramedic, I had never encountered a job quite like this," specialist rescue paramedic Peter Watts told 7 News.</p>

The woman's friends had initially tried to free her but were unsuccessful, prompting them to find phone reception to call for help. By the time rescuers arrived, she had already been stuck for over an hour.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Despite spending seven hours trapped upside-down, the woman escaped with only minor scratches and bruises. Unfortunately, her phone could not be recovered. NSW Ambulance praised the teamwork involved in the complex and successful rescue.</p>

<p>"Every agency had a role, and we all worked incredibly well together to achieve a good outcome for the patient," Watts said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid the war in Gaza, a heartbreaking video of a girl carrying her injured younger sister through the streets in search of medical care has surfaced. The girl, visibly exhausted, was asked where she was headed. "I want to get her leg treated," she replied. Asked why she had been walking, she said, Because we don't have a car." The child adds that she was trying to reach Al-Bureij Park to find a healthcare facility where her sister may get treated.</p>

<p>"I can't walk anymore," the girl says in the video. The person filming her helped and the two girls were given a ride to their destination.</p>

<p>During the car ride, the man asked the younger sister, "Do you love your sister because she was carrying you?" She nodded. On reaching the medical centre, the older sister carried her sibling again.</p>

<p>The video was shared on X, with the caption, "A Palestinian little girl was found walking and carrying her little sister to take her to the hospital for treatment. End the genocide. End the occupation."</p>

<p>The war in Gaza has claimed over 40,000 lives and orphaned hundreds of children. With their parents gone, many children have been forced to look after their younger siblings in a conflict zone. The war followed the October 7 attacks on Israeli cities. The attack drew a brutal counterstrike by the Benjamin Netanyahu government as it relentlessly bombed the Gaza Strip. According to the latest estimates of the Palestinian Health Ministry, around 17,000 children have died in the ongoing conflict.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[A new study by Cynthia Beall of Case Western Reserve University reveals how Tibetan communities have evolved over 10,000 years to thrive in the low-oxygen environment of the Tibetan Plateau.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In order to survive in the low oxygen conditions of the Tibetan Plateau, people living there have evolved special adaptations over the course of more than 10,000 years, according to a new study. The Tibetan communities have adapted to survive and flourish in spite of the thinner air, which contrasts with most people who would suffer from hypoxia. This illustrates how humans continue to evolve in response to challenging living situations.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is clarified by the research conducted by Cynthia Beall, a University Professor Emerita at Case Western Reserve University. The study, which was published on October 21 in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2403309121"><em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)</em></a>, shows how the physiological characteristics of Tibetan women enhance their capacity to procreate in an oxygen-poor environment.</p>

<p>"Adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia is fascinating because the stress is severe, experienced equally by everyone at a given altitude, and quantifiable," anthropologist Cynthia Beall of Case Western Reserve University in the US told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-are-evolving-right-before-our-eyes-on-the-tibetan-plateau"><em>ScienceAlert.</em></a>&nbsp;"It is a beautiful example of how and why our species has so much biological variation."</p>

<p>When comparing the pregnancy-related biology of Tibetan women with that of migrants to high altitudes, Tibetan women have lower hemoglobin concentration, higher oxygen saturation of hemoglobin and uterine artery blood flow, and heavier newborns. Among Tibetan women who have completed childbearing, unelevated hemoglobin concentration, higher oxygen saturation, and a higher pulse rate correlate with higher lifetime reproductive success. This pattern of human variation suggests the action of natural selection on oxygen delivery phenotypes.</p>

<p>"Previously we knew that lower hemoglobin was beneficial, now we understand that an intermediate value has the highest benefit. We knew that higher oxygen saturation of hemoglobin was beneficial, now we understand that the higher the saturation the more beneficial. The number of live births quantifies the benefits," Beall said.</p>

<p>"It was unexpected to find that women can have many live births with low values of some oxygen transport traits if they have favorable values of other oxygen transport traits."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine's population has declined by more than 10 million since Russia invaded in February 2022, sparking an exodus and sending birth rates plunging, the United Nations said Tuesday.</p>

<p>The UN Population Fund said there had not been a census, but that there clearly had been a dramatic population decline in war-torn Ukraine.</p>

<p>"The Ukraine population has declined by over 10 million since the beginning of the war," UNFPA's regional director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia Florence Bauer told reporters in Geneva.</p>

<p>She stressed that the decline had been seen "since the beginning of the full-scale invasion", and was due to "a combination of factors".</p>

<p>Already before the war, Ukraine had one of the lowest birth rates in Europe, and like many countries in Eastern Europe, it had seen a declining population, as young people left in search of more opportunities, Bauer said.</p>

<p>But since the war, some 6.7 million people fled the country as refugees while the birth rate fell to just around one child per woman, she said.</p>

<p>"That's one of the lowest in the world," she said, stressing that this was well below the theoretical replacement rate of 2.1 children that each woman on average must have to maintain the population size.</p>

<p>At the same time, she said, there are the "several tens of thousands of casualties (from the war), which of course add to the equation".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[At the NDTV World Summit, the conversation on women's inclusion in India's energy, logistics, and entrepreneurial sectors took centre stage with a sharp focus on the "3As" - Access, Ambition, and Attainment - as key drivers.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://special.ndtv.com/ndtv-world-summit-2024-167/#pfrom=home-ndtvworld_world%20site">NDTV World Summit</a>, the conversation on women's inclusion in India's energy, logistics, and entrepreneurial sectors took centre stage with a sharp focus on the "3As" - Access, Ambition, and Attainment - as key drivers for advancing women in leadership roles.</p>

<p>Preeti Bajaj, CEO &amp; MD of Luminous Power Technologies, talked about the tangible impact of increasing women's representation at the leadership level. "At Luminous Power Technologies, the senior leadership team constitutes 33 per cent women, really making a difference, all day, every day," she said, before detailing the "3As" framework.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Besides Preeti Bajaj, business leaders and entrepreneurs, including Kami Viswanathan (President, Middle East, Indian Subcontinent, and Africa at FedEx), and Padmaja Ruparel (Co-founder, IAN Group), discussed how women are not only breaking barriers but also setting new standards in leadership, innovation, and inclusivity.</p>

<p>Despite India's entrepreneurial boom, the growth of women entrepreneurs remains alarmingly low. Speaking on the subject, Padmaja Ruparel said, "In 2022, only 14.7 per cent of the funding went to women. In 2023, it dropped to a mere 9.7 per cent."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Ruparel called for stronger financial backing of women-led ventures, stating, "We need to create the BlackRock of India led by a woman. That, to me, is what will drive entrepreneurship."</p>

<p>Kami Viswanathan of FedEx said that 36 per cent of the company's board and 26 per cent of management globally are women.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We recently added the opportunity to DEI to rededicate ourselves to inclusive hiring, promotions, and supporting career paths," she said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>'Unicorn' is a term coined by a US American venture capitalist in the American context and India would do better by celebrating 'Indicorns', or enduring Indian businesses built as startups on the back of real revenues and profits, entrepreneur and investor Kunal Bahl has said.</p>

<p>In a wide-ranging conversation during the NDTV World Summit on Tuesday, the Snapdeal and Titan Capital co-founder also praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi's contributions to the startup ecosystem and recalled an anecdote about Ratan Tata which, he said, reflected the greatness of the titan of Indian industry.</p>

<p>On 'Indicorns', a term which was coined by him, Mr Bahl said, "We have been celebrating unicorns for many years. This term was invented by a venture capitalist in the US, in the context of the US, where companies over $1 billion are called unicorns, named after a mythical figure. Having built a unicorn, funded many companies which became unicorns, I asked why we are celebrating these when what our country needs right now is lasting enduring businesses where startups are built off the back of real revenues and real profits."</p>

<p>The entrepreneur said the ecosystem was too small for companies to become profitable relatively quickly even 10 years ago, but that has changed now. India, he said, has gone from 100 million internet users to over a billion and income levels have also gone up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We are seeing companies who want to be profitable doing so in two to three years from the starting point. So, why is there an obsession with a currency that is not ours? An amount which is irrelevant in our context - why Rs 8,300 crores, because that is what a billion dollars is?" Mr Bahl said.</p>

<p>"Isn't it better we build businesses with the intention of making them lasting and enduring and aim for goals which enable us to get there - like a Rs 100-crore revenue business, which is profitable, because the moment a company gets 100 crore in revenue and is profit-making, it is very likely it is not going to go out of business and will keep going from strength to strength," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Bahl argued that rather than India having 300 or 500 unicorns, it is probably better to have 10,000 'Indicorns' which can serve as the bedrock of the startup ecosystem and go on to become large, listed companies.</p>

<p><strong>Changing Times</strong></p>

<p>The investor said startups were not known when he began his journey in 2007 and Prime Minister Modi has left an "indelible mark" on the startup ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"When I started my startup journey in 2007, I was 23 years. There was nothing known as a startup. The word came into the national parlance only around 2015, when the 'Startup India' initiative was evangelised and launched by the honourable Prime Minister. And, because of that, startups gained legitimacy and recognition," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Suddenly, parents in small towns were not aghast when their 23-year-old child, who went to IIT after a lot of struggle by the parents, said he will not join McKenzie or Goldman Sachs or Microsoft or Google, and start something, making zero money for the next few years and likely be in debt during that period. And that contribution, I think, significantly goes to the Prime Minister and, obviously, the role models that have now become available to the younger generation of founders," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>'Enduring Legacy'</strong></p>

<p>Praising Ratan Tata, the late chairman emeritus of the Tata Group, who died earlier this month, Mr Bahl said he left behind an enduring legacy of contributions and wisdom.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The entrepreneur also shared an anecdote about meeting Mr Tata in 2014 and the fact that he remembered a promise made in passing even several years later.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"When I met him for the first time in 2014, I was in his office in South Bombay and after we had a short discussion about our business, he said, 'I would really love to invest if you will have me'. So, that was his humility, he did not assume that I would take his investment just because he was Ratan Tata. Of course I would take it, but he never assumed that. As the meeting was ending, he asked me if I had any other question, and I said I would love for him to come and meet our team at some point because it would change their life. He said okay," Mr Bahl recalled.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Around three years ago, I met him at a wedding. I went up and introduced myself and he said 'Of course I remember and, by the way, I still owe you that trip'. So that was the greatness of Mr Tata. Imagine the tens of thousands of people he would have met over the years. He still remembered the promise that he made to me in passing in 2014. And I think that is such an enduring lesson for everyone," he added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mutual funds remain the most attractive investment tool for retail investors and a lot of innovation is happening in this area, said Groww co-founder and CEO Lalit Keshre at the NDTV World Summit on Tuesday. Mr Keshre, who started Groww in 2016 with three other co-founders, spoke about the tremendous rise in retail investing in India and what led to this significant increase in investors' trust, during a fireside chat on Day 2 of the summit.</p>

<h2><strong>Growth in equity investments</strong></h2>

<p>Mr Keshre credited internet connectivity, and the introduction of Aadhaar and UPI for lowering the barriers to accessing the investment platforms, followed by platforms that made it easy and transparent.</p>

<p>"Earlier, investing was limited to cities like Mumbai and Bangalore, some cities of Gujarat. Now a lot of customers are from smaller cities because a lot of information that was missing is now available to everybody at their fingertips. That's a big fundamental change that has happened. The long-term trend started in 2015-16 and we were lucky to start at the same time," he said.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world"><strong>NDTV World Summit: Live Coverage</strong></a></p>

<h2><strong>Homecoming</strong></h2>

<p>Groww was started in 2016 and recently moved its headquarters to India from the US. On whether this will increase its tax liabilities, Mr Keshre said, "That's a price you pay. But in the long term, I think it would be very good for us."</p>

<p>"Groww is an Indian company. Customers and management are in India and all operations are in India. So, it did not make sense to be outside India. We are a YC company, so we had to register in the US but now there is no there is no reason why we shouldn't be in India," he said. A "YC company" refers to a firm that has been through the Y-Combinator startup accelerator program.</p>

<h2><strong>IPO soon?</strong></h2>

<p>Mr Keshre did not divulge if Groww is planning to go public anytime soon. Asked when the discount broker could be offering its IPO, he said, "Maybe in some time. It's somewhere down the line, but we don't know when."</p>

<h2><strong>Next phase of growth</strong></h2>

<p>Mr Keshre said it's hard to predict what will be the next big phase of growth and that mutual funds remain the most beautiful product for retail investors. "A lot of innovation is going to happen there as well," he added.</p>

<h2><strong>Retail investors and F&amp;O</strong></h2>

<p>Asked about regulatory concerns and if he thinks retail investors need to be protected from derivatives trading, he said, "There are certain things where customer protection is very important. From that perspective, I think we are in the right direction."</p>

<h2><strong>Next big innovation</strong></h2>

<p>Asked if Groww is working on its next big innovation, he said the company functions more like an innovation factory than focusing on one big idea. "It's very boring under the hood, but what comes out is much more exciting for the customers," he added.</p>

<h2><strong>What fintech world needs</strong></h2>

<p>Mr Keshre said the fintech industry needs a lot of investment for infrastructure development as it is very complicated. "We've almost 400 engineers working on just kind of getting things perfect because it's about customers' hard-earned money. Reliability becomes the number one promise in the roadmap and rest everything is secondary," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Climate change is a global challenge and it must be seen as a common issue for the entire planet to work together on, but it is increasingly caught in the web of whose responsibility it is - the developed world or the developing world, including the Global South. The other challenge being faced is the sharing of technology and financing the shift from fossil fuels to environment-friendly methods.</p>

<p>Speaking at the NDTV World Summit, Harjeet Singh, Global Engagement Director, Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, highlighted the trust deficit towards the developed world and their responsibility, or lack of it, that needs to be addressed on priority.</p>

<p>"The trust deficit is because of a reason," he said, elucidating that "When we see as India and other developing nations face tremendous pressure to move away from fossil fuels, and we must, but the reality is that there are sill millions who do not have access to energy in the developing world and need support, but in comparison, the developed world continue to increase its fossil fuel consumption."</p>

<p>"When you look at the global fossil fuel expansion, you see Australia, Canada, Norway, the UK, and the US put together are responsible for more than 50 per cent of the planet's fossil fuel expansion between now and 2050 - that is where the trust deficit stems from," he further said, adding that on top of it all, "they are not willing to share technology or help with finance."</p>

<p>Though he welcomed the new UK government's decision to stop issuing any more new licences for fossil fuel plants, he highlighted that the licences already issued in the last few years will have a tremendously negative impact on the climate over the next many decades. "The trust deficit is a real issue that needs to be dealt with as the developed nations have not acted based on their historical responsibility and contribute their fair share to the climate challenge, but continue to pressure developing countries to do more, that too without assisting with technology or finance."</p>

<p>Adding to this, another panelist, Shishir Priyadarshi, who is President of the Chintan Research Foundation said, "From the way the trade agenda was set in 1995 at the WTO, there are lots of lessons to be taken while working on the climate agenda. Why the setting up of the WTO led to a huge trade deficit was because of 2 reasons - One, the developed world made huge promises to the developing world if they simply lowered tariffs and opened up markets, and Second was that the developed world said 'we know' and 'we will tell you how it's done and what you need to do', and that is something that led to a huge deficit of trust. That is something that we must avoid while setting the climate agenda"</p>

<h2><strong>DEVELOPING COUNTRY DOING FAR MORE FOR CLIMATE CHANGE</strong></h2>

<p>Mr Priyadarchi highlighted how "The developing nations have done, and are doing far more to address climate change."</p>

<p>Citing India's example he said, "India has committed $2.5 trillion in investment towards climate funding between 2015 and 2030 - that's huge," he said, adding that "We (developing nations like India) are prepared to drive down the highway towards zero emissions, and we are absolutely with you (the developed world), but we will do it at our speed. You cannot tell us the speed with which changes need to be made or tell us that these are the restricted number of pitstops on the way. We will surely reach there, but we need the flexibility and support." If this is done, then it will bring down the "trust deficit" cinsiderably.</p>

<p>Giving a perspective from the developed nations, British High Commissioner to India Lindy Cameron said "Our foreign secretary had said recently that he had heard that developing countries believed the system didn't work for them. I understand that it is important we recognize that, but what we must recognize is that we all live on the same planet, and one must recognize that we in the UK have set ambitious targets like net-zero emissions by 2050."</p>

<p>She also said that "After 6 months in India, I do believe that India is the place where this (climate action) is going to happen. This is the place as this is the country that matters most for the future of the planet and for climate change, because India's ambition for development should not in any way be constrained by the responsibilities of the planet."</p>

<p>She further said that "We are committed to reforms like making more affordable finance available for developing countries. And we are also working here in India on technology and research to ensure that we can support those incredibly ambitious goals India has set."</p>

<p>The fourth panelist, Erik Solheim, Former Minister of Climate and the Environment of Norway, lauded China and India for their tremendous achievement in terms of climate action targets. Speaking at the NDTV World Summit he said, "Nobody should blame India or the developing world, especially when nations like the US where per capita emissions are 25 times that of India. The state of Gujarat alone has set the target of 100 Gigawatt of clean energy by 2030. This is enormous. It is as big as 20 times the entire energy grid of Nigeria - the biggest nation in Africa."</p>

<p>He further said that "Forget all of India and what all the rest of the country is doing, but if you see just the state of Gujarat...if it were a nation, it would be the 8th largest in terms of green energy."</p>

<p>He also had big praise for China, saying "China accounts for 60% of all green energy today and the rest of the world is the other 40%. India is second only to China."</p>

<p>He also lauded Indonesia which he said has "brought deforestation down to zero, and made it the biggest rain forest nation in the world".</p>

<p>"If ten years ago someone asked me where one needs to go to see climate progress, I would have said please go to Brussels or Berlin or Geneva or Paris, but today I would say go see what a Beijing, Delhi or Jakarta are doing," he concluded.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's&nbsp;neighbours&nbsp;have pledged they will not&nbsp;allow&nbsp;the&nbsp;use&nbsp;of&nbsp;their&nbsp;"soil&nbsp;or&nbsp;airspace"&nbsp;for&nbsp;any&nbsp;attack,&nbsp;Iranian&nbsp;Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Tuesday, as Israel weighs a retaliation&nbsp;for&nbsp;the Islamic Republic's missile strike.</p>

<p>"All our&nbsp;neighbours&nbsp;have assured us that they&nbsp;won't&nbsp;allow&nbsp;their&nbsp;soil&nbsp;or&nbsp;airspace&nbsp;to be&nbsp;used against the Islamic Republic&nbsp;of&nbsp;Iran," Araghchi told a press conference in Kuwait, weeks after&nbsp;Iran's October 1 missile&nbsp;attack&nbsp;on Israel.</p>

<p>Before Kuwait, Araghchi was in Bahrain on Monday as part&nbsp;of&nbsp;a regional tour that has also taken him to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Iraq, Egypt and Turkey.</p>

<p>"We are monitoring closely the movements&nbsp;of&nbsp;American bases in the region and are aware&nbsp;of&nbsp;all&nbsp;their&nbsp;movements and flights," Araghchi said, adding: "If Israel&nbsp;attacks&nbsp;Iran&nbsp;in any&nbsp;form,&nbsp;Iran&nbsp;will respond in the same&nbsp;format."</p>

<p>The United States, Israel's staunch ally, has military resources across the region including in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.</p>

<p>Araghchi also repeated&nbsp;Iran's warnings against Israel not to&nbsp;attack&nbsp;its nuclear facilities.</p>

<p>"Attacking nuclear sites is a big international crime; even threatening (to&nbsp;attack) nuclear sites is a crime and against international rights," he said.</p>

<p>"To defend ourselves and our nuclear sites, we have our own tools and methods, and we count on them," the minister added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

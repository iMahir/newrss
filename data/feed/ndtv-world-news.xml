       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday said that the world was "a little crazy" as he met President Emmanuel Macron in Paris ahead of the re-opening of Notre Dame cathedral on his first international trip since his re-election.</p>

<p>The two men embraced and shook hands several times on the steps of the French presidential palace, with Trump given a full guard of honour.</p>

<p>"It seems like the world is going a little crazy right now and we will be talking about that," Trump told reporters as he prepared to sit down for talks with Macron which started around 45 minutes later than scheduled.</p>

<p>Despite tensions between the two men during his first term, Trump hailed his ties with the centrist French leader, saying: "We had a great relationship as everyone knows. We accomplished a lot."</p>

<p>Macron told Trump it was "a great honour for French people to welcome you" for the re-opening ceremony at Notre Dame, which was devastated by a blaze in 2019 during Trump's first term.</p>

<p>"You were president at that time and I remember the solidarity and the immediate reaction," Macron added, speaking in English.</p>

<p>When he first took office in 2017, Trump's ties with Macron -- then also a fresh face on the world stage -- began warmly despite their obvious political differences.</p>

<p>Their long and muscular handshakes -- which saw each man seek to assert his superiority -- became a light-hearted focus of attention before ties cooled, then soured, following disputes about climate change, trade and defence.</p>

<p>They are expected to discuss the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as trade.</p>

<p>Trump's return to power has rung alarms in Paris and many European capitals after his promises on the campaign trail to force an end to fighting in Ukraine which could see US military assistance to Kyiv withheld.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was expected at the French presidential palace shortly after Trump and he is set to hold three-way discussions with Macron, an aide to Macron told AFP on condition of anonymity.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 13 years since Bashar al-Assad's security forces opened fire on protesters demanding democratic reforms, the Syrian president's grip on power may finally be weakening.</p>

<p>The 59-year-old son and heir of late dictator Hafez al-Assad has faced several setbacks during the long civil war triggered by his brutal crackdown in March 2011, but has so far managed to cling on to power.</p>

<p>Now, with his Lebanese ally Hezbollah reeling from an Israeli onslaught and his great power backer Russia distracted by its invasion of Ukraine, Assad is running short of friends on the battlefield.</p>

<p>Key cities in the north, including Aleppo and Hama have fallen to opposition fighters in just a matter of days.</p>

<p>And on Saturday the rebels said they are now encircling the capital where Assad has ruled since the death of his father in 2000.</p>

<p>Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has welcomed the rebel advance; Israel is reinforcing its forces in the occupied Golan; and Syria's southern neighbour Jordan is organising an evacuation of its citizens.</p>

<p>In a further sign of Assad's isolation, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) group, which controls much of northeast Syria, said it was ready to speak to its foes among the Turkish-backed rebels.</p>

<p>But international observers have repeatedly predicted the isolated former ophthalmologist's fall since the earliest months of the uprising, and they have repeatedly been incorrect.</p>

<p>The 2011 protests against Assad's rule began after a teenager was arrested for allegedly scrawling anti-government graffiti in the southern town of Daraa.</p>

<p>Stunning advance</p>

<p>Now, for Assad's rule, the "writing is on the wall", Joshua Landis, of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma told AFP. "Things are folding very quickly."</p>

<p>The rebel advance has been stunning.</p>

<p>After Aleppo and Hama fell in quick succession, the rebels and government forces were clashing Saturday near the major city of Homs.</p>

<p>Its capture would effectively cut Assad's capital off from his support base in the Alawite minority community in the coastal highlands.</p>

<p>"The Alawite minority has lost faith in Assad," Landis said. "There are serious questions about whether the Syrian army has any fight left."</p>

<p>But some caution is merited. After all, haven't world leaders underestimated Assad before?</p>

<p>As early as November 2011, Turkey's Erdogan urged Assad to hold free elections and warned that his "office is only temporary".</p>

<p>In October 2012, during a re-election campaign debate, US president Barack Obama also warned Assad that his "days are numbered".</p>

<p>The next month, Nabil Elaraby, then the head of the Arab League, declared "everyone knows that the regime in Syria will not remain for long".</p>

<p>The Syrian strongman defied them all, even as international lawyers drew up arrest warrants for war crimes and rights groups denounced Syria's use of chemical weapons and aerial bombardment in civilian areas.</p>

<p>As the civil war spiralled into overlapping regional conflicts -- government versus rebels, Turkey versus Kurdish fighters, US-backed militias against Islamic State group jihadists -- Assad retained his grip.</p>

<p>At first he was ostracised by many fellow Arab leaders, leaning instead on Iranian and Russian support, but as it became clear he was not leaving the stage diplomatic ties quietly resumed.</p>

<p><strong>Rebel victories</strong></p>

<p>And meanwhile, Russia and Iran had Assad's back. Lebanon's pro-Iran Hezbollah sent thousands of fighters, backed by Iranian advisers, to bolster Syrian government forces. Russia carried out air strikes.</p>

<p>But the speed of this week's rebel victories seems to suggest that without his powerful foreign friends, Assad's Syrian army is a hollow shell.</p>

<p>Russia has such little confidence in its ally that its embassy has acknowledged a "difficult military and political situation".</p>

<p>Before the recent ceasefire in its conflict with Israel, Hezbollah lost thousands of fighters and weapons and its long-standing chief Hassan Nasrallah.</p>

<p>It appears to be in no position to help, despite a Hezbollah source saying Saturday it had sent 2,000 fighters into Syria's Qusayr area "to defend its positions".</p>

<p>"The Assad government is in its most precarious position since the summer of 2012," Nick Heras, an analyst at the New Lines Institute, told AFP.</p>

<p>"There is a real risk that the Assad government could lose power in Damascus, either through battles or through a negotiated retreat.</p>

<p>"Ultimately, the Assad government's ability to survive will depend on the extent to which Iran and Russia see Assad as useful to their strategies in the region."</p>

<p>Heras said that Russia, which has a naval base in the Syrian port of Tartus, would be loath to withdraw its military personnel and assets from the country, and Iran would be similarly reluctant to abandon Assad.</p>

<p>"If either or both of those allies decide they can advance their interests without Assad, then his days in power are numbered," Heras said.</p>

<p>The winners would be Assad's main regional opponents: Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Turkey's Erdogan, who both faced periods of intense domestic criticism only to emerge victorious in war.</p>

<p>Turkey-backed rebels are now spearheading the opposition advance on Homs, and Israeli air strikes against Hezbollah and Iranian targets in Syria have effectively neutralised Assad's most potent backer.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lawyer in the United States allegedly shot his 20-year-old son, burnt his body and then called the cops to tell them what he claimed was a "horrible accident". According to the <em>People</em>, 68-year-old Michael Howard from Houston, Texas,&nbsp;was arrested on Monday and charged with murder and tampering with evidence. His son, Mark Howard, was diagnosed with Down syndrome and held a job. The father allegedly told the cops that he had "mistaken" his son "for an intruder at his property" and shot him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sabine County investigator JP MacDonough said that the 68-year-old showed officers around his property when they arrived at the scene, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://people.com/lawyer-kills-son-burns-body-before-claiming-accident-say-police-8757525" rel="noindex,nofollow">outlet </a>reported. He provided them with the shotgun he allegedly used to shoot his son before leading them to the wood pile where the 20-year-old's burned body was.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Michael Howard "had taken the body of the deceased, placed it in the front loading bucket of a backhoe tractor, and carried it to a remote area on his property and placed the body on a pile of wood and other burnable material, which had been previously set up and then, his words, 'cremated' his son in accordance with what he felt his son would have wanted," the investigator said, adding that the crime scene appeared to have been "washed" with a "water hose".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Howard says the "whole thing was a horrible accident," JP MacDonough alleged.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It is a bizarre crime. Mr Howard committed this act and then in the furtherance of that, burned the body and then cleaned the crime scene, which as an investigator I would take as indicative of nefarious purposes," MacDonough said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The victim's mother and his two siblings were not at the home at the time of the incident, police said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Separately, the district attorney said that his office is looking into possible additional charges including the desecration and mishandling of a corpse as well as other charges related to tampering with the scene of a crime.</p>

<p>Currently, the 68-year-old is in custody. His bond is set at $10 million per charge.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday the US should not be involved in the conflict in Syria, where rebel forces are threatening the government of President Bashar al-Assad.</p>

<p>"Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, &amp; THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!," Trump said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.</p>

<p>Trump said because Russia, an Assad ally, is tied up fighting a war with Ukraine it "seems incapable of stopping this literal march through Syria, a country they have protected for years."</p>

<p>If Russia were forced out of Syria, it "may actually be the best thing that can happen to them" because "there was never much of a benefit in Syria for Russia," Trump said.</p>

<p>Trump's comments appeared to reflect his opposition to the presence of some 900 US troops in Syria, mostly of them in the northeast, where they have backed a Syrian Kurd-led alliance in preventing a resurgence of Islamic State militants.<br />
Trump announced in 2018 during his first term that he wanted to withdraw the US troops because he said Islamic State was near defeat.</p>

<p>But he held off as advisers warned that a pullout would leave a void that would be filled by Iran and Russia.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most famous speeches in modern French history -- General Charles de Gaulle's 1940 radio plea for France to resist the Nazi occupation -- is set to go on display on Saturday for the first time.</p>

<p>The two-page manuscript of the so-called "Appeal of June 18", featuring De Gaulle's handwriting and numerous crossings-out, will be on show at an auction house in Paris ahead of the sale of some of the late leader's possessions.</p>

<p>"Copies have been exhibited before. What is unprecedented is seeing the original," said Frederic Harnisch, head of book and manuscript sales at Artcurial, which will exhibit the text at its Champs-Elysees office.</p>

<p>The historic script will not feature among the 372 lots being sold by De Gaulle's relatives on December 16 by Artcurial.</p>

<p>Items set to go under the hammer include the manuscript of De Gaulle's first book from 1924, "La Discorde chez l'ennemi" ("The Enemy's House Divided"), as well as a collection of letters to his wife Yvonne and a secondary school report card.</p>

<p>The auction was organised by De Gaulle's descendants who inherited a trove of personal items from his brother, Philippe, who died at the age of 103 in March.</p>

<p>"What we are selling is a small part of the inheritance," Harnisch told AFP.</p>

<p>The French state and private institutions are expected to be among the buyers of the memorabilia from a man considered the father of the modern French state.</p>

<p>De Gaulle spearheaded resistance to the Nazi Germany's occupation of France.</p>

<p>He then emerged as the country's post-war leader serving as the architect of the current constitution and president from 1958.</p>

<p>The Appeal of June 18 was broadcast by the BBC from London in which De Gaulle urged French people to fight on, laying the foundation for the underground resistance movement.</p>

<p>"Has the last word been said? Should hope disappear? Is defeat final? No! Believe me... nothing is lost for France," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Earlier, a war monitor and Abdel Ghani said rebels were within 20 kilometres of Damascus as government forces fall back in the face of the offensive gathering even more momentum.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Rebels on a lightning advance through Syria said on Saturday they have begun to encircle Damascus as government forces denied they had withdrawn from areas near the capital.</p>

<p>"Our forces have begun the final phase of encircling the capital, Damascus," said rebel commander Hassan Abdel Ghani, with the Islamist-led alliance that launched the offensive.</p>

<p>The defence ministry flatly denied the army had fled positions near the city.</p>

<p>"There is no truth to news claiming our armed forces, present in all areas of the Damascus countryside, have withdrawn," it said.</p>

<p>Earlier, a war monitor and Abdel Ghani said rebels were within 20 kilometres of Damascus as government forces fall back in the face of the offensive gathering even more momentum.</p>

<p>The Syria Observatory for Human Rights said government forces had ceded more key ground, losing control of all of southern Daraa province and evacuating posts in Quneitra, near the Israel-annexed Golan Heights.</p>

<p>The monitor said government forces were also pulling out of towns as little as 10 kilometres (six miles) from Damascus.</p>

<p>Abdel Ghani said earlier that "our forces were able to control the Saasaa (security) branch in the Damascus countryside. The advance towards the capital continues."</p>

<p>Air strikes and shelling by government forces and their ally Russia killed at least seven civilians near the city of Homs, as the army sought to slow the rebel advance there.</p>

<p>The astounding rebel gains have brought the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and its allies to the doorstep of President Bashar al-Assad's seat of power, just over a week into a renewed offensive in a conflict that had long seemed frozen.</p>

<p>As the rebels seize more territory, they have also sought to reassure those living in areas now under their control.</p>

<p>Abdel Ghani in a statement on Telegram Saturday recognised that the rebels had taken areas where "different religious sects and minorities" live.</p>

<p>"We ask that all sects be reassured... for the era of sectarianism and tyranny has gone away forever," he said.</p>

<p>Minorities have often been persecuted during Syria's long conflict, and HTS's precursor Al-Nusra Front, which was linked to Al-Qaeda, launched deadly attacks on Assad's Alawite minority in Homs early in the war.</p>

<p>The army said it was redeploying in the south where the Observatory said the government had lost control of Daraa province and the key city of the same name, cradle of the 2011 uprising.</p>

<p>An AFP correspondent in Daraa saw local fighters guarding public property and civil institutions on Saturday.</p>

<p>In the central Homs area, a key stepping stone to the seat of power in Damascus, the Observatory said government forces had brought "large reinforcements" and stopped the rebel advance.</p>

<p>An army statement carried by state media said government forces were "redeploying and repositioning" in the southern provinces of Sweida and Daraa.</p>

<p>But both the Observatory and rebels said that government forces no longer controlled any of Daraa province.</p>

<p>After the rebels seized Aleppo and Hama, Daraa was taken by local armed groups, the Britain-based monitor said.</p>

<p>In nearby Quneitra province, government forces "evacuated military and security positions while civil servants left their posts, leaving the province... free of the Syrian army for the very first time", said Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman.</p>

<h2><strong>- Evacuation calls -</strong></h2>

<p>Daraa and Quneitra are near the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights, where Israel said it was boosting its troop presence, and Jordan, which late Friday urged its citizens to leave Syria "as soon as possible".</p>

<p>Russia and the United States, which has troops in Syria as part of an anti-jihadist coalition, have also advised their nationals to leave.</p>

<p>Syria's civil war, which began with Assad's crackdown on democracy protests, has killed more than 500,000 people and forced more than half the population to flee their homes.</p>

<p>The HTS-led alliance has made rapid gains in the west since launching its offensive on November 27.</p>

<p>By Friday, the government was also pulling its troops out of Deir Ezzor in the east, with Kurdish-led forces saying they had moved in.</p>

<p>The HTS leader, known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, said in an interview published Friday the offensive's aim was to oust Assad.</p>

<p>"The goal of the revolution remains the overthrow of this regime. It is our right to use all available means to achieve that goal," he told CNN.</p>

<p>HTS is rooted in the Syrian branch of Al-Qaeda. Proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Western governments, it has sought to soften its image in recent years.</p>

<p>The Kurdish-led and US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, which control territory in the east, expressed readiness for dialogue with rival rebels and Turkey, saying the offensive heralded a "new" political reality for Syria.</p>

<h3><strong>- 'Syria is ours' -</strong></h3>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for a "political solution to the conflict" and for the protection of civilians and minorities, his spokesperson said Friday, in a call with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan.</p>

<p>Fidan and his Iranian and Russian counterparts discussed Syria in Qatar on Saturday.</p>

<p>Qatar's prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani, said the world had been "surprised" by the speed of the rebel advance, and called for "a political framework" to prevent violence from spiralling.</p>

<p>He also said Assad had failed to "start engaging and restoring his relationship with his people".</p>

<p>At least 826 people, mostly combatants but also including 111 civilians, have been killed since the offensive began last week, according to the Observatory, while the United Nations said the violence has displaced 370,000 people.</p>

<p>Many of the scenes witnessed in recent days would have been unimaginable earlier in the war.</p>

<p>In Hama, an AFP photographer saw residents set fire to a giant poster of Assad on the facade of city hall.</p>

<p>"The rebels entered Hama, it was a great joy for us -- something we had been waiting for since 2011," said Maymouna Jawad, expressing her hope that anti-government forces would "liberate" the whole country.</p>

<p>Online footage verified by AFP showed residents toppling a statue of Assad's father Hafez, under whose brutal rule the army carried out a massacre in Hama in the 1980s.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia, a rare audio recording of a Russian fighter jet evading Ukraine's Patriot air defence missiles has surfaced on social media. The clip, first shared on YouTube in July, captures the crew of a Russian Sukhoi Su-34 fighter bomber aircraft pulling off an extraordinary feat of evading the threat. The incident took place over Ukraine, close to Mariupol. In the clip, the navigator can be heard warning the pilot about the "multiple" missile launches from a Patriot SAM (Surface to Air Missile) battery.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The recording surfaced on X on Friday after a user tweeted about the "chilling" audio. "Just listened to the audio of a Russian SU-34 evading two Patriot missiles. Have to admit that Russian pilots are skilled. The audio is chilling and the heavy breathing you hear all the way until the end of the video doesn't help with making the video less disturbing," the user wrote. They also shared the YouTube video in the following post.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Take a look below:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>According to the caption of the YouTube post, the Russian jet survived the encounter by dragging and notching the missiles in different directions. However, after one of the Patriot missiles exploded close to the Russian jet, it damaged its intercom.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The audio recording captured the real-life conversation between the Russian pilot commander and the navigator during the attack. In the audio file, the navigator is heard telling the pilot repeatedly to evade the missiles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This is an encounter of a Russian Su-34 bomber (Callsign "754") and multiple launches from a Patriot SAM (Surface to Air Missile) battery over Ukraine, close to Mariupol. The Su-34 was making it's attack run when it got engaged by a Ukrainian Patriot system," the caption of the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD_en_xvSvU">YouTube pos</a>t read.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The Su-34 then proceeded to evade the threat by dragging and notching the missile in different directions to deplete it's energy, however the Patriot missile exploded somewhere close to the Su-34 and knocked out it's intercom - the Pilot Commander and Navigator struggled to hear each other for the remainder of the sortie," it added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On social media, the audio recording has left users amazed. "I think more credit should be given to the ground controller who could detect Patriot's radar pings on the Su-34 &amp; kept track of all launches," commented one X user. "It was a really interesting audio, but I strongly believe it was luck involved rather than skill," expressed another.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US man has revealed that he received death threats following a viral social media post that mistakenly identified him as the killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.</p>

<p>Joey Mannarino, a political commentator, shared his distress after his photograph was circulated alongside an image of the suspect on X (formerly Twitter). The text alongside the pictures read, “Possible match for the United Healthcare CEO assassin identified! Do you recognise this person?!”</p>

<p>Quote-tweeting it, Mr Mannarino asked, “How is this allowed? This can get me killed,” emphasising the potential consequences of such a mix-up.</p>

<p>Readers have also provided additional context, clarifying that the post was intended as satire but could easily be misinterpreted. “Incorrect claim. The picture on the right is Joey Mannarinous who is not a suspect.”&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol escaped impeachment Saturday over his brief declaration of martial law, after lawmakers from his ruling party boycotted a vote despite huge protests outside parliament.</p>

<p>Yoon stunned the nation and the international community Tuesday night by suspending civilian rule and sending troops to parliament, but was forced into a U-turn after lawmakers nixed his decree.</p>

<p>Opposition parties proposed the impeachment motion, which needed a two thirds majority to pass, but a near-total boycott by Yoon's People Power Party (PPP) doomed it to failure.</p>

<p>"The number of members who voted did not reach the required two-thirds majority," National Assembly speaker Woo Won-shik said, saying that as a result, the impeachment vote was "not valid".</p>

<p>The country -- and the world -- was watching, he said, adding it was "very regrettable that a vote could not even be held on such a significant national issue".</p>

<p>He said it signified "a failure to engage in the democratic process" on the part of the ruling party.</p>

<p>The PPP claimed after the vote that it had blocked the impeachment to avoid "severe division and chaos", adding that it would "resolve this crisis in a more orderly and responsible manner".</p>

<p>The outcome disappointed the huge crowds -- numbering 150,000 according to police, one million according to organisers -- demonstrating outside parliament for Yoon's ouster.</p>

<p>Demonstrators booed while some sighed or even wept in frustration as the ruling party lawmakers walked out of the chamber.</p>

<p>"Even though we didn't get the outcome we wanted today, I am neither discouraged nor disappointed because we will get it eventually," said Jo Ah-gyeong, 30.</p>

<p>"I'll keep coming here until we get it," she told AFP.</p>

<p><strong>'Politically dead'</strong></p>

<p>The opposition has already vowed to try again as soon as Wednesday, and many protesters vowed to continue demonstrations next weekend.</p>

<p>"I will impeach Yoon Suk Yeol, who has become the worst risk for South Korea, at any cost," opposition leader Lee Jae-myung said.</p>

<p>Before the vote, Yoon, 63, apologised for the turmoil but said he would leave it to his party to decide his fate.</p>

<p>"I caused anxiety and inconvenience to the public. I sincerely apologise," he said in the televised address, his first public appearance in three days.</p>

<p>He said he would "entrust the party with measures to stabilise the political situation, including my term in office".</p>

<p>The backing of PPP lawmakers came despite party head Han Dong-hoon -- who was allegedly on an arrest list on Tuesday night -- saying Yoon must go.</p>

<p>Only three PPP lawmakers -- Ahn Cheol-soo, Kim Yea-ji and Kim Sang-wook -- voted in the end.</p>

<p>The failure of the impeachment motion "means a more protracted political crisis," Vladimir Tikhonov, professor of Korean Studies at the University of Oslo, told AFP.</p>

<p>"We will have a politically dead president -- basically unable to govern any longer -- and hundreds of thousands coming to the streets every week until Yoon is removed," he said.</p>

<p>Had the motion passed, Yoon would have been suspended from duties pending a ruling by the Constitutional Court.</p>

<p>An opinion poll released Friday put backing for the president at a record low of 13 percent.</p>

<p><strong>'Step down'</strong></p>

<p>"The public will not forgive him," 63-year-old retiree Lee Wan-pyo told AFP at Seoul's main train station before the vote.</p>

<p>"I just want him to step down," said Han Jeong-hwa, a 70-year-old housewife.</p>

<p>Regardless of the vote, police have begun investigating Yoon and others for alleged insurrection.</p>

<p>In his address declaring martial law late Tuesday, Yoon claimed it would "eliminate anti-state elements plundering people's freedom and happiness".</p>

<p>Security forces sealed the National Assembly, helicopters landed on the roof and almost 300 soldiers tried to lock down the building.</p>

<p>But as parliamentary staffers blocked the soldiers with sofas and fire extinguishers, enough MPs got inside -- many climbed walls to enter -- and voted down Yoon's move.</p>

<p>Soldiers had been ordered to detain key politicians, officials from both parties have said, with the special forces chief later describing being given orders to "drag out" MPs from parliament.</p>

<p>Experts and lawmakers have speculated that the elite special forces soldiers may have slow-walked following orders, after discovering themselves to be involved in a political rather than national security incident.</p>

<p>The episode brought back painful memories of South Korea's autocratic past and blindsided its allies, with the US administration only finding out via television.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told his Korean counterpart Cho Tae-yul on Friday that he "expects the... democratic process to prevail".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said the needle is moving towards the reality of negotiations rather than the continuation of the Russia-Ukraine war.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Saturday called for “more innovative and participative diplomacy” and said the needle is moving towards the reality of negotiations rather than the continuation of the war between Russia and Ukraine.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar highlighted the increasing cost of oil, fertilisers and shipping etc. for several countries, including India, due to conflicts in the Gulf and the Mediterranean region.</p>

<p>He is visiting Doha to participate in the Doha Forum at the invitation of Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of State of Qatar Mohammed bin Abdulrahman. He was addressing a panel along with the Qatari prime minister and Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar said that diplomats have to tell themselves, it's a messy world. “It's terrible. There are conflicts, but therefore there's all the more reason for diplomats of the world to step forward,” he said.</p>

<p>He also said the era of the 60s and the 70s when the UN Security Council or a few Western powers managed conflicts is “behind us,” adding that all countries need to step forward.</p>

<p>“I think this, there is a greater case for more vigorous diplomacy, for more innovative diplomacy, for a more participative diplomacy, and, and I think more countries need to have the boldness to bypass the West,” the former diplomat turned minister said.</p>

<p>When the anchor asked about India's role in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Mr Jaishankar said, “The needle is moving more towards the reality of negotiation than the continuation of the war.” Describing how India is walking the talk, by going to Moscow, talking to President Vladimir Putin, going to Kyiv, engaging, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, transparently carrying messages to each others, Mr Jaishankar said India is trying to find “common threads” which can be picked up at some time.</p>

<p>He also said that India is articulating the sentiments and the interest of the Global South comprising 125 other countries who have found their fuel cost, their food cost, their inflation, their fertiliser costs impacted by this war.</p>

<p>“And, in the last few weeks and months, I've even seen this sentiment expressed by major European leaders, who are actually telling us, please keep engaging Russia and engaging Ukraine. So we do think that things are moving somewhere in that direction,” he added.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar also spoke about Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US president-elect Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Referring to Trump's recent threats to BRICS about imposing 100 per cent tariff if those countries went ahead with BRICS currency, Mr Jaishankar said, “I am not exactly sure what was the trigger for it but we've always said that India has never been for de-dollarisation. Right now, there is no proposal to have a BRICS currency.” He also explained how countries in BRICS don't have an identical position on the issue.</p>

<p>Answering a question if India has a role to play in Russia, China, North Korea and Iran forming an anti-American, anti-westernism axis, Mr Jaishankar said: “Every country has its interests. They agree on some, they disagree on some. Sometimes the same countries work in different combinations in different issues.” “The reality is much more complicated, much more granular,” he said at the panel discussions as part of the 22nd edition of the Doha Forum on the theme 'The Innovation Imperative.' As per its website, Doha Forum is a global platform for dialogue, bringing together leaders in policy to discuss critical challenges facing the world, and to build innovative and action-driven networks.</p>

<p>Under the banner ‘Diplomacy, Dialogue, Diversity', Doha Forum promotes the interchange of ideas and discourse towards policy making and action-oriented recommendations.</p>

<p>“In a world where borders are porous, our challenges and solutions are also interlinked,” it says on the home page.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Zia's party has historically kept closer ties with Pakistan unlike Sheikh Hasina's Awami League, who had kept a more pro-India stance. There is growing uncertainty about Bangladesh's new diplomatic and political outlook as well.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>Amid shifting Bangladesh-Pakistan ties, and growing proximity between the two countries, the interim government has removed the requirement for Pakistani citizens to get a security clearance before applying for a visa.</p>

<p>The clearance requirement was introduced in 2019 amid tensions and broader security measures.</p>

<p>However, this new policy removed such constraints when it was introduced through an announcement by the Security Services Division (SSD) of the Ministry of Home Affairs, on December 2.</p>

<p>This shift came a day before Pakistan's high commissioner to Bangladesh, Syed Ahmed Maroof, met with Khaleda Zia, the leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) in Dhaka on December 3.</p>

<p>This drew attention especially after the Bangladesh government allowed cargo vessel movement directly from Karachi to Chittagong in November.</p>

<p>Zia's party has historically kept closer ties with Pakistan unlike Sheikh Hasina's Awami League, who had kept a more pro-India stance. There is growing uncertainty about Bangladesh's new diplomatic and political outlook as well.</p>

<p>"This signals not a shift but a balancing act by Bangladesh. Bangladeshi officials are persistently stating that they want a friendly relationship with India though India is not reciprocating that. They not only gave refuge to Hasina but politicians are using inflammatory remarks based on half-truth and disinformation on Bangladesh", Mubashar Hasan, an expert on Bangladesh politics and executive director of the Sydney Policy and Analysis Centre in Australia, told ThePrint.</p>

<p>"So it seems by normalising relationships with India's arch-rival Pakistan, Bangladesh's administration is signalling that it is not going to see South Asian politics through [an] Indian prism anymore. Whether in the long run, Bangladesh can continue to afford that remains to be seen as the West-specifically the US-sees South Asia through [an] Indian prism and the US is a vital ally for Bangladesh. Having said that, India, too, must realise its neighbourhood policy is in shambles."</p>

<p>The security clearance poses serious questions for India's security, especially in the North East as there are rising concerns that the evolving political landscape in Bangladesh could facilitate extremist groups in the region.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A three-storey apartment block in The Hague partially collapsed Saturday after a fire and explosion, firefighters said, with first responders searching for people under the rubble.</p>

<p>Four people have already been pulled out of the debris and taken to hospital, as elite teams with sniffer dogs deployed to rescue others trapped by the disaster.</p>

<p>It was not known how many people were still missing nor what caused the explosion in the block of flats not far from the centre of the city.</p>

<p>"We still don't know how many people might be under the rubble," a police officer on-site told AFP.</p>

<p>An AFP reporter on the scene saw dozens of fire trucks as firefighters battled the blaze from the ground and from higher positions. Police helicopters circled overhead.</p>

<p>Debris was strewn across the street and several windows had been blown out, the AFP reporter said.</p>

<p>Huge plumes of smoke were billowing from a large hole where the building stood, with an acrid smell in the air.</p>

<p>"I was asleep and suddenly there was this huge bang," Adam Muller, a 14-year-old local resident, told AFP.</p>

<p>"I looked out of the window and just saw flames. It's a massive shock," he added.</p>

<p><strong>'Like an earthquake'</strong></p>

<p>Authorities warned locals to keep their windows shut and shut off ventilation systems due to the smoke.</p>

<p>Forensic investigators arrived on the scene to begin to probe a potential cause for the accident, an AFP reporter said.</p>

<p>Police appealed for witnesses, saying that a car had driven away from the scene at high speed after the explosion, which occurred around 6:15 am (0515 GMT).</p>

<p>The three floors of the building consisted of shops on the ground floors and five two-storey apartments, authorities said, with living rooms on the second floor and bedrooms on the top.</p>

<p>The city's mayor Jan van Zanen travelled to the site to coordinate rescue efforts.</p>

<p>"It was like an earthquake," said a 53-year-old man who identified himself as Dimi, declining to give his family name.</p>

<p>"Something collapsed but we didn't see where it came from. I know these neighbours. My kids go to school with them."</p>

<p>"My new car has also been seriously damaged," he added.</p>

<p>Early images from public broadcaster NOS showed several dozen firefighters tackling a large blaze and breaking down doors to gain access to the block.</p>

<p>A picture from local news agency ANP showed one person being led away on a stretcher into a waiting ambulance.</p>

<p>Hospitals in the area were on standby to treat victims.</p>

<p>Residents told local media the apartment block was mainly inhabited by elderly people and families with children.</p>

<p>Around 40 residents of other blocks near the collapsed building have been evacuated. Some have been taken away by bus to an unknown location.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Dick Schoof wrote on X that he was "shocked by the terrible images of a collapsed apartment building in The Hague."</p>

<p>"My thoughts go out to the victims, all other people involved and the emergency services who are now working on the scene," said Schoof.</p>

<p>He said he had been in contact with the city authorities and promised any help necessary.</p>

<p>Dutch King Willem-Alexander wrote on social media: "We sympathise with those personally affected or are worried about their loved-ones."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman in Australia who lost over a million in an elaborate scam eerily came face to face with one of the criminals while she was vacationing in China with her husband. The woman, who did not want to reveal her identity, runs a Chinese immigration and education business. Speaking to <em>news.com.au</em>, she said that she was distraught after learning that scammers had kept her on the hook for nearly a year through a fake online trading platform, before finally serving ties with her after draining her bank account.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It all started when the woman received a text message from a man called Wei Chen, asking her how she was. At first, she asked the man who he was, however, she didn't find the message alarming or strange as she runs a Chinese immigration and education business. "I thought my friends or clients introduced him to me," she told the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.news.com.au/finance/money/costs/melbourne-woman-loses-19m-to-scammers-eerily-meets-criminal-facetoface-during-overseas-trip/news-story/cd15bf384f1a297cf8df93f23ecce69a" rel="noindex,nofollow">outlet</a>.</p>

<p>Later, the two ended up getting on well. They messaged each other over WeChat and WhatsApp about food and how they had both moved to Australia. Chen told her that he was a permanent resident who ran a furniture store and he lived in the expensive Sydney suburb in a house worth over $12,000,000.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eventually, Chen mentioned that he staked his fortune on an investment trading website called SpreadEx. Notably, a legitimate company exists by that name in the UK as a sports betting and financial trading company, regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.</p>

<p>Chen convinced the woman to put some money in. She had $191,215.50 in savings and over a period of time put all that in, and then some more. The woman also revealed that she encouraged her friends to invest in the scheme and also borrowed money from them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the company she was dealing with was actually run by a group of scammers. In December last year - six months after the woman had invested - the UK financial watchdog put out a warning, flagging that the scammers were using an extra 's', using the domain spreadexs.com instead of spreadx.com. The Australian government also put out a warning about the fraudulent site.</p>

<p>The woman had already invested all her savings on the platform. She even borrowed a further $286,823.25 from friends and redrew the mortgage she shared with her husband. Some of her school friends also invested as well after she encouraged them.</p>

<p>The woman told the outlet that when she went on a vacation to China she wanted to continue investing on the platform. This is when the scammers told her that she could directly hand over the cash to them while she was in mainland China. She met a man in what she described as a "remote dark place" and handed him over 500,000 yuan in cash.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While overseas, the woman also left her SpreadEx trading account in the hands of Chen, who at this point she considered a mentor. But when she returned, she tried withdrawing some of her money but her trading account was suddenly suspended.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The scammers then told her she had to pay a risk fee for withdrawing cash. They also charged her a penalty because she had let someone else take over her account.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The woman said the last contact she had with Chen was in April, meaning he kept the ruse going for nearly a year. After multiple unsuccessful attempts to contact him, Roxy and her husband concluded it was a scam and alerted police in September this year.</p>

<p>The woman said she still owes money she took from her friends and the mortgage. Victoria police is still investigating the woman's case.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[With 170 million Americans using TikTok, this decision will sound the death knell for the app in one of its biggest markets.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TikTok is inching closer to being banned in the United States after a new law that could lead to the banning was unanimously upheld by a panel of federal judges.</p>

<p>With 170 million Americans using TikTok, this decision will sound the death knell for the app in one of its biggest markets.</p>

<p>The judges in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied TikTok's petition to overturn the law.</p>

<p>According to the law, in order for TikTok to operate in the US, the Chinese owner of the app - ByteDance is required to sell the app to a non-Chinese company by January. This happens amid rising concerns regarding TikTok being a national security concern under ByteDance.</p>

<p>Lawmakers and officials have said that the Chinese government would retrieve and use sensitive information from the app about Americans and spread propaganda, although there's no public evidence of the same occurring. It is also interesting to note that the Chinese government has banned Facebook and Youtube in China and that TikTok is not allowed there.</p>

<p>The app has kept free speech central to the argument and has sparked concern from content creators and influencers whose income depends on it. The American Civil Liberties Union said the decision is "a major blow to freedom of expression online" setting dangerous precedents for other platforms under foreign ownership.</p>

<p>TikTok will move to the Supreme Court and expects a different outcome on the same, although there is no guarantee the apex court will take it up.</p>

<p>"The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue," Michael Hughes, spokesperson for TikTok, said. He also said the ban is an "outright censorship of the American people and that its "based upon inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information".</p>

<p>Attorney General Merrick Garland says the ruling is "an important step in blocking the Chinese government from weaponising TikTok."</p>

<p>Moreover, President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly supported the app but the law will get into effect a day before his inauguration. According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/business/media/tiktok-ban-court-decision.html" rel="noindex,nofollow">New York Times</a>, some experts speculate that Trump could ask his new attorney general to refrain from enforcing it, but that in turn could put Apple and Google in a delicate situation with the law delineating that companies distributing TikTok in their stores will be penalised.</p>

<p>In any case, Trump had said in September,&nbsp;“For all of those who want to save TikTok in America, vote for Trump" and said that a TikTok ban would only help Meta and Mark Zuckerberg, who he considers&nbsp;“an enemy of the people". But considering his hawkish stance on China, anything is possible.</p>

<p>Trump currently has 14.6M followers on TikTok.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Earthquake In Northern California: The webcam footage at the Sacramento complex shows waterfowl foraging and wading in a wetland.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The US Fish and Wildlife Service has released footage capturing the moment when a 7.0 magnitude earthquake hit Northern California. The video shows how the birds at the Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge Complex and areas surrounding the Sacramento Valley reacted to the tremors.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The powerful earthquake shook a sparsely populated area of northern California on Thursday (December 5), forcing many to evacuate the low-lying areas amid a tsunami warning by the authorities, which was later cancelled.</p>

<p dir="ltr">US Fish and Wildlife Service has now shared a video featuring how the wildlife reacted to the strong tremors.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The webcam footage at the Sacramento complex shows waterfowl foraging and wading in a wetland.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">"Yesterday, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake hit Northern California, with the epicentre off the coast near Eureka. Even the Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge Complex and areas across the Sacramento Valley felt the shake! After the shaking subsided, our team at the refuge checked the webcam footage—and guess what? It caught the whole event! Watch the video to see just how long the quake lasted. At the end, you'll notice a flurry of birds startled into flight," read the Facebook post by the US agency.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The post garnered more than 36,000 views on the platform. People have made a bee-line to the comments section to share their thoughts.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"They don't freak out as much as I do … lucky they can fly away … I'm grounded," a person wrote.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Another added, "Great video. Amazing how all the birds suddenly lifted their heads at the same time."</p>

<p dir="ltr">The earthquake struck at 10:44 AM Pacific Time, while the tsunami warning, which extended along 500 miles (800 km) of the California and Oregon coasts, was called off by authorities around 90 minutes after the tremors, according to the National Weather Service.</p>

<p dir="ltr">No deaths or injuries have been reported so far. The US Geological Survey informed that the quake was centred about 39 miles (63 km) west of the town of Ferndale.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As many as 4.7 million residents of California and Oregon were under the tsunami warning before it was cancelled.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi has expressed grave concern over the recent unrest in Bangladesh following the arrest of ISKCON priest Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi has expressed grave concern over the recent unrest in Bangladesh following the arrest of ISKCON priest Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari.</p>

<p>In an official statement, he urged the Bangladeshi government to uphold human rights, guarantee legal protections, and end the wave of violence targeting Hindus and other minority groups.</p>

<p>"The ongoing violence against Hindus and others across Bangladesh is unacceptable and must end immediately. I strongly urge the government of Bangladesh to take decisive steps to reduce tensions peacefully now," he said.</p>

<p>The Illinois Congressman highlighted the need for Bangladesh to safeguard peaceful protests and ensure the arrested individuals receive proper legal representation.</p>

<p>"The government of Bangladesh must uphold and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the rights to peaceful protest and proper legal representation," he stated, adding that such measures are vital to de-escalate the current tensions.</p>

<p>The unrest stems from the sedition charges filed against Chinmoy Krishna Das for allegedly raising a saffron flag above Bangladesh's national flag in Chittagong on October 25. His arrest on November 25 sparked protests, culminating in violent clashes between his followers and law enforcement outside the Chattogram Court Building on November 27, which resulted in the death of a lawyer.</p>

<p>The situation has worsened following additional arrests.</p>

<p>According to ISKCON Kolkata, two monks, Adipurush Shyam Das and Ranganath Das Brahmachari, were detained on November 29 after visiting Chinmoy Krishna Das in custody. The organisation's Vice President, Radha Raman, also claimed that rioters vandalised an ISKCON centre in Bangladesh during the unrest.</p>

<p>Adding to the controversy, the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council condemned what they described as a "false and harassing case" against 70 minority lawyers and two journalists accused of fabricated crimes, including vandalism and bomb explosions. The council has called for the immediate withdrawal of these charges, stating they were designed to hinder the sedition case against Chinmoy Krishna Das and suppress related news coverage.</p>

<p>The Indian Ministry of External Affairs has also voiced concern over escalating violence and extremist rhetoric in Bangladesh, emphasising that it has consistently raised the issue of targeted attacks on minorities with Dhaka.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A string of rape and assault allegations against the son of Norway's future queen have plunged the royal family into its "biggest scandal" ever, wrapping up an "annus horribilis" for the monarchy.</p>

<p>The legal troubles surrounding Marius Borg Hoiby, the 27-year-old son born of a relationship before Crown Princess Mette-Marit's marriage to Crown Prince Haakon, have dominated the Scandinavian country's headlines since August.</p>

<p>The tall strapping blond with a "bad boy" look -- often photographed in tuxedos, slicked back hair, earrings and tattoos -- was arrested in Oslo on August 4 suspected of assaulting his girlfriend the previous night.</p>

<p>A photograph of a knife stuck in the wall of her apartment soon emerged in the media, alongside news reports that Hoiby handed over a partially destroyed cell phone with no SIM card to police.</p>

<p>Hoiby admitted the assault and damage a few days later, saying in a written statement to the media they were the result of a cocaine- and alcohol-fuelled argument.</p>

<p>He said he had struggled "for a long time with substance abuse" and "mental health troubles".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hoiby, who has friends in criminal circles according to media, was raised with his two step-siblings but has no official role in the royal family.</p>

<p>His legal troubles have only continued to mount since August.</p>

<p>Two ex-girlfriends have come forward to say they were also assaulted by Hoiby.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By December, the police suspicions against him had swelled to include death threats, violation of a restraining order, two rapes and a third possible sex crime.</p>

<p>When the first rape allegation emerged in November, Hoiby spent a week in police custody -- unprecedented for a member of the Norwegian royal family.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's snowballing and it doesn't seem to be able to stop," said Sigrid Hvidsten, a columnist at daily Dagbladet.</p>

<p>"It's the biggest scandal ever in the Norwegian royal family."</p>

<p>Police have yet to press any charges against Hoiby, who has so far only admitted the assault and damage during the night of August 3-4 as well as death threats against an unidentified man.</p>

<p>While still far from over, the saga is the culmination of a challenging year for Norway's royal family, its own "annus horribilis", said Hvidsten.</p>

<h3><strong>Wedding criticism</strong></h3>

<p>Norway's royals have been hugely popular and scandal-free for decades.</p>

<p>But even before the Hoiby affair, its image had been clouded by Princess Martha Louise's second wedding in August.</p>

<p>The 53-year-old eldest child of King Harald and Queen Sonja married an American self-proclaimed shaman, Durek Verrett.</p>

<p>Both are alternative therapy devotees: she claims to be a clairvoyant who can speak with angels; he calls himself a "sixth-generation shaman" and sells pricey gold medallions that he says save lives, prompting critics to call him a charlatan.</p>

<p>The couple have faced harsh criticism for their use of her royal title for commercial gain, which intensified when they signed deals with Hello! magazine and Netflix for exclusive coverage of their wedding.</p>

<p>In 2017, the royal family enjoyed the support of 81 percent of Norwegians but by September this year that had slumped to 62 percent.</p>

<p>Adding to the family's misfortunes, 87-year-old King Harald has suffered a slew of health issues.</p>

<p>In February, Europe's oldest-serving monarch had to be repatriated from a vacation in Malaysia on a medical transport plane after contracting an infection.</p>

<p>He was then put on a lengthy sick leave.</p>

<p>In a sign of things to come, the government earmarked 20 million kroner ($1.8 million) in October for a sarcophagus for the king and queen, to be installed in the royal mausoleum in Oslo.</p>

<h3><strong>Down but not out</strong></h3>

<p>The ageing monarch has only briefly, and indirectly, addressed the family's struggles.</p>

<p>"Sometimes, life is just very difficult. It's something that everyone can experience, including our family," he said in late October.</p>

<p>"When people we love are not doing well, it's hard for everyone around them. We're doing our best to look out for one another," he added.</p>

<p>Experts say the monarchy will survive as long as the scandals only concern peripheral royals.</p>

<p>The king, queen and the crown prince couple all remain hugely popular.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A republic is not an immediate threat," said Tor Bomann-Larsen, the author of several royal biographies.</p>

<p>"Even the worst polls show that there are twice as many Norwegians who support the monarchy. As long as its central members hold the line, the monarchy is safe."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) on Saturday alleged that its centre in Dhaka district in neighbouring Bangladesh was burnt down earlier in the day.</p>

<p>Iskcon Kolkata vice president Radharamn Das told PTI that the targetted attack on members of the community and members of the Vaishnavite order goes on unabated as "vandals set ablaze idols inside the temple at the Namhatta property."</p>

<p>He said in a post on X handle, "ISKCON Namhatta Centre burned down in Bangladesh. The deities of Sri Sri Laxmi Narayan and all items inside the temple were burned down completely. The centre is located in Dhaka. Early morning today, between 2-3 AM, miscreants set fire to the Shri Shri Radha Krishna Temple and the Shri Shri Mahabhagya Lakshmi Narayan Temple, which fall under the Hare Krishna Namhatta Sangha, located in Dhour village, under the jurisdiction of Turag Police Station, Dhaka district."</p>

<p>"The fire was initiated by lifting the tin roof at the back of the temple and using petrol or octane. Address: H-02, R-05, Ward-54," he said in the post.</p>

<p>Mr Das claimed that attacks are continuing and despite the ISKCON drawing the attention of the interim government in Bangladesh, not much is being done by the police and administration to assuage their grievances and address their concern.</p>

<p>"Iskcon India has expressed concern about the safety of Hindus in Bangladesh and urged its monks and followers from Bangladesh not to wear 'tilaks' and practice their faith discreetly. The targeted attacks continue," he had earlier said.</p>

<p>The Iskcon Kolkata vice president also expressed concern over arrested Hindu community leader Chinmoy Krishna Das's safety following his denial of bail and the violent attacks.</p>

<p>Since the installation of the interim government and the dislodging of the Awami League from power in August, ISKCON properties have come under attack at various places across Bangladesh in the past four months.</p>

<p>West Bengal BJP president and Union minister Sukanta Majumdar in a post on X said, "Strongly condemn the horrific arson attack on the #ISKCON Namhatta Centre in Dhaka, Bangladesh, which destroyed the Deities of Sri Sri Laxmi Narayan and sacred temple items." "This is an unforgivable act of hatred against a place of worship. Immediate action must be taken to bring the culprits to justice and ensure the safety of religious minorities," the Union Minister of State for Education said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donors poured a staggering $4.7 billion into the campaigns of Donald Trump, Kamala Harris,Joe Biden, and their supporting groups during the 2024 US presidential election.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Donors poured a staggering $4.7 billion into the campaigns of Donald Trump, Kamala Harris,&nbsp;Joe Biden, and their supporting groups during the 2024 US presidential election. The amount was revealed through final campaign finance reports released on December 5.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The figure represents contributions from October 17 to November 25, as detailed in the latest filings, combined with earlier reports. The data highlights a stark financial divide between the parties, with Democrats and their affiliated groups raising approximately $2.9 billion compared to the Republicans' $1.8 billion.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee (RNC) raised $1.2 billion from November 2022 - when he launched his campaign - till election day. His key super PACs, including MAGA Inc, Right for America, Turnout for America, America PAC, and Preserve America, added another $849 million.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Biden-Harris campaign benefitted from an early start, avoiding a competitive primary and signing a joint fundraising agreement with the Democratic National Committee (DNC) well ahead of their rivals. This enabled the Democrats to secure larger contributions. From April 2023, when Biden announced his re-election bid, till election day, the campaign raised around $2 billion. Their main allies super PACs, Future Forward and American Bridge, contributed an additional $652 million.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The overall $4.7 billion total includes funds raised during the Republican primary, much of which Trump's campaign used against other Republican challengers.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Dark money significantly influenced the final weeks of the election. Both Trump's and Harris's main super PACs relied heavily on contributions from affiliated dark-money groups. These funds, often termed "grey money," raise transparency concerns as the origins of the donations remain undisclosed.</p>

<p dir="ltr">MAGA Inc, Trump's primary super PAC, collected $78 million during the closing weeks, with $53 million originating from Securing American Greatness, its affiliated dark-money group. Similarly, Future Forward, the super PAC backing Harris, raised nearly $164 million during the same period, over $128 million of which came from its dark-money nonprofit, Future Forward USA Action.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Future Forward USA Action reportedly raised more than $900 million during the election cycle, including $58 million in 2023, according to a recent tax filing. This dark money later funded the super PAC in 2024, showcasing the blurred lines between transparency and influence.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Managing campaign finances post-election remains a delicate balance. Overspending can lead to debt, while underspending raises questions about unutilised resources.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Trump campaign reported $11.4 million in unpaid bills as of November 25 but also held $10 million in cash and was owed $4.7 million. The Harris campaign faced criticism for being $20 million in debt post-election but ended the race with no outstanding debts and $2 million on hand.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Elon Musk emerged as a major financial player, donating $277 million through his entities to federal groups supporting Trump. This included $238.7 million funnelled into America PAC, a super PAC Musk established discreetly in 2024. Musk also made headlines as the sole donor to RBG PAC, a super PAC created to align Trump with the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on abortion issues. Elon Musk contributed $20 million to the group in October 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

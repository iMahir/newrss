       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two powerful earthquakes rocked southern Cuba in quick succession on Sunday, US geologists said, as authorities said no tsunami alert was issued and no deaths immediately reported.</p>

<p>The US Geological Survey put the second, more powerful tremor at a magnitude of 6.8 and 14.6 miles (23.5 kilometers) deep, some 25 miles off the coast of Bartolome Maso, in southern Granma province.</p>

<p>It came just an hour after a first tremor, which the USGS put at a magnitude of 5.9, with the epicenter some nine miles beneath the ocean roughly 22 miles off Bartolome Maso.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The state-run newspaper Granma said no deaths had been immediately reported, but that the quake had been felt throughout the Caribbean island nation.</p>

<p>"Here people quickly took to the streets because the ground moved very strongly," Andres Perez, a 65-year-old retiree who lives in downtown Santiago de Cuba, told AFP via telephone of the first quake.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It felt very strong really, my wife is a bundle of nerves," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The US tsunami warning system said no tsunami warning had been issued.</p>

<p>The tremor shook the island as it recovers from Hurricane Rafael, which hit the country's west as a Category 3 storm, leaving residents without power for two days.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A 5.1 magnitude earthquake was recorded in October 2023 in Santiago de Cuba, without causing any damage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another strong earthquake of magnitude 7.7 was recorded in January 2020 in the Caribbean Sea and was felt in several Cuban provinces, causing the evacuation of buildings in the capital Havana, with no damage reported.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday accepted that he had "okayed" the pager attacks in Lebanon, which had killed nearly 40 Iran-backed Hezbollah members in September.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accepted that he had "okayed" the pager attacks in Lebanon, which had killed nearly 40 and wounded 3,000 Iran-backed Hezbollah members in September.</p>

<p>"Netanyahu confirmed Sunday that he greenlighted the pager operation in Lebanon," his spokesperson Omer Dostri told news agency AFP.</p>

<p>Thousands of pagers exploded in Hezbollah strongholds on September 17 and 18 - which Iran and Hezbollah blamed on Israel. Some of the Hezbollah members who were injured reportedly lost their fingers, while some lost their eyesight.</p>

<p>Hezbollah had called the blasts an "Israeli breach" of its communications network and vowed to avenge the attack.</p>

<p>The pagers were used by Hezbollah members as a low-tech means of communication to evade Israeli location-tracking.</p>

<p>The blasts came just hours after Israel announced it was broadening the aims of the war sparked by Hamas' October 7 attacks to include its fight against the group's ally Hezbollah along the country's border with Lebanon.</p>

<p>This week, Lebanon had filed a complaint with the United Nations Labour Agency over the deadly attack, calling it an "egregious war against humanity".</p>

<p>Israel and Hezbollah have been fighting across the Lebanese border since the war in Gaza erupted after Hamas attacked Israeli towns on October 7 last year. Since then, several Hezbollah fighters, including former chief of the Iran-backed group Hassan Nasrallah, have been killed. Last month, Israel's army also confirmed that it "eliminated" Hezbollah's Hashem Safieddine, an apparent successor of Nasrallah, in a strike in southern Beirut.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Israel conducted airstrikes on Hezbollah's main bastion in south Beirut, with one raid hitting an area near Lebanon's only international airport - causing minor damage to some of the airport's buildings, including flag carrier Middle East Airlines' premises.</p>

<p>Since October last year, more than 3,000 people have been killed in Israeli strikes on Lebanon.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin soared to a new record high on Sunday, as traders bet that Donald Trump's return to the White House will be good for the cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>The digital currency passed $80,000 for the first time in its history shortly after 12:00 pm (1200 GMT).</p>

<p>It has been rising since Republican candidate Trump won last Tuesday's US presidential election over sentiment that he will ease regulations on digital currencies.</p>

<p>"The odds that Bitcoin and crypto will become a significantly larger asset class have risen markedly," Charles Morris, an analyst at investment company ByteTree told AFP.</p>

<p>Bitcoin reached $75,000 on Wednesday, topping its previous all-time peak of $73,797.98 achieved in March.</p>

<p>"We shouldn't expect this bullish trend to be interrupted for a long time -- about a year. The next level for me is $100,000," Stephane Ifrah, of French crypto asset management company Coinhouse, told AFP.</p>

<p>Trump was seen as the pro-crypto candidate in his battle with the Democratic Party's candidate Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>During his first presidency Trump referred to cryptocurrencies as a scam, but has since radically changed his position, even launching his own platform for the unit.</p>

<p>He has pledged to make the United States the "bitcoin and cryptocurrency capital of the world," and to put tech billionaire and right-wing conspiracy theorist Elon Musk in charge of a wide-ranging audit of governmental waste.</p>

<p>The previous Trump term saw corporate tax cuts that brought more liquidity to markets, encouraging investment into high-growth assets such as cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Trump announced in September that he, along with his sons and entrepreneurs, would launch a digital currency platform named World Liberty Financial.</p>

<p>But it had a faltering sales launch earlier this month, with only a fraction of its tokens that went on the market finding a buyer.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies have made headlines since their creation, from their extreme volatility to the collapse of several industry giants, foremost among them the FTX exchange platform.</p>

<p>In the run-up to the election, Trump apparently became the first former president to use bitcoin in a purchase, as he bought burgers at a New York City restaurant, which hailed it as a "historic transaction".</p>

<p>Bitcoin is listed continuously, including on Sundays.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Osama Ahmed's life took a dramatic turn one night in October when the small boat that was to carry him and his father to the English coast sank shortly after setting out from France.</p>

<p>The 20-year-old Syrian was rescued but when he woke up in hospital and asked about his dad nobody knew anything.</p>

<p>Since that moment, Osama has been looking frantically for his father with whom he had hoped to start a new life in Britain.</p>

<p>Beyond the tragically long list of deaths in the Channel of migrants trying to cross, another statistic is also growing fast: Missing people.</p>

<p>"I live in hope of finding him," Osama told AFP in a house in Calais on the French coast where an association, La Margella, put him up. He rejected any idea that his dad may not have survived. "God willing, I will find him," he said.</p>

<p>On the night between October 22 and 23 father and son tried to make it across the water, like 30,000 other migrants this year alone. It was their third attempt.</p>

<p>They were part of a group of around 60 people hiding in the dunes who, at the signal of the people smugglers, rushed to the small boat waiting for them in the water.</p>

<p>But barely one kilometre (1,000 yards) into the journey, water began to seep in.</p>

<p>The group turned the boat around, but the smugglers on the beach pushed them back out to sea, Osama said.</p>

<p>He said they had been promised lifejackets that failed to materialise because, the smugglers claimed, they had been damaged.</p>

<p>The boat's air chambers became completely deflated soon after departure, and everyone on board tumbled into the sea.</p>

<p>For half an hour Osama and his father managed to cling to each other, but when the boat began to disintegrate amid the panic and darkness they were separated.</p>

<p>Two ferries passed without stopping, and eventually, rescue services arrived.</p>

<p>French maritime authorities reported finding three bodies, one woman and two men, after the drama that occurred two kilometres (1.2 miles) off the French coast.</p>

<p>Forty-five people were rescued but survivors reported that there had been more people on board, suggesting that a number had gone missing.</p>

<p>'World's nicest man'</p>

<p>The drama was followed by other, similar incidents, in the Channel and authorities have since found nine bodies floating in the sea or washed up on northern French beaches, none of them the young Syrian's dad.</p>

<p>Osama, who was treated in hospital for burns caused by saltwater and fuel, has been to every police station, hospital and Red Cross office in the area in search of his father, in vain.</p>

<p>He told officials what clothes his dad wore last, and about the ring in which his name is engraved. Police took a sample of Osama's DNA.</p>

<p>Every time a body is found along the coast, Osama fears it could be his father. As the excruciating wait lingers, his life plans are on hold.</p>

<p>His family fled from Syria 13 years ago, to settle in Turkey. Two of Osama's brothers are already in England, having made the journey also in small boats.</p>

<p>He flashed a big smile as he described his dad, "the world's nicest man" and his "role model".</p>

<p>On his phone he has a picture of him, a man in his 50s wearing a white shirt and a jacket, and sporting a grey moustache.</p>

<p>French associations say the authorities should do more to help survivors locate their loved ones after failed crossings.</p>

<p>"People go missing and their families find it very hard to access services that might assist them in their search," said Jeanne Bonnet, co-founder of La Margelle which tries to help migrants navigate French officialdom.</p>

<p>"We sometimes get the feeling that we're being given the runaround," she said.</p>

<p>Osama, she said, was offered no accommodation when he left hospital, injured and traumatised, so he went back to the same camp he had stayed in previously. That's where La Margella took charge of him.</p>

<p>Braving cold temperatures and fog, close to 1,200 migrants have reached England onboard small boats since the beginning of November, according to British official figures.</p>

<p>Sixty people have been confirmed dead this year -- not counting the most recently-discovered bodies and missing people -- a record number since such Channel crossings started in 2018.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The first cargo ship is likely to reach Sri Lanka's Adani-John Keells Holding (JKH) West Container Terminal (WCT) in Colombo Port in the first quarter of 2025, Srilankan news website The Morning Online reported.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first cargo ship is likely to reach Sri Lanka's Adani-John Keells Holding (JKH) West Container Terminal (WCT) in Colombo Port in the first quarter of 2025, Srilankan news website The Morning Online reported quoting JKH chairperson Krishan Balendra.</p>

<p>The vessel's arrival will add 1.5 million 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs) to the port capacity, Mr Balendra said.</p>

<p>The first phase of the WCT is likely to be operational in Q1 of 2025, which will add 1.5 million TEUs to the 8 million TEU capacity at Colombo Port, he said at the JKH investor webinar for Q2 of fiscal 2025.</p>

<p>The first batch of quay and yard cranes for WCT arrived in September, and the cranes' commissioning is expected to be completed by Q4 of 2024, he added.</p>

<p>The JKH quarterly report said the quay length in the first phase will enable simultaneous servicing of two large vessels, which will enable a higher throughput once the first phase is complete.</p>

<p>"The remainder of the terminal is expected to be completed by mid-2026," the report said.</p>

<p>Mr Balendra said the timeframe for operationalising the Sri Lanka Port Authority-run East Container Terminal (ECT) is unclear. Even if ECT becomes operational, only a part of the terminal will become operational, of which the capacity addition to the Colombo Port would not be material, he added.</p>

<p>The ECT project is expected to add a maximum of 2.4 million TEUs capacity to the Colombo Port once fully operationalised.</p><br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has a distinct approach to time and explained why he chooses not to wear a watch. Speaking at a tech event, Mr Huang, whose company Nvidia has seen its valuation skyrocket in recent years, emphasized the value of living in the present moment.</p>

<p>"Very few people know this, but I don't wear a watch. The reason I don't is that now is the most important time. You might be surprised, but I'm not particularly ambitious. I don't aspire to do more; I want to do better at what I'm currently doing. I'm not striving for more-I wait for the world to come to me. Those who know me are aware that Nvidia doesn't have a long-term strategy. We have no grand plan. Our definition of a long-term plan is simply: What are we doing today?"</p>

<p>An Instagram account, @entrepreneursonig, shared a video of Huang discussing his philosophy at the event, with the caption: "Doing more is easy; doing less is hard. Jensen Huang, CEO and co-founder of NVIDIA, shares how he and his company focus on the present, ultimately shaping their future."</p>

<p>In 2023, Huang shared a story from a conversation with a Japanese gardener, which shaped his perspective on the subject. The billionaire recounted meeting a gardener who "lovingly tended to a temple in Kyoto" and managed to maintain the garden's mossy perfection despite the heat, the garden's size, and his small tools. When asked how he did it, the gardener replied, "I have plenty of time."</p>

<p>Huang reflected, "This is the best career advice I can give: Now is the most important time-just focus on the present. I'm rarely chasing things... I'm focused on now. I'm enjoying my job."</p>

       <description><![CDATA[In August, it announced plans to reduce its workforce by 15,000 through voluntary separations and layoffs.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Intel is set to resume free coffee and tea for employees following substantial layoffs as part of broader cost-cutting measures. According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2024/11/intel-brings-back-workers-free-coffee-seeking-to-stem-declining-morale.html" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>The Oregonian</em></a>, the chip giant shared in an internal message that in-office beverages would return to boost employee morale.</p>

<p>"Although Intel still faces cost challenges, we understand that small comforts play a significant role in our daily routines," the message, seen by <em>The Oregonian</em>, stated. "We know this is a small step, but we hope it is a meaningful one in supporting our workplace culture."</p>

<p>However, free fruit, a perk employees had come to expect, will not be returning, the report noted.</p>

<p>Intel, once a leader in the tech industry, has faced several setbacks that have affected its position. While it played a major role in the PC boom of the 1990s, its focus on personal computers left it trailing in the mobile chip market, enabling Apple to take the lead with the iPhone.</p>

<p>In 2013, former Intel CEO Paul Otellini admitted to regretting his decision to pass on a deal with Apple to produce chips for the iPhone, as Intel had assumed the volume wouldn't justify the costs.</p>

<p>Another missed opportunity came in 2017 and 2018, when Intel declined to invest in OpenAI, now a front-runner in artificial intelligence. OpenAI had sought Intel's backing to reduce dependence on Nvidia's chips and create its own infrastructure. Former CEO Bob Swan reportedly doubted the market viability of generative AI models, contributing to Intel's decision to forgo the investment.</p>

<p>Intel has also faced delays in manufacturing, such as setbacks in 2020 with its 7-nanometer chips, which allowed competitors like Samsung and TSMC to pull ahead.</p>

<p>As its valuation dropped, Intel ramped up cost-cutting measures. In August, it announced plans to reduce its workforce by 15,000 through voluntary separations and layoffs. That month, the company shared a presentation detailing cuts to employee benefits, including reductions in reimbursements for internet, phone, and commuting costs.</p>

<p>In September, Intel informed employees in at least one Oregon office that free beverages and fruits would be discontinued.</p>

<p>"That's petty, right? How much does one piece of fruit per day cost?" a former Intel employee told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/news/intel-says-its-bringing-back-free-office-coffee-to-boost-morale-after-a-rough-year/articleshow/115064835.cms" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>Business Insider</em></a>.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a tragic incident last week, a married couple in Washington State fatally wounded each other during a violent confrontation in their home while their 11-year-old son played video games in another room, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/09/us-news/parents-brutally-killed-each-other-as-son-11-played-video-games-in-another-room-officials/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>New York Post </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to officials, the boy, wearing earbuds, was unaware of the argument unfolding on Halloween night as his parents fought in the home. He only realized what had happened when he later found their bodies.</p>

<p>The incident occurred on October 31 in Longview, Washington, about 50 miles north of Portland, Oregon. Investigators have been unable to determine which of the two was the primary aggressor, the media outlet reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The victims, identified as Juan Antonio Alvarado Saenz, 38, and Cecilia Robles Ochoa, 39, both suffered fatal injuries. Police reported that Alvarado Saenz died from multiple stab wounds to the chest, while Robles Ochoa had both stab and gunshot wounds, according to the Cowlitz County Sheriff's Office.</p>

<p>After discovering his parents in the kitchen, the boy called 911. Emergency responders arrived but were unable to revive the couple. Authorities confirmed that the boy was the only other person present in the home at the time.</p>

<p>Detectives have since uncovered that Alvarado Saenz and Robles Ochoa had ongoing relationship issues and were planning to separate, according to statements from the sheriff's office.</p>

<p>A knife and a gun were recovered at the scene. The firearm was later confirmed to have been stolen from Alvarado Saenz's employer and had not been reported missing until after the incident.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian troops recently suffered their worst month for casualties since the country's war with Ukraine began almost three years ago, the head of Britain's armed forces said on Sunday.</p>

<p>An average of around 1,500 Russian soldiers were killed or injured per day in October, UK Chief of the Defence Staff Tony Radakin told the BBC.</p>

<p>Russia does not reveal the number of its war dead, but Radakin said last month's toll was the heaviest since Moscow launched the full-scale invasion of its neighbour in February 2022.</p>

<p>"Russia is about to suffer 700,000 people killed or wounded -- the enormous pain and suffering that the Russian nation is having to bear because of (President Vladimir) Putin's ambition," he added.</p>

<p>The armed forces chief acknowledged that Russia was territorial making gains, but said the losses were "for tiny increments of land".</p>

<p>He said the Russian government was spending more than 40 per cent of public expenditure on defence and security, putting "an enormous strain" on the state.</p>

<p>The UK has been one of Ukraine's strongest backers in its fight against Russian aggression, providing Kyiv with billions of pounds in military aid, as well as weapons and troop training.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has reiterated Britain's "ironclad" support for Ukraine, after Donald Trump's US presidential election win raised concerns about western countries' future commitment to backing Kyiv's war effort.</p>

<p>Radakin repeated that the UK would support Ukraine for "as long as it takes".</p>

<p>"That's the message President Putin has to absorb and the reassurance for (Ukrainian) President (Volodymyr) Zelensky," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's capital Dhaka remains tense on Sunday as several Awami League supporters were reportedly beaten following the party's decision to hold a protest march at Shaheed Noor Hossain Square in commemoration of Noor Hossain Day.</p>

<p>The incident took place in front of Sheikh Hasina's party's central office on Bangabandhu Avenue, local media reported.</p>

<p>A political activist and leader of Awami League's youth front, the Jubo League, Noor Hossain was killed on November 10, 1987 during the anti-Ershad movement.</p>

<p>The Awami League's announcement to hold a rally on Sunday afternoon to mark the occasion was its first significant decision since the government led by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was brought down by an uprising on August 5.</p>

<p>In a social media post, the party invited common people and activists, who believe in the "values of the Liberation War and democratic principles", to join the march at Noor Hossain Chattar (Zero Point). It also called for removal of anti-democratic forces and the reestablishment of democratic governance under the leadership of the Bangladesh Awami League.</p>

<p>Immediately after the announcement, Bangladesh's interim government led by Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus made it clear that it will not grant permission to hold the protest rally.</p>

<p>"The Awami League in its current form is a fascist party. There is no way this fascist party will be allowed to hold protests in Bangladesh," said Yunus' Press Secretary Shafiqul Alam.</p>

<p>The anti-discrimination student movement is also holding a counter-gathering at the same venue, demanding trial of the Awami League leaders.</p>

<p>Anticipating violence, the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) said that 191 platoons of the border security forces have been deployed in the country's capital and across the country to maintain law and order on Noor Hossain Day.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[With Donald Trump set to become the next US president after the recently closely contested presidential polls, India and other Asian countries are expected to benefit due to rising US-China tensions and potential investment restrictions.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With Donald Trump set to become the next US president after the recently closely contested presidential polls, India and other Asian countries are expected to benefit due to rising US-China tensions and potential investment restrictions in strategic sectors, as per Moody's Ratings.</p>

<p>"In the Asia-Pacific region, trade and investment flows might be further diverted away from China as the US tightens investments in strategic sectors, which would negatively affect China's economy and consequently dampen regional growth. However, this shift might benefit India and ASEAN countries," the global rating agency said.</p>

<p>The global agency anticipated a significant shift under the Trump administration across fiscal, trade, climate, and immigration issues, departing from the approach of the administration of the current US President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>The rating agency added that Trump could have both legislative and executive avenues to advance his agenda on every front.</p>

<p>It further added that as a candidate, Trump promised tax reform, with plans to make the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, lower the corporate tax rate, and implement income tax relief. These initiatives, along with targeted and broad tariffs, including steep tariffs on Chinese imports, are expected to increase federal deficits.</p>

<p>It highlighted that the US under Trump will adopt a protectionist trade policy, which would be more disruptive and increase the risks to global growth.</p>

<p>"Protectionist measures could disrupt global supply chains and negatively affect sectors that rely on imported materials and goods, such as manufacturing, technology, and retail," it added.</p>

<p>Trump's trade policy approach would likely bring immediate impacts to the manufacturing sector, the credit rating agency said, adding that although a divided Congress might slow down or adjust the scope of such measures.</p>

<p>The climate initiatives of the US are also likely to see reversals as Trump seeks to boost fossil fuel production under the banner of "American energy dominance."</p>

<p>Reduced funding for clean energy projects and a possible withdrawal from the Paris Agreement would undermine the US's commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>While federal support for green technologies may wane, private-sector initiatives and state-level mandates, particularly in renewable energy, are expected to partially offset this shift.</p>

<p>Some industry experts believe market-driven growth in wind and solar could continue, as these energy sources have become cost-competitive in many parts of the country.</p>

<p>"The shift would likely result in renewed support for the fossil fuel industry, reduced funding for clean energy and green technologies, and loosened environmental regulations, including the Environmental Protection Agency's efforts to reduce emissions in the power and auto sectors. It is likely that the Trump administration will withdraw from the Paris Agreement again and reverse commitments to meeting net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050," the agency said.</p>

<p>On the regulatory front, Trump is expected to pursue a lighter approach, as per the Moody's, which will include relaxed rules for small and midsized banks, potentially reducing their capital requirements but also exposing creditors to higher risks.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canadian police have arrested a 35-year-old Brampton resident on charges of assault with a weapon during a violent demonstration at a Hindu temple in the city, authorities said.</p>

<p>On November 3, a protest occurred at the Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton and unverified videos circulating on social media appeared to show demonstrators holding Khalistani flags. The videos showed fistfights and people striking each other with poles on what appears to be the grounds surrounding the temple.</p>

<p>The Peel Regional Police responded to the altercation during the demonstration at the mandir. As tensions between opposing sides increased, the demonstrations became physical and assaultive, a statement said on Saturday.</p>

<p>Police began investigating several offences that occurred during the demonstration, many of which were captured on video; including individuals using flags and sticks to assault people, it said.</p>

<p>Investigators from the 21 Division Criminal Investigations Bureau and Strategic Investigation Team (SIT) have arrested and charged Inderjeet Gosal of Brampton, the Peel Police statement said.</p>

<p>Gosal is the Canada coordinator for the banned group Sikhs for Justice, the Toronto Star reported.</p>

<p>On November 8, 2024, he was arrested and charged with assault with a weapon. He was released on conditions and is to appear at the Ontario Court of Justice in Brampton at a later date, it said.</p>

<p>A SIT dedicated to investigating incidents of criminality during the November 3 and 4 incidents has since been formed.</p>

<p>On November 3, the protesters carrying Khalistani flags clashed with people and disrupted a consular event co-organised by the temple authorities and the Indian Consulate.</p>

<p>The Sunday incident was condemned by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau who said every Canadian has the right to practise their faith freely and safely.</p>

<p>India condemned the attack with an expectation that those indulging in violence "will be prosecuted".</p>

<p>In a statement, the Ministry of External Affairs said that New Delhi remains "deeply concerned" about the safety and security of Indian nationals in Canada.</p>

<p>The relations between India and Canada came under severe strain following Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations in September last year of a "potential" involvement of Indian agents in Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar's killing. New Delhi rejected Trudeau's charges as "absurd".</p>

<p>India has been maintaining that the main issue between the two countries is that of Canada giving space to Khalistani elements operating from Canadian soil with impunity.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Afghan Taliban officials will attend a major United Nations climate conference that starts next week, the Afghan Foreign Ministry said on Sunday, the first time they have attended since the former insurgents took power in 2021.</p>

<p>The COP29 climate summit in Azerbaijan's capital Baku will be among the highest-profile multilateral events attended by Taliban administration officials since they took control in Kabul after 20 years of fighting NATO-backed forces.</p>

<p>The UN has not allowed the Taliban to take up Afghanistan's seat at the General Assembly, and Afghanistan's government is not formally recognised by U.N. member states, largely due to the Taliban's restrictions on women's education and freedom of movement.</p>

<p>Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi said officials from the National Environmental Protection Agency had arrived in Azerbaijan to attend the COP conference. The Taliban took over the agency when they returned to power as U.S.-led forces withdrew.</p>

<p>Taliban officials have taken part in U.N.-organised meetings on Afghanistan in Doha, and Taliban ministers have attended forums in China and Central Asia in the past two years.</p>

<p>But the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change's Bureau of the COP has deferred consideration of Afghanistan's participation since 2021, in effect freezing the country out of the talks.</p>

<p>Afghan NGOs have also struggled to attend climate negotiations in recent years.</p>

<p>Host Azerbaijan invited the Afghan environment agency officials to COP29 as observers, enabling them to "potentially participate in periphery discussions and potentially hold bilateral meetings," a diplomatic source familiar with the matter told Reuters.</p>

<p>Because the Taliban are not formally recognised within the U.N. system as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, the source said, the officials cannot receive credentials to take part in the proceedings of full member states.</p>

<p>Azerbaijan's presidency declined to comment.</p>

<p>The Taliban has closed schools and universities to female students over the age of around 12. It also announced a set of wide-ranging morality laws this year that require women to cover their faces in public and restrict their travel outside the home without a male guardian.</p>

<p>The Taliban says it respects women's rights in accordance with its interpretation of Islamic law.</p>

<p>Afghanistan is considered one of the countries worst affected by climate change. Flash floods have killed hundreds this year, and the heavily agriculture-dependent country has suffered through one of the worst droughts in decades. Many subsistence farmers, who make up much of the population, face deepening food insecurity.</p>

<p>Some advocates have criticised international isolation of the Taliban, saying it only hurts the Afghan people.</p>

<p>"Afghanistan is one of the countries that is really left behind on the needs that it has," said Habib Mayar, deputy general secretary of the g7+, an intergovernmental organisation of countries affected by conflict.</p>

<p>"It is a double price that they are paying," Mayar said. "There is lack of attention, lack of connection with the international community, and then there are increasing humanitarian needs."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The US President is one of the most highly influential persons around the world, receiving a substantial financial package accompanied by multiple allowances and lifetime benefits. Even after the end of their respective tenures, the former presidents of the US continue to enjoy several benefits.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Salary of US President</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">It would be surprising for many to know that the US President has not been provided a raise in 20 years.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This means that when President-elect Donald Trump will officially take control of the White House again in January 2025, he will earn the same salary as his predecessor, Joe Biden.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Donald Trump will earn $400,000 annually. This yearly income has remained unchanged since 2001. Before that, the president used to get $200,000 annually between 1969 and 2001.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Perks and allowances</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">In addition to the annual remuneration, the US President is also entitled to several other allowances and benefits. Among these include a non-taxable expense allowance of $50,000, a travel account of $1,00,000 as well as an entertainment budget of $19,000 every year.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Moreover, there is a Redecoration Allowance — $100,000 — in case the official residence, The White House, requires redecorating as the new President takes charge.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Altogether, these multiple benefits ensure that the US President is well-supported in his post to lead the country.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Official residence and security</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Apart from the various benefits, the US President is also entitled to stay at the official residence — the White House — along with family. It must be noted that all the costs of housing, including its maintenance, are fully covered.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The White House serves both as the official residence and workplace for the US President, thereby offering a comfortable and safe ambience.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The US President, along with the family members, is also provided round-the-clock security protection, including the Secret Service.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Benefits after demitting office</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">The US Presidents, even after they leave office, remain on the government's payroll and after given an annual pension, which now amounts to over $200,000.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Additionally, they are provided with office space and travel expenses, as per the Former Presidents Act of 1958.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Also, they get to earn money through various other endeavours, including book sales, speaking engagements and others.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gunmen attacked a bar in central Mexican city of Queretaro killing 10 people on Saturday, a local security official said. The attackers opened fire inside the Los Cantaritos bar in the city's historic district, according to the head of Queretaro's public security department Juan Luis Ferrusca.</p>

<p>"Emergency services arrived at the scene and confirmed that at least four people armed with long weapons had arrived on board a pickup truck," he said in a video posted on social media.</p>

<p>"Inside, 10 people were reported dead and at least seven more were injured so far," he added.</p>

<p>One suspect was detained and the vehicle used in the attack was found abandoned and set on fire, Ferrusca said.</p>

<p>Queretaro is considered one of the safer cities in Mexico, where spiralling violence, much of it linked to drug trafficking and gangs, has seen more than 450,000 people murdered since 2006.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ukraine's biggest drone strike on the Russian capital since the start of the war forced flights to be diverted from three of the city's major airports.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine attacked Moscow on Sunday with at least 32 drones, the biggest drone strike on the Russian capital since the start of the war in 2022, forcing flights to be diverted from three of the city's major airports and injuring at least one person.</p>

<p>Russian air defences shot down 32 drones flying towards Moscow over the Ramenskoye and Kolomensky districts of the Moscow region, as well as in Domodedovo city, home to one of the city's biggest airports, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said.</p>

<p>"32 drones flying to Moscow have been destroyed," Sobyanin said. He reported no major damage, though Russia's federal air transport agency said the airports of Domodedovo, Sheremetyevo and Zhukovo had diverted flights.</p>

<p>One person was injured.</p>

<p>The airports have since resumed their operations, Russia's aviation watchdog Rosaviatsia said.</p>

<p>Moscow and its surrounding region, with a population of at least 21 million people, is one of the biggest metropolitan areas in Europe, alongside Istanbul.</p>

<p>The Ramenskoye district, some 45 km (30 miles) southeast of the Kremlin, was last targeted in September in what was then Ukraine's biggest attack on the Russian capital, when Russian air defence units destroyed 20 drones.</p>

<p>Unverified video posted on Russian Telegram channels showed drones buzzing across the skyline. Russian officials reported multiple Ukrainian drone attacks in other regions, among them the Kaluga, Bryansk and Orlov regions.</p>

<p>The 2-1/2-year-old war in Ukraine is entering what some officials say could be its final act after Moscow's forces advanced at the fastest pace since the early days of the war and Donald Trump was elected 47th president of the United States.</p>

<p>Trump, who takes office in January, said during campaigning that he could bring peace in Ukraine within 24 hours, but has given few details on how he would seek to do this.</p>

<p>When Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called Trump to congratulate him on his presidential election victory, Tesla CEO and Trump supporter Elon Musk joined the call, according to media reports. Musk owns SpaceX, which provides Starlink satellite communication services that are vital for Ukraine's defense effort.</p>

<p>MOSCOW 'UMBRELLAS'</p>

<p>Kyiv, itself the target of repeated mass drone strikes from Russian forces, has tried to strike back against its vastly larger eastern neighbour with repeated drone strikes against oil refineries, airfields and even the Russian strategic early-warning radar stations.</p>

<p>While the 1,000 km (620 mile) front has largely resembled grinding World War One trench and artillery warfare for much of the war, one of the biggest innovations of the conflict has been drone warfare.</p>

<p>Moscow and Kyiv have both sought to buy and develop new drones, deploy them in innovative ways, and seek new ways to destroy them - from using farmers' shotguns to advanced electronic jamming systems.</p>

<p>Moscow has developed a series of electronic "umbrellas" over Moscow, with additional advanced internal layers over strategic buildings, and a complex web of air defences which shoot down the drones before they reach the Kremlin at the heart of the Russian capital.</p>

<p>Both sides have turned cheap commercial drones into deadly weapons while ramping up their own production. Soldiers on both sides have reported the visceral fear of drones - and both sides have used macabre video footage of fatal drone strikes in their propaganda.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has sought to insulate Moscow from the grinding rigours of the war, has called Ukrainian drone attacks that target civilian infrastructure such as nuclear power plants "terrorism" and has vowed a response.</p>

<p>Moscow, by far Russia's richest city, has boomed during the war, buoyed by the biggest defence spending splurge since the Cold War.</p>

<p>There was no sign of panic on Moscow's boulevards. Muscovites walked their dogs while the bells of the onion-domed Russian Orthodox churches rang out across the capital.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">Now, experts have predicted that the President-elect may put more money into the pockets of the Americans through major <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/factbox-what-new-proposals-did-trump-make-during-his-economic-speech-6501352">tax code changes</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">During his campaign trail, Mr Trump put major emphasis on slashing taxes on tips as well as other social security benefits, suggesting a total overhaul of income taxes with the hope of replacing the revenue with tariffs.</p>

<p dir="ltr">According to the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/09/us-news/trump-plans-ambitious-tax-agenda-with-insiders-revealing-how-it-could-put-more-money-in-americans-pockets/" rel="nofollow,noindex">New York Post</a>, the extension and expansion of tax changes are high on Donald Trump's agenda.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Among the wish-list items of the expanded tax cut program, the key focus would be on cutting down corporate tax rates. Earlier, Mr Trump had slashed the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% in 2017. He now plans to bring it down to 15%.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“When you reduce the corporate rate by 2% wages go up 1%, corporations have more money to invest for workers,” the report quoted Grover Norquist, an activist and president of Americans for Tax Reform, as saying.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Not just that, Mr Trump has even promised his voters to reverse a provision of his 2017 <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/president-donald-trump-tax-overhaul-under-intensifying-fire-as-congress-readies-bill-1768800">tax cut package</a> — the $10,000 cap on the famous state and local tax deductions, known as 'SALT'.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This cap majorly targets residents of high-tax 'blue' states wherein the soaring state and local taxes support bloated state bureaucracies. Hence, the promise by Donald Trump to repeal this has the potential to be an early bipartisan win, the New York Post report said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Long Island Democratic Representative Tom Suozzi, a critic of the cap, said he takes Donald Trump at his word, holding him accountable for the promise to eliminate the SALT cap.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"I will work with him and anyone to get things done on behalf of the people,” Mr Suozzi was quoted as saying.</p>

<p dir="ltr">However, insiders have suggested that this repeal can be a significantly heavier lift. “The major problem is it pits high tax states against low tax states. Phil Magness, an economic historian at the Independent Institute, said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Noting that regions like New York, California and New Jersey have high state and local tax rates, Magness said it gives those who live there an advantage in their deductions against the ones who are residing in low-tax areas like Florida or Texas.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A 24-year-old American YouTuber, named Johnny Somali, has apologised after getting involved in a highly controversial incident in Korea.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Mr Somali sparked massive outrage when he kissed the statue of a girl, symbolising Korean victims of wartime sexual slavery, during his visit to Changdong History and Culture Park in Seoul's Dobong district, <a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2024/11/113_385960.html" rel="nofollow noindex">The Korea Times</a> reported.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The apology was shared on the YouTube channel Company on Thursday. In the video, Mr Somali can be seen standing next to the girl's statue and apologising to the Korean public.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"I want to apologise to Koreans. I didn't understand the significance of the statue," Mr Somali said.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Further, Mr Somali explained that his actions were to entertain his viewers in the US. While bowing down, he added in Korean, "I'm truly sorry for being disrespectful."</p>

<p dir="ltr">Mr Somali has also expressed his interest in learning more about the history of Japan's wartime sex slavery and the victims, who are also known as the "comfort women". In the video, Mr Somali shared his willingness to meet the survivors in person and interview them to learn more about their history.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Despite the apology many viewers have expressed doubt on Mr Somali, noting that he has shared multiple controversial photographs and videos on his social media accounts.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Several people have highlighted that Mr Somali hasn't deleted the images and videos of his controversial actions from social media.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">This is not the first time when Mr Somali faced criticism for his actions. A while back, he shared a photograph of himself holding an image of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and said, "I defeated Koreans for you, Shinzo Abe."&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">While the post on YouTube was later deleted, it continued to be visible on Instagram with the caption, "RIP Shinzo Abe, I defeated the Koreans for you!"</p>

<p dir="ltr">On October 31, the Seoul Mapo Police informed that Mr Somali was being investigated for obstruction of business over his behaviour at a convenience store. In addition to this, police are also looking into allegations of alleged assault and drug use as Somali is currently on an "exit ban" that prevents him from leaving the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's new Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday said he was "not prepared" to continue with the previous Conservative government's flagship scheme to deport migrants to Rwanda.</p>

<p>"The Rwanda scheme was dead and buried before it started... I'm not prepared to continue with gimmicks that don't act as a deterrent," he told reporters at his first news conference.</p>

<p>Ex-prime minister Rishi Sunak has staked his political reputation on his plan to "stop the boats", pushing the controversial deportation plan despite opposition from rights groups and judicial rulings.</p>

<p>Labour, however, said it would jettison the scheme to remove people to Rwanda who crossed the English Channel by boat from northern France.</p>

<p>Immigration has become an increasingly central political issue since the United Kingdom left the European Union in 2020, largely on a promise to "take back control" of the country's borders.</p>

<p>Starmer said previously that Sunak's policy was neither a deterrent nor value for money.</p>

<p>He has pledged to tackle the issue "upstream" by smashing the people-smuggling gangs behind the crossings.</p>

<p>Central to the policy would be a new "elite" Border Security Command, comprising immigration and law enforcement specialists, as well as the domestic intelligence service MI5, he has said.</p>

<p>An estimated 12,313 people have made the crossing to Britain so far this year, an 18 percent increase from the same period last year, the UK Home Office said last month.</p>

<p>There were 29,437 arrivals across the whole of 2023, a drop of 36 percent on a record 45,774 arrivals in 2022.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Indian-origin former Conservative Party member of Parliament Alok Sharma, who had chosen not to seek re-election in this weeks general election, will now take his seat in the House of Lords.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian-origin former Conservative Party member of Parliament Alok Sharma, who had chosen not to seek re-election in this week's general election, will now take his seat in the House of Lords after being conferred a peerage by King Charles III.</p>

<p>The 56-year-old Agra-born MP, who was knighted as Sir Alok in the King's New Year's Honours list last year for his contribution to tackling climate change through his leadership as president of the COP26 climate summit over two years ago, now becomes Lord Sharma.</p>

<p>Sharma was among seven nominations made by outgoing prime minister Rishi Sunak for his customary “Dissolution Peerages,” which also saw former Prime Minister Theresa May become a peer in the Upper House of the UK Parliament.</p>

<p>“Humbled to have been appointed to the House of Lords but so sorry to see many fine Conservative candidates lose, including in Reading West &amp; Mid Berkshire,” said Sharma in a post on X on Friday, as his party's disastrous general election results became evident.</p>

<p>His former constituency was won by Labour's Olivia Bailey, who Sharma described as a “decent person who I feel will serve the area diligently.” Sharma's Reading West constituency, like several others across the UK, had undergone a boundary change to become Reading West &amp; Mid Berkshire.</p>

<p>“This has not been an easy decision for me. It has been the honour of my life to serve as the MP for a constituency in the town where I grew up and a privilege to serve in government and represent the UK on the international stage,” Sharma said, when he announced his decision in September last year to not contest the next general election.</p>

<p>“I will continue to support my Conservative colleagues and serve my constituents diligently for the remainder of my time as an MP, as well as champion in Parliament the causes I care deeply about, especially climate action,” he added.</p>

<p>Sharma was selected as a parliamentary candidate in 2006 and has served as a Tory MP since 2010. In his role as Cabinet minister since then, he has been appointed Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and International Development until he was conferred a Cabinet-level role as COP26 president by former PM Boris Johnson in January 2021.</p>

<p>Under Rishi Sunak as prime minister, he was on the House of Commons back benches and often spoke out to express his concerns about the government's delay in certain targets towards meeting the country's climate action Net Zero pledge by 2050.</p>

<p>“Chopping and changing policies creates uncertainty for businesses and the public. Ultimately this makes it more difficult to attract investment and pushes up costs for consumers,” he said.</p>

<p>Sharma was among a series of high-profile Tory colleagues, including former defence secretary Ben Wallace, who had decided not to seek re-election in the 2024 polls.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>India-Iran partnership in various sectors, including connectivity, has expanded tremendously in recent times, especially during the tenure of Iran's late President Seyyed Ebrahim Raisi who passed away in a helicopter crash in May this year.</p>

<p>India had also observed a day's state mourning as a mark of respect to the late Iranian President and other eight people, including the country's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, who lost their lives in the tragic accident.</p>

<p>It was also under India's presidency that Iran joined the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).</p>

<p>Both countries have fast-tracked infrastructure cooperation, focusing especially on the Chabahar project and the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) - the 7,200 km-long multimodal trade corridor linking Russia with India via the ports of Iran.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a mark of reverence on the 89th birthday of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, an icon of ahimsa (non-violence) and karuna (compassion), on Saturday, 'Never Forget Tibet: The Dalai Lama's Untold Story' was released worldwide.</p>

<p>The documentary, directed by Jean-Paul Mertinez, explores details of the Nobel Peace Laureate's incredible escape into exile for the first time on film in his own words, with the Indian political officer who led him to safety -- late Havildar Mander Singh.</p>

<p>Featuring the Tibetan community in exile and those with historic ties to Tibet, the film explores the Dalai Lama's compassion for a world seemingly in crisis today and seeks to find out what can be learnt from his inspirational life story, Tibetan culture and its ancient spirituality.</p>

<p>Inspired by the book 'An Officer and His Holiness' by Rani Singh, the film is narrated by British acting legend Hugh Bonneville (Downton Abbey, Paddington) and features music from Grammy-nominated artist Anoushka Shankar.</p>

<p>The film is produced by Compassionate Films and the Executive Producers are Templeheart Films, Lyndon Baldock, Gavin Patterson and Rani Singh.</p>

<p>The worldwide digital release has been made possible with the collaboration of The Italian Buddhist Union, Rome, Italy.</p>

<p>The feature-length documentary will be available on world's leading streaming platforms, including Apple TV , Amazon and Google Play.</p>

<p>In 1959, the occupying Chinese troops suppressed the Tibetan national uprising in Lhasa and forced the 14th Dalai Lama and over 80,000 Tibetans into exile in India and neighbouring countries.</p>

<p>On reaching India after a three-week-long and treacherous journey, the Dalai Lama first took up residence for about a year in Mussoorie in Uttarakhand.</p>

<p>On March 10, 1960, just before moving to Dharamsala, which also serves as the headquarters of the exiled Tibetan establishment, the Dalai Lama said: "For those of us in exile, I said that our priority must be resettlement and the continuity of our cultural traditions. We, Tibetans, would eventually prevail in regaining freedom for Tibet."</p>

<p>Currently, the government-in-exile is based in Dharamsala, a town in Himalayan foothills where a community of Tibetans lives in exile with the Dalai Lama, hoping to sustain their struggle to secure complete autonomy in their Chinese-ruled homeland, Tibet.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's newly-elected Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday morning and said he stood ready to conclude a Free Trade Agreement that worked for both sides, Downing Street said.</p>

<p>India and the UK have been negotiating a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) for over two years with a Conservative Party-led government but the talks were stalled in the 14th round amidst the general election cycles in both countries.</p>

<p>It is now expected to be picked up by the new Starmer-led Labour government, which was voted in with a landslide this week.</p>

<p>According to the Downing Street readout of the newly-elected UK Prime Minister's Indo-Pacific-related international calls on Saturday, the call with Modi seems to have been the first followed by Japan and Australia.</p>

<p>"The leaders exchanged congratulations on their respective election wins, and reflected on the strength of the relationship between the UK and India," a Downing Street spokesperson said.</p>

<p>"Discussing the Free Trade Agreement, the Prime Minister said he stood ready to conclude a deal that worked for both sides. The leaders hoped to meet at the earliest opportunity," the spokesperson added.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Pleased to speak with <a href="https://twitter.com/Keir_Starmer?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Keir_Starmer</a>. Congratulated him on being elected as the Prime Minister of the UK. We remain committed to deepening Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and robust ??-?? economic ties for the progress and prosperity of our peoples and global good.</p>

<p>Both sides have been working towards clinching a pact to enhance the GBP 38.1 billion bilateral trading partnership since January 2022, when Boris Johnson was the British prime minister.</p>

<p>The talks have since had to contend with political turmoil in the UK that first led to a short-lived Liz Truss premiership followed by Rishi Sunak as Britain's first prime minister of Indian heritage.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world organisation has warned of a “heightened risk of a full-scale war” along the Lebanon-Israel border where 901 Indian peacekeepers are deployed.</p>

<p>“The UN is deeply concerned at the increase in the intensity of exchanges of fire across the Blue Line yesterday, which heightens the risk of a full-scale war”, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres's spokesperson's office said on Friday.</p>

<p>“Escalation can and must be avoided. We reiterate that the danger of miscalculation leading to a sudden and wider conflagration is real,” it added.</p>

<p>After an Israeli drone killed a senior commander of the Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon on Wednesday, the militia responded by sending a barrage of 100 rockets into Israel.</p>

<p>The well-entrenched Hezbollah, which has the backing of Iran has threatened to continue attacks on Israel in solidarity with Hamas under Israeli assault in Gaza.</p>

<p>The decades-long tensions in the area have intensified since October 7 when Hamas attacked Israel, which launched a retribution on Gaza that it controls.</p>

<p>In solidarity with Hamas, Hezbollah said attacks on Israel till there is a ceasefire in Gaza, raising fears of a wider regional conflict.</p>

<p>Civilians have suffered the most from the volley of attacks between Hezbollah and Israel.</p>

<p>About 60,000 Lebanese have reportedly been displaced, and, according to United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken, about 20,000 Israelis have also been forced to flee the border areas because of the attacks.</p>

<p>“Israel has effectively lost its sovereignty in the northern quadrant of its country because people don't safe to go to their homes,” he said on Monday underscoring the risk of war.</p>

<p>He added that an agreement reached through diplomacy was needed to end the security risks and ensure that “forces are pulled back.”</p>

<p>The spokesperson's office also emphasised that a “political and diplomatic solution is the only viable way forward.”</p>

<p>The Indian peacekeepers are a part of the 10,000-strong 49-nation UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) charged by the Security Council to work with Lebanese national forces to keep order in the volatile section known as the Blue Line that separates Lebanon and Israel.</p>

<p>In effect, the mission also acts as a buffer between the two countries at times caught in the crossfire between Israel and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>The spokesperson's office said that the Foreign Affairs Committee of Lebanon's Parliament visited UNIFIL to express support for the mission and its mandate on Thursday.</p>

<p>Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, the UN special coordinator for Lebanon met with Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri and caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati to emphasise “the need for de-escalation across the Blue Line,” it added.</p>

<p>Lebanon's writ is weak in the region where Hezbollah controls vast tracts of territory.</p>

<p>Mohammad Naameh Nasser, who Israel blamed for rockets into the country, was the second Hezbollah commander killed in less than a month.</p>

<p>Last month another Hezbollah commander, Taleb Abdallah, was killed by Israel in Southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>Hezbollah retaliated with about 150 rockets and drones, but international diplomacy kept it from further escalation.</p>

<p>At another peacekeeping mission in the region, the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) charged with maintaining the ceasefire between Israel and Syria, 202 Indian troops are deployed.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Dalai Lama said on Saturday he is recovering from a knee surgery and feels "physically fit", brushing aside rumours of ill health on his 89th birthday.</p>

<p>"Recently I had surgery on my knee, which has given me some problem. However, I am recovering and have no problem at all now," the exiled spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism said in a video message from the United States, where he is recuperating.</p>

<p>"There may be people trying to confuse you about my health, saying that the Dalai Lama has gone to a hospital and is undergoing treatments, and so on, making my condition sound grave. You don't need to trust such misinformation," he said.</p>

<p>A charismatic figure who popularised Buddhism internationally, the Dalai Lama won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for keeping alive the Tibetan cause in exile. He fled to India in 1959, nine years after China sent troops into the Himalayan region in 1950, saying it was liberating Tibetan "serfs".</p>

<p>As the spiritual leader ages and battles health problems, the appointment of his successor has become a looming issue for Tibetans struggling for more autonomy in China or outright independence. Tibetan Buddhists believe that learned monastics are reincarnated after death as newborns.</p>

<p>The Dalai Lama has said he will clarify questions about succession - including whether and where he would be reincarnated - around his 90th birthday.</p>

<p>"I am nearly 90 now but I don't feel unhealthy, except for the slight discomfort in my legs. I would like to thank all my fellow Tibetans in and outside Tibet for your prayers on my birthday," he said, adding that some issues are part of ageing.</p>

<p>On Saturday, tens of thousands of Buddhists and well-wishers around the world are to gather to celebrate and pray for the long life of a leader who for them represents the strongest hope of an eventual return to Tibet.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden fended off questions about his mental fitness and electability on Friday in a TV interview meant to draw a line under a disastrous debate performance that triggered calls for him to quit his re-election bid.</p>

<p>With rebellion brewing among some nervous Democratic voters, lawmakers and donors, the one-to-one with the ABC network was hyped as the most consequential of the 81-year-old president's long career.</p>

<p>But the 22-minute sit-down appeared to provide little reassurance, as Biden blamed sickness for his sub-par performance and repeatedly dismissed polling and fears within his party that the debate had gravely wounded his prospects.</p>

<p>"I was sick, I was feeling terrible... I just had a really bad cold," said the president, in his first unscripted remarks of any length since last week's showdown with Republican rival Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The interview was intended to help Biden weather the storm, but his hoarse voice and meandering answers drew immediate Democratic fire for appearing "out of touch."</p>

<p>Asked if staying in the race might jeopardize Democrats holding on to the White House, Biden said: "I don't think anybody's more qualified to be president or win this race than me."</p>

<p>He dodged calls to have doctors assess his mental acuity, saying that the duties of the presidency mean "I have a cognitive test every single day. Every day I have that test, everything I do."</p>

<p>The Trump campaign mockingly posted on social media that "Biden sounds great" as the broadcast went out, before concluding the president "is in denial and in decline."</p>

<p>The interview came after Biden was hesitant and often incoherent during the debate against Trump in Atlanta, leading to panic within his party and calls for him to pull out of the race.</p>

<p>- 'I'll beat Trump' -</p>

<p>The Biden campaign has pushed back hard on any suggestion he may withdraw and, just hours before the ABC interview, released an aggressive campaign travel schedule for the rest of July.</p>

<p>Appearing at a campaign rally in Madison, Wisconsin, the president delivered an energetic stump speech, unequivocally declaring, "I'm staying in the race. I'll beat Donald Trump."</p>

<p>Post-debate polls have shown a widening deficit in Trump's favor, and at least four Democrats in Congress have called on Biden to step aside, as have major newspapers, donors and a raft of Democratic-supporting political commentators.</p>

<p>Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Mark Warner and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries were both planning crisis talks with lawmakers in the coming days, US media reported.</p>

<p>In Friday's interview, ABC host George Stephanopoulos repeatedly referenced the growing Democratic clamor for a conversation on picking a new candidate, asking Biden if he would step down if convinced he couldn't beat Trump.</p>

<p>"Well, it depends. If the Lord Almighty comes down and tells me that, I might do that," he said.</p>

<p>Biden added that he had not watched the debate afterward, saying "I don't think I did, no."</p>

<p>And he dismissed the idea that his poor performance was a sign of a more serious health problem.</p>

<p>"It was a bad episode, no indication of any serious condition. I was exhausted. I didn't listen to my instincts in terms of preparing and -- and I had a bad night," Biden said.</p>

<p>David Axelrod, a top aide in Barack Obama's White House and an occasional thorn in the side of the Biden administration, said the interview showed a president "dangerously out of touch" with concerns over his fitness for office.</p>

<p>"Four years ago at this time, he was 10 points ahead of Trump (in polls). Today, he is six points behind," Axelrod posted on X.</p>

<p>The White House has announced Biden will visit Pennsylvania this weekend before holding a press conference during the NATO summit in Washington next week.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif will decide the fate of social media platforms such as YouTube, WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok during the Muharram festival as Pak's Punjab government sought a ban on them, citing need to control "hate material.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif would decide the fate of social media platforms such as YouTube, WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok during the Muharram festival as the Punjab government sought a ban on them, citing the need to control "hate material".</p>

<p>Shia Muslims hold large gatherings during the festival to observe the martyrdom of the grandson of the prophet of Islam.</p>

<p>The Muslims generally observe his martyrdom as a symbol of resistance to tyranny, and the Shia Muslims take out rallies during the first ten days of Muharram which culminate into huge processions on the 9th and 10th of the month.</p>

<p>The Sunni Muslims have a historic theological rivalry with the Shias, and Pakistan's extremist Sunni groups brand them as heretics and target them through bombings, with Pakistan witnessing numerous such attacks in the past.</p>

<p>To disrupt communication among the militants, governments in Pakistan traditionally undertake elaborate security measures during Muharram, including suspension of internet, cell phone and social media services to avoid acts of terrorism.</p>

<p>The Punjab government had asked the federal government to suspend access to social media from July 6 to 11 to control the spread of misinformation and hate material to prevent sectarian violence.</p>

<p>This week, the provincial home department, through a letter to the Interior Ministry, recommended suspending "Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube, X, TikTok, etc. across the province".</p>

<p>The Ministry of Interior after a meeting held on Friday deferred a decision on the Punjab government's request, according to an overnight statement.</p>

<p>It stated that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif would make the final decision on the matter, adding that the requests of the provinces had "neither been rejected nor accepted".</p>

<p>The statement did not reveal which provinces other than Punjab had made such requests but indicated that Punjab was not the only one to have sought this.</p>

<p>Muharram is expected to begin on Sunday or Monday on the condition of the sighting of the moon.</p>

<p>Separately, a body of clerics tasked to sight the moon is meeting this evening to decide the beginning of Muharram.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Gelsenkirchen, a city in western Germany, is temporarily renaming itself "Swiftkirchen" in honour of Taylor Swift's upcoming Eras Tour shows.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Gelsenkirchen, a city in western Germany, is temporarily renaming itself "Swiftkirchen" in honour of Taylor Swift's upcoming Eras Tour shows. The city's mayor, Karin Welge, approved the proposal ahead of the popstar's performances from July 17-19.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Taylor Swift is set to perform at three concerts in Gelsenkirchen, and thousands of her fans, known as 'Swifties,' are expected to attend. The city is preparing for the events by putting up signs with the new name, which translates to “Swift's Church.”&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The decision to temporarily change the city's name was taken after Aleshanee Westhoff from Emmerich, a fan of Taylor, started a petition and even wrote to Mayor Welge about this.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"It's a great idea to temporarily rename Gelsenkirchen to 'Swiftkirchen', which is why I'm particularly pleased that you can experience the short-term 'renaming' of Gelsenkirchen live and up close in Gelsenkirchen today," Mr Welge said in a letter to Westhoff, according to an official release.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Also, the first signage that marks the entrance to "Swiftkirchen" has also been installed by Westhoff on Ebertstrasse, the release stated.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Markus Schwardtmann, the head of the city's public relations department, said, "Today is the starting signal. We will be installing many more signs in highly frequented places in Gelsenkirchen in the coming days".</p>

<p dir="ltr">Besides, a "Taylor Swift tram" from Bogestra is already said to be on the road and will be making an attractive selfie motif, the release said, while highlighting the red frames that have been set up all over the city.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Taylor Swift will also receive her own stone on the Gelsenkirchen Walk of Fame, alongside local notables like soccer coach Rudi Assauer and writer Ilse Kibgis.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"There will be many small and large surprises so that the Swifties in Gelsenkirchen have a lot to discover," Mr Schwardtmann said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Not just that, the German city will even be hosting a "big open-air Taylor Swift party,” which has been named “Taylor Town”. It will feature “lots of offers (swap market, karaoke, tattoos) related to the star."</p>

<p dir="ltr">"As mayor, I am of course very happy that Taylor Swift, currently the most successful singer in the world, will be performing three times in Gelsenkirchen. International attention will therefore be back on our city immediately after EURO 2024," Mayor Welge said in the official statement.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Taylor Swift is used to such adulation. At the beginning of the Eras Tour in March last year, Arizona's Glendale was temporarily renamed as “Swift City” in honour of the singer's tour stop in the city.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) said on Saturday that China's largest coastguard vessel has anchored in Manila's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the South China Sea, and is meant to intimidate its smaller Asian neighbour.</p>

<p>The China coastguard's 165-meter 'monster ship' entered Manila's 200-nautical mile EEZ on July 2, spokesperson for the PCG Jay Tarriela told a news forum.</p>

<p>The PCG warned the Chinese vessel it was in the Philippine's EEZ and asked about their intentions, he said.</p>

<p>"It's an intimidation on the part of the China Coast Guard," Tarriela said. "We're not going to pull out and we're not going to be intimidated."</p>

<p>China's embassy in Manila and the Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China's coast guard has no publicly available contact information.</p>

<p>The Chinese ship, which has also deployed a small boat, was anchored 800 yards away from the PCG's vessel, Tarriela said.</p>

<p>In May, the PCG deployed a ship to the Sabina shoal to deter small-scale reclamation by China, which denied the claim. China has carried out extensive land reclamation on some islands in the South China Sea, building air force and other military facilities, causing concern in Washington and around the region.</p>

<p>China claims most of the South China Sea, a key conduit for $3 trillion of annual ship-borne trade, as its own territory. Beijing rejects the 2016 ruling by The Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration which said its expansive maritime claims had no legal basis.</p>

<p>Following a high-level dialogue, the Philippines and China agreed on Tuesday for the need to "restore trust" and "rebuild confidence" to better manage maritime disputes.</p>

<p>The Philippines has turned down offers from the United States, its treaty ally, to assist operations in the South China Sea, despite a flare-up with China over routing resupply missions to Filipino troops on a contested shoal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Reformist Masoud Pezeshkian won Iran's presidential runoff election on Saturday, defeating hardliner Saeed Jalili by a margin of around 2.8 million votes.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The 69-year-old president-elect aims to improve relations with the West and ease the mandatory headscarf law. While Pezeshkian respects Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's authority and seeks no major changes to Iran's government, he faces significant challenges – opposition from hardliners, the Israel-Hamas conflict, and Western concerns about Iran's nuclear program.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Here are some facts about Masoud Pezeshkian:</strong></h2>

<ol>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Masoud Pezeshkian was born on September 29, 1954, in Mahabad, West Azerbaijan, to an Azeri father and a Kurdish mother. He speaks Azeri and focuses&nbsp;on the affairs of Iran's minority ethnic groups. Mr Pezeshkian lost his wife Fatemeh Majidi and one of his daughters in a car accident in 1994. He chose not to remarry and raised his two other sons and daughter alone.</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">He is a heart surgeon and has served as the head of the Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. He became a combatant and physician during the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), dispatching medical teams to the front lines.</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Masoud Pezeshkian served as the Minister of Health, Treatment, and Medical Education under President Mohammad Khatami's administration. He has been a member of the Iranian Parliament, representing Tabriz, Azarshahr, and Osku across multiple terms (8th to 12th).&nbsp;He served as the first Deputy Speaker from 2016 to 2020.</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The 69-year-old had registered for presidential elections in 2011 and 2021. He withdrew in 2011 and was disqualified in 2021. In the 2024 presidential run, Pezeshkian campaigned with the slogan "For Iran," aiming to contrast his policies with those of his opponent Saeed Jalili.</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Masoud Pezeshkian has been involved in several controversies. He attended the autopsy of Iranian-Canadian photojournalist Zahra Kazemi in 2003, who was detained, tortured, and died in custody. He cited intracranial hemorrhaging as the cause of death but claimed there were no signs of bruising or cuts, contradicting international outcry and demands for an investigation.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">In 2017, Pezeshkian admitted to being among the first to prohibit women not wearing hijab from entering universities and hospitals in 1978, even before the mandatory hijab policy was officially introduced. In 2022, after Mahsa Amini's death, he said it was “unacceptable in the Islamic Republic” to arrest a girl for not wearing a hijab and then return her dead body to her family.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Akshata Murty stood by her husband Rishi Sunak as he delivered his final speech outside 10 Downing Street following a crushing loss to the Labour Party in the UK elections. While the results and the Conservative Party's future were the primary topics of discussion, social media couldn't help but fixate on Ms Murty's dress.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Her red, white and blue chevron gown, identified as the 395 pound (Rs 42,000) Lina Dress from designer Omi Na Na, drew significant attention. Comments ranged from the colour scheme to the design, and even to the price tag. Although she was in the background, her outfit sparked speculation, with some wondering if her bold fashion choice – featuring the colours of the UK flag – was a tactical move to make a subtle statement amid the country's changing political dynamics.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Akshata Murty's dress is absolutely perfect for the occasion. The multi-layered symbolism is *chef's kiss*,” a user wrote on social media platform X.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p dir="ltr">Rishi Sunak holds the distinction of being the richest person to have served as the Prime Minister of the UK. His wife Akshata Murty adds to their financial status as the daughter of Narayana Murthy, the billionaire founder of Infosys. According to the <a href="http:// https://www.thetimes.com/sunday-times-rich-list/profile/article/rishi-sunak-and-akshata-murty-net-worth-sunday-times-rich-list-blp6mk660 ">Sunday Times' 2024 Rich List</a>, the couple's combined fortune is estimated at an impressive 651 million pounds. This immense wealth makes them the wealthiest inhabitants of 10 Downing Street to date.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>People in the UK woke to a new dawn on Friday, with the Labour Party winning a landslide victory under its leader, Keir Starmer. The first Prime Minister of Indian origin, Rishi Sunak led his Conservative Party to its worst defeat in modern times. Its vote share fell to just 25.8% - worse than the previous lowest of 29.25% recorded by the Duke of Wellington in the 1832 election.</p>

<p>Although Sunak retained his own seat - Richmond and Northallerton in Yorkshire - about a dozen of his cabinet ministers lost theirs, including Penny Mordaunt, who was tipped as a future leader of the Conservative Party, and Defence Minister Grant Shapps. Some of the seats the party lost in Thursday's election had been Conservative for over a century.</p>

<p>The former prime minister, Liz Truss, whose unfunded tax cuts crashed the British economy in 2022 and forced her to resign in just 45 days in office, also lost. It was her resignation that had brought Sunak to power, seen in the Conservative Party then as the only person who could be trusted to fix the broken economy.</p>

<h2><strong>People Wanted Change</strong></h2>

<p>The main reason for the Conservatives' defeat was that people were crying for change after 14 years of rule. Although Sunak was able to immediately stabilise the economy, it was not an easy task to fix something that had been badly hit by Brexit, Covid, and the Russia-Ukraine war. It was during this time that India replaced Britain as the fifth-largest economy.</p>

<p>Sunak may have known a thing or two about business and economics, but he was never a popular politician. He lacked charisma and sound political judgment and was often accused of being a weak leader. Despite his promises and efforts, he could not improve the National Health Service and stop the small boats of illegal migrants reaching UK shores.</p>

<p>Although a former Brexiteer and right-of-centre politician, Sunak was regularly attacked by supporters of former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who blamed him for his forced resignation. He also remained under fire during his time as prime minister from a group of ambitious right-wing fellow MPs, including Suella Braverman, another Indian-origin MP, who had been sacked by Sunak as Home Minister.</p>

<h2><strong>The Reform Juggernaut</strong></h2>

<p>But the most crucial factor that hit Sunak and his Conservative Party in this election was a right-wing party: Reform. Led by a firebrand veteran anti-immigration politician, Nigel Farage, Reform took sizable chunks of Conservative votes across the country, costing them at least a hundred seats. Farage himself got elected this time to parliament after seven failed attempts previously. Three other members of his party have also been elected.</p>

<p>It is a spectacular victory for Labour in Britain, a left-of-centre party. This is even more remarkable considering how much of Europe is tilting towards the far-right, with six countries in the continent having hard-right governments. Labour's victory is close to the one it achieved under the 43-year-old Tony Blair, when it won 418 seats with 43% of the vote. In this election, Labour under Starmer has won 412 seats with only 35% vote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, why is Labour's vote share in this election not that remarkable? Firstly, like Sunak, Starmer is also not a charismatic politician. Coming from a working-class background, he is a former human rights lawyer but not a popular person outside his own party. Many traditional Labour voters were angry with him for bringing the party to the centre and abandoning its socialist principles, and for his support for Israel. It lost a few seats to independents in sizable Muslim areas who successfully fought a pro-Palestinian campaign.</p>

<p>Some Labour supporters unhappy with Starmer's environment policy defected to the Greens, who won four seats in the parliament for the first time.</p>

<p>Jeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the Labour Party and a critic of India, won as an independent as he was expelled from Labour over his remarks about anti-Semitism.</p>

<h2><strong>How Indians Voted</strong></h2>

<p>A sizable number of Indians also voted against Labour and helped overturn a traditional Labour seat in Leicester in middle England in favour of the Conservatives. Shivani Raja's victory in Leicester East was one of the few good things in this election for Sunak's party. Bob Blackman, a vocal supporter of India in the British parliament, also retained his Harrow East seat by a big margin. It also indicated that at least some Indians have remained loyal to the Conservatives.</p>

<p>Although India got independence from Britain under a Labour government, in recent times, India's relations have been better under the Conservatives. Within the Labour Party, there is a strong pro-Pakistan lobby that tries to influence policy, though not very successfully. This has alienated many Indians.</p>

<p>But Keir Starmer is a pragmatic politician. As prime minister, he will try to retain good relations with India, though one would expect a Labour government to criticise India for its human rights violations and any unfair treatment of minorities.</p>

<p>One of Starmer's priorities will be to conclude a free trade agreement with India, on which the previous government already had done a lot of groundwork. Indian students, health workers, financial and computer experts play a key role in the British economy and the wider society. That is unlikely to change under the new government in Britain.</p>

<h2><strong>The Rocky Road Ahead</strong></h2>

<p>Like the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in India, Conservatives have a formidable election machine. So, after a postmortem and some recriminations, the party is expected to reorganise, as it has done in the past. But the scale of defeat will take them much longer this time to fully recover.</p>

<p>Rishi Sunak is expected to resign from the party leadership, but he will stay a little longer until a new leader is elected. He has already promised to stay in parliament despite reports that he may return to the US to take a lucrative job in the corporate world. The election of a new leader will show where the party intends to head. The challenge of Nigel Farage's Reform Party will tempt the Conservatives to push to the right. But there are others in the party who will argue that it needs to get back to the centre if it wants to defeat Labour in the next election.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Masoud Pezeshkian emerges victorious from Iran's presidential election, defeating hardliner Saeed Jalili, his presidency promises a shift towards more pragmatic and reformist policies. But how will Mr Pezeshkian's presidency reshape Iran-India relations?</p>

<p>Mr Pezeshkian, a seasoned lawmaker and cardiac surgeon, has long supported both domestic and international reforms in Iran. His win is viewed as a call for change since it follows a general unhappiness with the hardline policies of his predecessors. But the dynamics of Iranian politics, where hardliners still control the majority and the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei retains ultimate authority, will put Mr Pezeshkian's ability to carry out his vision to the test.</p>

<p><strong>READ </strong>| <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/iran-reformist-masoud-pezeshkian-leads-in-runoff-vote-against-hardline-candidate-saeed-jalili-6044941">Iran Reformist Pezeshkian Defeats Hardliner Jalili In Presidential Polls</a></p>

<p>"Today, we are holding the second round of the presidential election. More than 700 polling centres are accepting the vote of Iranians. We hope that by tomorrow morning we will have a new president. There will be no changes in Iranian foreign policy and internal policy. Both discourses emphasise strengthening Iranian power internally and externally," said Iran's ambassador to India, Iraj Elahi.</p>

<h3><strong>India-Iran Ties</strong></h3>

<p>India and Iran have historically enjoyed strong economic ties. Under Pezeshkian's presidency, these ties are likely to deepen.</p>

<p>The focus will be especially on the strategic Chabahar Port, a project to which India has already committed heavy investments. It is an important transit point for trade with Afghanistan and Central Asia, bypassing Pakistan. India has pledged $120 million for the development of the Shahid-Beheshti Port terminal and offered a $250 million credit line for infrastructure projects in Iran. Experts believe that Iran's general foreign policy is unlikely to change whoever takes over next; modus operandi and details may, however, be different.</p>

<p>Iran is one of India's key sources of crude oil. With Iran eyeing an increase in the exports of oil against the backdrop of ongoing Western sanctions, India could be looking at a reliable and arguably cheaper source of crude oil.</p>

<p>The Pezeshkian approach to regional security will be closely watched in New Delhi. His stand related to keeping up the Axis of Resistance" against Israel and strategic regional siding with forces against what he calls "the Zionist regime" could continue to impact India's tightrope diplomacy in the region.</p>

<p>Another platform for close cooperation between India and Iran is the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), a multi-modal transportation route connecting India to Russia via Iran. This corridor increases connectivity in terms of trade and bilateral ties for regional stability.</p>

<h3><strong>Iran Elections</strong></h3>

<p>The presidential election in Iran takes place in the backdrop of former President Ebrahim Raisi passing away in a helicopter crash on May 19. The polls saw the lowest turnout of voters since the 1979 Islamic Revolution as only 39.92 per cent of eligible voters took part.</p>

<p>The Iranian government had predicted, and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei forecasted a higher turnout. State television showed modest lines at polling centres, while online videos depicted empty polls and light traffic at some sites in the capital, Tehran, reportedly with a heavy security presence.</p>

<p>The elections were held amid heightened regional tensions. In April, for instance, Iran launched its first direct attack on Israel amid the latter's ongoing aggression in Gaza. This was then followed by an intensification of attacks by militant groups, including Lebanon's Hezbollah and the Houthis of Yemen, both armed by Tehran.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While Ayatollah Khamenei has the last word on state affairs, it remains to be seen if the Middle Eastern nation adopts a change in its foreign policy in light of recent events.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Iran's reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian on Saturday won a runoff presidential election against ultraconservative Saeed Jalili, interior ministry said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian on Saturday won a runoff presidential election against ultraconservative Saeed Jalili, the interior ministry said.<br />
Pezeshkian received more than 16 million votes and Jalili more than 13 million out of about 30 million votes cast, electoral authority spokesman Mohsen Eslami said, adding that voter turnout stood at 49.8 percent.</p>

<p>The number of spoiled ballots was reported to be over 600,000.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian said the vote was the start of a "partnership" with the Iranian people.</p>

<p>"The difficult path ahead will not be smooth except with your companionship, empathy, and trust. I extend my hand to you," Pezeshkian said in a post on social media platform X, after on Tuesday saying he would "extend the hand of friendship to everyone" if he won.</p>

<p>The election, called early after the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash, followed a first round marked by a historically low turnout last week.</p>

<p>Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who wields ultimate authority, had called for a higher turnout in the runoff, emphasising the importance of the election.</p>

<p>He said the first round turnout was lower than expected, but added that it was not an act "against the system".</p>

<p>The ballot comes against a backdrop of heightened regional tensions over the Gaza war, a dispute with the West over Iran's nuclear programme, and domestic discontent over the state of Iran's sanctions-hit economy.</p>

<h2>Reformist support</h2>

<p>In last week's first round, Pezeshkian, who was the only reformist allowed to stand, won the largest number of votes, around 42 percent, while Jalili came second with around 39 percent, according to figures from Iran's elections authority.</p>

<p>Only 40 percent of Iran's 61 million eligible voters took part in the first round -- the lowest turnout in any presidential election since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.</p>

<p>The candidacy of Pezeshkian, a relative unknown until recently, has raised the hopes of Iran's reformists after years of dominance by the conservative and ultraconservative camps</p>

<p>Iran's main reformist coalition supported Pezeshkian, with endorsements by former presidents Mohammad Khatami and Hassan Rouhani, a moderate.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian, a 69-year-old heart surgeon, has called for "constructive relations" with Western countries to revive the nuclear deal in order to "get Iran out of its isolation".</p>

<p>Jalili, 58, is Iran's former nuclear negotiator who is widely recognised for his uncompromising anti-West stance.</p>

<p>During his campaign, he rallied a substantial base of hardline supporters and received backing from other conservative figures.</p>

<p>Ahead of Friday's runoff, Pezeshkian and Jalili took part in two televised debates during which they discussed the low turnout, as well as Iran's economic woes, international relations and internet restrictions.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian vowed to ease long-standing internet restrictions and to "fully" oppose police patrols enforcing the mandatory headscarf for women, a high-profile issue since the death in police custody in 2022 of Mahsa Amini.</p>

<p>The 22-year-old Iranian Kurd had been detained for an alleged breach of the dress code and her death sparked months of nationwide unrest.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Catholic Church is to pay 104 million Canadian dollars ($76 million) to hundreds of victims of sexual abuse from eastern Canada, according to a statement released Friday.</p>

<p>In 2020 the Archdiocese of St. John was found liable for one of Canada's largest child sex abuse scandals, at Mount Cashel Orphanage, a now-defunct boy's orphanage in Newfoundland and Labrador province.</p>

<p>The court found sexual abuse was perpetrated by priests and other church officials at the orphanage starting in 1940 and continued over the course of several decades.</p>

<p>A total of 292 victims will receive payouts ranging from 55,000 to 850,000 Canadian dollars, according to the report seen by AFP.</p>

<p>Accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young has been tapped as a third-party intermediary to determine the amount distributed to each victim.</p>

<p>Geoff Budden, one of the attorneys representing the victims, told AFP the amount was in line with "similar compensation from other courts."</p>

<p>"People didn't really grasp the scale of the problem and how widespread the abuse was," he said.</p>

<p>The Archdiocese of St. John declared bankruptcy in 2021, though it has raised 40 million Canadian dollars through selling buildings that belonged to it.</p>

<p>However, Budden said he is optimistic that the victims will receive the full amount awarded by the court.</p>

<p>"There are still assets that need to be processed, including insurance products," he said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A disturbing incident of medical negligence has come to light in Pakistan, where hospital authorities have been accused of swapping a baby boy with a dead baby girl, the <em>Dawn </em>reported. According to an official statement, the parents brought their four-day-old sick baby boy to a Children's Hospital in Lahore after he fell ill. During the treatment, doctors at the hospital declared the boy dead and handed over the body to his father. But when the father took the body to his hometown, Gujranwala, for burial, he was shocked to find it was a girl. He immediately rushed back to the hospital with the body of the girl, claiming that they had brought their baby boy for treatment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1843699/childrens-hospital-replaces-sick-baby-boy-with-dead-girl"><em>Dawn</em></a>, this incident has prompted an investigation. After learning of the shocking accusations, the hospital authorities launched an inquiry into the matter. Later, the hospital authorities found that the baby boy had reportedly gone "missing," the official said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In his formal complaint, the father detailed the sequence of events and accused the hospital of substituting his son with the dead girl's body. He urged the police to lodge a case against the hospital's managerial officials and the doctors concerned for committing the crime and demanded the recovery of his son.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Punjab Health Department in Pakistan swiftly responded to the incident, forming an inquiry committee comprising three senior doctors from the Children's Hospital. The team was tasked with conducting a thorough investigation and submitting a detailed report to uncover the truth, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1843831">outlet</a>.</p>

<p>In its findings, the committee declared that the investigating officers questioned all the relevant staff, including doctors, nurses and paramedics, who remained at the neonatal unit where the baby boy was provided treatment. They also examined the footage of the CCTV cameras.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During their investigation, the hospital management claimed that the parents had themselves taken away the male baby from the hospital against medical advice, without explaining the issue of baby "exchange". The report also stated that the condition of the newborn got critical despite all possible treatments, and the doctors shifted him to the high-dependency unit to put him on ventilator support. However, the parents of the patient refused to get further treatment and left the hospital along with the baby after signing the Leave Against Medical Advice form, the report said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The report did not address the issue of the alleged exchange of the babies. Meanwhile, police have lodged an FIR on the complaint regarding the alleged swapping of the baby boy with the dead baby girl by the hospital staff. The investigation is ongoing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In his first television interview since the CNN debate with Donald Trump, President Joe Biden candidly addressed his performance, describing it as a "bad episode" and taking full responsibility for what transpired.</p>

<p>ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos interviewed Biden in Madison, Wisconsin, following a rally with Democratic supporters where Biden reiterated his commitment to staying in the race.</p>

<p>Stephanopoulos didn't waste time delving into the debate, acknowledging Biden's team's characterisation of it as a "bad night." Biden concurred, straightforwardly admitting, "Sure did."</p>

<p>The conversation then turned to remarks made by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who queried whether the debate was indicative of a more serious underlying issue. "It was a bad episode," Biden clarified. "No indication of any serious condition. I was exhausted. I didn't listen to my instincts in terms of preparing and -- and a bad night."</p>

<p>Regarding his preparation leading up to the debate, which followed his international trip to France for the D-Day anniversary and subsequent rest at Camp David, the anchor asked why the recovery time wasn't sufficient. Biden explained, "Because I was sick. I was feeling terrible." He disclosed that medical tests ruled out COVID-19 but confirmed he had been battling a severe cold.</p>

<p>The anchor inquired if Biden had watched the debate footage afterward. Biden admitted, "I don't think I did, no."</p>

<p>Pressed on whether he realised how poorly it was going while on stage, Biden acknowledged, "Yeah, look. The whole way I prepared, nobody's fault, mine. Nobody's fault but mine."</p>

<p>He reflected on his preparation style and how he adapted it inappropriately for the debate setting, saying, "I prepared what I usually would do sitting down as I did come back with foreign leaders or the National Security Council for explicit detail. And I realised-- partway through that, you know, all-- I get quoted the New York Times had me down, ten points before the debate, nine now, or whatever the hell it is. The fact of the matter is that what I looked at is that he also lied 28 times. I couldn't-- I mean, the way the debate ran, not-- my fault, nobody else's fault, no one else's fault."</p>

<p>"But it seemed like you were having trouble from the first question in, even before he spoke?" Stephanopoulos asked.</p>

<p>"Well, I just had a bad night," Biden said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden vowed Friday to stay in the White House race and blamed his dismal debate performance on "feeling terrible" due to a cold, as he sought to save his reelection campaign with a make-or-break TV interview.</p>

<p>As rebellion brews among some nervous Democratic voters, lawmakers and donors, the one-to-one with the ABC network was hyped as the most consequential of the 81-year-old's long career.</p>

<p>"I was sick, I was feeling terrible... We were trying to figure out what's wrong," the president said in an excerpt of his first TV interview since the debate with Donald Trump.</p>

<p>"They did a test to see whether or not I had some infection, you know, a virus. I didn't. I just had a really bad cold."</p>

<p>Biden sounded raspy and gave meandering answers in the clip, which appeared unlikely to reassure Democrats.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign offered a lightning-quick mocking reaction, posting on X that "Biden sounds great!"</p>

<p>The sit-down -- which was due to be aired in full later Friday, came after Biden's debate in Atlanta triggered panic within his party and calls for him to pull out of the race.</p>

<p>The Biden campaign has pushed back hard on any suggestion he may withdraw and, just hours before the ABC interview, released an aggressive campaign travel schedule for the rest of July.</p>

<p>Appearing at a campaign rally in Madison, Wisconsin, the president delivered an energetic stump speech, unequivocally declaring, "I'm staying in the race. I'll beat Donald Trump."</p>

<p>As supporters cheered, he went on the attack against his rival.</p>

<p><strong>- Polls tip toward Trump -</strong></p>

<p>"Let's focus on what really matters," Biden said, reading from teleprompters. "We're running against the biggest liar and the biggest threat... to our democracy in American history -- that's not hyperbole."</p>

<p>Post-debate polls have shown a widening deficit in Trump's favor, and at least three Democrats in Congress have called on Biden to step aside, as have several major newspapers and a raft of Democratic-supporting political commentators.</p>

<p>Wealthy Disney heiress and Democratic supporter Abigail Disney, told CNBC she plans to withhold donations to the party until Biden drops out, saying bluntly that "if Biden does not step down the Democrats will lose" in November.</p>

<p>"This is realism, not disrespect," she said.</p>

<p>Senate Intelligence Committee chariman Mark Warner has approached fellow Democrats to organize talks on Monday on Biden's path forward, multiple US media outlets reported.</p>

<p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries was convening his own meeting -- a video call with senior Democrats -- on Sunday, according to NBC News.</p>

<p>Former US House speaker Nancy Pelosi, one of the most influential Democratic voices, has deemed it "essential" he do more major interviews to prove himself.</p>

<p>The White House has announced he will hold a press conference during the NATO summit in Washington next Thursday, but has not revealed any details on its format or length.</p>

<p>Biden's travel plans include Pennsylvania this weekend, then the NATO meeting, and back on the campaign trail with a swing through the American Southwest.</p>

<p>The president will "engage in frequent off-the-cuff moments over the course of the month, as he has consistently throughout this campaign," his team said, seeking to emphasize his folksy charm.</p>

<p>Trump has meanwhile dared Biden to another debate, or an "all-on discussion," saying he was ready "anytime, anywhere, any place."</p>

<p>With speculation swirling over a potential switch in the Democratic ticket, Kamala Harris, the nation's first female vice president, has suddenly been in the spotlight.</p>

<p>The 59-year-old former prosecutor has offered unwavering support for Biden in public but is standing by as a leading alternative if he steps aside.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

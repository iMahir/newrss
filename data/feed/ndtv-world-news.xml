       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Of the view that the comeback of president-elect Donald Trump is the American comeback, entrepreneur-turned-politician Vivek Ramaswamy on Wednesday said that the country deserves a "badass commander-in-chief" right now and that's exactly what it got.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, not only won the November 5 presidential elections in both popular votes and electoral college votes but also got the Republican Party control of the House of Representatives and the Senate.</p>

<p>"Here's the reason why Donald Trump won by the largest margin of any president in modern history. He's not an ideologue. He's not a policy wonk. He's an American badass. They tried to DQ him, jail him, kill him (twice). None of it worked. Our self-appointed 'betters' in the media misunderstood him, underestimated him, doubted him," Ramaswamy said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"But not once during this campaign did Trump misunderstand, underestimate, or doubt himself. As everyone at Mar-a-Lago celebrated around him last night, I watched him unfazed, with full conviction that he was exactly where he was destined to be," he said.</p>

<p>"He's just like our nation in that way. We've always believed it was our manifest destiny to be exceptional, to be the greatest nation on Earth, to show the world what's possible for humanity to achieve, even when other countries doubted us. Some still do today," Ramaswamy said.</p>

<p>"But they're wrong. Trump's comeback is the American comeback. Our nation deserves a badass commander-in-chief right now and that's exactly what we got. Funny how well our democracy actually works," said the former Republican presidential aspirant.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden hoped Kamala Harris would salvage his legacy as the man who saved America from Donald Trump. Instead, it lies in tatters.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old's pride made him resist growing concerns about his age, health and mental acuity until it was too late, and a disastrous debate against Trump forced him to drop his bid for a second term barely three months before Election Day.</p>

<p>Biden cast the decision as a move to "pass the torch" to a new generation of leadership in the form of his vice president, whom he endorsed as the new Democratic nominee.</p>

<p>Had Harris won, the rows over his age and refusal to bow out earlier would have been forgiven by the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>Biden would have been able to celebrate a list of achievements in his one term that included guiding the country out of the Covid crisis, passing historic legislation, building infrastructure and promoting green energy.</p>

<p>On the foreign front he helped Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion and hoped, against hope, that he could still end Israel's conflict in Gaza.</p>

<p>US presidents famously always have an eye on the way they will be judged by history, and it was therefore in his interest that Harris should win against Trump.</p>

<p>Harris was "very much a legacy project," for Biden, said Frank Sesno, a professor at George Washington University and former White House correspondent.</p>

<p>But Democrats are now likely to judge Biden far more harshly.</p>

<p>His bid for a second term was "perhaps a little bit of arrogance, or over-reaching," Alex Keena, an associate professor of political science at Virginia Commonwealth University, told AFP.</p>

<p>Back in 2020 Biden had run on a promise to be a transitional president, but his decision to seek four more years meant that when he dropped out there was no time for a proper primary to find a replacement.</p>

<p>"It was a missed opportunity for the Democrats to nominate someone with broad appeal," said Keena.</p>

<p>"Granted, they might have nominated Kamala Harris... but as a result, the country didn't get a chance to really know Kamala Harris or see her fight for the Democratic base."</p>

<p>- 'Terrible feeling' -</p>

<p>In fact Biden had convinced himself that having beaten Trump once, he was the only man who could beat him again.</p>

<p>It was in character for a proud and often stubborn man who loved to cite his family's mantra that "when you get knocked down, get back up again."</p>

<p>From playground punch-ups to a stutter to the terrible tragedy of losing his wife and baby daughter in a car crash, Biden had long seen his life as a series of comebacks against impossible odds.</p>

<p>Biden even said Trump's first term was an "aberration."</p>

<p>But now it is Trump making the comeback -- and it is Biden's single term in office that will be the outlier between two Trump terms.</p>

<p>Biden's remaining two and a half months in office will see him try to salvage what he can of the legacy he craves.</p>

<p>The Democrat began the effort within hours of Trump's victory, reaching out to invite him to the White House and promising a peaceful transition of power -- a stark contrast to the Republican's unprecedented refusal to do the same when he lost to Biden.</p>

<p>He will address the nation on Thursday to "discuss the election results and the transition," the White House said.</p>

<p>Biden is seeking to seize the moral high ground over a man who not only wouldn't accept the 2020 election result, but tried to hold onto power, stymied the transition process and refused to attend the incoming Democrat's inauguration.</p>

<p>But it won't come easy.</p>

<p>"That's got to be a terrible feeling," said Keena, adding that Biden would have to "make a decision about how cordial he is."</p>

<p>Biden will also know that Trump is likely to immediately set about dismantling key parts of his achievements, from green energy to his backing of Ukraine.</p>

<p>"Knowing that Trump is going to try very hard to undo his legacy, it has to be that has to be a terrible way to go out for somebody who's served for so many years in public service," Keena added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia will move to pass new laws banning children under 16 from social media, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Thursday, vowing to crack down on tech companies failing to protect young users.</p>

<p>"This one is for the mums and dads. Social media is doing real harm to kids and I'm calling time on it," he told reporters.</p>

<p>Albanese first mooted a social media age limit earlier this year, but it is the first time he has put a firm number on it.</p>

<p>Tech giants and social media platforms will bear the responsibility for ensuring users are old enough, Albanese said, rather than parents who were "worried sick about the safety of their kids online".</p>

<p>"The onus will not be on parents or young people. There will be no penalties for users."</p>

<p>Earlier proposals to introduce a social media age limit have enjoyed broad bipartisan support in Australia.</p>

<p>Albanese said the new laws would be presented to state and territory leaders this week, before being introduced to parliament in late November.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Obama's comments stand in stark contrast with Trump's unprecedented refusal four years ago to concede defeat to Joe Biden, culminating with the violent attack by his supporters on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.</p>

<p>"This is obviously not the outcome we had hoped for," Obama said in a statement. "But living in a democracy is about recognizing that our point of view won't always win out, and being willing to accept the peaceful transfer of power."</p>

<p>The ex-president also voiced pride over the efforts of Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate Tim Walz, who were soundly beaten in the election.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Wednesday fired his rebellious Finance Minister Christian Lindner, spelling doom for the three-party coalition though Scholz could stay on in a minority government.</p>

<p>The move came after weeks of bitter feuding that have rocked the coalition government between Scholz's Social Democrats, Lindner's Free Democrats and the Greens.</p>

<p>Scholz fired his finance minister during a crunch meeting of senior figures from all three ideologically disparate parties at the chancellery, Scholz's spokesman Steffen Hebestreit told AFP.</p>

<p>The chancellery scheduled a press conference for 2015 GMT, and Lindner announced statements to the media shortly after, to be followed by Greens politicians.</p>

<p>Fiscal hawk Lindner had proposed sweeping reforms to jumpstart the troubled German economy that the other two parties opposed, and had long flirted with bolting the unhappy coalition.</p>

<p>He had repeatedly warned of "an autumn of decisions" as difficult budget talks have loomed.</p>

<p>Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck of the Greens had warned that the US presidential election, Germany's economic woes and the Ukraine and Middle East wars make this "the worst time for the government to fail".</p>

<p>The Bild daily reported that on Wednesday he told the other parties that the talks of recent days had shown there was not enough common ground on economic and financial policy.</p>

<p>Lindner had argued that Donald Trump's US presidential election victory had made an economic turnaround even more urgent.</p>

<p>The newspaper added that Lindner had suggested that the parties opt for new elections in early 2025, but that Scholz had rejected the proposal.</p>

<p>If confirmed, this would suggest the Social Democrats and the Greens will seek to stay in power as a minority government until scheduled elections in September 2025.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris conceded the presidential election to Donald Trump after an acrimonious, turbulent and polarising campaign. In her speech, the Democratic leader said though she has conceded the election, she has not conceded "the fight that fuelled this campaign."</p>

<p>"While I concede the election, I do not concede the fight that fuelled this campaign. Fight for freedom, opportunity, dignity for all people," Ms Harris said in a speech that lasted less than 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Her supporters cheered, even though she admitted it was painful to lose. She told them to "keep fighting".</p>

<p>"... I will close with this. Only when it is dark enough, can you see the stars. I know many people feel we are entering a dark time... Let us fill the sky with the light of billions and billions of stars, the light of truth, optimism and service," she said.</p>

<p>"The outcome of this election is not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for, but hear me when I say that the light of America's promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting," she told supporters.</p>

<p>"We must accept the results of this election. Earlier today, I spoke with President-elect Trump and congratulated him on his victory," Ms Harris told supporters in the concession speech at her alma mater Howard University in Washington.</p>

<p>"I also told him that we will help him and his team with their transition, and that we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power," she said.</p>

<p>Mr Trump's victory, following one of the most hostile campaigns in modern US history, was all the more remarkable given an unprecedented criminal conviction, a near-miss assassination attempt, and warnings from a former chief of staff that he is a "fascist."</p>

<p>Mr Trump had never conceded defeat four years ago when his supporters ransacked the US Capitol. He returned to the White House with wider margins than before despite a criminal conviction, two impeachments while last in office and warnings from his former chief of staff that he was a "fascist."</p>

<p>At 78, Mr Trump will be the oldest President during his inauguration scheduled on January 20. Had Ms Harris won, she would have been the first woman president of the US. "It's a political victory that our country has never seen before," Mr Trump said earlier today in his victory speech.</p>

<p>Global leaders swiftly pledged to work with Mr Trump, despite concerns in some parts of the world about his "America First" approach. Among the most worried countries will be Ukraine, which Russia invaded in 2022.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first leaders who dialled Mr Trump to congratulate him. "Had a great conversation with my friend, President Donald Trump, congratulating him on his spectacular victory. Looking forward to working closely together once again to further strengthen India-US relations across technology, defence, energy, space and several other sectors," PM Modi said in a post on X.</p>

<p>Mr Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance have scoffed at the billions of dollars in US assistance to Ukraine under outgoing President Joe Biden, with their aides musing about forcing Ukraine to make concessions to end the war.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky congratulated Trump and said he hoped the new US leader would help Ukraine find a "just peace."</p>

<p>Ms Harris entered the race in July after the visibly ageing Biden dropped out. She ran a centrist campaign that highlighted Mr Trump's inflammatory messaging and use of racist and sexist tropes. But his apocalyptic warnings about immigration found their mark with voters battered by the post-Covid economy and eager for change after the Biden years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President-elect Donald Trump will return to the White House in January joined by his family, who played an outsized role in his first administration and on the campaign trail this year.</p>

<p>A closer look reveals the personalities of the nation's incoming "first family" -- consisting of five children and 10 grandchildren from Trump's three marriages.</p>

<p><strong>- Donald Trump Jr -</strong></p>

<p>The eldest of the Trump children is dogmatic to the core, having promoted Trump's "Make America Great Again" agenda to his 12 million followers on X and through his "Triggered" podcast.</p>

<p>The 46-year-old, who sports a carefully groomed beard, was influential in securing his friend J.D. Vance's ascension from a relatively little-known conservative Ohio senator to Trump's running mate.</p>

<p>He has five children with his ex-wife Vanessa Trump, including their 17-year-old daughter Kai, who has described the Republican leader -- labelled a fascist by his former chief of staff -- as "just a normal grandpa."</p>

<p>Don Jr is now married to former Fox News presenter Kimberly Guilfoyle, who helped campaign for Trump through TV interviews.</p>

<p><strong>- Eric Trump -</strong></p>

<p>Eric, 40, is similarly loyal and backed up his father's election bid through routine media appearances and speeches at rallies.</p>

<p>Along with Donald Jr, he is an executive for The Trump Organization -- the real estate empire that propelled the 78-year-old Trump into American public consciousness.</p>

<p>Eric has two children with his wife Lara Trump, who in March was appointed co-chair of the Republican National Committee, allowing her to shape the party in Trump's image by reportedly firing dozens of longtime staff.</p>

<p><strong>- Ivanka Trump -</strong></p>

<p>Trump's daughter Ivanka, 43, held the vague role of "advisor to the president" during his first administration, prompting concerns of nepotism as she attended global summits such as the G20 summit.</p>

<p>But she was largely withdrawn during the 2024 campaign, having earlier announced her plans to prioritize family life with husband Jared Kushner and their three children.</p>

<p>Kushner was also a presidential advisor, and eyebrows were raised when Trump put him in charge of brokering peace in the Israel-Palestinian conflict, despite having no significant experience in the Middle East.</p>

<p><strong>- Melania Trump -</strong></p>

<p>Melania will regain the symbolic title of "First Lady" -- a role she used during Trump's 2017-2021 presidency to campaign for children's health care and online safety.</p>

<p>She has kept a relatively low profile since then, but the 54-year-old did break cover to publish a self-titled memoir weeks before Tuesday's election.</p>

<p>The book shared her pro-choice stance on abortion -- a view that seemingly clashed with Trump's boasting of his role in appointing Supreme Court justices who scrapped the federal right to abortion under Roe v Wade.</p>

<p>Melania has one child with Trump, 18-year-old Barron, who is studying at New York University.</p>

<p><strong>- Tiffany Trump -</strong></p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris called Donald Trump on Wednesday to congratulate him for winning the 2024 presidential election, one of her senior aides said, following a bitter and contentious race.</p>

<p>Democrat Harris discussed with Mr Trump the importance of a peaceful transfer of power and being a President for all Americans, said the aide, confirming that Ms Harris will deliver remarks in Washington later today.</p>

<p>During the acrimonious campaign, the Democratic presidential candidate had described Mr Trump as a unique threat to democracy, but her campaign in the end underwhelmed voters.</p>

<p>She will deliver her concession speech in Washington today (2.30 am IST).</p>

<p>Mr Trump had never conceded defeat four years ago when his supporters ransacked the US Capitol. He returned to the White House with wider margins than before despite a criminal conviction, two impeachments while last in office and warnings from his former chief of staff that he was a "fascist."</p>

<p>At 78, Mr Trump will be the oldest President during his inauguration scheduled on January 20. Had Ms Harris won, she would have been the first woman president of the US. "It's a political victory that our country has never seen before," Mr Trump said earlier today in his victory speech.</p>

<p>Global leaders swiftly pledged to work with Mr Trump, despite concerns in some parts of the world about his "America First" approach. Among the most worried countries will be Ukraine, which Russia invaded in 2022.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first leaders who dialled Mr Trump to congratulate him. "Had a great conversation with my friend, President Donald Trump, congratulating him on his spectacular victory. Looking forward to working closely together once again to further strengthen India-US relations across technology, defence, energy, space and several other sectors," PM Modi said in a post on X.</p>

<p>Mr Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance have scoffed at the billions of dollars in US assistance to Ukraine under outgoing President Joe Biden, with their aides musing about forcing Ukraine to make concessions to end the war.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky congratulated Trump and said he hoped the new US leader would help Ukraine find a "just peace."</p>

<p>Ms Harris entered the race in July after the visibly ageing Biden dropped out. She ran a centrist campaign that highlighted Mr Trump's inflammatory messaging and use of racist and sexist tropes. But his apocalyptic warnings about immigration found their mark with voters battered by the post-Covid economy and eager for change after the Biden years.</p>

<p>Hispanic and Black Americans, seen as crucial voting blocs for Harris, moved in greater numbers toward Mr Trump, who won a majority of Latino men, exit polls had shown.</p>

<p>Mr Trump is the first US President in more than a century to win a non-consecutive second term, and the only person to be elected President as a convicted felon -- he is scheduled to face sentencing in a New York court for fraud on November 26.</p>

<p>He is also a longtime sceptic of climate change who is expected again to reduce US global commitments, although one of his top campaign surrogates was fellow billionaire Elon Musk, owner of electric vehicle maker Tesla.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Voters approved most of the referendums expanding the right to abortion in US states while Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota rejected such measures, giving anti-abortion advocates victories since the Supreme Court ended the constitutional right.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Voters approved most of the referendums expanding the right to abortion in US states on Tuesday, while Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota rejected such measures, giving anti-abortion advocates their first victories since the US Supreme Court ended the constitutional right to the procedure in 2022.</p>

<p>A proposal to amend Florida's state constitution to guarantee abortion rights fell short of the 60% vote threshold needed to pass, Edison Research projected on Tuesday.</p>

<p>In Nebraska, voters faced two opposing ballot measures. They approved one enshrining the state's current 12-week ban, with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother, The Associated Press projected. At the same time they rejected a measure that would have added the right to access abortions to the state constitution, the AP projected.</p>

<p>South Dakota voters rejected a proposed amendment that would have guaranteed abortion rights in the state constitution, the Associated Press projected. Abortion is presently banned in South Dakota, with few exceptions.</p>

<p>Edison projected abortion rights measures would pass in Arizona, Missouri, Nevada, Colorado, New York, Maryland and Montana.</p>

<p>The Missouri ballot measure was a notable win, marking the first time that voters in a state enforcing a total abortion ban approved a constitutional amendment that will guarantee abortion rights through fetal viability. The measure's passage will not automatically void the state's ban, but abortion rights advocates now expect they will win a legal battle to restore abortion rights within months.</p>

<p>Before Tuesday, seven states had put the issue of abortion rights directly to voters following the U.S. Supreme Court decision to overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling. Abortion rights campaigns had won all of those elections.</p>

<p>Edison Research said the Florida measure was approved by 57% of voters with 95% of votes counted. Since it failed to meet the 60% threshold, a ban on abortions after the sixth week of pregnancy that came into affect in May will stand.</p>

<p>Florida's ban after the sixth week has few exceptions.</p>

<p>Anti-abortion advocate Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, called Florida's result "a momentous victory." Her group also celebrated the results in Nebraska and South Dakota, and thanked politicians such as South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem and Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen.</p>

<p>Anna Hochkammer, director of Florida Women's Freedom Coalition, which backed that state's measure, noted that 57% still represented a majority of voters.</p>

<p>"The fight goes on because the women and girls of Florida continue to suffer," she said.</p>

<p>The Democratic Party's presidential candidate, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, had sought to build support for Tuesday's ballot measures that propose amending state constitutions to enshrine a right to abortion.</p>

<p>Democrats have blamed the Republican Party, led by former President Donald Trump, for the abortion bans that many of the measures sought to void. More than a dozen states banned abortion in all or most cases after the Supreme Court - with a Trump-appointed conservative majority - gutted the federal right to abortion.</p>

<p>Trump, a Florida resident, had said he would vote against the ballot measure, after initially appearing to suggest he would vote in favor.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump planned to name Kashyap Patel the deputy director of the CIA in the final weeks of his administration.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">Kashyap 'Kash' Patel is of Gujarati ancestry and has said that his parents grew up in East Africa. According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/10/kash-patel-trump-national-security-council/679566/">The Atlantic</a>, his father fled Uganda, ruled by Idi Amin, in the 1970s and moved to the US.&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Mr Patel was born and raised in Garden City, New York in 1980. Raised Hindu, his senior-yearbook quote was by Jewish theologian Abraham Joshua Heschel: "Racism is man's gravest threat - the maximum of hatred for a minimum reason."</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">According to his Department of Defense profile, Mr Patel completed his undergraduate studies at the University of Richmond before returning to New York to earn his law degree, along with a Certificate in International Law from University College London Faculty of Laws in the UK.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The 44-year-old served as the former Chief of Staff to Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller. Before that, as the Deputy Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Counterterrorism at the National Security Council, he executed several of then-President Donald Trump's top priorities, including eliminating ISIS and al-Qaeda leadership like al-Baghdadi and Qasem al-Rimi, and the repatriation of many American hostages.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">He had also served as the National Security Advisor and Senior Counsel for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, where he spearheaded the investigation into the Russian active measures campaign to influence the 2016 presidential election.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Having begun his career as a public defender, he tried many complex cases, including those related to murder, narco-trafficking and financial crimes in state and federal courts.&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The Atlantic report describes Mr Patel as the man "who will do anything for Trump", who is now the president-elect after pulling off a remarkable victory in the just-concluded elections.&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The report says Mr Patel joined the then-Trump administration in 2019 as a 40-year-old lawyer and rose up the ranks rapidly.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Trump also, the report said, planned to name Patel the deputy director of the CIA in the final weeks of his administration, but faced pushback.&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">At a gala of young Republicans last year, Trump had a message for Mr Patel: "Get ready, Kash. Get ready".</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The glass ceiling for women in politics just got even more daunting, as the prospect of a female US president has been shattered once again by Donald Trump. This isn't the first time Trump has stood in the way of history being made - he previously defeated Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.</p>

<p>As the Center For American Women And Politics mentions, "Once again, a woman has reached for the highest office in American politics, has come close to breaking that barrier, but ultimately was not elected."</p>

<p>It's worth noting that women have been fighting for a spot in the Oval Office for centuries. Victoria Woodhull, a trailblazing stockbroker, newspaper publisher, and social reformer, was the first woman to actively pursue the presidency back in 1872.</p>

<p>Despite facing numerous challenges, including being four years too young to serve as president according to the US Constitution, Woodhull's courage paved the way for future generations of women in politics.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Harris' loss is reminiscent of Hillary Clinton's, except for the fact that Trump won all of the swing states this year whereas in 2016 he missed Nevada.</p>

<p>Both parties were endorsed by celebrities in their own style. Harris was backed by a guild of female celebrities such as Taylor Swift, Jennifer Lopez, Beyonce, Lady Gaga and Oprah Winfrey, whereas Trump had his own mantuary with Elon Musk, Hulk Hogan, Joe Rogan and more.</p>

<p>However, they were judged by double standards. Michelle Obama, former first lady, was of the opinion that, "We expect her to be intelligent and articulate, to have a clear set of policies, to never show too much anger, to prove time and time again that she belongs" talking about Harris. "But for Trump, we expect nothing at all. No understanding of policy, no ability to put together a coherent argument, no honesty, no decency, no morals."</p>

<p>The question remains: when will the glass ceiling finally shatter, paving the way for a woman to become the President of the United States?</p>

<p>At Trump's Pennsylvania town-hall, he had said, "Let's not do any more questions. Let's just listen to music", after a few people had some medical emergency. One of the songs that played in those 40 minutes was "It's a Man's, Man's, Man's World" by James Brown.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shares in Tesla soared in pre-market trading Wednesday after Donald Trump claimed victory in the US presidential election and hailed the electric car company's boss Elon Musk as a "genius".</p>

<p>Tesla shares were up more than 15 percent at $289.44 in after-hours deals before the opening bell on Wall Street.</p>

<p>Investors welcomed the prospect of a Trump victory as Wall Street futures -- bets on what the price of a stock will be at a later date -- jumped as the former president appeared poised to defeat Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Musk shared a photo on his social media platform X showing him with Trump at an election watch party in Florida, and the Republican candidate singled him out during a celebratory speech.</p>

<p>"We have a new star, a star is born: Elon," Trump said, marvelling at Musk's SpaceX rocket and the deployment of the Starlink satellite internet service during Hurricane Helene.</p>

<p>"He's an amazing guy," Trump said. "He's a character, he's a special guy, he's a super genius."</p>

<p>Musk staunchly supported Trump during the campaign through America PAC, a political action committee that contributed tens of millions of dollars and doled out $1 million giveaways to registered voters in key states.</p>

<p>"Tesla shares are rising due to his special ties with Donald Trump," Andrea Tueni, analyst at Saxobank, told AFP.</p>

<p>Trump, Tueni said, "owes him a lot".</p>

<p>Investors are betting that their closeness "will turn into something positive for Tesla", Tueni added.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's return to the White House next year could bring economic pain and difficult decisions for Canada's Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, once branded a "far-left lunatic" by the Republican.</p>

<p>The potential consequences include trade disputes that push Canada into recession since 75% of its exports go to the US, as well as thousands of people pouring north across the US border, analysts and economists said.</p>

<p>Trump's victory adds to Trudeau's trouble at a time polls show he would likely lose to his Conservative opponent in an election that must be held within a year. Canada's slowing economy and a rapid surge in the cost of living over the past few years are top campaign issues, which come against the backdrop of diplomatic disputes with China and India that have hampered efforts to diversify trade.</p>

<p>Canada, the world's No. 4 crude oil producer, is especially vulnerable to Trump's plan for a 10% tariff on all imports and his vow to boost US energy production.</p>

<p>Laura Dawson of the Future Borders Coalition, which seeks to smooth bilateral trade and travel, said the real challenge will be gradually declining investor confidence in America's northern neighbour.</p>

<p>"For&nbsp;Canada, four years of a Trump presidency could be very long indeed," she said.</p>

<p>Trump called Trudeau "a far-left lunatic" in 2022 for requiring truck drivers crossing the border to be vaccinated against COVID-19. In June 2018, Trump walked out of a G7 summit in Quebec and blasted the Canadian leader for being "very dishonest and weak."</p>

<p>Trudeau, who has been in power since 2015, congratulated Trump on Wednesday and said the friendship between the two nations was the envy of the world.</p>

<p>"I know President Trump and I will work together to create more opportunity, prosperity, and security for both of our nations," Trudeau said on X.</p>

<p>Asked about Trump's win on Wednesday, Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland sought to reassure Canadians.</p>

<p>"A lot of Canadians were anxious throughout the night and I want to say ... that Canada will be absolutely fine," she said. "We have a strong relationship with the United States, we have a strong relationship with President Trump and his team."</p>

<p>In January, however, Trudeau told reporters another Trump presidency would be "a step back" that made life tough for Canada.</p>

<p>Desjardins Economics analysts forecast Trump's policies would result in real Canadian gross domestic product falling by 1.7% by end-2028 compared to what would have happened under a Democratic president.</p>

<p>The Canadian Chamber of Commerce said Trump's planned 10% tariff would cut Canada's real income by 0.9% annually and labor productivity by nearly 1%. If other countries retaliate, setting off a trade war, real income would drop by 1.5% annually, with labor productivity falling by nearly 1.6% each year, the chamber said.</p>

<p>Trump first took office in 2017 vowing to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, the trilateral trade deal with Mexico and Canada, complaining that trading partners were taking advantage of the US.</p>

<p>After 18 months of sometimes rancorous talks, which at one point saw the United States and Canada imposing sanctions on each other's products, the pact was reborn as the US-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) deal.</p>

<p>Trump said on Oct. 11 he would use an existing USMCA clause to start renegotiating the treaty in 2026.</p>

<p>"I'm going to have a lot of fun," he said.</p>

<p><strong>RECESSION INDUCING</strong></p>

<p>David Doyle, Macquarie's head of economics for the Americas, said Trump's promised policies had the potential to be a significant economic shock for Canada.</p>

<p>"It's possible that it is a recession-inducing event because it's on such an enormous scale that we really haven't seen for almost 100 years," he said.</p>

<p>Canada staved off the worst during the USMCA talks by proactively sending officials and politicians to dozens of US states to highlight the benefits of free trade.</p>

<p>Kirsten Hillman, the long-serving Canadian ambassador in Washington, said Canada has "a very good ability to push back" on the 10% tariff proposal and had already been talking to Trump's camp about it.</p>

<p>"We've been spending a lot of time talking to the Trump team, his advisers, saying ... this just isn't the right move," she told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. in mid-October.</p>

<p>Liberal officials are careful not to say anything derogatory in public about the Republican leader.</p>

<p>But in January, Trudeau told a meeting of senior Liberals that a second Trump administration would be of "a magnitude more challenging" for Canada than the first, according to a source who was present in the room.</p>

<p>Policy clashes seem inevitable, both domestically and internationally, especially if Trump follows through on his plan to deport millions of people living in the US illegally.</p>

<p>"I predict you're going to have a huge flood north of many of those folks trying their chances here," said Jason Kenney, former immigration minister in the Conservative government that ruled from 2006 to 2015.</p>

<p>"We could have a true crisis in terms of homelessness and pressure on our social system just months away," he told a podcast organized by the National Post before the election.</p>

<p>The United States and Europe could well retreat into hostile competing blocs, stranding Canada in the middle, said Kim Richard Nossal, professor of politics at Queen's University in Kingston and author of a book on Canada's likely isolation if Trump's movement were to regain power.</p>

<p>"The implications for Canada are, in my view, dramatic," he said, predicting Trump would insist Ottawa spend far more on defense.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's return to power in the United States will have a positive outcome on Israeli interests, several experts interviewed by AFP said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Still, some were cautiously optimistic at the prospect of a second Trump term, given his unpredictability during his first term from 2017 to 2021, particularly when it came to foreign policy.</p>

<p><strong>Why such enthusiasm over Trump's win?</strong></p>

<p>Former president Trump favoured Israel many times in his first term, and Israeli leaders were among the first to congratulate him on Wednesday as soon as he claimed victory.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Trump over "history's greatest comeback!", and newly appointed foreign affairs minister Gideon Saar hailed him as a "true friend of Israel".</p>

<p>Opinion polls showed that 66 percent of Israelis wanted Trump back in power, with pundits pointing to his family ties to Israel and his daughter's conversion to Judaism.</p>

<p>During his first term, Trump broke the historic US policy of neutrality over the status of Jerusalem, whose eastern half has been occupied by Israel since 1967.</p>

<p>As early as 2017, he recognised the city as Israel's capital and the following year moved the American embassy there.</p>

<p>Trump also recognised Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, the strategic northern region annexed by Israel in 1967 and which the international community views as Syrian territory.</p>

<p>Trump's government also said it did not view Israeli settlements in the West Bank as illegal, despite international law saying they are.</p>

<p>Lastly, American diplomats in Trump's first administration largely facilitated the normalisation of Israeli ties with more Arab states, which Israelis view as a way of securing their country's future.</p>

<p><strong>What do Israelis expect from him?</strong></p>

<p>With Israel at war for more than a year and amid several diplomatic setbacks, "Trump's win is a big emboldening for Netanyahu", according to Mairav Zonszein, an expert at the International Crisis Group, pointing to the two leaders' similar political style.</p>

<p>She added that the result was hailed by the "far right and the settler right in Israel", who expect a US policy that is more favourable to settlers in the West Bank.</p>

<p>Analysts noted that Trump will favour Israel's interests on the international scene.</p>

<p>"Considering what he said and what he's done before, we expect him to be tougher on Iran," said international relations expert Yonatan Freeman of Jerusalem's Hebrew University.</p>

<p>Freeman predicted new talks with Iran pushing "for a better deal for Israel's security", enabled by the new American president.</p>

<p>Several experts pointed to the issue of US military support. President Joe Biden waved this as a potential pressure point in Gaza war ceasefire talks, but it would no longer be a threat under Trump.</p>

<p><strong>What are the main challenges?</strong></p>

<p>"It is sometimes preferable to deal with predictable people even if we don't really like them, rather than unpredictable people,", Yossi Mekelberg, an expert on Israeli geopolitics at Chatham House, told AFP.</p>

<p>Mekelberg pointed to past disputes between Trump and Netanyahu, including in 2020 when Trump saw Netanyahu's congratulations to Biden on winning the election as a betrayal.</p>

<p>Trump's statements since then have sometimes seemed contradictory, between his support for Israel and his wish for an end to the war in Gaza, despite overtures from Netanyahu.</p>

<p>In July, both men met when the Israeli prime minister visited the United States, suggesting that the two may have patched things up.</p>

<p>"You can't really analyse someone that has no coherent line of thinking," Mekelberg concluded.</p>

<p>Zonszein said some Israeli leaders appear to have prematurely decided on Trump's position on "Israel's treatment of Palestinians".</p>

<p>"It's not necessarily clear that he would kind of just stand aside while Israel continues to de facto annex the West Bank", she said, pointing to his past opposition to aspects of Israel's annexation plan and his support for the Abraham Accords.</p>

<p>The 2020 Abraham Accords saw Bahrain, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates establish formal ties with Israel.</p>

<p>Because of strategic alliances and diplomatic dynamics, "it's not at all certain that Trump will be happy to support Israel's war on all fronts", Zonszein said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>Saudi Arabia's King Salman and his son, de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, congratulated Donald Trump on his election victory on Wednesday, state media reported.</p>

<p>The two leaders sent cables to Trump, who cultivated warm Saudi ties during his first administration. King Salman hailed "close relations between the two friendly countries and peoples, which everyone seeks to strengthen and develop in all fields", the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA) said.</p>

<p>Later on Wednesday, SPA reported that Prince Mohammed called to congratulate Trump on his win and "expressed the kingdom's aspiration to strengthen the historical and strategic relations between the two countries, wishing the friendly American people progress and prosperity under His Excellency's leadership".</p>

<p>After taking office in 2017, Trump quickly courted Saudi Arabia, long an important energy and security partner for Washington.</p>

<p>His first overseas visit was to the Saudi capital Riyadh, where he basked in an elaborate welcome involving a sword dance and a fly-past of air force jets.</p>

<p>The honeymoon period later cooled, with Prince Mohammed faulting Trump for failing to respond more aggressively after a 2019 attack widely blamed on Iran halved the Gulf kingdom's crude output.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden criticised Saudi Arabia harshly while on the campaign trail for human rights abuses including the 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.</p>

<p>But the relationship with Biden dramatically improved, and the two sides attempted to negotiate a so-called mega-deal in which Saudi Arabia would recognise Israel in exchange for a defence pact with the United States and help on a civilian nuclear programme.</p>

<p>That deal was put on ice after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7 last year, triggering war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Last week, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan told an investor forum in Riyadh that his government could potentially move "quite quickly" on some bilateral agreements with Washington even if the mega-deal remained out of reach.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A proposed law allowing terminally ill adults in England and Wales to end their lives was published on Tuesday, setting out safeguards such as ensuring the approval of doctors and judges to try to ease concerns in Britain over its possible misuse.</p>

<p>The proposed law has polarised opinion and has split the governing Labour Party. Lawmakers will vote on the proposed law on Nov. 29, almost 10 years since parliament rejected an earlier bid to legalise assisted dying.</p>

<p>The Labour lawmaker who has proposed the new law, Kim Leadbeater, described it as "very robust", saying the legislation offers layers of safeguards to protect vulnerable people, who some critics fear might feel pressured to end their lives if assisted dying becomes legal.</p>

<p>Assisted dying would only be an option for mentally competent, terminally ill adults with six months or less left to live, as expected, under the proposed new law.</p>

<p>The other safeguards include two doctors confirming seven days apart that the person is eligible and has made their decision free from pressure, while a judge would then speak to one of those doctors before a 14-day period of reflection.</p>

<p>"This is just for terminally ill adults. It's not for anybody else. It's for people who are dying, and it is about shortening death rather than ending life," Leadbeater told BBC radio.</p>

<p>The bill would make it illegal to pressure or coerce someone into ending their life by assisted dying. The offence would be punishable by up to 14 years in prison.</p>

<p>Under current laws assisting suicide is punishable by up to 14 years in jail but Leadbeater argues that current rules do not reflect a shift in public opinion over the issue during the last 10 years.</p>

<p>Supporters of assisted dying say Britain is a laggard after Australia, Canada, New Zealand and some U.S. states legalised it under certain circumstances in recent years. It has been legal in Switzerland since 1942 and in the Netherlands since 2002.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said politicians will be able to vote with their consciences on the matter, rather than along party lines. He has supported changing the law in the past while health minister Wes Streeting has said he will oppose it.</p>

<p>Should the proposal, known as the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Members Bill, pass a first vote, it would kick off the formal process for a law change, subjecting it to further scrutiny and requiring approval by both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, the upper house of parliament.</p>

<p>In 2015, British lawmakers voted 330 to 118 against the second reading of proposed legislation to legalise assisted dying.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump was expected Tuesday to pick South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem to head the US Department of Homeland Security, a powerful post at the center of the incoming president's tough-on-immigration policies.</p>

<p>Sources in Trump's transition team told US media including CBS News that he has decided on Noem, a longtime Trump loyalist who was once considered a strong contender to be the Republican nominee's running mate.</p>

<p>Joining Trump's cabinet would be a notable political rebound for Noem, who saw her stock plummet earlier this year when she released a memoir in which she recounted having shot dead an "untrainable" pet dog after a hunting excursion gone awry. Noem has said her action showed she was able to make tough choices.</p>

<p>Homeland Security is a sprawling organization with a budget topping $107 billion, about 15 times that of South Dakota, where Noem is in her second term as governor.</p>

<p>If confirmed as its secretary by the US Senate, the 52-year-old would oversee the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) along with protective security operations on the borders with Canada and Mexico, key agencies in any Trump plan for restricting immigration or deporting undocumented migrants.</p>

<p>DHS also controls the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which assists communities in times of natural disasters like hurricanes.</p>

<p>Trump himself has yet to confirm Noem's nomination. If accurate, it would be the latest quick pick as the Republican leader seeks to flesh out his cabinet.</p>

<p>He has already chosen former immigration official Tom Homan as the country's "border czar," tasking him with fulfilling his key domestic promise of mass deportations of undocumented migrants. The DHS secretary would be closely involved in any such operations.</p>

<p>The current homeland security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, was impeached in February by the Republican-majority House of Representatives, as Republicans successfully turned immigration and border security into a critical 2024 election issue. The Democratic-held US Senate rejected the effort to convict him.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Firefly Aerospace has raised $175 million in a late-stage funding round led by RPM Ventures, valuing the space startup at more than $2 billion, it said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Venture capital firms have been investing strongly in rocket makers and satellite manufacturers, marking a shift in the investment trend for such capital intensive businesses, Seraphim Space said in a report last month.</p>

<p>Texas-based Firefly makes small and medium launch vehicles for commercial launches to the earth's orbit. It also offers on-orbit services through its Elytra line of orbital vehicles, providing hosting, rideshare, delivery and servicing missions.</p>

<p>The startup is preparing for its first mission to the moon, dubbed Blue Ghost, as part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Service initiative later this year.</p>

<p>The Series D funding round at Firefly included existing investors as well as new entities, including GiantLeap Capital and Human Element.</p>

<p>Firefly intends to utilize the fresh capital to enhance the market reach of its Elytra spacecraft, transition to full-scale production of its Alpha rocket, and expedite the hardware qualification for newly developing vehicles.</p>

<p>The company said it was simultaneously preparing for multiple launches of the Alpha rocket under contracts with Lockheed Martin, L3Harris and NASA, among others, while collaborating with Northrop Grumman to develop a medium launch vehicle.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Fast-rising methane emissions could undermine efforts to limit global warming by mid-century, prompting scientists and policymakers to urge aggressive action to curb output of the potent greenhouse gas.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fast-rising methane emissions could undermine efforts to limit global warming by mid-century, prompting scientists and policymakers to urge aggressive action to curb output of the potent greenhouse gas.</p>

<p>Nearly 160 countries have pledged a 30% cut from 2020 methane emissions levels by the end of this decade.</p>

<p>Over the last five years atmospheric methane levels have risen at their fastest rate since record-keeping began in the 1970s, driven in part by natural sources, according to the 2024 Global Methane Budget report. &nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Here is why controlling methane emissions is so important:</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>HEAT-TRAPPING POWER</strong></h3>

<p>Methane molecules are more powerful than carbon dioxide (CO2) in trapping heat, meaning it takes fewer of them to cause the same amount of warming and reducing them can have a more immediate effect than reducing CO2.</p>

<p>Tackling methane also makes financial sense. United Nations analyses have found cutting methane emissions is likely cheaper than CO2 cuts for a comparable climate benefit.</p>

<p>While CO2 remains in the atmosphere for centuries, methane breaks down after about a decade - meaning it has less of a long-term impact on temperatures.</p>

<p>Scientists normally compare the overall warming effects of methane versus CO2 over a century, calculating that methane emissions are about 28 times worse than CO2 for global warming.</p>

<p>Over a shorter timespan of 20 years, however, methane is 80 times worse.</p>

<p>Methane has led to around 0.5 degrees Celsius of warming so far, or about one-third of the roughly 1.3 C of warming experienced to date since pre-industrial times.</p>

<h3><strong>SURGING EMISSIONS</strong></h3>

<p>Methane concentrations are rising faster than any other major greenhouse gas, with human activities driving at least two-thirds of global emissions, according to the 2024 Global Methane Budget.</p>

<p>That includes the agriculture sector, including rice farming and livestock, fossil fuel activities, and landfills and other waste.</p>

<p>The report, published every five years, found methane emissions from these human activities have risen overall by 20% over the last two decades.</p>

<p>Most of the methane mitigation efforts under way, including EU legislation, are focused on the oil and gas sector, where the emissions are easier to tackle than in agriculture, according to the food-focused investor initiative called FAIRR.</p>

<h3><strong>NATURAL SOURCES A CONCERN</strong></h3>

<p>The remaining third of the world's methane emissions comes from natural sources such as thawing permafrost, peat bogs and wetlands - and emissions could rapidly increase as temperatures rise.</p>

<p>Animals, including humans, are also a source of methane.</p>

<p>While it is easy to measure atmospheric methane, understanding where it comes from is crucial for tackling the problem.</p>

<p>By analyzing distinct isotope signatures in methane detected, scientists can investigate whether the the gas comes from biological sources or industry.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The judge in Donald Trump's New York criminal case has delayed to November 19 a decision on potentially throwing out the US president-elect's conviction, the court said Tuesday.</p>

<p>Trump was convicted of 34 felony counts in May after a jury found he had fraudulently manipulated business records to cover up an alleged sexual encounter with a porn star ahead of the 2016 election.</p>

<p>Trump, due to be sentenced on November 26, may receive a reprieve if Judge Juan Merchan decides to dismiss the case following the Supreme Court's recent ruling on presidential immunity.</p>

<p>That landmark ruling saw the court, with a 6-3 conservative majority, decide that presidents have sweeping immunity from prosecution for a range of official acts committed while in office.</p>

<p>Ahead of the election, Trump's lawyers moved to have the case thrown out in light of the Supreme Court decision, a move that prosecutors have firmly rejected.</p>

<p>If Merchan throws out the case on that basis, there will be no sentencing of Trump, 78.</p>

<p>If he does not, Trump's legal team would almost certainly seek to oppose or delay any sentencing, insisting it would interfere with Trump's role as commander-in-chief once he is sworn in on January 20.</p>

<p>"The joint application for a stay of the current deadlines... until November 19, is granted," the court wrote in an email to parties in the case, seen by AFP.</p>

<p><strong>'A severe blow'</strong></p>

<p>An editorial in the Kansas City Star newspaper called for the judge in the case to "do what was once unthinkable -- force a president-elect to take the oath of office in a jail cell."</p>

<p>"The surreal scene, while certainly shocking for the rest of the free world to witness, would send an unmistakable message -- the rule of law still applies in America."</p>

<p>But Trump's former attorney general Bill Barr said that both the New York case as well as others around the country had been "plainly brought for political purposes (and) have now been extensively aired and rejected in the court of public opinion."</p>

<p>"Further maneuvering on these cases in the weeks ahead would serve no legitimate purpose and only distract the country and the incoming administration from the task at hand," he wrote.</p>

<p>Trump has repeatedly derided the case as a witch hunt, saying it "should be rightfully terminated."</p>

<p>Alongside the New York case, brought by state-level prosecutors, Trump faces two active federal cases, one related to his effort to overturn the 2020 election and the other connected to classified documents he allegedly mishandled after leaving office.</p>

<p>However, as president, he would be able to intervene to end those cases, and Jack Smith, the special counsel handling both cases, has reportedly begun to wind them down.</p>

<p>A Trump-appointed federal judge already threw out the documents case, but Smith had sought to appeal that decision.</p>

<p>"Trump's victory means he is unlikely to be held accountable for any of his alleged criminal misconduct," said former prosecutor Randall Eliason in an article on Substack.</p>

<p>"That's a severe blow to the ideal of the rule of law."</p>

<p>The New York conviction, coming just months before an election that Trump won convincingly, was one of several dramatic developments in the race for the White House.</p>

<p>In July, Trump survived an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania when a bullet grazed his ear.</p>

<p>Later that month, President Joe Biden stepped aside as the Democratic Party's candidate following a disastrous performance against Trump in a televised debate.</p>

<p>That paved the way for Vice President Kamala Harris to become the first woman of color from a major US party to stand for president.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India's internet and telecom sector is likely to get a new entrant - Elon Musk's Starlink - a game-changer for internet users in the world's most populous country. Elon Musk will be taking on behemoths like Mukesh Ambani's Jio and Sunil Bharti Mittal's Airtel besides national carrier BSNL to provide ultra-high speed connectivity to Indian users.</p>

<p>Whether or not he will be able to match Jio and Airtel on pricing is yet to be seen. India currently has the world's lowest pricing in terms of broadband and WiFi internet. Elon Musk, currently the world's richest person, may aim to compete aggressively in the world's most vibrant internet data market.</p>

<p>Starlink, which provides wireless internet service with the help satellite constellations in near-Earth orbit, is currently seeking the required security clearances for a licence to offer satellite broadband services in India and is expected to get a permit should it satisfy authorities of the conditions laid out, the telecom minister said today.</p>

<p>Starlink has been looking to enter India for years and its plans got a major boost last month when New Delhi said it wouldn't auction spectrum for satellite broadband but rather award it administratively - just as Elon Musk wanted. Rival Indian telecom billionaire Mukesh Ambani had wanted an auction.</p>

<p>India's Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia confirmed today that Starlink is in the process of obtaining the necessary security clearance, which requires it to satisfy the Government of India that the company processes and stores all data locally in India, and that its satellite signals are encrypted and 100 per cent secure.</p>

<p>"When you check all the boxes, you get the licence. If they (Starlink) do that, we will be very happy," Mr Scindia said.</p>

<p>Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio currently dominates India's broadband market with more than 14 million wired subscribers. Jio also has a user base of nearly 500 million mobile internet users. Airtel too has close to 300 million broadband subscribers. However, they are concerned that after spending more than 20 billion dollars in spectrum auctions, they now have the risk of losing customers to Elon Musk's Starlink as satellite technology advances.</p>

<p>As per a Reuters report, Reliance Jio already has the necessary clearances to launch its own satellite broadband service, but hasn't done so yet. Starlink has now informed the Government of India that it is willing to comply with India's rules and regulations for security, data storage, and servers.</p>

<p>When Reliance Jio had first launched services, Mukesh Ambani, then Asia's richest person, had offered broadband services for free to all subscribers to capture a majority market share. Elon Musk, who is the world's richest person is now adopting a similar strategy - In Africa, Musk offers Starlink services for as little as $10 (roughly Rs 800) per month. In the US, Musk offers the same Starlink service for as much as $120 (roughly Rs 10,000) per month.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eleven people were killed when a teashop in Myanmar was hit by a military airstrike in the town of Naungcho in the northern Shan state on Tuesday afternoon, a spokesperson for a local ethnic armed group said.</p>

<p>The attack, shortly before 3pm local time, comes as the junta battles widespread armed opposition to its 2021 coup and its soldiers accused of bloody rampages and using air and artillery strikes to punish civilian communities.</p>

<p>"They were civilians who came to drink tea and sitting at the shop," Lway Yay Oo, a spokesperson for the Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) said.</p>

<p>At least four civilians were wounded and were receiving treatment in a hospital, she said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft, the big technology company that is at the forefront of artificial intelligence innovation courtesy of its partnership with OpenAI, might just be looking to rebrand what has been its flagship product offering inside Microsoft Suite. Copilot, which was previously known as Bing Chat, offers users a variety of features, including AI web search powered by ChatGPT.</p>

<p>Microsoft has positioned AI features at the centre of its windows ecosystem, launching a line of windows pcs: copilot + PCs. It has now come to notice through a social media post, that a recent update in copilot had a hint inside appprivacy.adml- a settings file on the recently shipped update.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Let Apps Access Windows Intelligence <a href="https://t.co/gbyU4JdmG5">pic.twitter.com/gbyU4JdmG5</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The rebranding exercise might put all the AI features offered by Microsoft through a subscription model under the name of "Microsoft Intelligence", taking a feather out of the apple hat, who called their suite of AI features Apple Intelligence in as early as June this year.</p>

<p>Such a move would also help windows to further expand into all of its other applications offered under windows operating systems, such as notepad and MS word, with better brand recall than copilot, which has been envisioned as a separate product for the company.</p>

<p>If Windows does indeed go ahead with the rebranding, this won't be the first time Microsoft has "taken inspiration" from its direct rival, the most significant of which is the introduction of voice assistant Cortana in 2014, when Apple had launched Siri as early as 2011.</p>

<p>What would Steve Jobs think of this latest rebranding exercise? "They have absolutely no taste," Steve had said about Microsoft in a 1995 interview.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iranian bank cards can now be used in Russia, state television reported, as the two countries linked their banking systems in the latest bid to counteract sanctions.</p>

<p>Iranian banks have been excluded since 2018 from the SWIFT international financial messaging service, which governs the vast majority of transactions worldwide.</p>

<p>The move is part of a raft of sanctions that were re-imposed on Iran after the United States withdrew from a landmark 2015 nuclear deal.</p>

<p>Iranian bank cards can now be used in Russia, state television channel IRINN said on Monday, showing the withdrawal of money using an Iranian bank card from an ATM in Russia.</p>

<p>The operation was made possible by connecting Iran's interbank network Shetab to its Russian equivalent Mir, the channel said.</p>

<p>Iranians can currently withdraw money in Russia, and will in the future be able to use their cards to pay for in-store purchases, it added.</p>

<p>"The plan is also going to be implemented in other countries that have a wide range of financial and social interactions with Iran, for example Iraq, Afghanistan and Turkey," it said.</p>

<p>Both Iran and Russia have sought to counteract the effects of sanctions on their economies.</p>

<p>Since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow has faced mounting sanctions, and its ties with Tehran have grown closer in parallel.</p>

<p>Ukraine and its Western allies have since the start of the conflict accused Iran of supplying Russia with both drones and missiles for use in the war.</p>

<p>Tehran and Moscow signed an agreement in June to strengthen their cooperation in the banking sector.</p>

<p>In the future, Russians will also be able to use their bank cards in Iran, IRINN said, without specifying when.</p>

<p>Russia has been pushing for the creation of an international payment platform as an alternative to the SWIFT service, from which key Russian banks have also been excluded since 2022.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[President-elect Donald Trump is expected to take a slew of executive actions on his first day in the White House to ramp up immigration enforcement and roll back President Joe Biden's flagship legal entry programs.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President-elect Donald Trump is expected to take a slew of executive actions on his first day in the White House to ramp up immigration enforcement and roll back President Joe Biden's flagship legal entry programs, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.</p>

<p>The executive actions would give federal immigration officers more latitude to arrest people with no criminal records, surge troops to the US-Mexico border and restart construction of the border wall, the sources said.</p>

<p>Trump also is expected to end Biden's humanitarian programs that allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants to enter legally in recent years and could encourage those with expired statuses to leave voluntarily, according to the sources who declined to be identified.</p>

<p>"All of these should be on the table," said Mark Morgan, an immigration official in Trump's first term who said he did not speak for the Trump transition team.</p>

<p>Trump's early executive actions would kickstart his immigration agenda, which includes a promise to deport record numbers of immigrants in the US illegally.</p>

<p>The US Department of Homeland Security estimated there were 11 million immigrants without legal status in 2022, a figure that may have increased. Some cities that received migrants including New York, Chicago and Denver struggled to house and aid them.</p>

<p>Trump, a Republican, defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in last week's presidential election. He made claims that the Biden administration allowed high levels of illegal immigration a focus of his campaign.</p>

<p>Trump's transition effort remains in its early stages and plans could change before his inauguration on January 20. A Trump spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Migrant arrests reached a record during Biden's presidency, straining US border enforcement. But illegal crossings fell dramatically this year as Biden instituted new border restrictions and Mexico stepped up enforcement.</p>

<p>Trump aims to drive illegal crossings even lower and use a whole-of-government approach to arrest, detain and deport large numbers of people.</p>

<p>Trump announced on Sunday night that former hardline US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Acting Director Tom Homan would serve as a White House "border czar" overseeing security and immigration enforcement.</p>

<p>Vice President-elect JD Vance on Monday appeared to confirm that Stephen Miller, architect of Trump's restrictive first-term immigration agenda, would return as deputy chief of staff for policy, assuring the issue will remain central.</p>

<p>Trump's aggressive agenda will likely encounter legal challenges from states governed by Democrats, the American Civil Liberties Union and pro-immigration advocates.</p>

<p><strong>DAY ONE TAKES SHAPE</strong></p>

<p>One of Trump's Day One executive actions is expected to be an order on so-called interior enforcement, arresting and detaining immigrants in the US illegally, the sources said.</p>

<p>Trump intends to scrap Biden administration guidance that prioritized people with serious criminal records for deportation and limited enforcement against non-criminals, they said.</p>

<p>The Trump order would call for deportations to prioritize people charged with felonies and people who have exhausted their legal avenues to remain, but would not restrict officers from picking up other potentially deportable immigrants.</p>

<p>More than 1 million immigrants in the US have exhausted their legal options and been ordered deported, according to the pro-immigration American Immigration Council.</p>

<p>Homan told Fox News on Monday these people would be a priority. "A federal judge said, 'You must go home,' and they didn't," Homan said.</p>

<p>Certain groups - such as international students who support Palestinian operator group Hamas and have violated the terms of their student visas - could also be listed as a priority, two of the sources said.</p>

<p>ICE could use military planes in deportations and seek help from other government agencies to transport deportees, one source said. "All options are on the table," the source said.</p>

<p>Another order would deal with border security, the two sources said. Trump intends to send National Guard troops to the border and declare illegal immigration a national emergency to unlock funds for border wall construction, the sources said.</p>

<p>Wall construction in Arizona - where Democratic Governor Katie Hobbs has opposed Republican enforcement efforts - could be a priority, two sources said.</p>

<p><strong>ENDING BIDEN PROGRAMS</strong></p>

<p>Trump plans to end Biden's temporary humanitarian "parole" programs that have allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants to enter legally and access work permits, the sources said.</p>

<p>The programs include an initiative for certain migrants with US sponsors and another that allows migrants in Mexico to use an app to schedule border appointments.</p>

<p>People in the US with expired parole status who leave voluntarily could be allowed to apply for legal admission without penalties, the sources said.</p>

<p>Trump is also expected to talk with Mexico about reinstating his "Remain in Mexico" program which required non-Mexican asylum seekers to stay in Mexico while their US cases were decided.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's army announced the opening Tuesday of an additional aid crossing into Gaza, on the eve of a US-imposed deadline to improve humanitarian conditions for Palestinians in the war-ravaged territory.</p>

<p>"As part of the effort and commitment to increase the volume and routes of aid to the Gaza Strip, the 'Kissufim' Crossing was opened today," the army said in a joint statement with COGAT, the Israeli defence ministry agency responsible for civilian affairs in the Palestinian territories.</p>

<p>"The operation... includes the delivery of food, water, medical supplies, and shelter equipment to central and southern Gaza," they said, adding it involved the military, COGAT and defence ministry.</p>

<p>"The IDF (Israeli army), through COGAT, will continue to operate in accordance with international law to facilitate and ease the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip."</p>

<p>Last month, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned Israel it had until November 13 to improve aid delivery to Gaza or risk the withholding of some military assistance from the United States, Israel's biggest supporter.</p>

<p>The letter was sent weeks before the November 5 US presidential election won by Donald Trump, who has promised to give Israel freer rein.</p>

<p>Although outgoing President Joe Biden had repeatedly urged Israel to deliver more humanitarian aid and protect civilians, he mostly stopped short of using leverage such as cutting off weapons.</p>

<p>Kissufim, near a kibbutz across from southern Gaza that was attacked in the October 7, 2023 Hamas assault that sparked the war, has mostly been in disuse except by the military since Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed more than 43,603 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to data from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry that the United Nations considers reliable.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian MPs on Tuesday passed in the final third reading controversial legislation banning "propaganda" of remaining childless, the latest measure targeting what Moscow depicts as Western liberal ideas.</p>

<p>Facing an ageing population and low birth rates, Moscow is seeking to reverse a demographic slump -- accentuated by its military offensive on Ukraine -- that threatens its economic future.</p>

<p>MPs in the Duma lower house of parliament voted unanimously in favour of the draft bill, which would apply to materials online, in media, advertising and in films that promote "rejection of childbearing".</p>

<p>The bill targets "destructive content" that promotes a "conscious" rejection of having children.</p>

<p>Violations would be punishable by fines up to 400,000 rubles ($4,000) on individuals to five million rubles for businesses. The bill also includes a provision to deport foreigners.</p>

<p>"This is a fateful law... Without children, there will be no country. This ideology will lead to people stopping giving birth to children," the Duma's speaker Vyacheslav Volodin told MPs ahead of the vote.</p>

<p>He also said the legislation was about "protecting citizens, primarily the generation growing up, from information spread in the media space that negatively affects the development of personality".</p>

<p>This is "so new generations of our citizens grow up orientated towards traditional family values", he said.</p>

<p>The legislation will now be considered by the upper house of parliament on November 20, before being signed into law by President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>It would amend existing legislation that already bans any information seen as encouraging LGBTQ relationships or changing gender.</p>

<p>The Duma also passed legislation in the third reading banning foreigners in countries that allow gender reassignment from adopting Russian children.</p>

<p>It is the latest attack and stigmatisation of LGBTQ people by Moscow.</p>

<p>Moscow has long portrayed itself as a bulwark against liberal values, but that trend has hugely accelerated since the Kremlin launched its Ukraine offensive, further rupturing ties with the West.</p>

<p>The bill would ban adoption by citizens of countries that authorise "the change of sex by medical intervention, including with the use of medicine", or allow individuals to change their gender on official identity documents.</p>

<p>Since 1993, foreigners have adopted 102,403 children from Russia, Volodin said, warning that "Western policy towards children is destructive."</p>

<p>Russia has created an inhospitable environment for LBGTQ people for years. In July 2023, it banned the "international LGBT movement" as extremist and made gender reassignment illegal.</p>

<p>Putin himself has repeatedly mocked people who have undergone gender reassignment as well as LGBTQ people.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden was seen wiping away a tear during a rendition of 'God Bless America' at the Veterans Day service on Monday. As the song echoed through the grounds of the Arlington National Cemetery, the President appeared visibly emotional. The event was held to honour the service of those who have served in the US armed forces. A clip shared on X (formerly Twitter) captured the moment, with Biden expressing his emotions while singing along.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">???? Today, at the Veterans Day service at Arlington National Cemetery, President Biden teared up as he joined veterans in singing God Bless America.<br />

<p>President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, in their first joint appearance since Donald Trump's re-election, came together to honour US military veterans.</p>

<p>During the ceremony, Biden and Harris laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Standing side-by-side, they maintained a solemn expression. After placing the wreath, Biden paused for a moment of quiet reflection, making the sign of the cross.</p>

<p>In his speech, Biden shared his sense of gratitude, telling the crowd, "This is the last time I will stand here at Arlington as commander in chief. It's been the greatest honour of my life, to lead you, to serve you, to care for you, to defend you, just as you defended us generation after generation after generation."</p>

<p>He also spoke about his late son, Beau Biden, a major in the Delaware Army National Guard who served in Iraq and died from glioblastoma in 2015. He said, "Like many of you, our son Beau Biden deployed in Iraq for a year. I still remember the day he asked me to pin his bars on him. He stood ramrod straight. How proud Jill and I and our family felt."</p>

<p>Recounting the hardships military families face, he continued, "Like many of you, we remember how hard it was when he was deployed, empty seat at the dinner table, missed holidays, prayers of worry repeated every night. Just as we ask everything of our veterans, we ask everything of their families."</p>

<p>Addressing all military families, especially those with missing loved ones or those who have lost family members in combat, Biden assured them: "For all the military families, for all those with a missing or loved one still unaccounted for, to all those with loved ones who have died in combat. Jill and I want you to know we see you, we thank you, and we will never stop working to meet our sacred obligation to you and your families."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Thirty-five people were killed and 43 wounded after a car ploughed into pedestrians Monday evening in the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai, local police said Tuesday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A driver has killed 35 people and wounded 43 others in southern China, police said Tuesday, a day after the car ploughed down people exercising in a sports centre in the city of Zhuhai.</p>

<p>After the attack was reported on Monday, Police only said people had been wounded, while videos of the incident appeared to have been scrubbed from social media.</p>

<p>But on Tuesday, police said that a "serious and vicious attack" had occurred at Zhuhai Sports Centre, revealing the death count to be 35.</p>

<p>The 43 people wounded are not currently in life-threatening conditions.</p>

<p>Videos from Monday night geolocated by AFP showed people lying motionless on the ground, while others were seen frantically attempting to resuscitate the unconscious.</p>

<p>Preliminary investigations suggested that the 62-year-old driver, surnamed Fan, had been "triggered by (his) dissatisfaction with the division of property following his divorce", the police said in a statement.</p>

<p>Fan drove "a small SUV through the gate and forced his way into the city's sports centre, ramming people who were exercising on the internal roads of the sports centre", the statement added.</p>

<p>He was "controlled on the spot by the police who rushed to the scene as he attempted to drive away".</p>

<p>The police found Fan in his car cutting himself with a knife, before they stopped him and sent him to hospital.</p>

<p>He is currently in a coma after self-inflicted injuries to his neck and other parts of his body and unable to undergo interrogation, police added.</p>

<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has urged "all-out efforts" to treat the people injured and has "demanded punishing the perpetrator in accordance with the law", the official Xinhua news agency said.</p>

<p><strong>Lying motionless</strong></p>

<p>Graphic videos circulating on social media on Monday night showed the aftermath of the incident, though most had disappeared by Tuesday.</p>

<p>China's largest airshow showcasing Beijing's civil and military aerospace sector is being held in the same city at the moment.</p>

<p>On Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu, users expressed their shock at the death count.</p>

<p>"Last night after work, when I watched the news, there weren't this many people reported," one user commented on a photo of the police statement released. "Tonight, suddenly seeing this number -- so many families affected."</p>

<p>In a safety alert, Japan's embassy in China warned its citizens on Tuesday to be on high alert and "refrain from speaking loudly in Japanese and avoid provocative, attention-drawing behaviour such as being loud in groups".</p>

<p>The embassy said it had no information that any Japanese citizens had been wounded in the attack.</p>

<p>China has seen a spate of violent public attacks in recent months.</p>

<p>A man killed three people and wounded 15 in a knife attack at a supermarket in the Chinese megacity of Shanghai in October.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is very important to be kind to each other, to yourself and to the world. To remind people about the importance of the event, November 13 is observed as World kindness Day. Global doughnut chain Krispy Kreme has come up with an innovative idea to make this World Kindness Day extra sweet. It is offering free dozen original glazed doughnuts to eager customers. The offer applies to the first 500 guests in participating stores in various US locations, which means the bakery chain will be doling out approximately 6,000 free doughnuts per store.</p>

<p>"World Kindness Day is a reminder that we can all make a positive impact in people's lives, including through small gestures like sharing a sweet treat. We hope that each dozen Original Glazed doughnuts we give away enables and inspires many dozens of small acts of kindness," Krispy Kreme Global Chief Brand Office Dave Skena said in a release.</p>

<p>The offer is valid across the US. Some of its international locations - the chain operates in 40 countries - also have World Kindness Day promotions planned.</p>

<h3><strong>How to Get Your Free Doughnut</strong></h3>

<p>Participating in this sweet celebration is easy! On November 13th, simply head to your nearest Krispy Kreme store, and you'll be greeted with a warm smile and a free doughnut of your choice. Whether you prefer a classic Original Glazed, a decadent chocolate-filled treat, or something more adventurous, you can enjoy it at no cost.</p>

<p>According to UNESCO, World Kindness Day was first celebrated in 1998 by international NGO World Kindness Movement, which aims to promote goodwill around the world.</p>

<p>The UN body said that the day gives people the opportunity to reflect on one of the most important and unifying human principles - empathy, compassion and kindness. "On a day dedicated to the positive potential of acts of kindness big and small, let us collectively try to promote and spread this crucial quality that brings people of all kinds together," a note on UNESCO website says.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran will pursue whatever secures its interest, government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani said on Tuesday, when asked if there could be direct talks with the Trump administration.</p>

<p>"Whatever secures the country's interest and values of the revolution will be pursued by the government," Mohajerani told a journalist, according to the Iranian Student News Agency.</p>

<p>There have been no reports that Donald Trump or his team are planning any such talks as he prepares to return to the US presidency.</p>

<p>Trump unilaterally pulled the US out of Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers during his last term of office in 2018 and re-applied sanctions which severely impacted the Iranian economy.</p>

<p>"The maximum pressure campaign of Trump has failed, even if people have been burdened by it. What is important will be actions and not words, but we recommend Trump to take into account the failure of his past policies," Mohajerani added.</p>

<p>Indirect talks between Washington and Tehran to revive the nuclear deal were initiated under the administration of US President Joe Biden, but stalled. Iran is still formally part of the deal but has scaled back commitments to honour it due to US sanctions reimposed on the Islamic Republic.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A small amount of radioactive debris removed by a robot from Japan's stricken Fukushima nuclear plant has arrived at a research lab near Tokyo, the plant operator said Tuesday, after a journey kept secret for safety reasons.</p>

<p>The announcement comes after operator Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) said last week that a tricky trial debris removal operation using a specially developed extendible device had been completed.</p>

<p>More than 13 years after a catastrophic tsunami caused by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake triggered one of the world's worst nuclear accidents, around 880 tons of hazardous material remain.</p>

<p>Removing this debris is seen as the most daunting challenge in the decades-long decommissioning project, because of the dangerously high radiation levels.</p>

<p>Despite delays caused by technical snags, the trial debris removal from the plant in northeastern Japan went ahead with the aim of studying the sample for clues about conditions inside the reactors.</p>

<p>TEPCO said in an email to reporters on Tuesday that "the transportation of the fuel debris collected during the test removal operation... was completed" during the afternoon.</p>

<p>The company had not previously given details of when the 160 kilometre (100 mile) journey to the Oarai Nuclear Engineering Institute of the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) would take place, citing safety concerns.</p>

<p>According to Japanese media reports, while the sample retrieved by the robot weighs 0.7 grams (0.02 ounces), the JAEA has said it would need at least one gram to conduct a proper analysis.</p>

<p>Three of Fukushima's six reactors went into meltdown in 2011 after the huge tsunami swamped the facility.</p>

<p>Japan last year began releasing into the Pacific Ocean some of the 540 Olympic swimming pools' worth of reactor cooling water amassed since the disaster.</p>

<p>The step sparked a diplomatic row with China and Russia, both of which banned seafood imports, although Japan insists the discharge is safe, a view backed by the UN atomic agency.</p>

<p>Beijing, however, said in September it would "gradually resume" importing seafood from Japan.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ms Truss was reportedly informed that the Russian president was mere hours from deploying a nuclear weapon.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vladimir Putin came alarmingly close to using nuclear weapons in October 2022, prompting then-UK Prime Minister Liz Truss to prepare for potential consequences during her final days in office, according to an updated version of her biography.</p>

<p>Reports indicate that Ms Truss spent her last days as prime minister examining weather maps and preparing for radiation poisoning cases in the UK, following US intelligence suggesting an imminent nuclear strike, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/liz-truss-putin-ukraine-russia-nuclear-b2645407.html" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>The Independent </em></a>reported.</p>

<p>Ms Truss was reportedly informed that the Russian president was mere hours from deploying a nuclear weapon, which British officials feared could release radioactive material that would spread up to 1,700 miles from the blast. The revised edition of <em>Out of the Blue</em>, an unauthorized biography by journalists Harry Cole and James Heale, claims Truss spent "numerous hours studying satellite weather data and wind directions," concerned that unfavourable weather patterns could lead to a "direct fallout effect on Britain."</p>

<p>According to reports, US intelligence indicated a 50 per cent likelihood that Russia might use either a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine or a larger bomb over the Black Sea, with the intelligence described as "exquisite."</p>

<p>Excerpts from Out of the Blue, published by <em>The Sun</em>, reveal disturbing details of how narrowly the war avoided nuclear escalation. On October 18 of that year, then-Defense Secretary Ben Wallace travelled to Washington to address the crisis. Around the same time, President Joe Biden warned of a "direct threat" of Russia using nuclear weapons if the situation continued to escalate, stating, "A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought."</p>

<p>The updated edition of Out of the Blue was released following former Prime Minister Liz Truss's book, Ten Years to Save the West, which contained striking claims about her 49 days in office.</p>

<p>In her memoir, Ms Truss, who lost her seat in the general election, revealed that upon learning of the Queen's death, she thought, "Why me, why now?" She also mentioned that Boris Johnson's dog had left fleas in No. 10, recounting how her husband predicted that her time as prime minister "would all end in tears."</p>

<p>Ms Truss described learning about Johnson's forced resignation while she was in Bali as foreign secretary. She recalled, "As I walked along the beach in Indonesia, I started crying. Even Hugh [her husband], who had foreseen it ending in tears, agreed that this was the moment I was expected to step up. If I didn't, people would say I had backed down."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kai Trump, the granddaughter of US President-elect Donald Trump, has shared a glimpse of their family celebrations on election night following her grandfather's win over Kamala Harris. She also shared moments leading up to the Trump family photograph featuring Tesla CEO Elon Musk.</p>

<p>The 17-year-old is an avid vlogger on YouTube and posts moments from her life with her 1,78,000 subscribers. In her latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smI_BS5Tujg">video</a>, the teenager shared her thoughts on Donald Trump's second term in the White House.</p>

<p>The little over 10-minute video starts with Kai getting her makeup done and sharing her thoughts about the election. "I am here in my house getting ready for the election night at Mar-a-Lago and the convention centre," she said, sitting in a makeup chair.</p>

<p>On her way to the Florida resort, she listened to ABBA's <em>'Money, Money, Money'</em> song every time she drove through the gates. Kai said she hadn't seen her grandfather in a while because he was busy campaigning, adding she was "super excited" to see him again. "He's called me almost every other day," she added.</p>

<p>As she reached the venue, the video showed the room filled with her family and close friends. Altogether, they watched across four TVs, with different channels delivering results.</p>

<p>The vlog also shows how the viral family photograph, also featuring the richest person in the world, was taken. As the family members posed for the camera, Trump is seen insisting on including Musk and his four-year-old son X Æ A-12 in another pic.</p>

<p>"Elon... You have to get Elon with his boy. Gorgeous, perfect boy," Trump can be heard saying in the video.</p>

<p>After the watch party, Kai headed to the Palm Beach Convention Center to meet her friends, who also appeared on the vlog.</p>

<p>While Kai said she was "very nervous" at the beginning of the night, she later described November 5 as a "special night".</p>

<p>"I'm extremely proud of him (Donald Trump)... I think he deserves it more than anyone in the whole world... He's such an incredible person and such a unique person," she said.</p>

<p>She noted it was "his last time running so it was so special for him to win because he really deserves this." She added that she was now "really excited" to see what Donald Trump would do for the next few years, adding "he's gonna kill it."</p>]]></content:encoded>

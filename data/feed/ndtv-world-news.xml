       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A sailor was found floating in the middle of the ocean several nautical miles off the coast of Australia more than a day after he fell overboard a cargo ship.</p>

<p>The man, who was sailing in the vessel Double Delight - a Singapore-based bulk carrier. The sailor, who fell while he was out on deck late at night, was found 8 nautical miles off the coast of Newcastle, a harbour city north of Sydney in Australia.</p>

<p>A search was initiated shortly after 11:30 pm local time on Thursday when the ship's staff informed coastal authorities in Sydney. However, no contact or visibility could be detected in the night-long operations.</p>

<p>The rescue operation, that went on late into the night, involved two life boats, two helicopters and an aircraft.</p>

<p>Authorities got information about a man found floating in the ocean by recreational fishermen who were returning to the harbour late on Friday evening. An ambulance service from New South Wales was pressed into effect and paramedics were rushed to a beach in Swansea, a neighbouring town south of Newcastle, to attend to the man found at sea.</p>

<p>A spokesperson from the coalstal authorities in Sydney said, "The patient, a man in his 20s, reportedly was in the water for about 24 hours. He was wearing a life jacket, he was conscious, he was able to communicate with us, but he was very cold and absolutely exhausted."</p>

<p>The sailor has been admitted to a hospital for the required treatment. The authorities are yet to record his statement to understand what exactly happened and how he went overboard in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>The fact that he was found with a life jacket fastened to him suggests it might have been an intentional jump, however, there is no clarity on that yet.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Tens of thousands of people from around the globe will gather next week for COP29, the annual UN climate summit, in Azerbaijan's capital of Baku.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tens of thousands of people from around the globe will gather next week for COP29, the annual UN climate summit, in Azerbaijan's capital of Baku.</p>

<p>But as each year's summit has produced its own set of promises, plans, and paperwork to chase, the rationale for these discussions can be hard to follow.</p>

<p>Here's what you need to know about why COP, short for Conference of the Parties, matters:</p>

<h3><strong>Why do we have a yearly COP?</strong></h3>

<p>Because climate change will affect every country, regardless of whether it contributed to the problem, it demands global solutions that can address the diversity of needs across countries.</p>

<p>In signing the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that launched the global negotiations, the parties that agreed to it took pains to differentiate between the wealthy nations that caused the bulk of warming and poorer countries that suffer disproportionately from it.</p>

<p>Put another way, the talks are framed around the idea that the countries that benefited the most from industrialising should take the most responsibility for dealing with the warming that resulted.</p>

<p>Addressing that imbalance has become more difficult as developing countries' economies have grown and rich nations juggle competing costs including war.</p>

<h3><strong>What can a yearly summit achieve?</strong></h3>

<p>The summit provides a place for countries to discuss solutions, including energy policies, financing schemes or funding needs.</p>

<p>Nearly every summit is also attended by world leaders, giving an important signal that their countries are committed to the UNFCCC goals. The leaders' presence also helps countries hold one another accountable for past promises.</p>

<p>But the annual COP is just the main event in a continuous process. Country representatives meet year round to build support for new climate action proposals ahead of the COP, where they can be agreed by consensus of all countries.</p>

<h3><strong>Is the process working?</strong></h3>

<p>While each summit is meant to advance global climate action from the year before, the event also offers countries a chance to show their citizens the problem is being addressed.</p>

<p>Importantly, the exercise has seen countries counting and reporting their emissions, and has helped move hundreds of billions of dollars in climate aid to developing nations.</p>

<p>By requiring decisions by consensus, the process also ensures strong global support for agreed actions, improving the chances these actions will be implemented.</p>

<p>But the pace of progress has been too slow to contain the rise in global temperatures. Since COP summits began in 1995, both emissions and temperatures have continued to rise, meaning the world is on track for extreme climate change.</p>

<p>Proponents of the UNFCCC process say there is no alternative for negotiating major socioeconomic changes to try to limit global warming.</p>

<h3><strong>What will we get out of COP29?</strong></h3>

<p>This year's summit is hoping for a few headline agreements: a new annual climate finance target, a deal to get multilateral carbon credit markets working, and more aid money pledged for countries already hit by costly climate disasters.</p>

<p>Beyond that, negotiators will continue to work on technical agreements that build on work done at previous summits.</p>

<p>Outside the formal COP framework, groups of countries could launch their own initiatives or pledge funding for specific projects. Companies will likely announce commercial deals related to climate action, while financiers try to raise cash for climate investments.</p>

<h3><strong>What is Azerbaijan's role in COP29?</strong></h3>

<p>Azerbaijan holds the presidency of COP29 this year, when the rotating COP presidency fell to Central and Eastern Europe.</p>

<p>Next year Brazil will serve as Latin America's host for COP30.</p>

<p>As summit host, a country works the entire year to steer pre-summit negotiations and lobby other governments for ambitious action. This gives the presidency an important part in defining the summit's priorities.</p>

<h3><strong>What else happens at COP?</strong></h3>

<p>Beyond the country negotiations, the COP summit offers a chance for anyone to try to draw attention - or funding - to their cause.</p>

<p>Hundreds of side events see activists and scientists rubbing shoulders with industry lobbyists and banking heavyweights.</p>

<p>Public-facing conference stages host panel discussions on topics from ocean acidification to designing carbon offset projects.</p>

<p>An exhibition hall, dubbed the "Green Zone," features discussions led by national delegations, non-profit organisations and corporations.</p>

<p>While some summits have seen big organized protests, such as the rally of thousands outside of COP26 in Glasgow in 2021, the last two conferences in Egypt and the United Arab Emirates have allowed for protests only in designated, roped-off areas.</p>

<p>Azerbaijan, which also has banned public protests, will likely see little civic action outside of the high-security conference site.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Qatar has withdrawn as a key mediator for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Qatar has withdrawn as a key mediator for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal and warned Hamas that its Doha office "no longer serves its purpose", a diplomatic source told AFP on Saturday.</p>

<p>Qatar, with the United States and Egypt, has been engaged in months of fruitless negotiations for a truce with a hostage and prisoner releases.</p>

<p>"The Qataris informed both the Israelis and Hamas that as long as there is a refusal to negotiate a deal in good faith, they cannot continue to mediate," the source said on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>"As a consequence, the Hamas political office no longer serves its purpose," the source said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The informed source said Qatar had already "notified both sides, Israel and Hamas as well as the US administration" of its decision.</p>

<p>"The Qataris conveyed to the US administration that they would be ready to re-engage in mediation when both sides... demonstrate a sincere willingness to return to the negotiating table", the source added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Qatar, which is home to a major US military base, has hosted Hamas's political leadership since 2012 with Washington's blessing.</p>

<p>During the talks after Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel last year, both Qatari and US officials indicated that the militant group would remain in Doha as long as its presence offered a viable channel of communication.</p>

<p>Qatar said in April that it was reassessing its role as a mediator in the conflict as it was facing criticism, notably from Israeli and US politicians.</p>

<p>At that time, the Qataris gave a similar message over the status of the Hamas office, prompting Hamas officials to leave for Turkey, the diplomatic source said.</p>

<p>But they returned after two weeks at the request of the United States and Israel, as negotiations were "ineffective" while they were in Turkey, the source said.</p>

<p>Apart from a one-week pause in the fighting late last year, during which scores of Hamas-held hostages were released, successive rounds of negotiations have failed to halt the war.</p>

<p>To break the deadlock near the end of US President Joe Biden's term and in the run-up to this week's US elections, Washington and Doha last month announced fresh in-person talks to explore new options.</p>

<p>But the latest initiative produced no breakthrough.</p>

<p>The diplomatic source said Qatar had "concluded that there is insufficient willingness from either side, with the mediation efforts becoming more about politics and elections rather than a serious attempt to secure peace".</p>

<p>Qatar "advised the US administration and both parties that it would not accept being subjected to political exploitation aimed at gaining political leverage at Qatar's expense while misleading public perception", the source added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon's health ministry said Saturday seven people including two children were killed in Israeli strikes on the southern city of Tyre a day earlier, with rescuers still searching for missing people under the rubble.</p>

<p>"Israeli enemy strikes on the city of Tyre killed seven people including two girls, and injured 46 others," the ministry said, adding that body parts had been found and will be "identified with DNA testing".</p>

<p>It added that rubble was being cleared following the strikes as part of ongoing efforts to locate missing persons.</p>

<p>The ministry had on Friday reported a toll of three killed and 30 injured in the strikes.</p>

<p>AFP photos showed rescuers carrying bodies on stretchers amid the wreckage, as rubble and twisted metal were strewn across the street.</p>

<p>Earlier on Saturday, Lebanon's official National News Agency had said the deadly strikes targeted three buildings in the coastal city, causing "massive damage to dozens of homes".</p>

<p>The NNA also said "enemy fighter jets" destroyed two heritage houses in the southern city of Nabatiyeh.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said on Saturday it targeted Israeli troops, locations and military sites including a base and an area north of Haifa, in addition to downing an Israeli Hermes 450 drone over a south Lebanon village.</p>

<p>Israel intensified its air campaign on Lebanon in September and later sent in ground troops after a year of cross-border clashes.</p>

<p>The escalation came after nearly a year of low-intensity, cross-border attacks by Hezbollah in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas following its October 7, 2023 attack on Israel that triggered the Gaza war.</p>

<p>More than 3,110 people have been killed in Lebanon since the cross-border exchanges began, according to the Lebanese health ministry.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's Queen Camilla will not attend Remembrance Day events to recover from a chest infection, but hopes to return to public duties early next week, Buckingham Palace said on Saturday.</p>

<p>Camilla, the wife of King Charles, pulled out of planned engagements this week after suffering a chest infection for which her doctors advised a period of rest.</p>

<p>The 77-year-old will miss the annual Festival of Remembrance at London's Royal Albert Hall on Saturday and the main Remembrance Day ceremony on Sunday.</p>

<p>The ceremony at the Cenotaph war memorial is held on the nearest Sunday to Nov. 11 to mark the end of World War One, and pays tribute to those who lost their lives in conflict.</p>

<p>"Following doctors' guidance to ensure a full recovery from a seasonal chest infection, and to protect others from any potential risk, Her Majesty will not attend this weekend's Remembrance events," a palace spokesperson said, adding she would mark the occasion privately at home.</p>

<p>Princess Kate, 42, who is gradually returning to public engagements after preventive treatment for cancer this year, will attend the Remembrance events alongside her husband Prince William, Charles and other members of the royal family.</p>

<p>The Princess of Wales said in September she had finished chemotherapy, but her path to full recovery would be long.</p>

<p>At the time, she said she would be carrying out a handful of public engagements later in the year. Her last public appearance was in October when she met the bereaved families of three young girls who were murdered at a dance class in northwest England.</p>

<p>Charles, who is undergoing treatment for cancer which was diagnosed in February, recently visited Australia and Samoa.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Dozens of inhabitants of flooded communities said that by the time they received the regional government's alert, muddy water was already surrounding their cars, submerging streets of their towns and pouring into their homes.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The water was already knee-high on the ground floor of the hotel where Aitana Puchal had taken refugee when she received a text alert from the regional government of Valencia at 8 pm on Oct. 29 warning people to shelter in place from severe flash floods.</p>

<p>"We could have done with (the warning) about six hours earlier," said the 23-year-old, who had fled with other local residents and guests to the first floor of the hotel near the town of Paiporta. "We were all calming down a little from the panic and drying our feet." &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Others were not so fortunate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Carlos Martinez, another Paiporta resident, told local television the flood alert came when he was stranded in a tree "seeing bodies floating past."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dozens of inhabitants of flooded communities told Reuters that by the time they received the regional government's alert, muddy water was already surrounding their cars, submerging streets of their towns and pouring into their homes. &nbsp;</p>

<p>After days of storm warnings from the national weather service since Oct 25, some municipalities and local institutions had raised the alarm much earlier. Valencia University had told its staff the day before not to come to work. Several town halls across the region of eastern Spain had suspended activities, shut down public facilities and told people to stay home.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the mixed messages and confusion cost lives, dozens of local residents and experts told Reuters. More than 220 people died and nearly 80 are still missing in what is the most deadly deluge in a single European country since 1967, when floods in Portugal killed around 500.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The national weather service AEMET had raised its threat level for heavy rains to a red alert at 7.36am on Oct 29, following heavy rains in mountainous areas west of the city of Valencia from the early morning. In the 12 hours it took for the regional government's shelter-in-place order to come through, waters running through the usually dry Poyo ravine - the epicentre of the flooding - had surged to more than three times the flow of Spain's largest river.</p>

<p>As climate change exacerbates weather patterns along Spain's Mediterranean coast, floods are becoming commonplace and some previous incidents have been deadly. But after at least five decades without a major catastrophe, many people in Valencia were unaware of the grave dangers posed by flash flooding or how to respond.</p>

<p>Puchal, the 23-year old who sought refuge in the hotel, said she had never received much information about the risks of floods.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"At school, they gave talks about fires," she said. "But not floods." &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>That, combined with poor coordination among regional and national authorities as well as political decisions taken years ago not to invest in waterways infrastructure, worsened the calamitous loss of life, seven experts consulted by Reuters said.</p>

<p>"It was foreseeable that we would have catastrophic flooding here," said Felix Frances, professor of hydraulic engineering and environment at Valencia Polytechnic University.</p>

<p>Deaths were recorded in 14 of the 24 towns that had already been identified in environment ministry reports as at high risk of flooding, a Reuters review found.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Experts including hydraulic and civil engineers, geologists, urban planners and disaster relief specialists said successive failures - to conduct flood mitigation work on nearby rivers, better protect houses built on flood plains, educate people and warn residents quickly - added to the fatalities.</p>

<p>With better infrastructure, "those deaths would have been infinitely less," said Luis Banon, an engineer and professor of Transportation Engineering and Infrastructure at the University of Alicante.</p>

<p>One central government source said they expect multiple judicial enquiries to examine decisions made and to attribute responsibility for the high death toll.</p>

<p>As more of the world's population settles on flood plains, climate events become more extreme and Europe warms faster than the global average, what happened in Valencia underscores the need for strategic, coordinated measures to protect people in European cities, said Sergio Palencia, professor of urbanization in Valencia Polytechnic University.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frances said he had helped draw up a plan 17 years ago to build flood works for the Poyo ravine at a cost then of 150 million euros ($162 million). On Nov. 5, a week after the floods, the national government earmarked 10.6 billion euros to help victims.</p>

<p>The plan Frances worked on expired in 2017 because "no work had been initiated," Spain's State Secretary for the Environment Hugo Moran told Reuters. The government had to start from scratch and some works are underway, he said.</p>

<p>Frances said some people were so unaware of the risk they didn't know, for example, that it would be unwise to go down to a basement "to save the car."&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Multiple alerts</strong></h3>

<p>AEMET had already warned of a storm known locally as DANA -- a high-altitude isolated depression -- on Oct. 25. In following days, its warnings became more specific until Oct. 29, when the alert was upgraded to red -- the highest level, meaning high risks for the population.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At 8.45 am, the regional branch of AEMET posted footage on the social media platform X showing cars being swept down roads by a tide of brown water.</p>

<p>Just after noon, the public body managing the region's river basins, the Jucar Hydrographic Confederation (CHJ) emailed regional authorities saying the flow of water through the Poyo ravine had reached 264 cubic meters per second. That's stronger than the average flow of the Guadalquivir river, one of Spain's largest.</p>

<p>The CHJ said it can only feed the information to regional emergency services, which are responsible for issuing alerts to citizens. Three experts told Reuters that once water started rising, it would take less than nine hours to reach the towns. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the next eight hours, officials from the regional and national governments, environmental authorities and emergency services exchanged phone calls, emails and held emergency meetings.</p>

<p>For some time that afternoon, the data from the CHJ suggested the flow was declining.</p>

<p>Carlos Mazon, the region's president and the main person responsible for issuing a shelter-in-place alert, has become a focus for anger over authorities' reaction to the storm. Despite signs of severe flooding, he did not change his schedule.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At a news conference at lunchtime, he cited a national weather forecast saying the storm's intensity would decrease around 6pm, according to a tweet he later deleted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the day went on Mazon, a member of the conservative People's Party that sits in opposition to the Socialist-run national government, appeared in photos tweeted by his staff receiving a sustainable tourism certification, and discussing budgetary matters.</p>

<p>His office did not respond to requests for comment on his handling of the disaster. Mazon told reporters on Thursday that he had a "work lunch" on Oct 29 and was constantly in touch with his team handling the situation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At 5pm, as the authorities met again, the CHJ gave "verbal notification" of a generalised increase in water flows running through or near the towns, according to a statement.</p>

<p>At 6.43pm, CHJ sent another email warning that the flow of water through the ravine had reached 1,686 cubic metres per second -- more than triple the pace of the Ebro, Spain's largest river.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Twelve minutes later, the CHJ said the Poyo flow had risen to 2,282 cubic meters per second before destroying the sensor that measured it.</p>

<p>"That could fill an Olympic pool every second," said Nahum Mendez, a geologist at Valencia University.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By 7pm, many towns were without power, making it difficult to send alerts immediately to phones or radio stations, officials said.</p>

<p>Maria Isabel Albalat, the mayor of Paiporta, which lies in the outskirts of the city of Valencia, said she called the national government delegate in the region to tell her that "my town was flooding" and "people were already dying." Police drove through the town with sirens, lights and loudspeakers telling people to stay off the bridge and leave the streets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At 8 pm, Spain's environment secretary Moran, who was travelling in Colombia, called the regional official in charge of the emergency services Salom&amp;#233; Pradas to say there was a risk a dam would fail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pradas told local television on Thursday that a technical advisor then suggested the services send a text alert. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"How is it possible that with all the information that was available ... the agencies responsible for activating the alarms did nothing?" Moran said.</p>

<p>Mazon, the regional head, later said the CHJ data showing water flows declining had added to the confusion and delays. Moran, whose department oversees the CHJ, told Reuters its task was just to provide real time information to emergency teams, not to make decisions on their response.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Paiporta mayor Albalat said that by the time the alert came, "we had been up to our necks in water for more than an hour and a half."</p>

<h3><strong>Flood protections</strong></h3>

<p>Political decisions to not invest earlier in better flood defences to protect a wider area have multiplied the economic cost "by 200," said Banon, the Alicante professor.</p>

<p>"This type of works aren't sexy, don't give political profitability until something happens," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Now they have no choice but to undertake the works."</p>

<p>In other countries such as the United States and Japan, natural disasters are more commonplace so people have a better sense of how to respond, said Maria Jesus Romero, 50, Professor of Urban Planning Law at the Polytechnical University of Valencia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some Valencia residents remembered past floods, including a major one in 1957. After that, the city of Valencia was protected by hydraulic works completed under dictator General Francisco Franco in 1973.</p>

<p>Paiporta residents Rosario Masia, 84, and her husband Cristobal Martinez, 87, said past floods were "nothing" compared with this one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We had a hard time, but not like now," said Masia. "We are in pieces."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many properties hit by the floods were built before 2003 when revised guidance on building in flood zones was issued, experts said. The new guidance either bans construction or includes strict pre-requisites including that properties built in flood zones should not have basements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the largely working-class suburbs of Valencia, the car is vital to get to work. Many of those interviewed by Reuters in the flood zone said their first move when it rains is to move their cars out of underground car parks of their apartment blocks so the engines aren't damaged by flooding.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's historic comeback has sparked a wave of congratulatory messages and statements from across the globe. Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed it as a "historic election victory," while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described it as "history's greatest comeback." Vikas Swarup, a former Indian diplomat, praised the win as "one of the greatest political comebacks in history." Additionally, the victory has led to a significant surge in online searches related to Donald Trump and his remarkable achievement.</p>

<p>News of Donald Trump getting elected the 47th President of America has evoked two different emotions in the American population. The right-wing populists, who strongly oppose immigration, cheered on and celebrated the new president while the Democrats started to look into new opportunities to migrate themselves.</p>

<p>Notably, since 1892, no US President who had lost an election has ever come back to win a non-consecutive second election. In the US presidential election, Republican candidate and former President Donald Trump won a decisive victory over his Democratic rival Kamala Harris. He will be sworn in as the 47th President of the United States, which will be his second term in this post.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From New York to the Rio Grande Valley, across big cities like Miami and San Francisco, in college towns and subdivision-dotted exurbs, the US electorate this year shifted unmistakably rightward.</p>

<p>You can see it if you zoom in on a place like Robeson County, North Carolina, a majority-minority county with the state's largest Native American population, which swung 9 points toward Donald Trump. You can see it if you zoom out, with the reliably blue state of New Jersey favoring Kamala Harris by just 5 points only four years after President Joe Biden won it in a 16-point rout.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/j68020to_trump-bloomberg-story-stat-1-bloomberg_625x300_09_November_24.png" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>The trend cut across demographic groups, with the heavily Arab American city of Dearborn, Michigan, giving a plurality of its votes to the Republican. Latino men backed Trump by a 12-point margin, according to CNN exit polls - an outcome that would've been unimaginable to strategists from both parties as recently as 2012, when the GOP lost the presidency and said in its own autopsy of the contest that non-White voters "think that Republicans do not like them."</p>

<p>The strength of the right was apparent up and down the ballot, with Republicans taking control of the Senate and appearing on the cusp of holding a narrow majority in the House. While the extent of the carnage is still being tallied, Democrats lost their majorities in the lower houses of the Michigan and Minnesota legislatures.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/4ekb6vr4_donald-trump-bloomber-story-bloomberg_625x300_09_November_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>And the shift was so broad that it left Democrats with hardly any silver linings. After claiming the popular vote in every election since 2008 - and lamenting the Electoral College as a quirky obstacle to what would otherwise be an era of assured political dominance - the party looks poised to lose that, too.</p>

<p>That came despite Democrats outspending Republicans and knocking on millions more doors, and after Harris' star-studded endorsements and meticulous ground game, which in the end fell short as Trump closed the deal with Joe Rogan and Elon Musk. Ultimately, Harris' truncated 107-day campaign after Biden's sudden exit couldn't shake off voter anxiety over the direction of the country, especially the state of the economy and immigration.</p>

<p>"The Democratic Party just has to come to terms with the fact that we were rejected en masse at the national level by the American electorate," said Evan Roth Smith, a Democratic pollster.</p>

<h2><strong>BORDER COUNTIES</strong></h2>

<p>One place that helps illuminate Trump's decisive victory is Maverick County, Texas. Its shift was bigger than that of any other county in the nation: Trump won it with 59% of the vote - a 28-point swing from four years ago.</p>

<p>The last Republican to win Maverick County was Herbert Hoover in 1928.</p>

<p>Maverick, where nearly 90% of the population speaks Spanish at home, has large numbers of Latino voters. Trump won Latino men outright nationwide, and while Latino women still broke for Harris, the Republican chipped away at her party's advantage with them.</p>

<p>The map gives hints about the issues that drove the shift. Eight of the 10 US counties with the largest lurch to the right were in Texas - all of them along the Rio Grande River that separates the US from Mexico. Maverick is home to Eagle Pass, a hotspot for border crossings that Trump promised to shut down.</p>

<p>Both campaigns shelled out on ads aimed at Latino voters, with the percentage of presidential election ads running on Spanish-language television and radio stations hitting a record this year.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/lihgtcss_trump-bloomberg-story-stat-2-bloomberg_625x300_09_November_24.png" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>"These people have always been conservative, they have just never had anyone knocking on their door and saying it's ok to vote this way," said Abraham Enriquez, founder of Bienvenido US, a Republican advocacy group that targeted Latino voters in Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Texas during the election.</p>

<p>Betty Silva, a New York voter and daughter of Puerto Rican parents, is one voter who put aside personal dislike of Trump and cast her ballot for him. When the Republican was president, she said, "I could afford stuff."</p>

<p>Trump's victory this time has shown Republicans that a winning coalition can be built around populist appeals to multi-ethnic, working-class voting blocs - and that his 2016 win was no fluke.</p>

<p>Still, it remains to be seen how enduring Trump's MAGA movement will be in 2028, when he will be constitutionally barred from a third term. After all, voters already rejected him in 2020 as the pandemic upended the economy.</p>

<h3><strong>HARRIS COLLAPSE</strong></h3>

<p>The story of the 2024 election is as much about a Harris collapse as it was a Trump surge. With Arizona and Nevada still to be called, but leaning Republican, Trump could get as many as 312 electoral votes if he completes the sweep of all seven battleground states. That's more than the victor received in the last two elections, but well short of a landslide by historical standards: Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama all received more.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/mr2ppdso_trump-harris-bloomberg-story-stat-3-bloomberg_625x300_09_November_24.png" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>In states with mostly complete results, Trump improved over his 2020 vote totals in roughly equal proportions in battleground and non-battleground states.</p>

<p>But Harris can't say the same. As of early Friday morning, she was 84,227 votes behind Biden's pace in five battleground states - but 2.7 million votes behind in 29 other states with more than 98% of expected vote counted. As Monmouth University pollster Patrick Murray noted, her vote totals suffered most in states where Democrats usually win - a sign of flagging enthusiasm from her base.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/cbfrnnmg_trump-harris-bloomberg-story-stat-4-bloomberg_625x300_09_November_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Arizona voter Jennifer Linzy couldn't get behind Harris because of the vice president's stance on the Israel-Hamas war. Linzy, a 39-year-old progressive, left a Phoenix polling station on Tuesday saying she only voted in down-ballot races. "This is the first time I've abstained in my entire adult life in a presidential election," she said.</p>

<p>Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located, is on track to have a 20% increase in these presidential "undervotes" this year compared to last time.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><small><em>Election officials sort ballots ready for tabulation at the Maricopa County Tabulation and Election Center (MCTEC) in Phoenix. Photographer: Dominic Valente/Bloomberg</em></small></p>
</div>

<p>Of the US counties with more than 98% of the expected vote counted as of 12:00 a.m. Friday, Trump had improved his vote share in 2,380 of them. Harris improved over Biden's 2020 mark in just 231 of them. Many of those were the Georgia and North Carolina counties hardest hit by September's Hurricane Helene, suppressing turnout.</p>

<p>In Monroe County, Pennsylvania, in the heart of the Pocono Mountains, New York City expatriates have shaded local politics blue for the last two decades. But after a 7-point shift to the right, Trump is winning the county by 900 votes.</p>

<p>Trump's showing, coupled with Republicans taking control of the Senate and on track to keep the House, will give him a strong hand in negotiating with Congress on taxes, spending, immigration and trade. He's shown a willingness to use his endorsement to impose party discipline, giving him considerable influence over leadership in Congress.</p>

<p>And he's already appointed three justices to the Supreme Court in his first term - creating a six to three conservative majority - and with three justices in their 70s, he could have a chance to nominate even more.</p>

<p>"Voters of the United States of America decisively said we are not happy with what we've received under the Biden presidency, and we're ready to go in a different direction," said Jay Townsend, a bipartisan political consultant.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 election – and his threat to impose tariffs on all imports to the United States – highlights an important problem for the global economy.</p>

<p>The US is a technological powerhouse, spending more than any other country on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03403-4">research and development and winning more Nobel prizes</a> in the last five years than every other country combined. Its inventions and economic successes are <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2024/10/14/the-american-economy-has-left-other-rich-countries-in-the-dust">the envy of the globe</a>. But the rest of the world needs to do everything in its power to avoid being too dependent on it.</p>

<p>And this situation would not have been much different had Harris won.</p>

<p>The “America first” approach of Donald Trump has actually been a bipartisan policy. At least since previous president Barack Obama's policy of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2023/05/02/us-energy-independence-soars-to-highest-levels-in-over-70-years/">energy independence</a>, the US has been on a mostly inward-looking quest of maintaining technological supremacy while ending the offshoring of industrial jobs.</p>

<p>One of the major choices Trump made in his first term was to accept higher prices for US consumers in order to protect national producers by slapping high tariffs on almost every trading partner.</p>

<p>For instance, Trump's 2018 tariffs on washing machines from all over the world mean US consumers have been paying <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20190611">12% more</a> for these products.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden – in certainly a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-racism-asian-mcconnell-youngkin-b2227283.html">more polite</a> way – then <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/13/politics/china-tariffs-biden-trump/index.html">increased</a> some of the Trump tariffs: up to 100% on electric vehicles, 50% on solar cells and 25% on batteries from China.</p>

<p>At a time of climate emergency, this was a clear choice to slow down the energy transition in order to protect US manufacturing.</p>

<p>While Biden <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/16/us-eu-agree-ceasefire-in-long-running-trade-war-over-aircraft-subsidies">signed a truce</a> with Europe on tariffs, it started a perhaps even more damaging battle by launching a subsidy race.</p>

<p>The US Inflation Reduction Act for instance contains <a href="https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/eu-us-green-arms-race-misses-bigger-picture-2023-03-16/">US$369 billion</a> (£286 billion) of subsidies in areas such as electric vehicles or renewable energy. And the <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/blog/2024/08/two-years-later-funding-chips-and-science-act-creating-quality-jobs-growing-local">Chips Act</a> committed US$52 billion to subsidise the production of semiconductors and computer chips.</p>

<h2>China, Europe and the rest of the world</h2>

<p>This US industrial policy might have been inward-looking, but it has clear consequences for the rest of the world. China, after decades of mostly export-based growth, must now deal with massive problems of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6bce03f5-bc7c-45df-9d86-363ade9ab47f">industrial overcapacity</a>.</p>

<p>The country is now trying to encourage more <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d82840e4-755b-4ecc-9277-93245cc8c8a9">domestic consumption</a> and to diversify <a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/global-economy/article/3256119/china-ev-exports-slammed-wests-trade-barriers-find-greener-pastures-free-trade-partners">its trading partners</a>.</p>

<p>Europe, despite a very tight budget constraint, spends a lot of money <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-chips-act_en">in the subsidy race</a>. Germany, a country facing sluggish growth and big doubts on its <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6c345cf9-8493-4429-baa4-2128abdd0337">industrial model</a>, is committed to matching US subsidies, offering for instance <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/northvolt-gains-eu-nod-986-mln-german-aid-build-ev-battery-plant-2024-01-08/">€900 million</a> (£750 million) to Swedish battery makers Northvolt to continue producing in the country.</p>

<p>All those subsidies are <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/07/13/subsidies-and-protection-for-manufacturing-will-harm-the-world-economy">hurting the world economy</a> and could have easily financed urgent needs such as the electrification of the <a href="https://www.tse-fr.eu/debate-ecological-transition-sub-saharian-african-crampes-estache">entire African continent</a> with solar panels and batteries. Meanwhile, China has replaced <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/africaatlse/2022/11/04/what-is-chinas-investment-end-game-in-africa/">the US and Europe</a> as the largest investor in Africa, following its own interest for natural resources.</p>

<p>The incoming Trump mandate might be a chance to fix ideas.</p>

<p>One might, for instance, argue that the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and the thousands of deaths and the energy crisis that followed, could have been avoided had the Biden administration been clearer to Russian president Vladimir Putin about the consequences of an invasion, and provided modern weapons to Kyiv before the war.</p>

<p>But the blame is mostly on Europe. Credit where it's due, the strategic problem of becoming too dependent on Russian gas is something Trump had <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/markets/currencies/trump-lashes-germany-over-gas-pipeline-deal-calls-it-russias-captive-idUSKBN1K10VH/">clearly warned Germany</a> about during his first mandate.</p>

<p>There is a clear path forward: Europe could help China fix its overcapacity problems by negotiating an end to its own tariff war on Chinese technology such as <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_13_501">solar panels</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/eu-slaps-tariffs-chinese-evs-risking-beijing-payback-2024-10-29/">electric cars</a>.</p>

<p>In exchange, Europe would regain some sovereignty by producing more of its own clean energy instead of <a href="https://ieefa.org/european-lng-tracker-september-2024-update">importing record amounts</a> of liquid gas from the US. It could also <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-give-china-taste-its-own-medicine-ev/">learn a few things</a> from producing with Chinese companies, and China could use its <a href="https://theconversation.com/russia-has-become-so-economically-isolated-that-china-could-order-the-end-of-war-in-ukraine-232951">immense leverage on Russia</a> to end the invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>The European Union could also work harder on what it does best: signing <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/028981e6-33f0-4f0f-88a1-1846e2616e7c">trade deals</a>, and using them as a way to <a href="https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/carbon-border-adjustment-mechanism_en">reduce carbon emissions</a> around the world.</p>

<p>This is not only about Europe and China. After decades of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/much-better-awful-can-be-better">continuous improvement</a> on all major dimensions of human life, the world is moving backwards.</p>

<p>The number of people facing hunger is increasing, taking us back to <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/24-07-2024-hunger-numbers-stubbornly-high-for-three-consecutive-years-as-global-crises-deepen--un-report">the levels of 2008-9</a>. War is raging in Gaza, Sudan, Myanmar, Syria, and now Lebanon. The world had not seen as many <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/09/more-civilian-casualties-recorded-in-2023-than-any-year-since-2010-gaza">civilian casualties</a> since 2010.</p>

<figcaption><span class="caption">Tariffs: how we got here.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For better or worse, it is unlikely that a Trump administration will reverse the path of lower US interventionism. It is also unlikely to lead any major initiative on peace, climate change or on the liberalisation of trade.</p>

<p>The world is alone, and America will not come to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68266447">save it</a>.</p>

<p>We do not know what will happen to the US. Maybe the return of Trump will mostly be a continuation of the last ten years. Maybe <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/news/if-elected-donald-trumps-proposed-tariffs-would-damage-the-economies-of-united-states-china-and-europe-and-set-back-climate-action/">prohibitive tariffs</a> or destroying the institutions that made the US such an <a href="https://theconversation.com/nobel-economics-prize-how-colonial-history-explains-why-strong-institutions-are-vital-to-a-countrys-prosperity-expert-qanda-241305">economic powerhouse</a> will make the US economy less relevant.

       <description><![CDATA[The asteroid was first observed on October 22 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey in Hawaii.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month, the Earth's atmosphere was bombarded by a small, boulder-sized asteroid just hours after it had first been detected, having evaded early impact monitoring systems. The object, designated 2024 UQ, was discovered just two hours before entering Earth's atmosphere, and fortunately, there was no real threat, since it measured only 3 feet (1 meter) in diameter.</p>

<p>The Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, a four-telescope survey based in Hawaii for monitoring near-Earth objects, had discovered the asteroid on October 22. Within days of its detection, 2024 UQ disintegrated in the atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean, off California, creating an "imminent impactor," or an impact where Earth-bound objects are detected hours before hitting the planet.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/londons-iconic-dogstar-bar-and-nightclub-forced-to-close-down-before-squatters-take-over-6980115">Also Read | London's Iconic Dogstar Nightclub Forced To Close Down Before Squatters Take Over</a></p>

<p>"ATLAS survey obtained images that included detections of a small object in a high-probability collision course. However, due to the location of the object near the edge of two adjacent fields, the candidate was recognized as a moving object only a few hours later," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://neo.ssa.esa.int/documents/d/guest/newsletter-november-2024">ESA wrote in the newsletter.</a>"By the time the astrometry reached the impact monitoring systems, the impact had already happened."</p>

<p>According to ESA, the asteroid was the third imminent impactor detected this year.</p>

<p>That close call serves to highlight both the strengths and weaknesses of the modern track system and sets an argument for continuing investment in early detection technology. While harmless in this circumstance, the situation serves to bring focus to Earth's continued improvement efforts in regards to space surveillance-the possibility of potentially dangerous space rocks slipping undetected.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's expected foreign policy towards Europe during his second term will have far-reaching, and possibly, grave consequences.</p>

<p>At the end of last week, journalist <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-kamala-harris-jd-vance-tim-waltz-eu-nato-us-elections-weapons/">Nicholas Vincour</a> suggested that the decades-long close Europe-American relationship was about to be over, whoever won the White House. And that Europeans should worry less about the presidency and “more about how Europe can hack it alone on a dangerous global stage”. Yesterday's dismissible cynicism over declining American commitment in Europe is today's cautionary tale. But with Trump as president that concern deepens considerably, particularly over trade and defence.</p>

<p>In his first presidency Trump unleashed a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/business/timeline-key-dates-in-the-us-china-trade-war-idUSKBN1ZE1AA/">battery of tariffs</a>, tit for tats and trade wars with states, companies and regions including the EU. That trend is set to continue, if Trump's <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/6/asia-braces-for-disruption-to-alliances-trade-after-trumps-victory">campaign promises are to be believed</a>, including imposing 10-20% <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-trade-war-donald-trump-elections-triumphs-board-tariffs-transatlantic-relations/">tariffs on all imports</a>, with a particular focus on key states such as Germany and key companies including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/06/german-carmakers-shares-slump-fear-trump-tariffs">Mercedes-Benz</a>.</p>

<p>Trump's stated preference is to reset the supply chains <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFskg98w204">to US advantage</a>, either through eye-wateringly high <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-economy-risks-big-hit-under-trump-tariffs-plan-think-tank-says-2024-11-06/">tariffs</a> or ensuring greater post-manufacture assembly of foreign goods in the US. These are high stakes indeed. The US is the EU's biggest trade partner, with ever-increasing volumes of <a href="https://policy.trade.ec.europa.eu/eu-trade-relationships-country-and-region/countries-and-regions/united-states_en">goods and services</a> being purchased.</p>

<h2>Is Europe prepared?</h2>

<p>Not only has the European Commission been sharpening its teeth on a number of trade, tech, AI and investment-related mechanisms designed to keep <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai#:%7E:text=The%20AI%20Act%20is%20the%20first%2Dever%20comprehensive%20legal%20framework,powerful%20and%20impactful%20AI%20models">Trump-upmanship</a> at bay. But the highly anticipated trade war has already <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/business-economy-euro/european-semester_en">been prepared for</a>, at least in terms of protecting the EU's financial interests.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eesc.europa.eu">European Commission</a> is focused on increasing the EU's overall self-sufficiency in big tech, including climate tech and raw materials. This will likely invite arguments with the US, as well as unresolved arguments over steel.</p>

<p>Trump's antipathy to Europe isn't new. And it isn't entirely personal. Washington is no longer populated with policy makers with a natural empathy to, or even personal connections with, Europe. Even under presidents <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/what-will-define-barack-obamas-european-legacy-eu-us/">Barack Obama</a> and Joe Biden, Washington shifted clearly, and possibly permanently, away from both Europe <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/11/05/trump-win-nato-european-defense/">and Nato</a> and towards Asia</p>

<p>Whether via <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2024/09/u-s-troop-withdrawals-from-europe-wont-benefit-its-rivals/">reduced troop levels</a> or diminished diplomatic interest in Europe among officials in the State Department, <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2024/04/the-united-states-stepping-back-from-europe-is-a-matter-of-when-not-whether?lang=en">US attitudes to Europe</a> range from indifferent at best, to hostile at worst.</p>

<p>The US has moved from post-cold war levels of cooperation in 1994 <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-kamala-harris-jd-vance-tim-waltz-eu-nato-us-elections-weapons/">to pivot towards Asia</a> in the 2000s. Now, accelerated by entrenched partisanship, isolationism and Trump's second win, Washington remains content with <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-kamala-harris-jd-vance-tim-waltz-eu-nato-us-elections-weapons/">the ongoing</a> “downgrading of Europe in the psyche of American elites”.</p>

<p>This despite (<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-kamala-harris-jd-vance-tim-waltz-eu-nato-us-elections-weapons/">as argued</a> by retired US Army officer and former commanding general Ben Hodges) critically reducing the “huge advantage we [the US] have with our leadership inside NATO and our relationship with European countries”. As president, Trump is simply going to accelerate this trend.</p>

<h2>In the Baltics</h2>

<p>Among Baltic countries there is already an expectation that Trump will push European states for <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-23/trump-advisers-push-even-higher-target-for-nato-defense-spending?embedded-checkout=true">higher defence</a> spending. However, in the eyes of some, Trump's demand is not a bad thing in and of itself.</p>

<p>As Tallinn-based International Center for Defense and Security director Indrek Kannik <a href="https://news.err.ee/1609513435/expert-joe-biden-will-be-remembered-as-a-weak-president-on-foreign-policy">argues</a>: “If the US spends 3.5 to 4 percent on security, while Europe only spends 1.5 to 2 percent, it's an imbalance.”</p>

<p>Kannick's suggestion that “Europe will gradually assume more responsibility for its defense” echoes perspectives increasingly advocated in Brussels itself. In effect: now is the time for Europe to acknowledge finally its lacklustre, scattered approach to defence coordination.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-eu-officials-china-union-policy-kamala-harris-medicine-ukraine-defense/">Others fear</a> that Trump 2.0 “would be so hostile to Europe … that the bloc would have no choice but to bolster its defense spending”.</p>

<p>For the Baltics, the question of improving defence coordination and sorting out financing is vital in tackling the threat of a territory-hungry Putin on its borders.</p>

<h2>Wake up, Nato?</h2>

<p>Last time around, Trump was fiercely critical of Nato, largely because the US provides <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_67655.htm">the largest portion</a> of defence spending. Trump's view in 2016 was that this encouraged free-riding among other members, happy to contribute less at the US's expense.</p>

<p>This time, Trump has ramped up his criticism that Nato allies are still failing to spend enough. This in turn has spurred Trump to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/closer-trumps-years-criticizing-nato-defense-spending/story?id=107201586">suggest</a> that he would “encourage” Russia “to do whatever the hell they want” to Nato allies who fail to pay their bill.</p>

<p>This leaves open the question of whether the US itself would defend another member in the event of an attack, or even leave the organisation.</p>

<figure><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QvcikCxCNxE?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0" width="650"></iframe>

<figcaption><span class="caption">Sweden recently joined Nato and is concerned about an expansionist Russia.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Trump's options regarding Ukraine are simple: either arm it, or deny it aid. The former risks freezing battle lines and forcing an imperfect peace on Ukraine, the latter gives Russia's President Vladimir Putin a satisfactory victory, bringing an aggressive Russia to the very doorstep of the EU and Nato.</p>

<p>This is particularly worrying for Baltic states: with Ukraine overpowered, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/19ef9629-805f-49aa-81bc-54c84240b733">the eastern flank</a> of the EU and Nato would be exposed, which in turn would destabilise European collective security.</p>

<p>From a foreign policy perspective, the frustration is that European decision makers simply cannot be sure of what Trump will actually do next. As journalist <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/world/us/2024/10/10/the-biggest-drag-on-us-power-is-that-it-keeps-changing-its-mind/">Janan Ganesh recently observed</a>, the US “at its peak had more going for it than overwhelming strength. It had a certain amount of predictability. Without either, its purchase on events can't be the same”.</p>

<h2>Friends in some places</h2>

<p>Trump's victory will be warmly welcomed by some Europeans, particularly those from <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyvglq47y9o">far-right parties</a> who will now be confident in a White House that shares their ideological approaches. Similarly, Trump may even lend active support to far-right governments in Hungary and Italy.</p>

<p>There are opportunities aplenty. <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-pm-viktor-orban-donald-trump-win-us-elections-2024/?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=alert&amp;utm_campaign=Trump%20win%20is%20%E2%80%98in%20the%20bag%2C%E2%80%99%20Orb%C3%A1n%20gloats">Hungary's prime minister Viktor Orbán</a> has spent years personally cultivating a deep connection with Trump and Maga-Republicans. And Italy's prime minister Giorgia Meloni could continue the same balancing act she has within the EU on key issues including immigration.</p>

<p>Others, like the UK and the European Commission, are going to have to play either the pragmatist card, or be prepared to hit back, and hit hard against everything from isolationist tariffs to vanishing defence commitments.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Women in Afghanistan are not forbidden from speaking to each other, the Taliban government's morality ministry told AFP on Saturday, denying recent media reports of a ban.</p>

<p>Afghan media based outside the country and international outlets have in recent weeks reported a ban on women hearing other women's voices, based on an audio recording of the head of the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (PVPV), Mohammad Khalid Hanafi, about rules of prayer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PVPV spokesman Saiful Islam Khyber said the reports were "brainless" and "illogical", in a voice recording confirmed by AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A woman can talk to another woman, women need to interact with one another in society, women do have their needs," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He added, however, that there were exceptions according to Islamic law, such as those described by Hanafi that women should use hand gestures instead of raising their voices to communicate with other women while praying.</p>

<p>Women in Afghanistan are barred from singing or reciting poetry aloud in public, according to a recent "vice and virtue" law detailing sweeping codes of behaviour, including that women's voices should be "concealed" along with their bodies when outside their homes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Women's voices have also been banned from television and radio broadcasts in some provinces.</p>

<p>The law codified many rules the Taliban government has imposed based on their strict interpretation of Islamic law since they came to power in 2021, with women bearing the brunt of restrictions the United Nations has called "gender apartheid".&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Taliban authorities have banned education after secondary school for girls and women, also barring them from various jobs as well as parks and other public places.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Taliban government has said all Afghan citizens' rights are guaranteed under Islamic law.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few minutes after I took my seat at an advanced screening of Amazon Prime's Brian Epstein biopic, Midas Man, I found myself engaged in Beatles chat with the chap next to me. I wasn't surprised to find a fellow Fab Four fanatic at such an event. But I was surprised when I realised I was speaking with the legendary presenter <a href="https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Writer/paul-gambaccini">Paul Gambaccini</a>, a man who, I was soon to discover, met not only John, Paul, George and Ringo, but also original drummer Pete Best and bassist Stuart Sutcliffe's sister. Or “five and a half Beatles”, as he put it.</p>

<p>As the lights went down and we readied ourselves, Gambaccini whispered that he hoped this wasn't going to be “another Beatles film with no Beatles music in it”. The subject of soundtracks in Beatles biopics has always been an elephant in the room among fans, and Midas Man, like Backbeat (1994), In His Life: The John Lennon Story (2000), Lennon Naked (2010) and many others before it, did indeed lack any Lennon and McCartney (or Harrison) originals.</p>

<p>But, given that it cost the 2019 film Yesterday US$10 million (£7.7 million) to <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/beatles-biopics-ranked-2869762">acquire the rights to use the Beatles' music</a> (40% of the entire budget), this shouldn't really come as a surprise. And there aren't any crafty ways round it, either. This much we know from the fate of 1979's Birth of The Beatles which <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/beatles-biopics-ranked-2869762">has been prevented from reissue</a> due to its unauthorised use of songs.</p>

<p>Midas Man tells the story of the legendary Beatles manager, Brian Epstein. The film follows Epstein, played by Jacob Fortune-Lloyd, from his days as the unfulfilled manager of a furniture and musical instrument shop to making good on his promise that his unknown and unsigned band, The Beatles, would one day be “bigger than Elvis”.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/entertainment/music/midas-man-a-flimsy-portrait-of-the-man-who-discovered-the-beatles/ar-AA1tcOBd">Some reviews</a> have taken issue at how the film shows Epstein one minute suavely cajoling American TV host Ed Sullivan, and the next falling to pieces after the death of his father. But such contradictions of character were exactly what made Epstein who he was – a man <a href="https://mrepstein.tumblr.com/post/670711046215008256/the-fifth-beatles-double-life-the-sunday-times">Beatles biographer Craig Brown</a> has described as alternatively lonely, businesslike, scrupulous, obsessive, shrewd, awkward and pernickety.</p>

<p>For me, it's Epstein's complexity that makes him so endearing, both in real life and in Midas Man. Fortune-Lloyd expertly and realistically portrays him as confident in his abilities, but also on the cusp of being consumed by self-doubt at any moment. He also carries off the magnetic charm that led Epstein on his scarcely believable journey from selling pianos in his family shop to one of the most powerful people in the entertainment industry within the space of a few years.</p>

<figcaption><span class="caption">The trailer for Midas Man.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In what is ultimately a tragic story of a troubled life, it's unsurprising that there are plenty of tearjerker moments. But screenwriters Brigit Grant and Jonathan Wakeham avoid the temptation to overdo the pathos, choosing subtlety over the sledgehammer.</p>

<p>A combination of this and Fortune-Lloyd's understated acting lead to several poignant moments in the film. Epstein yearns to be a part of the band's world, but is kept on the sidelines due to his position of authority, (perceived) difference in class and, most importantly, his own social awkwardness.</p>

<h2>Being Brian</h2>

<p>The film's sets are a highlight throughout, from 1960s Liverpool's unique blend of vibrancy and poverty to the glitz and glamour of New York. The North End Music Store (NEMs) where Epstein worked and which became his management company, thrums with the energy and anticipation of the tectonic shift in culture that's just around the corner. And I've scarcely experienced a more immersive recreation of The Beatles's lunchtime performances at The Cavern.</p>

<p>Alongside Fortune-Lloyd's nuanced performance, there were several other standouts. Leo Harvey-Elledge provides much of the humour as George Harrison, Darci Shaw has a whale of a time as an effervescent Cilla Black, and the consistently excellent Eddie Marsan and Emily Watson are perfectly cast (although somewhat underused) as Epstein's parents.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><em><small>Leo Harvey Elledge as George Harrison in Midas Man. Signature</small></em></p>

<p>Good as the overall casting is, however, it's hard to see Fortune-Lloyd's Epstein as only six years senior to Jonah Lees's John Lennon. As versatile as the former is, he looks significantly older than Epstein's 27 years – the age he was when he first saw The Beatles perform at The Cavern in 1961.</p>

<p>This may seem like a minor point, but it affects the dynamic between him and the band, which, combined with the significant height difference between Fortune Lloyd (6ft 2) and Lees (5ft 8) gives a sense of authority that was more representative of The Beatles' producer, George Martin.</p>

<p>The decision to make John “Tex” Ellington (Ed Speleers) such a major character is also a bit of a surprise, as, although based on a real person, the role he played in Epstein's life is much-debated among Beatle historians. But the inclusion of this turbulent love affair did admittedly add another dimension to Epstein's characterisation.</p>

<p>With the exception of this, perhaps, there's nothing in Midas Man that die-hard Beatles fans didn't already know about Epstein. But given that he and The Beatles are part of what's been called <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/sep/20/beatles-films-midas-man-paul-mccartney-one-hand-clapping-let-it-be">“the greatest story ever told”</a>, that's not necessarily a bad thing.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Days after his win in the US Presidential elections, Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate security has been upgraded with a robotic dog. The mechanical canine was spotted patrolling the estate in Palm Beach, Florida, early on November 8, adding a futuristic layer to the estate's security measures.</p>

<p>According to<a href="http://https://nypost.com/2024/11/08/us-news/robot-dog-seen-patrolling-donald-trumps-mar-a-lago-estate/" rel="nofollow noindex"> The New York Post,</a> in videos, the robot dog, manufactured by Boston Dynamics, is seen moving along the grassy grounds, walking amid the palm trees surrounding the property. A warning label on its side reads, “DO NOT PET.”</p>

<p>The United States Secret Service confirmed the deployment of the robotic dog as part of its ongoing efforts to safeguard the President-elect. A spokesperson for the agency told New York Post, “Safeguarding the President-elect is a top priority. While we cannot get into the specific capabilities, the robotic dogs are equipped with surveillance technology, and an array of advanced sensors that support our protective operations.”</p>

<p>Trump, who survived two assassination attempts during his campaign, has been working on assembling his incoming administration at Mar-a-Lago following his victory over Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Robotic dogs have become increasingly popular among public safety agencies across the US. They provide a way to keep law enforcement officers and first responders out of harm's way in dangerous situations. The New York Police Department (NYPD) unveiled a robotic K-9 unit dubbed “Digidogs,” announced by Mayor Eric Adams last year. Originally leased from Boston Dynamics, the robots were met with public criticism, with social media users drawing comparisons to something straight out of the dystopian series Black Mirror.</p>

<p>Beyond law enforcement, these robots have been deployed for more critical, life-saving roles. In the aftermath of a parking garage collapse in Lower Manhattan last year, one such robot dog was sent into the wreckage to search for survivors and assess the destruction.</p>

<p>The military has also found use for these advanced machines. Earlier this year, Ukraine's military deployed 30 robot dogs, each costing around $9,000, against Russian forces. The “metal pooches” served as reconnaissance units that could swiftly deliver supplies, reducing the risk to human soldiers on the front lines.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Saturday warned that the wars in Gaza and Lebanon, where Israel is battling Tehran-backed groups, could spill over beyond the Middle East.</p>

<p>"The world should know that in case of the expansion of war, its harmful effects will not be limited only to the West Asia region; insecurity and instability can spread to other regions, even far away," Araghchi said in speech aired on state TV.</p>

<p>Iran's arch-nemesis Israel has been waging a devastating war in the Gaza Strip against Iran-backed Palestinian militant group Hamas since it launched its shock attack on Israel in October 2023.</p>

<p>Israel has more recently shifted its focus to Lebanon, where it has been engaged in full-fledged battle since September with Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant group which is financially and militarily supported by the Islamic Republic.</p>

<p>On October 26, Israel conducted air strikes on military sites in Iran in response to Tehran's October 1 attack on Israel, itself retaliation for the killing of Iran-backed militant leaders and a Revolutionary Guards general.</p>

<p>Iranian officials said Israel's October 26 attack killed four soldiers and resulted in "limited damage" to radar systems. Iranian media also reported that a civilian was killed.</p>

<p>Tehran has since vowed to retaliate despite the US and Israel's warning against it.</p>

<p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has maintained that a potential ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon could affect Iran's response.</p>

<p>"If they (the Israelis)... accept a ceasefire and stop massacring the oppressed and innocent people of the region, it could affect the intensity and type of our response," Pezeshkian said early this month.</p>

<p>On Thursday, an adviser to Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei cautioned against an impulsive response to Israel.</p>

<p>"Israel aims to bring the conflict to Iran. We must act wisely to avoid its trap and not react instinctively," the adviser, Ali Larijani, told state television.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former Hamas hostage has lambasted the United Nations and other advocacy groups for their inaction towards the plight of hostages still held in Gaza. During an address outside the United Nations Security Council in New York on November 6, Mia Shem expressed frustration over what she described as the UN's absence in seeking aid for those in captivity.<br />
<br />
“Not a single humanitarian agency saw me or treated me. Where was the Red Cross? Where was the UN demanding that they have access to us?” said Mia Shem, who was released in November 2023.<br />
<br />
The 22-year-old Israeli-French dual national detailed her harrowing experience marked by isolation, lack of medical treatment and intimidation by armed captors. She said, “For 50 days, I was kept alone, suffering from an unbearable pain in my hand, without any treatment. A Hamas terrorist sat in front of me in a dark room with a gun pointed at my head. Not a single humanitarian agency saw me or treated me even as my arm got worse.”</p>

<p>Shem also revealed how after her abduction she was held in a Palestinian home, where she endured harassment from an adult and taunts from a child. Speaking to Channel 12, she said, “There are no innocents in Gaza, not even one.”</p>

<p>Israel's UN Ambassador, Danny Danon, also spoke at the press conference, sharply criticising the UN's “complete moral failure.” He said the UN's silence on the issue was “unforgivable.”</p>

<p>According to a report in the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/08/world-news/freed-hamas-hostage-mia-shem-says-un-hasnt-lifted-a-finger-to-help-remaining-captives/" rel="nofollow noindex">New York Post</a>, while the UN Security Council has issued statements urging Hamas to release Israeli hostages, no specific actions or sanctions have been proposed to enforce these demands.</p>

<p>The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has maintained that, as a neutral humanitarian body, it cannot adopt a strong public stance, although it has expressed a desire to visit Israeli captives.</p>

<p>In over a year-long Israeli onslaught in Gaza, over 43,000 Palestinians -- a vast majority of them kids and women -- have been killed. Almost the entire population of Gaza has been internally displaced, with people forced to move from one place to another as Israeli rockets target neighbourhoods, hospitals and even camps offering temporary refuge.</p>

<p>The Benjamin Netanyahu government's war in Gaza came as a retaliation to Hamas' October 7 attack on a music festival and parts of southern Israel. At least 1200 people were killed in the attack, and Hamas took another 254 people hostage.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump is preparing for his second term in the Oval Office. Days after he defeated Kamala Harris in the Presidential polls, political observers in the US speculated that Trump would issue pardons for several controversial figures. From January 6 rioters to prominent public figures, these potential pardons seem to be part of Trump's strategy to galvanise his political base and challenge what he views as a biased legal system.</p>

<p>According to the US Department of Justice, “The President's clemency power is conferred by Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the Constitution of the United States, which provides: ‘The President…shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.'”</p>

<p>But pardons do not fully erase a criminal record. Even after a pardon, individuals may still face restrictions, such as being prohibited from voting in certain states.</p>

<h3><strong>Pardons for January 6 rioters</strong></h3>

<p>Trump has repeatedly expressed his intention to pardon those involved in the January 6 Capitol riots, though he remains vague on specifics. “If they're innocent, I would pardon them,” he remarked in July. Campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told the<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/11/06/jan-6-defendants-trump-pardons/"> Washington Post</a> that pardons would be decided on a “case-by-case” basis, with some defendants already invoking Trump's pardon promises in court since his election on November 5.</p>

<h3><strong>Hunter Biden</strong></h3>

<p>Trump hinted at the possibility of pardoning Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son, who faces sentencing for federal tax and gun charges. Trump told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt in October, “I wouldn't take it off the books… despite what they've done to me.”</p>

<h3><strong>Ross Ulbricht</strong></h3>

<p>Another person who may benefit from a potential pardon is Ross Ulbricht, founder of the Silk Road dark web marketplace, who has received vocal support from libertarians. Supporters of Ulbricht, who was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2015 for running the Silk Road marketplace on the dark web, expressed their hope on social media, with one tweet stating, "ROSS IS COMING HOME IN JANUARY. We are so grateful to @realDonaldTrump for his pledge to #FreeRoss and to all those who have supported us.”</p>

<h3><strong>Julian Assange</strong></h3>

<p>Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, may also receive a pardon. Trump expressed in May 2024 that he would “give very serious consideration” to granting clemency to Assange.</p>

<h3><strong>Peter Navarro</strong></h3>

<p>Trump has left the door open for a potential pardon of his former trade adviser, Peter Navarro, who was sentenced to four months in prison for contempt of Congress. Trump praised Navarro as a “great patriot,” claiming he was “treated very unfairly.”</p>

<h3><strong>Trump's self-pardon and legal boundaries</strong></h3>

<p>As for the possibility of Trump pardoning himself, the issue remains murky. While Trump previously dismissed the idea, telling <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-unlikely-pardon-convicted-presidency-meet-the-press-rcna104779">NBC News </a>last year it was “very unlikely” he'd pardon himself, because he “didn't do anything wrong,” legal experts remain divided on whether the Constitution permitted such an action. While Trump may avoid needing a self-pardon for federal charges, state-level prosecutions, including those in New York and Georgia, remain outside his jurisdiction.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A team of astronomers has uncovered an Earth-like planet orbiting a star located 4,000 light years away from the solar system, potentially offering insights into Earth's distant future. The rocky planet, about the same mass as Earth, revolves around a white dwarf in the constellation Sagittarius.</p>

<p>The discovery brings a glimmer of hope for Earth's survival when our sun enters its final stages. It suggests that Earth could potentially avoid being consumed by the expanding sun, opening up possibilities for human migration to the outer solar system, with moons such as Europa, Callisto, and Ganymede around Jupiter, or Enceladus near Saturn, becoming possible havens for future generations.</p>

<h2><strong>What is a white dwarf?</strong></h2>

<p>A white dwarf is a star's remnant after it has run out of nuclear fuel and shed its outer layers. It symbolises the sun's eventual fate. The sun will grow into a red giant as its nuclear fuel runs out, then shrink to become a white dwarf. The extent of its expansion will determine which planets in the solar system will be engulfed - Mercury and Venus are likely to be consumed. But what about Earth?</p>

<p>In a study published in Nature Astronomy, researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, used the Keck Telescope in Hawaii to observe a system designated KMT-2020-BLG-0414. The system contains a white dwarf star with an Earth-sized planet in an orbit twice as far from the star as Earth is from the sun. Alongside the planet is a brown dwarf - a planet roughly 17 times the mass of Jupiter.</p>

<p>This finding supports the theory that as the sun expands into a red giant, its loss of mass will push the planets into more distant orbits. This phenomenon could allow Earth to escape destruction. Jessica Lu, an associate professor of astronomy at UC Berkeley, noted, "Whether life can survive on Earth through that (red giant) period is unknown. But certainly, the most important thing is that Earth isn't swallowed by the Sun when it becomes a red giant."</p>

<h2><strong>Future of Earth</strong></h2>

<p>"We do not currently have a consensus whether Earth could avoid being engulfed by the red giant sun in six billion years," said Keming Zhang, the lead author and a former doctoral student at the UC Berkeley, who is now an Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral fellow at UC San Diego.</p>

<p>"In any case, planet Earth will only be habitable for another billion years, at which point Earth's oceans would be vaporized by the runaway greenhouse effect-long before the risk of getting swallowed by the red giant." &nbsp;</p>

<p>Could humanity find refuge beyond Earth? As the sun swells into a red giant, the habitable zone in the solar system will shift outward to the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn. Many of their moons, such as Europa and Callisto, could become ocean worlds capable of supporting life. Zhang suggested, "Humanity could migrate out there."</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As I walked out of my Upper West Side polling station in New York City after casting my vote, the lack of energy in America's most liberal city was palpable. The pins being sold just outside said “Keep Kamala and Carry On-a-la”, but the calmness was about to explode.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Donald Trump's stunning comeback forces an acknowledgement that Americans do not want to simply carry on. Much like India earlier this year. They are increasingly tired of the financial pain that started after the 2008 financial crisis, rendering many of them under-employed. The most powerful ingredients of rapid global economic growth in our lifetimes—globalisation and technological replacement—have ricocheted back to cause acute pain at the working-class Americans' dining tables. And they are hoping, against the odds, that their ballot can overpower that bullet.</p>

<p>This is precisely the reason why, much like the re-emergence of the former President, a defining trend is now categorising the American election cycle. And, I would argue, the Indian election cycle too.</p>

<h2><strong>Incumbents Beware</strong></h2>

<p>This is now the third presidential election since 2016 when the incumbent party has been voted out, a trend not seen since the 1970s when Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan were voted in quick succession as inflation eclipsed all else. Once is an accident. Twice, a coincidence. Three times, a pattern.</p>

<p>In India, the lack of a majority for the incumbent party this year was an indication of that very problem that is proving difficult for any global leader to resolve. In fact, there has been a dissipation of existing power if not an outright change in every major government across the world this year—from the UK and Italy to Germany and Japan, and others.</p>

<p>As Bill Clinton's political strategist Jim Carville stated prophetically thirty years ago, “It's the economy, stupid.” But some would point out that the stock markets are at an all-time high and economic growth was at par in both Trump and Biden years. So, why the discontent? Didn't life seem good enough?</p>

<p>Yes, but only for the elite, whether in the US or India. The elite are the real beneficiaries of the riches-to-riches story. How long can you ignore the larger population that now has to work an average of 2.5 jobs to keep the same lifestyle as a decade ago? In the case of India, too, yes there are cheap mobile phones and food handouts, but job prospects cannot keep up with young aspirations.</p>

<p>In this discontented mix, a message like Trump's, which primarily centres around inflation and its many symptoms—immigration being an obvious one—will obviously be attractive. But so is that of any politician who offers a change in the existing status quo. It is akin to a company changing multiple CEOs in the hope its fortunes will change, not realising that the problem lies in the product itself.</p>

<h2><strong>The Polarisation Card Is Losing Its Edge&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>This election has broken several myths—the overriding one being polarisation—including that echo chambers are permanent and defined and will not sway voters from their trenches. That certainly was the case in 2016, when Trump's winnability was attributed to a fringe base of non-college-educated men. But in 2024, Trump's winnability is attributed to virtually all subsets.</p>

<p>A case in point is young men, and shockingly for the democrats, young men of colour—whether Latino or Indian-American—swinging in Trump's favour. The Left is finally realizing that they cannot club all minorities together, much like the Right in India is realizing the majority cannot always be a single voting bloc. Their loyalty, and more importantly, their ethics, are being questioned. I disagree. This was not a vote for the messenger, it was a vote for the message.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This election has stuck a needle into the bubble of polarisation that the world has sworn by throughout the last decade. Both sides tried to polarise voters, whether it was Trump with immigration or Harris with abortion. But it did not work. There are voters who have chosen Trump and abortion rights. The choice is no longer binary. Above all else, the voters in America are pragmatic.</p>

<p>The same is true for India. The 2024 India voting reflected the discontent among ordinary voters, where the economy superseded everything else. The conservative argument of caste or religious lines shaping voting patterns is increasingly becoming redundant.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As it has long been said, democracy is a luxury when there is not enough food on the table. But there are also similarities between the out-of-touch ‘Khan market gang' in India and America's coastal elite. Instead of focusing on the real issue of voter pain, the Democrats' and the Indian Opposition's patronising tone of ‘How could you vote for him?' reeked of moral superiority borne out of privilege, not realism.</p>

<h2><strong>Only Betting Markets Got It Right &nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>The media and the pollsters have got it so far wrong that they are in danger of losing their voice. These echo chambers are now functioning as cheerleaders of political thought. They dole out a narrative rather than acting as arbiters of reason. It is ironic that the most truthful picture came from sources that are often the most tainted in history—the betting markets in the US and the satta bazaar in India. Whether Trump's sweep or the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) underperformance, they were the only ones who got it right.</p>

<h2><strong>Kamala Played Well</strong></h2>

<p>Kamala Harris also emerged as a hero to many. Clearly, many things that were out of her control went wrong for her: Biden's selfishness in holding on to power, the war fatigue, and the all-important anti-incumbency.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When my 10-year-old daughter accompanying me to the voting booth asked me why a woman gets passed yet again for the most powerful job in the world, I told her to walk tall the next day. Because in the shortest presidential campaign in American history, of only 107 days, Kamala managed to achieve the impossible and did better than any reasonable hope. LOTUS for POTUS simply did not have enough time to bloom.</p>

<p>I do not think America acted like it did in 2016 and chose to vote against a female President. The pain threshold that Trump pressed on was much lower on Maslow's needs chart for the gender ceiling in American politics to even be a conversation. A famous meme from the Kamala campaign was a father going with his daughter to the polling booth and saying he was voting for her. I believe the father did still vote for his daughter, not necessarily as a mark of support for the candidate but as an act of hope of providing his family with a better life.</p>

<h2><strong>Trump Needs A Hail Mary&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>But will Trump be able to deliver on that hope? In the America of the 1980s, the Republican party's modern hero, Ronald Reagan, achieved the impossible as he took on the structural inflation problem, giving birth to decades of prosperity.</p>

<p>For Trump to leave the legacy he wants, he will have to be in offensive tackle mode for the next four years and deliver a magical Reaganesque solution to the working class pain. Or else, given the musical chairs game global politics has become, the Dems will be back in the White House in 2028.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three NASA astronauts, who recently returned to Earth after a 235-day stay in space, have shed light on the challenges of readjusting to gravity and life on the planet. Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt and Jeanette Epps returned to Earth on October 25 aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule. During a NASA conference, they discussed the physical toll the mission had on their bodies.<br />
<br />
Dominick, a first-time space traveller and mission commander, revealed that while he expected dizziness and disorientation upon returning to Earth's gravity, some of the smaller struggles took him by surprise. “The big things you expect — being disoriented, being dizzy. But the little things like just sitting in a hard chair … My backside has not really sat on a hard thing for (235) days.” He also shared an amusing anecdote from a recent dinner with his family, where he found himself lying on a towel in the yard due to the discomfort of sitting.<br />
<br />
Epps, reflecting on the physical changes she faced, noted the unexpected weight and heaviness of objects once she returned to Earth. “The weight and the heaviness of things just is surprising, (I've been) laying any chance I got. But you have to move, and you have to exercise every day, otherwise you won't get those gains. You have to move regardless of how exhausted you feel,” she said.<br />
<br />
The astronauts, who spent months aboard the ISS, faced a brief and unexpected hospitalisation after their return. While NASA confirmed that all crew members were taken to Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola “out of an abundance of caution,” details surrounding the medical issue, which led to one astronaut staying overnight at the hospital, have not been made public.<br />
<br />
Dominick, Barratt, Epps, and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Grebenkin, who also participated in the mission, were originally scheduled to return home earlier, but their return was delayed by scheduling conflicts with other spacecraft and weather conditions. The Crew-8 astronauts' mission duration was extended by a few weeks due to these unforeseen delays.<br />
<br />
Barratt, a medical doctor and veteran astronaut, stressed the importance of medical privacy concerning the situation. "Medical privacy and the processes we have going on right now negate our ability to (discuss the issue),” he said during the press conference.<br />
<br />
According to <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/08/science/spacex-nasa-crew-8-astronauts-update/index.html">CNN</a>, medical checkups are routine after extended space missions. But astronauts are usually transported back to their base in Houston for reconditioning following splashdown, allowing them to transition back to Earth's gravity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

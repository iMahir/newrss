<p class="has-text-align-none">If you listen to venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz explain why they’re <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361087/trump-silicon-valley-fundraising-musk-andreessen-horowitz">supporting Donald Trump</a>, between the discussions of crypto and China and AI, you’ll detect a much more conventional reason for rich people to vote Republican: They’re <a href="https://youtu.be/n_sNclEgQZQ?si=77NENqin8HawDMEX&amp;t=3832">worried about Democrats raising their taxes</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Specifically, Andreessen and Horowitz railed against Joe Biden’s proposed Billionaires Minimum Income Tax, which they claimed would destroy the startup ecosystem in Silicon Valley. They aren’t alone: <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/taxing-unrealized-gains-would-obliterate-us-economy">Finance</a> and <a href="https://x.com/mansourtarek_/status/1783936485936316778">tech</a> <a href="https://x.com/Austen/status/1783254353274638346">commentators</a> have been furious since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/28/biden-announces-billionaire-minimum-income-tax">Biden first unveiled the plan in 2022</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Billionaires oppose tax increase” has a certain “dog bites man” quality to it as a story. But this particular iteration viscerally annoys me. For one thing, Andreessen and Horowitz are complaining about a tax that not only is dead on arrival in Congress but one that the Supreme Court, just a couple weeks ago, <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/355969/supreme-court-moore-us-wealth-tax-billionaires">implied would be unconstitutional</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The plan is going nowhere. They’ve won. Stop gloating!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">My other beef is that I think the minimum tax was mostly a good idea. It represented the <a href="https://equitablegrowth.org/taxing-wealth-by-taxing-investment-income-an-introduction-to-mark-to-market-taxation/">culmination of decades of scholarship</a> from economists and tax law experts attempting to address a serious problem with the way the US currently taxes income from selling stocks, real estate, and other assets.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Luckily, I think there are other options to solve the problems that the proposal was meant to solve, options that might not face quite the same resistance and would pass constitutional muster.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The problem with normal capital gains taxes</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When you buy something for one price, and later sell it for a higher price, that’s called a “capital gain.” In tax lingo, you “realize” a capital gain when you ultimately sell the asset. If the asset gains in value without you selling it (e.g., a stock you own rises in price), those gains are “unrealized.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The capital gains tax in the US has a “realization requirement”: You have to actually sell the asset to be taxed. This creates an easy way for rich people to avoid taxes, by simply waiting to sell.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Imagine a 20-something who starts an internet company called FriendCo with his college roommates. Let’s call him Mark. (While I’m obviously basing Mark on somebody real, I’m going to simplify the real numbers a lot to make it easier to follow.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At FriendCo’s founding in 2004, Mark and his four roommates each took 10 percent of the company, with the other half to be sold to investors. At the start, their shares were worth $0. But their website took off fast and soon had 1 billion users. The company went public in 2012, at a market value of $100 billion. Mark and his roommates’ shares were worth $10 billion each.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At this point, the company stands still and remains worth $100 billion forevermore (I told you I was going to simplify).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Mark sells all his shares in 2012 after the company goes public, he’d pay taxes on the amount that the shares increased. They were worth $0 at first, and are now worth $10 billion. The top rate on capital gains in the US is 23.8 percent, so he’d pay $2.38 billion in taxes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Suppose, instead, Mark decides to keep all his shares until he retires 40 years later, in 2052. Assuming the tax code doesn’t change, he’d still pay $2.38 billion. That, right there, is the problem.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Being able to pay a tax bill decades in the future, instead of right now, is a <em>huge</em> benefit. If I told my landlord that I would prefer to pay my rent 40 years from now, she would not find that very amusing. At the very least she would demand that I pay a <em>lot</em> of interest for paying so late. Other big purchases, like houses and cars, usually <em>do</em> involve paying a ton of interest in exchange for later payments. Capital gains taxes don’t.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The “realization requirement” of the capital gains tax thus functions like a massive, zero-interest government loan to people who’ve gained money on their investments. They’re able to save huge sums in taxes merely by waiting to sell their assets, and not paying any interest while they wait.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is unfair; if you can afford to wait and not sell, you get a big tax break, but if you can’t afford that, you don’t. But the rule can also cause serious economic harm. By pushing people to hold onto investments longer than they normally would, it keeps them from moving their money to newer investments. That makes it harder for startups and other innovative firms to get the money they need to grow, leading to less innovation and slower economic growth.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The problem is compounded by other aspects of the US tax code. If Mark were to never sell his shares and instead pass them along to his children, they would not have to pay capital gains tax on the gain. In fact, if they were to later sell the shares, they would only pay tax on the difference between the value of the shares when they sell, and the value <em>when they inherited them</em>. (This is called “step-up in basis” or more evocatively as the “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1987/06/25/the-angel-of-death-loophole/5a42296d-982b-4517-a13a-c89ba270f52d/">angel of death loophole</a>.”) So if the shares remain at $10 billion, the children can sell them and not pay a dime in capital gains tax. The rich are <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/more-than-half-of-americas-100-richest-people-exploit-special-trusts-to-avoid-estate-taxes">talented at evading the estate tax</a>, too, so it’s very possible that Mark’s fortune will be completely untaxed.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How the Biden minimum tax tries to fix the problem</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/131/General-Explanations-FY2023.pdf#page=40">Biden proposal</a> is meant to make the ultra-rich pay more. The strategy is simple: get rid of the realization rule.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For people with over $100 million in assets, the proposal would put in place a new tax regime. For easily sold assets with clear prices, like stocks and bonds and crypto, gains in value would be taxed during the year they happen, whether or not the assets are actually sold. Taxpayers would be able to get refunds if the assets later fell in value.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Andreessen, Horowitz, and other Silicon Valley types fret about what this would mean for startup founders whose companies haven’t gone public yet. These founders may be billionaires on paper but do not have any actual cash with which to pay taxes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If these VCs had read <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/131/General-Explanations-FY2023.pdf#page=40">the fine print of the plan</a>, they’d see that someone in this situation <em>would not have to pay taxes yet</em>. If more than 80 percent of a person’s net worth is in “illiquid assets” like private company shares, they would not have to pay annual tax on those assets. If they sold the assets, they’d pay the tax plus a “deferral charge,” a kind of interest for paying the tax years after they gained the money. Should the company go public or be acquired, the situation would change — but also the newly minted billionaire would suddenly have liquid assets with which to pay their tax bill.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is all somewhat academic, though, after the Supreme Court’s June 20th ruling in<em> </em><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-800_jg6o.pdf"><em>Moore v. United States</em></a>. While the decision itself concerned a minor provision in the Trump tax cuts, one justice, Amy Coney Barrett, wrote a concurring opinion arguing that realization is required for a capital gains tax to be constitutional. As my colleague <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/355969/supreme-court-moore-us-wealth-tax-billionaires">Ian Milhiser notes</a>, Brett Kavanaugh’s majority opinion hinted pretty strongly that he’d side with Barrett on the matter, while deferring on a ruling for now.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the Barrett view has at least five supporters on the Supreme Court, then the Billionaire Minimum Income Tax is dead in the water.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A more modest approach</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, the minimum tax will likely never make it to the Supreme Court. Republicans control the House and aren’t voting to raise taxes on billionaires. The Biden administration failed to even get a much more modest capital tax hike passed in 2021–22, when they had a narrow Congressional majority. That plan would’ve <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-04/biden-tax-rule-would-rip-billions-from-biggest-fortunes-at-death?embedded-checkout=true">gotten rid of the angel of death loophole</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-seek-backup-plan-on-taxing-capital-gains-11631893650">internal Democratic opposition</a> in Congress killed the idea. I do not know of a single honest defense of the angel of death loophole, but unfortunately there are many deeply dishonest defenses. Former Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) spent much of 2021 claiming that <a href="https://doubledeathtax.org/heidi-heitkamp-launches-saving-americas-family-enterprises-safe/">realization at death would obliterate family farms in the Plains</a>, for which she offered literally zero evidence. Alas, the gambit worked.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In theory, though, a future Congress could still close the loophole. They could go further still and pass law professors Edward Fox and Zachary Liscow’s plan to <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4716197">tax the loans billionaires currently use</a> to generate tax-free cash. The most ambitious option would be to <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2979583">add deferral charges to the capital gains tax</a>, so the rich have to pay the government interest when they defer taxes by not selling their assets.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of which is to say: There are a lot of ways to raise revenue from America’s billionaire class. And none of them pose any of the risks to innovation or startups, whatever you hear about from the likes of Andreessen.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For more than two years, the US poultry industry has been battling a highly virulent strain of avian influenza, or bird flu. The virus has driven up egg and turkey prices and crossed over from infecting just birds to numerous mammalian species, including sea lions, mice, cats, dairy cows, and, increasingly, humans. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And it shows no signs of stopping — only reaching new milestones. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first milestone reached this month concerns the birds themselves. Last week, a Weld County, Colorado, farm that housed 1.3 million egg-laying hens detected bird flu and, per <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/depopulationpolicy.pdf">federal policy</a>, was forced to kill the whole flock in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. Those 1.3 million dead birds tipped the total number of chickens and turkeys killed during this outbreak to over 100 million — double the total from the <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/media/document/2086/file#:~:text=Approximately%207.4%20million%20turkeys%20and,as%20part%20of%20the%20response.">previous outbreak</a> in 2014 and 2015.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The second milestone concerns us humans. Earlier in July, bird flu was detected on an even bigger farm — housing 1.78 million hens — in the same Colorado county as the first farm. A crew of some <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/chicken-culling-disposal-raise-concern-bird-flu-spreads-2024-07-18/">150 workers</a> were deployed to kill the hens. They were given goggles and masks for protection, but the 104-degree heat combined with strong industrial fans in the barns made it <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/colorado-workers-with-bird-flu-toiled-high-heat-without-sufficient-protective-2024-07-16/">difficult</a> for the gear to work effectively.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2024/07/20/colorado-bird-flu-sixth-case/7391721505676/">Six</a> workers contracted the virus, which made it the single most infectious bird flu event for humans in US history, more than doubling the number of Americans who had contracted the virus since April 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/WAM22828.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.70228295175,100,78.5954340965" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Workers remove their biohazard suits after culling ducks at a farm in Ontario, Canada, in 2022. | Jo-Anne McArthur/We Animals Media" data-portal-copyright="Jo-Anne McArthur/We Animals Media" />
<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON512">Around half</a> of the nearly 900 people who’ve fallen ill to H5N1 globally since the early 2000s have died, though the variant circulating during this outbreak has proven quite mild in humans. Patients in Colorado and elsewhere have reported pink eye, fever, and coughing, and the Centers for Disease Control maintains that the risk to the American public <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/p-0715-confirm-h5.html">remains low</a>. I spoke with four bird flu experts who generally agree with that risk assessment, but with some important caveats, which brings us to the third milestone.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of those experts said that, based on <a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/avian-flu-infects-two-more-colorado-poultry-cullers-one-second-farm">genetic sequencing</a> from one of the sickened farmworkers, the strain of the virus that infected all those hens and workers is <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/07/22/bird-flu-infects-colorado-poultry-workers-related-to-h5n1-in-cows/">related</a> to a strain that’s been circulating in cows. That means the strain is more infectious for other mammals — like humans — than a normal poultry H5N1 virus.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I don&#8217;t think it is a coincidence that several people were infected with this version of the virus, which has adapted to cows,” said <a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/philip-s-meade">Philip Meade</a>, a microbiologist at Mount Sinai Health System.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This doesn’t mean a bird flu pandemic is on the horizon. For that to happen, the virus would have to evolve in such a way that it effectively transmits from human to human and causes more severe symptoms, which may never happen. But that’s the bedeviling nature of bird flu — it’s <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/09/bird-flu-upends-avian-influenza-dogma/">highly unpredictable</a>. Tom Peacock, a virologist fellow at the Pirbright Institute, which researches livestock diseases, said the risk level remains low “until it suddenly isn’t,” in the event that the virus adapts to transmit between people. That it’s circulating among cows increases the possibility that it could occur.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Is bird flu here to stay?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That the virus has been spreading in the US for over two years also raises the question as to whether it’s endemic, meaning it circulates year-round.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Experts told me it’s highly likely that it’s already endemic in wild birds, the original reservoir for the virus, who spread it to poultry farms in the spring and fall during migration. In <a href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/news/avian-flu-cases-decline-europe-surveillance-recommended-view-upcoming-season">Europe</a>, which has experienced a steep decline in bird flu outbreaks on poultry farms this year, wild birds seem to have gained some immunity from the virus, which could happen here too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the persistence of H5N1 in the US during the summer months suggests that a “decent proportion” of recent poultry outbreaks, according to Peacock, seem to be caused by the cattle strain, which he described as a major change.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The concern here is that the virus can maintain a transmission cycle involving cattle — which don&#8217;t usually die or sometimes even develop noticeable symptoms from bird flu — creating a reservoir from which the virus could mutate unfavorably or cause human outbreaks,” said <a href="https://andersen-lab.com/people/">Brady Page</a>, an infectious disease research fellow at the Scripps Research Institute.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In short, we could be entering some kind of bird flu doom loop, in which it has multiple reservoirs to infect farmed birds, and can more readily adapt to infect mammals.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That the threat level is on the rise is also a damning indictment of the US Department of Agriculture’s <a href="https://www.agriculture.com/usda-aims-to-isolate-exhaust-h5n1-virus-in-dairy-herds-8657880">sclerotic response</a> to the virus, which has drawn <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24140017/milk-bird-flu-safe-dairy-usda-fda">sharp criticism</a> from the infectious disease research community.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bird flu first began to infect dairy cows late last year, but it wasn’t detected until late March. The USDA then took several weeks to upload critical data about the virus. It also didn’t mandate routine testing of dairy cows, and farms with positive H5N1 tests weren’t required to report them — a move that hamstrung <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24140017/milk-bird-flu-safe-dairy-usda-fda">scientists’ efforts to track and prevent the spread</a>. It took a month for the agency to at least require testing before cows crossed state lines, and there’s no proactive effort to test large numbers of farm workers. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The response is in line with the USDA’s deferential relationship to industry and explains in part how we got here. The USDA has resisted calls to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24155545/bird-flu-vaccines-h5n1-avian-flu-cows">vaccinate poultry birds</a> because it would disrupt trade agreements, and thus the industry’s bottom line. The USDA also helped build the modern factory farming system, which provides the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/4/22/21228158/coronavirus-pandemic-risk-factory-farming-meat">perfect conditions</a> for viruses to spread: hundreds to thousands of weak, genetically identical animals packed together in unsanitary barns.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/WAM30758.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A young turkey on a farm in Israel is sprayed with firefighting foam to kill the flock during a 2016 bird flu outbreak in the country. | Roee Shpernik/Glass Walls/We Animals Media" data-portal-copyright="Roee Shpernik/Glass Walls/We Animals Media" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">“We should treat potential pandemic threats like this virus with the same seriousness that we apply to our national defense,” said Meade, the Mount Sinai researcher. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If we don’t, we’ll have a harder time breaking out of the bird flu doom loop. Without a vigorous response to contain the virus — and sober reflections on the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24128700/bird-fludairy-meat-industry-h5n1-cows-milk-eggs-safety">pandemic risk</a> posed by America’s meat industry — we’re likely to see more and more farmed birds <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23963820/bird-flu-surge-us-ventilation-shutdown-veterinarians">dying horrible deaths</a>, more sickened cows, higher food prices, and an increased threat that we spark the next pandemic.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Five years ago, standing in front of a crowd of some 20,000 people in Oakland, California, Kamala Harris announced that she was running for president. “My whole life, I’ve only had one client: the people,” she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now that President Biden has dropped out of the race and Harris has become the presumptive Democratic nominee, it’s fair to start asking what, exactly, she plans to do for her client if she wins in November. Despite Harris’s long career and remarkable rise in politics — she has served as the San Francisco district attorney, California’s attorney general, US senator, and, most recently, vice president — it’s still difficult to predict what her campaign, let alone presidency, will look like.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although Harris has been vice president for three years and ran a presidential campaign in the 2020 cycle, she’s managed to avoid being neatly pigeonholed into any ideological box. Unlike candidates Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, who are easily remembered for their Medicare-for-all or wealth-tax proposals, Harris’s 2020 campaign fizzled out with few, if any, policy ideas or slogans being closely associated with it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At any point in her two-decade political career, she could fit the description of a number of “types” of Democrat: centrist, moderate, progressive, liberal, establishment, or outsider. But besides her “<a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/kamala-harris-wrote-a-good-book-about">smart-on-crime</a>” identity, none of those labels has ever effectively captured her way of thinking or how she would govern as president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That might have been by design. “Policy has to be relevant,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/27/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020-election.html">Harris told the New York Times in 2019</a>. “That’s my guiding principle: Is it relevant? Not, ‘Is it a beautiful sonnet?’”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her allies and those who have worked with her in the past describe her as a pragmatist — a fact that makes it hard for the public and press to decipher her vision for the nation. </p>

</ul>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This may be the best way to understand Harris: She doesn’t necessarily <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151127005330/https://modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/the-unstoppable-rise-of-kamala-harris">believe in a big ideological mission</a> to remake government or society, but instead considers government as a tool to concretely help improve the lives of as many people as possible, as quickly as possible, through practical means, like lowering the cost of medication, expanding access to broadband internet, and fixing roads and bridges. Aiming at smaller targets can effect change to bigger&nbsp;interconnected problems, like lowering inflation, expanding access to health care, and protecting reproductive rights.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“She thinks about policy and law not from a place of the words on a page, but the ways in which those words impact the lives of everyday people,” said Democratic California Sen. Laphonza Butler, a longtime adviser and friend to Harris. “She tends to see gaps and see around corners and make sure that the policy can work for everyone.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A 2015 profile of her in San Francisco Magazine underscored that incrementalist approach. “I don’t admire grand gestures,” Harris <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151127005330/https://modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/the-unstoppable-rise-of-kamala-harris">was quoted as saying</a>. “I admire goal achievement.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What those goals are, exactly, has remained unclear throughout her career. Even as recently as her last run for president, they weren’t entirely defined: As one person who sat in on a meeting with Harris about whether she should run later <a href="https://x.com/IsaacDovere/status/1815412205522719095/photo/1">put it</a>, “We launched into a void, without a worldview,” the journalist Edward-Isaac Dovere has reported.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Harris hits the campaign trail anew, many more voters will want to hear what her vision for the country is beyond defeating Donald Trump.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, what does Harris actually want to achieve if she makes it to the Oval Office?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Harris’s 2020 campaign gave voters an incomplete picture</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the last election cycle, Harris’s career as a prosecutor seemed to guide much of her campaign: Her <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/kamala-harris-prosecutor-for-the-people/">slogan</a> — “Kamala Harris, for the people”<em> </em>— was how <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/26/kamala-harris-2020-oakland-1128563">she introduced herself in court</a>; her ads focused on her <a href="https://x.com/KamalaHarris/status/1197243216132804608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1197243216132804608%7Ctwgr%5E341a78b4244eb8e416847db91740560bc1295366%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rollingstone.com%2Fpolitics%2Fpolitics-news%2Fkamala-harris-trump-attack-ad-viral-1235064809%2F">record prosecuting sexual predators</a>, banks, and big corporations; and her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/kamala-harris-prosecute-trump.html">promise to Democratic voters</a> was that she’d be the best candidate to “prosecute the case” against Donald Trump in 2020.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But as she campaigned, Harris’s messaging on policy was often muddied. She supported big ideas like Medicare-for-all, on the one hand, but emphasized that she’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/27/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020-election.html">“not trying to restructure society”</a> on the other.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of her policy positions were also never clear, in part because she flip-flopped on several occasions. There were multiple times, for example, when she seemed to support abolishing private health insurance while campaigning on Medicare-for-all, but she <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/kamala-harris-walks-back-her-hand-moment-health-insurance-democratic-n1024756">walked back on that position when pressed</a> on whether her plan would leave room for private insurers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In one high-profile moment during the campaign, she went after Biden’s record on desegregation during a debate, skewering him for opposing court-ordered school busing programs in the 1970s. But in the days after her attack on Biden, Harris gave <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/harriss-views-on-busing-come-under-question-after-her-debate-criticism-of-bidens-past-position/2019/07/04/b197c6cc-9e71-11e9-b27f-ed2942f73d70_story.html#">only vague answers</a> about whether she supported federally mandated busing, leaving many to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/us/politics/kamala-harris-biden-busing.html">wonder whether there was actually any daylight</a> between her position and Biden’s.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Aides who have worked with her in the past chalk some of this up to Harris’s “literalism” — what they say is a focus on the lived experience of the people who elected her and how policies and stances may need to change with the times or as reality sets in.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“She’s someone who thinks about the user experience of government, how it works, how it operates, how people are experiencing it, and she wants to make it better in literal ways, as opposed to theory,” said Daniel Suvor, who served as Harris’s chief of policy when she was California attorney general.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There was, however, at least one clear and consistent message throughout her 2020 campaign: that she was the best candidate to defeat Trump in that cycle. And while defeating Trump might not be a long-term agenda, it’s also not necessarily an insufficient reason to run for the presidency. After all, that’s what Biden repeatedly said <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-motivated-joe-biden-to-run-for-president">inspired him to run</a> in 2020 and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/biden-says-he-has-to-run-for-president-because-trump-is-running/">again in 2024</a>. And if Trump does indeed pose a long-term threat to democracy, then beating him at the ballot box can be a legacy-defining achievement in and of itself.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What does Harris’s vice presidency tell us about her priorities?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Harris struggled to define herself during the 2020 primaries, accepting the offer to serve as vice president only made that struggle <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/517325-kamala-harris-from-historic-to-invisible/">harder</a>. Early on, there were signs that Biden might want to empower his number two and make her a governing partner, as he said he would&nbsp;during the campaign. His pre-election talk about being a “bridge” to a new generation of leaders also cemented the idea that his vice president might be primed to be his successor.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it quickly looked like Harris would be sidelined — and that’s what the public and press eventually assumed occurred. Questions swirled around what her portfolio would include. Harris ended up doing a little bit of everything, contributing to the sense of ambiguity and that her <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/14/politics/kamala-harris-frustrating-start-vice-president/index.html">tenure suffered from a lack of focus</a>. She asked for one specific priority (voting rights) and received another more nebulous task (addressing <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361635/kamala-harris-border-czar-immigration-mexico-guatemala-rnc">root causes</a> of migration).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first priority was easy to define: securing the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/president-biden-taps-vice-president-harris-lead-efforts-pass-voting">passage</a> of the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. She <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/magazine/kamala-harris.html">reportedly</a> made the decision to focus on this task after spending time talking to other Black leaders in the Democratic Party, including those focused on ballot access and voting rights, such as Stacey Abrams.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s when she made a departure from the pragmatism that had previously defined her, despite the grim odds of the legislation passing in a tied Senate, let alone breaking a filibuster with 60 votes. She saw voter access as an issue that could unite various factions of the Democratic Party, and on which she could carry on the party’s legacy of fighting for civil rights — meaningful given her own historic place as the first Black woman vice president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She was warned about the low chances of this kind of legislation passing, but still, she <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/15/harris-voting-rights-push-527186">tried</a>, meeting with various activist groups and advocates to build popular support. Her work on Capitol Hill&nbsp;was more limited as the president himself tried to lobby senators. Despite an emotional <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/11/us/biden-harris-voting-rights">last-minute push</a>, the chance of abolishing the filibuster was essentially zero, killing the effort.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her second priority, pegged to immigration, came as an assignment she did not ask for: leading diplomatic efforts and engagement with the countries of Mexico and the Northern Triangle to address the root causes of migration. It was essentially the same assignment Biden had received from Barack Obama eight years before, but it quickly spun into a greater political mess,&nbsp;one that will continue to be a vulnerability for Harris in the general election.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The task was diplomatic, neither focused on border security nor the immediate response to the influx of migrants and people seeking asylum. But that <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361635/kamala-harris-border-czar-immigration-mexico-guatemala-rnc">distinction</a> was muddled by the press, Republicans and the right, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/4/1/22359917/biden-border-mixed-messaging-crisis">even</a> the White House.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Things changed for Harris when the <em>Dobbs </em>decision overturned <em>Roe v. Wade </em>and eliminated the constitutional right to abortion. The vice president&nbsp;quickly seized on the issue, talking naturally and practically about the decision’s real-world implications —&nbsp;in large part because it dealt with two constituencies she has always prioritized: mothers and children, a former Harris adviser said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She traveled to battleground and Republican-run states, explained the ties between abortion rights and other reproductive and individual rights, and became the administration’s point person on the issue. Harris’s thinking and strategizing on how to talk about reproductive rights in the aftermath of the <em>Dobbs</em> decision also fit the larger theme of how she thinks about policies and initiatives: considering who is affected, and how long it will take to achieve justice. And it will be a centerpiece of the campaign she runs now.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What would a Harris presidency look like?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What Harris’s career has made clear is that she’s more likely to pursue incremental progress than big, ambitious ideas. That’s why if elected, it’s likely that her administration would simply be an extension of the current one rather than a disruption.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the campaign trail this week, several priorities have come into focus, with the economy and affordability still at the top of the list. Harris continues to talk about prioritizing the middle class, just as Biden did: “Building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency,” Harris said at her first major campaign rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on Tuesday. “When our middle class is strong, America is strong.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To support that swath of Americans, improving the care economy — those services that focus on children and the elderly — could be one of the major policy areas she may come to prioritize.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She would zero in on a straightforward policy agenda, said Carmel Martin, who served as the vice president’s domestic policy adviser from 2022 to 2023:&nbsp;a focus on “economic progress while bringing down inflation, expanding access to services that people need — health care being at the front of the line — and protecting reproductive rights.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris has already shown signs of this focus, saying in a campaign address on Monday that she believes “in a future where no child has to grow up in poverty; where every person can buy a home, start a family, and build wealth; and where every person has access to paid family leave and affordable child care.” All of these stances are essentially what Biden has pitched before.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The fact that Harris has shown she’s not a hardened ideologue means that she can be swayed by political headwinds, giving social movements an opportunity to push various agendas.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of the country’s most transformational legislation, for example, didn’t come directly from presidents who were ideological hardliners, but rather from presidents who were willing to listen to social movements and public sentiment — as was the case during the Civil Rights Era.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Will Harris help or hurt the Democrats’ chances in November?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Usually, by the time a presidential candidate makes it to the general election after a grueling primary campaign, their policy priorities and ideology are relatively clear. Barack Obama, for example, offered a vision for a post-George W. Bush America —&nbsp;promising to end the US “forever” wars, address economic inequality, and unite the country around the common desire for hope and change. By contrast, Donald Trump offered a distinctly dark vision for the country, building a backlash coalition by injecting more racism and xenophobia into mainstream American politics.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2020, Biden was largely viewed as a centrist who campaigned on defending democracy and a return to normalcy after the rise of Trumpism and the devastating effects of a pandemic, specifically touting his vested interest in pursuing bipartisanship.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris, however, is starting a campaign essentially from scratch, without having gone through a primary process. As a result, voters haven’t been properly introduced to her as a candidate for the presidency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her lack of a clearly defined ideological position up to this point in her career might now prove an asset: She has a unique opportunity to reintroduce herself to the country and offer a new vision for the future.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What Harris does over the next few weeks will help to shape voters’ opinions of her. That doesn’t mean she can entirely evade her past — her <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/1/23/18184192/kamala-harris-president-campaign-criminal-justice-record">record as a prosecutor</a> will likely keep coming up — or that she won’t be haunted by past policy positions. For now, though, she’s likely to focus on Trump’s baggage and the danger he poses to democracy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The script writes itself: the prosecutor against the convicted felon,” California Sen. Alex Padilla said. “That&#8217;s what this race has become.”</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not as if no one was thinking about security issues when Paris was awarded this summer’s Olympics back in 2017. Just two years earlier, the French capital had been the scene of one of the worst terrorist attacks in European history, when Islamic State gunmen killed <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Paris-attacks-of-2015">more than 130 people</a>. That attack came only a few months after a massacre at the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo<em>. </em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then-French <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/17/world/europe/olympics-2024-paris.html">President François Hollande said</a> that when he was lobbying for the Olympics in 2016, he was asked by International Olympic Committee officials “whether Paris would be able to organize safe Games.” He made the case that not only would Paris be ready, but an Olympics in the City of Light would be the “most beautiful answer we could give to fundamentalism.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Seven years later, the Olympics are finally coming to Paris in a very different era with a very different landscape of security threats. While the attention of governments and the media has largely <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/352855/war-on-terror-biden-isis-al-qaeda">shifted away from terrorist groups like ISIS</a>, the group and its affiliates have demonstrated they can continue to carry out major attacks, including a <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2024/3/23/24109865/moscow-crocus-city-hall-theater-terrorist-attack-russia-isis-vladimir-putin-ukraine-war">horrific recent one in Moscow</a> with a death toll similar to what Paris suffered in 2015. The Olympics also take place against the backdrop of the October 7 attacks, Israel’s brutal war in Gaza, and a global surge in antisemitism, <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20240125-anti-semitic-acts-nearly-quadrupled-last-year-in-france-says-jewish-organisation">France very much included</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Olympics, which were originally <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22918000/beijing-olympics-world-peace-russia-ukraine-war">meant to mark a period of truce from war</a>, are also taking place in a Europe embroiled in the biggest armed conflict since WWII. The impact of the war in Ukraine will be visible during the competitions themselves: Russian and Belarusian athletes are barred from competing under their countries’ flags, though some will be present as “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/12/09/1218406353/russian-belarus-athletes-ioc-2024-olympic-games">individual neutral athletes</a>.” A recent string of mysterious events, including arson attacks, has also raised concerns that Russia could attempt to disrupt the games in retaliation for France and other Western countries’ support of Ukraine. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Olympics have been the target of political violence in the past – mostly famously the killing of 11 members of the Israeli team at the 1972 games in Munich by a Palestinian militant group and a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/04/13/eric.rudolph/">bombing by a right-wing anti-abortion extremist</a> at the 1996 games in Atlanta. Al-Qaeda was also known to have <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/al-qaeda-targeted-olympics-jews-court-20040520-gdiymj.html">planned to attack the 2000 Sydney Olympics</a> but ultimately didn’t follow through.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Large sporting events, with their massive crowds and built-in global media attention, will always present a tempting, if presumably well-defended target. Though it’s less remembered today than the slaughter at the Bataclan rock venue during the 2015 ISIS attacks in Paris, one terrorist attempted and failed to enter the Stade de France where 80,000 people including the French president were watching a France-Germany soccer match.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Not surprisingly, security levels at the Games are high with a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/paris-olympics-security-police-military-terrorism-34b168e7a511e22ce7119a91932d2759">heavy police and military presence </a>in Paris, as well as the controversial use of artificial intelligence technology for video surveillance. But notably, the opening ceremonies on Friday evening will be held for the <a href="https://olympics.com/en/news/paris-2024-olympic-games-opening-ceremony-all-you-need-to-know">first time outside a stadium</a>, with athletes parading in boats along the Seine. It promises to be a beautiful sight — but it will also be a security headache, set out across a sprawling metropolis rather than a closed and controlled location.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One US security official who spoke with Vox said that all Olympics pose their particular concerns, from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2012/07/26/sport/olympic-security-overview/index.html">terrorism in London in 2012</a> to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/weeks-from-olympic-games-rio-worries-about-rising-crime-police-cutbacks/2016/06/08/16343886-2c0b-11e6-b9d5-3c3063f8332c_story.html">crime during</a> Rio de Janeiro in 2016 to <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/10/05/national/2020-games-cyberattacks/">cyberattacks at the last summer games in Tokyo</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With Paris in 2024, the official said, “you have everything.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In May, French police <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/french-officials-foil-olympics-terrorism-plot-/7638153.html">arrested an 18-year-old Chechen national</a> who was accused of plotting to attack a soccer game at the Paris Olympics, alleging that he “wanted to attack spectators, but also security forces and die as a martyr.” A month earlier, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sports/soccer/france-spain-tighten-security-champions-league-games-citing-islamic-state-2024-04-09/">security was tightened</a> at Champions League soccer games around the continent after ISIS threatened to launch drone attacks on the elite European club tournament.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s been no known comparable threat to the Olympics, but the attack on the Crocus Concert Hall near Moscow that killed <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2024/3/23/24109865/moscow-crocus-city-hall-theater-terrorist-attack-russia-isis-vladimir-putin-ukraine-war">more than 130 people in March</a> was a wake-up call to many officials: While greatly diminished, the threat from groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS has not disappeared. “If you can do Moscow, you can do Paris,” Gilles Kepel, a French expert on terrorism, <a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2024/04/29/beware-global-jihadists-are-back-on-the-march">told the Economist</a>.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Responsibility for the Moscow attack was claimed by Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K), the group’s Afghan affiliate in Afghanistan and Central Asia. (Khorasan is a historical name for a region that includes Afghanistan and parts of several neighboring countries.) In the years since the dismantling of ISIS’s territorial “caliphate” in parts of Syria and Iraq, ISIS-K has emerged as arguably the most dangerous and high-profile of the group’s global affiliates. It carried out a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-vows-revenge-after-biggest-attack-since-1979-revolution-2024-01-04/">bombing that killed more than 100 people</a> in Iran at the beginning of this year, as well as the attack in Kabul that killed 13 US troops and more than 100 Afghans during the chaotic evacuation of US personnel from Afghanistan. Authorities in Europe have broken up several alleged <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germany-charges-six-suspected-isis-k-members-over-attack-plots-2024-04-24/#:~:text=Germany%20charges%20seven%20suspected%20ISIS%2DK%20members%20over%20attack%20plots,-By%20Reuters&amp;text=BERLIN%2C%20April%2024%20(Reuters),prosecutor's%20office%20said%20on%20Wednesday.">ISIS-K plots</a> in recent months. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Experts say the ISIS of today operates differently than it did in its heyday. Many of the attackers involved in the 2015 massacre had traveled to Syria for on-the-ground training. That’s no longer feasible. “All these things used to be done from ISIS hubs, but ISIS doesn’t have territory anymore. It’s totally dematerialized,” Wassim Nasr, a Paris-based terrorism analyst with the France 24 television network, told Vox. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But ISIS operatives in Europe aren’t quite the proverbial “lone wolves” either. They interact online with what Nasr called “cyber-coaches” abroad who advise them on planning and logistics.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The result, Nasr says, is that ISIS operatives in Europe are likely less trained and less able to carry out attacks than their predecessors. “That’s the difference from 10 years ago,” he says. “The European recruits who could have done this [carried out a successful attack on a high-security event like the Olympics] are now either dead or in jail.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A US security official told Vox that while authorities aren’t taking ISIS’s decline for granted, particularly in light of the Moscow attack, they see no sign of an active threat. “You have a lot of aspirational chatter online,” the official said. “What we’re not seeing is those aspirational views turned into anything concrete.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">October 7 and the war in Gaza have, of course, raised the level of tension as well. Israel’s presence at the games may drive some protests, as it did at the recent <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/sweden-gears-up-eurovision-final-amid-israel-protests-dutch-controversy-2024-05-11/#:~:text=There%20was%20also%20booing%20when,slogan%20%22United%20by%20music%22.">Eurovision Song Contest in Sweden</a>. French authorities <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/france-give-24-hour-protection-israeli-olympics-team-amid-gaza-tensions-2024-07-22/">announced this week</a> that the Israeli Olympic team would be given 24-hour protection after a left-wing lawmaker said the team was not welcome and should be protested.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US official said street protests, whether about Gaza or anything else, were not a major security concern and that French authorities were well-equipped to handle them: “It’s the national pastime here. It’s what the French do.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A greater concern is that the events in the Middle East could inspire violent one-off attacks by individuals. Europol recorded over a <a href="https://www.icct.nl/publication/terrorism-threat-2024-paris-olympics-learning-past-understand-present">dozen jihadist terror plots in Europe</a> in the nine months following October 7 compared to just six in all of 2022. These include the ISIS sympathizer who <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/france/20231017-killer-of-french-school-teacher-claims-attack-for-islamic-state-group">stabbed a schoolteacher to death</a> in Northern France in October, and the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67604591">killing of a German tourist</a> in a hammer and knife attack near the Eiffel Tower in December.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Moscow rules</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the first time in years, European security officials may be worried less about non-state groups like ISIS than about a hostile government. The continent has been on increasingly high alert for acts of sabotage <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/30/europe-on-high-alert-after-suspected-moscow-linked-arson-and-sabotage">orchestrated by the Russian government</a>, linked to the war in Ukraine. Russian agents have been <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68843541">accused of plotting sabotage attacks</a> against military targets in Germany, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f8207823-f5e1-4caf-934d-67c648f807bf">interfering with railways in the Czech Republic</a>, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/suspects-alleged-russia-linked-uk-arson-attack-face-trial-next-year-2024-05-10/#:~:text=United%20Kingdom-,Suspects%20in%20alleged%20Russia%2Dlinked%20UK%20arson,to%20face%20trial%20next%20year&amp;text=LONDON%2C%20May%2010%20(Reuters),British%20court%20heard%20on%20Friday.">arson attacks in the UK</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/30/europe-on-high-alert-after-suspected-moscow-linked-arson-and-sabotage">Lithuania</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Earlier this month, it was reported that US and German authorities had foiled a Russian plot to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/us-germany-foiled-russian-assassination-plot/index.html">assassinate the CEO of Rheinmetall</a>, Germany’s largest defense contractor and a significant contributor of ammunition to the Ukrainian war effort. US military bases across Europe were recently placed on high alert because of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/09/politics/intelligence-russian-sabotage-threat-us-bases-europe/index.html">intelligence about potential Russian sabotage attacks</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last month, a Russian-Ukrainian man <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2024/06/27/man-arrested-with-explosives-near-paris-airport-was-part-of-vast-russian-sabotage-campaign_6675959_7.html#:~:text=The%2026%2Dyear%2Dold%20Russian,sabotage%20campaign%20orchestrated%20by%20Moscow.">was injured while making explosives</a> near Paris’s Charles De Gaulle airport. French authorities say he had been planning to attack a hardware store in Paris as part of a Moscow-orchestrated sabotage campaign. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the recent NATO summit in Washington, Gabrielius Landsbergis, foreign minister of Lithuania, referred to these events saying, “I’m not sure it can be called “hybrid events” or “gray zone events any longer. It’s quite clear that [these are] terrorist attacks by a hostile neighboring country against NATO countries.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Petter Nesser, an expert on terrorism in Europe with the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment, told Vox that while it can be very difficult to attribute some of these events to Russia directly, it is clear that “Russia wants to sow discord and weaken cooperation among European states to help them have their way in Ukraine. They have shown in the past they can use their spy networks and proxies to sow discord.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The exclusion of Russia and Belarus — at least officially — from the Games may make them an even more tempting target for sabotage. This need not take place in physical space. The Olympics are always the target of cyberattacks, and British authorities have alleged that Russia <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/19/russia-planned-cyber-attack-on-tokyo-olympics-says-uk">plotted large-scale cyberattacks</a> against the Tokyo Olympics in 2020 before they were postponed due to the coronavirus. French organizers say these Games are facing an “unprecedented level of threat” online, and not just from the Kremlin. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The AI eye in the sky</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite the numerous threats, Olympic organizers have promised to turn the French capital into the “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/olympics-paris-corruption-terrorism-crime-2c64905237dbd8fb6ed2aa6dde92a08a">safest place in the world</a>” during the games, an effort that involved the deployment of some <a href="https://apnews.com/article/france-paris-olympics-olympic-games-security-e8f9b8812dc06dae22ffdfad9d15858e">30,000 police per day</a> — and up to 45,000 during the Opening Ceremony — including reinforcements from around 40 countries. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Authorities are also using a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sports/olympics-how-france-plans-use-ai-keep-paris-2024-safe-2024-03-08/">controversial artificial intelligence system to</a> analyze images captured by surveillance cameras around the city in real-time to identify potential threats such as unusual behavior, abandoned objects, or weapons. French legislators had to <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/tech-24/20230324-france-passes-controversial-ai-surveillance-bill-ahead-of-2024-olympics">amend the country’s laws</a> last year to allow for deployment of the new technology. The system was successfully tested at a Depeche Mode concert in Paris in March. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Privacy advocates worry that the use of the system opens up the floodgates to future use of AI technology to undermine privacy and criminalize what authorities deem to be aberrant or unusual behavior in crowds.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“When the next event comes up in another country, they will, of course, look at France and whether or not there was a political reaction,” Patrick Breyer, a German minister of the European Parliament who organized an open letter protesting the use of the system, told Vox. “There’s a risk this will become standard procedure in connection with large events.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before every Olympics, there is a tendency in media coverage to <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2021/07/pre-olympics-bummers.html">accentuate the negative</a>: terrorist risk, political controversy, shoddy facilities, crime, environmental damage. Once the Games start and the athletes are on the court or off the blocks, these issues tend to be brushed aside, for better or worse.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All indications so far are that the Paris Olympics will be a safe and successful Games. US security officials who spoke with Vox emphasized that for all the threats, they have no concerns about the French authorities’ ability to handle them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since 1993, before every Olympics the UN General Assembly has voted to urge member-states to observe the <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/olympic-truce">Olympic Truce</a>, which calls for a cessation of hostilities during the course of the Games. This Olympics was no different, with the vote passing in November.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Olympic Truce has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/what-is-the-olympic-truce-5ea915f2f856d2b1c5edba2e9fc23cbe">always been more aspiration than reality</a>, and between the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, not to mention countless other conflicts around the globe, we can be sure that war won’t come to a pause during the two weeks of the Paris Games. But as International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/un-general-assembly-adopts-olympic-truce-for-paris-2024">said at the UN that day</a>: “The Olympic Games are the only event in our fragile world where people can still come together in peace and harmony.” The hope can only be that the thousands of athletes and the millions of spectators who will gather in Paris can be kept safe from a fragile world beyond the Games.</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">According to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/nancy-pelosi-helped-pressure-joe-biden-end-2024-campaign-rcna162943">multiple reports,</a> former <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/11/20/23467057/nancy-pelosi-speaker-legacy-molly-ball-biography">House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</a> — long known for her steely <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/11/17/23464543/nancy-pelosi-house-speaker-hakeem-jeffries">legislative prowess and confrontation of Republicans</a> — was integral to the push to get President Joe Biden to reconsider his 2024 reelection bid.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Nancy made clear that they could do this the easy way or the hard way,” a Democrat familiar with private conversations <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/21/why-biden-dropped-out-00170106">told Politico</a>. “She gave them three weeks of the easy way. It was about to be the hard way.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The hard way could have included Pelosi publicizing devastating internal polling that showed Biden losing states he easily won in 2020, according to the publication. And it could have led to Pelosi and other Democratic leaders stating plainly that it was time for Biden to go. Current House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer also reportedly had frank conversations with the president about dropping out, though Pelosi’s stance was <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/nancy-pelosi-helped-pressure-joe-biden-end-2024-campaign-rcna162943">viewed as one of the most</a> impactful given her stature in the party.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pelosi’s ability to influence the president was unsurprising due to the unique position of power she holds among Democrats, one she has earned after serving as House speaker for two hugely important terms, and as a lawmaker for more than three decades. In her time as speaker, she was known for overseeing the passage of critical policies like the Affordable Care Act, Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform, and the American Rescue Plan, and for shepherding a fractious conference into uniting behind them. Over the years, she’s also built deep relationships across the party, and with different presidents — including Biden — while helming the House. </p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race. Catch up on this story.</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">President Joe Biden surrendered to pressure from top Democrats and campaign donors who urged him to step aside amid concerns over his age and low polling numbers against Donald Trump.</p>

</ul>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pelosi’s successes (and wide-ranging ties) have all fed into her clout. And they point to how laser-focused she is on results, even at the expense of personal or political backlash. She’s known for sticking by her convictions, whether that involves confrontations with former President Donald Trump or using her political power to persuade other members to support her policies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These tendencies were evident in how she handled Democrats’ Biden crisis, which saw her <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/nancy-pelosi-it-s-up-to-biden-to-decide-if-he-s-going-to-run-214554181531">subtly pressuring the president</a> to step aside on one of his favorite television shows, <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/california-playbook/2024/07/18/the-pelosi-acolytes-pressuring-biden-00169299">working her network</a>, holding <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/nancy-pelosi-biden-conversation/index.html">direct conversations</a>, and finally, according to reports, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/21/why-biden-dropped-out-00170106">issuing an ultimatum</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her recent actions were likely spurred by a drive to win and the risk Biden could have posed to down-ballot House races, per <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/07/17/2024/senate-democrats-share-polling-showing-biden-dragging-down-candidates">polls</a>. Overall, though, they mark the latest example of Pelosi’s singularly influential role within the party and the skillful ways in which she leverages that power.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">How Pelosi became so influential</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pelosi’s willingness to take tough stances and the efficacy she’s had in doing so are trademarks of her leadership and a big reason she’s accrued so much respect. Simply put, she’s known for delivering.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her passage of health care reform, a goal that stymied numerous Democratic speakers, for instance, is just one of many moves that cemented these credentials.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To rally a wide-ranging and divided Democratic conference around the Affordable Care Act, Pelosi spent countless hours on the phone, navigating members’ concerns, Molly Ball, a Wall Street Journal writer and author of <em>Pelosi</em>, a biography, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/11/20/23467057/nancy-pelosi-speaker-legacy-molly-ball-biography">previously told Vox</a>. And she found specific arguments that would appeal to those who were wary of backing the bill. In the case of then-Indiana Rep. Joe Donnelly, for example, Pelosi knew how important his Catholic background was to him, and she had the president of <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/health-care-victory-puts-pelosi-in-the-history-books/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/health-care-victory-puts-pelosi-in-the-history-books/">Notre Dame, his Catholic alma mater, put in a personal call</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pelosi’s handling of that bill was illustrative of how committed she can be to an outcome, even if that goal comes with a high political price. “She ultimately was willing to lose the speakership if it meant that Americans would have health care in perpetuity,” said Ball. After the House passed the ACA in 2009, political backlash — which both Pelosi and then-President Barack Obama had anticipated — led to Democrats’ loss of the House in the 2010 midterm elections.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her willingness to accept difficult consequences in order to reach her ultimate goal was reflected, too, in the tough conversations she took on with Biden, despite the reputational risks they could pose.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyond her successes in advancing policy and electoral wins, Pelosi is also known for how vocal she was as an antagonist to Trump. Her dedication to that role has fueled perceptions of her strength as a leader and added to the sense that she’s only prioritizing what it takes to prevent his return to power.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“She’s the single most consequential legislator of our time. So, you know, people trust her guidance, they trust her judgment. And she’s gotten more done than anybody else,” Drew Hammill, Pelosi’s former deputy chief of staff, told Vox.&nbsp;</p>

	<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The year is 2023. Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who played VP Selina Meyer on the 2010s HBO comedy series <em>Veep</em>, <a href="https://x.com/whitehouse/status/1640007568515801088">visits the White House</a> to meet President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. “Veep!” “Veep!” the two women greet one another. “By the way, she left as president,” Biden jokes to Harris, referring to a central plot point of the show: Meyer ascends to the top job, after the president first decides he won’t be seeking a second term, and later steps down altogether.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Biden announced he would be exiting the 2024 race this past Sunday, making Harris the frontrunner to be the Democratic presidential nominee, the internet’s collective mind exploded. To some it’s further proof that <em>Veep</em> wasn’t just a good satire, but a crystal ball.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not the first time comparisons have been drawn between the real and fictional first female vice presidents. In 2022, <em>The Daily Show</em> made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72vUngNA9RM">supercut</a> combining Meyer’s habit of word salading with Harris’s more confusing sound bites, for which she has become <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2022/01/kamala-harris-offers-illuminating-thoughts-on-covid-strategy.html">somewhat known for</a> over the years. The perception has been egged on by right-wing attacks and even a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/fact-check/video-of-kamala-harris-rambling-her-speech-at-howard-university-is-digitally-cre-idUSL1N3712OM/">digitally altered video</a> that went viral. (<em>Veep </em>showrunner David Mandel, for what it’s worth, doesn’t see the <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/veep-kamala-harris-selina-meyer-showrunner-david-mandel">resemblance in Harris</a>, pegging Mike Pence as more of a Selina Meyer-type.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the collision between the TV show, which aired from 2012 to 2019, and real life goes beyond just how Harris and Meyer start their presidential campaigns. People keep making <em>Veep</em> comparisons to explain the, if you will, <a href="https://www.vox.com/kamala-harris/359072/kamala-harris-coconut-tree-context-unburden-meme-khive">context</a> <a href="https://x.com/lindsayballant/status/1810807033571992039">in which</a> <a href="https://x.com/F466OT/status/1813336208954843241">we live</a>. White House insiders — <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/3816339-julia-louis-dreyfus-harris-says-veep-is-more-like-dc-than-anyone-would-care-to-admit/">including Harris</a> — have, after all, long praised the show for accurately capturing the <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/obama-aides-say-veep-accurate-west-wing-house-cards/">bumbling chaos</a> within the auspicious halls. The fact that we’re so quick on the draw to connect <em>Veep</em> plotlines to real politics, though, might be a reflection of our own nihilistic mood. The show, for how funny and prescient it is, is a behind-the-scenes look at how Meyer becomes a petty tyrant. <em>Veep</em> plays up people’s most cynical suspicions about our government, satirizing an ugly, ugly world where politicians are self-serving monsters who fail upward.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More so than forecasting precise scandals and snafus — though there were plenty of eerily predictive moments, including the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/veep-jonah-ryan-daylight-saving-time-1235112922/">woke-ification of daylight saving time</a> — what <em>Veep</em> got right was the absurd tone of our fractured reality. Not just the increasingly nasty mud-slinging between politicians, but the head-swiveling plot twists that <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361133/trump-assassination-attempt-rnc-men-guns">keep coming</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361827/biden-drops-out-2024-kamala-convention">our way</a>. American politics these days is often compared to a reality show where the story beats get more nonsensical each season. It’s likely that we’re now looking at a former reality TV star running against a politician buoyed by what started out as a bunch of <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/362300/kamala-harris-meme-brat-summer">irony-pilled memes</a>. <em>Veep</em>, at least, knew how ridiculous it could get all along.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Political fortunes turn on a dime</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If there was anything <em>Veep</em> epitomized, it was the whiplash of the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/its-so-over-were-so-back">It’s So Over/We’re So Back</a> vibes meter. Selina Meyer’s stock is always tanking or rallying throughout the series, often thanks to pure dumb luck or misfortune, and the opportunists around her scurry as the dial jerks back and forth.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is taken to an extreme at the end of the first season, when Congressman Roger Furlong (Dan Bakkedahl), running for governor of Ohio, flip-flops on whether he wants Meyer to endorse him. He hems and haws even as she’s on stage giving a speech to introduce his gubernatorial bid. First it’s a no, because Meyer’s disapproval rating sits at a dismal 66 percent, and there are even whispers that POTUS might replace her on the ticket for his second term. Then she gives one good TV interview, and the endorsement is back on. But she cries a little too much during the Furlong speech — endorsement is off. In the next split second, she says something folksy that makes the crowd in Ohio cheer: endorsement is a go. The comically frustrating scene is not unlike the <a href="https://isitjoever.com/">back-and-forth</a> whispers we saw in the <a href="https://x.com/josh_wingrove/status/1813993123883753662">last few weeks</a>, with one report claiming Biden was <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/18/president-biden-drop-out-election-democrats">close to dropping out</a> only for the next to claim he was, in fact, never <a href="https://x.com/josh_wingrove/status/1814032510591918182">dropping out</a>.</p>

</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A lot of <em>Veep</em>’s plotlines are, at their core, about the unpredictability of winds blowing hot and then cold. Who in the world could have foreseen that a former president would almost get assassinated, followed in quick succession by the current president getting Covid, then leaving the presidential race and completely shaking up the landscape of the 2024 election? When Meyer finds out she has a real shot at becoming president at the end of season two, she’s at her lowest, feeling ignored, underappreciated, tired. Every day she asks if the president called.&nbsp;The answer is always no. But now, halfway through his term, the president is probably facing impeachment, and things are not looking good for their party (<em>Veep</em> never makes clear which it is, though there are signs it’s the Dems). Meyer tells her staff that she’s out — she won’t be veep again. In six years, she’ll run at the top of the ticket.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And then the president finally calls for her. He’s not seeking reelection. Meyer can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tY0YsXQQS3k">barely conceal her glee</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not just Meyer, either — most of the characters go from being losers to winners to losers again. Jonah Ryan (Timothy Simons) starts the show as the awkward, annoying liaison between the West Wing and the veep’s office, treated as a punching bag within the Meyer circle (see: a <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/veep-jonah-ryan-daylight-saving-time-1235112922/">compilation of Jonah insults</a>). But in the later seasons the sniveling brown noser described as having a “police sketch face” becomes first a congressman, then a populist right-wing presidential candidate, and then later Meyer’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpQF4xzU_4g">hand-picked vice president</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Not serious people</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most famous American political dramas portray Washington with a degree of gravitas. The stakes are high, and the characters wield their power with intention, for better or for worse. <em>The West Wing</em> represents the most earnest end of the spectrum, showing us well-meaning adults running the country. <em>House of Cards</em> occupies the other end, depicting a dark world full of shadowy, capable puppet masters.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Veep</em>, meanwhile, says that Washington is a circus — an inept one, where the tightrope walkers crash down and the fire breathers set themselves alight. The characters that populate its universe aren’t decent people like they are in <em>The West Wing</em>, but they aren’t evil masterminds like those in <em>House of Cards</em> are either; they desperately want to be Machiavellian but are, alas, too stupid for that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meyer is herself the queen of petty and childish — so, despite the charm of Louis-Dreyfus, the comparison has never been a flattering one for Harris. In season one, she demands a member of her Secret Service detail be reassigned because he smiles at something she says (the move backfires on her). She also makes her absurdly loyal personal aide Gary Walsh (Tony Hale) break up with the man she’s been seeing, because she’s too cowardly to do it herself. In one of her <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/11/5/21550880/trump-tweet-stop-the-count-votes-presidential-election">Trumpiest moments</a>, when a recount of votes in Nevada doesn’t seem to be going her way, she screams for her staff to “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntpywGl5ak">stop the recount</a>.” Even when things are going well, her innate smallness sabotages her ability to be a good leader, like when she’s seething with jealousy over her own running mate’s popularity. (In later seasons, her immaturity calcifies into straight-up cruelty.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Meyer’s not being immature, she (and her staff) can be laughably incompetent, whether it’s <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/the-hapless-veep-staff-trips-itself-up-as-selina-ascends/">accidentally budgeting more money</a> for a program she wanted to cut or literally <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxC8w-vPGTM">walking into a glass door</a>. To quote another show that was a critical darling from HBO, these are <a href="https://www.vox.com/tv/23664902/succession-season-four-ep-two-recap-connor-roy-rehearsal">not serious people</a>. There are plenty of <a href="https://x.com/annetdonahue/status/1814666259851526200">bizarre blunders</a> in recent American politics, a lot of it from the topsy-turvy Trump years, that could be straight out of a <em>Veep</em> episode. Remember when Trump stared <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-looking-solar-eclipse.html">straight into the sun</a>? Or who could forget the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/11/8/21555022/four-seasons-landscaping-trump-giuliani-philadelphia-press-conference">Four Seasons Total Landscaping</a> press conference? Or South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem admitting <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24145840/kristi-noem-puppy-killing-book-trump-vp">to killing a dog</a> in a recent memoir, something Dan Egan (Reid Scott), one of Meyer’s slimiest advisers in<em> Veep</em>, also <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thetheaterandmemesguy/video/7367050789828775214">admits doing</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The frivolousness of <em>Veep</em>’s characters really shines through in the way they talk. In <em>The West Wing</em>, President Bartlet is always <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRYxQM1HHX0">making a stirring speech</a> for one reason or another. In <em>House of Cards</em>, protagonist Frank Underwood <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLf4rnJYUGk">speaks with dramatic authority</a>, sometimes even turning to the camera to communicate straight to the audience. In <em>Veep</em>, in a closer approximation to real life, politicians make mealymouthed declarations that are so careful not to offend any faction that their speeches end up being “noise-shaped air,” as Dan once puts it. This unwillingness to say anything of substance reaches its absurd peak when Meyer hires a yes-woman who has mastered <a href="https://youtu.be/6qoeSe_uzsI?si=wRJbp539QZW66Rsj&amp;t=97">the art of saying absolutely nothing</a>. Meyer’s memoir, of course, has a perfectly nonsensical title, too — <em>A Woman First: First Woman</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">It’s all about the image (and the memes)</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Veep </em>was also merciless about how shallow politics could be — 99 percent of the game, it cynically contends, is theater. In the very first episode, Meyer asks Mike McLintock (Matt Walsh), then her communications director, what he thought the biggest mistakes of her presidential campaign were. He says immediately that a certain hat she wore on the trail hurt them immensely because it looked bad. It sounds facile, but it’s not like there aren’t any real-life examples of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/28/politics/barack-obama-tan-suit-fifth-anniversary/index.html">political fashion scandals</a>. In a quick scene early in the premiere, Meyer also decides not to wear her glasses to an event because they make people look “weak.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the second episode, the veep team spends an inordinate amount of time brainstorming what flavor Meyer should get during a photo-op at the local froyo shop. “Good flavors” that will get a positive reaction from the American People include, apparently, chocolate, peach, and mango, while the bad ones are red velvet cake and peanut butter. Jonah is personally Team Mint, because “it implies freshness, trust, traditional values.” They land on Jamaican Rum but the froyo visit predictably devolves into a mess when Meyer is hit with a stomach virus.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meyer’s staff, much like that of real politicians, is constantly <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/biden-campaign-meme-manager-2024-election-dark-brandon-rcna153947">monitoring the internet</a> just in case the VP goes viral (derogatory) and is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myxMEwyilqo">turned into a meme</a>. Unlike the positive boost Harris memes have given the real veep — something the team now appears to be fully leaning into — internet virality almost always creates more headaches for Meyer, like when the hashtag #fakeveepweep starts trending after a journalist reveals that Meyer’s team intentionally made their boss cry during an interview so she would appear sympathetic. Even the Meyer-Harris memes, as enjoyable as they are now, could fall victim to the fickle It’s So Over/We’re So Back dichotomy, becoming a liability rather than a boon to the campaign.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What Meyer’s team tries (and fails) to do across seven seasons is to make her look likable — which is hard when almost everyone involved, most of all Meyer, are unlikable or out-of-touch people who frequently miss the mark on how the public will react. When a political rival publishes a Spotify playlist of what he’s currently listening to — angling for the youth vote — Meyer declares they need to make one too. (Gary suggests Katy Perry, much to Meyer’s dismay.) When Meyer uses an ableist slur in a speech, a moment that seems all but guaranteed to get negative press, her communications director’s first instinct is to hope for something worse to take attention away from the gaffe. “What if Tom Hanks dies?” he suggests.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">What <em>Veep</em> didn’t predict</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mandel,<em> Veep</em>’s showrunner, has said that the show had to end once Trump took office. <em>Veep</em> was supposed to be satire, its black heart emerging during the height of the <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hopecore">hopecore</a> Obama years. Then reality became more preposterous than the farce. “Trump, in a weird way, is sort of doing us,” Mandel wrote in a column for <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/making-veep-trump-era-golden-shower-joke-got-cut-guest-column-993109/">the Hollywood Reporter</a> in 2017. “We’re not doing him.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Veep</em> does nod to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=embMAtagQiU">Trump-esque figures</a> and the paranoid, anti-establishment <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOD8XXy2l4o">conspiracy hunting</a> that dominates social media now, especially through the character of Jonah Ryan. But, having ended in 2019, the show didn’t anticipate the pandemic or how much worse everything would become — the anti-vaxxers and Covid deniers, the insurrection on January 6, the disinformation accelerated by fake AI photos and videos now littering the internet.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump — who continues to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/rnc-trump-stolen-election-claims-6b3bdc8c0b69cf1b9311068ee6cdae8c">refer to the false claim</a> that the <a href="https://www.vox.com/21506029/trump-violence-tweets-racist-hate-speech">2020 election was stolen</a> — is now the Republican presidential candidate once again. Mandel recently <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/veep-kamala-harris-selina-meyer-showrunner-david-mandel">told Vanity Fair</a> that <em>Veep</em> was already dated in one key way: “So much of it was based on the notion that there were consequences to what you do and say as a politician, and that just went out the window with Donald Trump,” he said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We don’t know how things will pan out in 2024, let alone decades from now — but in <em>Veep</em>, most of the characters ultimately don’t get what they want. Their careers end not with a bang but with a little sputter. Gary <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/veep-series-finale-tony-hale-betrayal-flash-forward-reveal-1210885/">goes to prison</a>, taking the fall for Meyer’s sins. Aggressively ambitious Dan becomes a realtor. Jonah is impeached from the vice presidency. Most importantly, Selina Meyer has no legacy to speak of. The notoriously comprehensive Robert Caro writes what’s almost certainly a <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/veep-coronavirus-episode.html">scathing biography of her</a> in just 18 months, a sure sign of how pitifully small her political career was, and she dies somewhere in her mid-70s (which is younger than both Trump and Biden currently are). Her funeral is overshadowed by news of Tom Hanks’s death.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But that’s the far-off future. For now, everyone — including Kamala Harris — is still laughing at <em>Veep</em>’s uncanny prophecies.&nbsp;</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The day after <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361888/biden-drops-out-kamala-harris-endorsement-dnc-democratic-nominee">President Joe Biden said he would not seek reelection</a>, his White House&nbsp;announced more than <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-43-billion-grants-community-driven-solutions-cut">$4.3 billion in grants from the Environmental Protection Agency</a> to communities to curb climate change, cut pollution, and seek environmental justice.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a big announcement, but easily lost amid the thunderous presidential campaign news.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The grants will fund projects across the country that include decarbonizing freight, installing geothermal systems, and capturing fugitive methane emissions. According to the EPA, these grantees will cut US greenhouse gas emissions up to 971 million metric tons by 2050. That’s equal to the emissions of five million average homes over 25 years.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Amid all the political pandemonium, it’s remarkable that the administration is continuing to pump out new environmental initiatives. Climate has consistently been a high priority for the Biden administration, and this announcement proves a genuine commitment. Biden has the distinction of introducing the earliest bill in the Senate to address climate change, the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/99th-congress/senate-bill/2891">1986 Global Climate Protection Act</a>. Humanity, though, has <a href="https://ieep.eu/news/more-than-half-of-all-co2-emissions-since-1751-emitted-in-the-last-30-years/">more than doubled its greenhouse gas pollution</a> since then. As president, Biden has made dealing with global warming an even higher priority than it was during his last turn in the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/5/28/18634602/joe-biden-2020-climate-change-announcement">White House as vice president</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The United States is the <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-which-countries-are-historically-responsible-for-climate-change/">world’s largest historical emitter of greenhouse gasses</a> and is currently second in annual output, behind China and ahead of India. So on the world stage, the US has a significant role, and activists say a responsibility, to nudge the global warming trajectory downward.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When he leaves office in January 2025, Biden will be able to credibly claim that he has done more on climate change than any other president and has been one of the most consequential decision-makers in the world for the future of the planet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But while he’s done the most, it’s still not enough to get the US in line with <a href="https://www.vox.com/22397364/earth-day-us-climate-change-summit-biden-john-kerry-commitment-2030-zero-emissions">Biden’s own climate change goals</a>. Many of Biden’s environmental initiatives are still struggling to get rolling, and some <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/12/sunrise-youth-climate-biden-elections-00167851">activist groups are not satisfied</a> with what he’s done.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And if Donald Trump wins in November, that progress will stall.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Joe Biden has done for the climate</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Biden was one of nearly two dozen Democrats running for the top job in 2019, he <a href="https://htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/files/bidenclimateplan-1559610636.pdf">proposed an extensive climate plan</a> released in two installments that emphasized cutting greenhouse gas emissions by building up a robust US clean energy sector with $2 trillion in investment. He also laid out a <a href="https://htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/files/bidenclimateplan-1559610636.pdf">legislative strategy</a> and a list of <a href="https://www.vox.com/21549521/climate-change-senate-election-joe-biden">executive actions</a> he would take on his own, such as imposing tough methane leak restrictions on new oil and gas facilities, requiring federal government operations to procure clean energy, and imposing new efficiency regulations on appliances. At the same time, Biden’s plan was seen as <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/9/5/20850009/cnn-climate-town-hall-2020-presidential-democrats-winners-and-losers">less ambitious</a> than those of his competitors — <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/8/22/20827396/bernie-sanders-2020-climate-policy-green-new-deal">Bernie Sanders called for $16.3 trillion in total</a> — and he was criticized for declining to support a ban on fracking and for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/05/us/politics/joe-biden-andrew-goldman-fundraiser.html">attending a fundraiser</a> hosted by a natural gas company founder.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But since taking office in January 2021, Biden has demonstrated that at least part of his plan was realistic: He managed to tick many of the items on his to-do list that are directly under the president’s purview or from cabinet agencies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He brought the US back into the <a href="https://www.vox.com/22241348/president-biden-climate-change-paris-agreement-executive-order-keystone-pipeline">2015 Paris climate agreement</a>, personally <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/11/11/remarks-by-president-biden-at-the-27th-conference-of-the-parties-to-the-framework-convention-on-climate-change-cop27-sharm-el-sheikh-egypt/">attended international climate talks</a>, and committed the country to a more ambitious goal of <a href="https://www.vox.com/22397364/earth-day-us-climate-change-summit-biden-john-kerry-commitment-2030-zero-emissions">cutting carbon dioxide emissions in half from 2005 levels by 2030</a> while achieving <a href="https://www.vox.com/22737140/un-cop26-climate-change-net-zero-emissions-carbon-offsets">net-zero emissions</a> across the economy by 2050. His administration enacted <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24106924/epa-vehicle-emissions-carbon-pollution-climate-ev-hybrid">new fuel economy regulations</a> for cars and trucks to encourage electrification. It set <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/5/13/23719080/environmental-protection-agency-limit-power-plant-pollution">stringent caps on air pollution and carbon dioxide</a> from <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-suite-standards-reduce-pollution-fossil-fuel">fossil fuel power plants</a>. It raised efficiency standards for stoves, refrigerators, and shower heads. It set <a href="https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/president-biden-signs-executive-order-federal-sustainability">zero-emissions targets for federal buildings, energy suppliers, and vehicle fleets</a>, including placing orders for at least 45,000 <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/23518852/postal-service-electric-mail-truck-usps-ngdv-dejoy">electric mail trucks</a>. It vastly expanded <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/07/fact-sheet-president-biden-restores-protections-for-three-national-monuments-and-renews-american-leadership-to-steward-lands-waters-and-cultural-resources/">federal protections for public lands</a> and established a <a href="https://www.blm.gov/careers/students-and-grads/civilian-climate-corps">Civilian Climate Corps</a> to train workers to maintain them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps Biden’s single most impactful climate action was signing the <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/23373026/kigali-amendment-signed-biden-republican-hfc-climate-change-montreal">Kigali Amendment</a>, an international treaty to phase out some of the most powerful greenhouse gasses. On its own, the Kigali Amendment would avert almost 1 degree Fahrenheit of warming by the end of the century. On September 21, 2022, it <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1172/vote_117_2_00343.htm">cleared the Senate with bipartisan support</a>, including 21 Republicans.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With Congress, Biden signed the trio of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/22772701/biden-infrastructure-law-environmental-funding">Bipartisan Infrastructure Law</a>, the <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2022/7/27/23277664/chips-act-solve-chip-shortage-biden-manufacturing">CHIPS and Science Act</a>, and the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/8/8/23296951/inflation-reduction-act-biden-democrats-climate-change">Inflation Reduction Act</a>. While climate change isn’t in their names, these laws mobilized billions of dollars in investments in clean energy, infrastructure, battery manufacturing, and building up supply chains. Together, they’re some of the largest investments in climate change mitigation in the world. Additionally, they’re structured as incentives, with no explicit penalties for carbon dioxide emissions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Getting these laws passed was a bruising fight. Biden’s signature <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/7/28/23281757/whats-in-climate-bill-inflation-reduction-act">Inflation Reduction Act</a> in its final form — with $370 billion for clean energy deployment — was a fraction of the size of the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-house-vote-bidens-175-trillion-bill-after-hours-long-delay-2021-11-19/">$1.75 trillion version that passed the House in 2021</a>. The Democrats’ narrow majority in the Senate gave holdouts like <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/23955967/joe-manchin-climate-change-senate-biden-inflation">West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin leverage</a> to chip away at its scope while securing more pot sweeteners for his own state. That in turn <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/08/10/victory-whose-expense-climate-activists-grapple-with-political-compromise/">drew the ire of environmental activists</a> who were anticipating a much more robust law.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Much of the IRA’s costs come in the form of tax breaks rather than new spending. “The IRA’s projected costs to the U.S. federal budget are mostly reductions in taxes owed by U.S. taxpayers or increases in federal payments to those taxpayers,” according to a <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/the-inflation-reduction-acts-benefits-and-costs">Treasury Department analysis</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, the IRA remains the <a href="https://rmi.org/the-ira-is-the-largest-climate-investment-in-us-history-are-utilities-planning-accordingly/">largest investment to deal with climate change</a> in US history.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Politics and <strong>Biden’s own policies undermined his climate ambitions&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden has also had to navigate political rapids over the past four years and has ended up getting turned around on occasion.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For instance, Biden campaigned on <a href="https://x.com/umairfan/status/1515067048275202048">banning new oil and gas development on public lands</a> (on a page since deleted from his website), but in 2022, the Interior Department opened the door to <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-announces-significantly-reformed-onshore-oil-and-gas-lease-sales">new drilling lease sales</a>. One example is the <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/2023/3/14/23637780/willow-project-biden-oil-drilling-climate-change">Willow project in northern Alaska</a>, which the Biden administration greenlit last year, that could extract more than 600 million barrels of oil over 30 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fossil fuel projects like this have led to some of Biden’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24098983/biden-oil-production-climate-fossil-fuel-renewables">biggest climate contradictions</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Biden’s watch, the US has become the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61545">largest oil and gas producer in history</a>. US exports of natural gas hit a record high, especially after the administration stepped up deliveries to allies after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Even though the US is aiming to slash its domestic emissions, the country is on track to double liquid natural gas (LNG) exports by 2030. But Biden also imposed a pause on <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24055711/lng-export-pause-biden-liquefied-natural-gas-climate-change">new liquefied natural gas export terminals</a> pending a review of their environmental and national security bona fides.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When desperate to tamp down inflation and smooth over supply chain disruptions stemming from the Covid-19 pandemic, the White House <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/16/biden-oil-reserve-fuels-00121298">tapped the strategic petroleum reserve</a> to help bring gasoline prices down. Biden has <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/07/22/remarks-by-president-biden-during-economic-briefing-on-lowering-gas-prices/">bragged about lowering gasoline prices</a>. These lower prices tend to spur more driving, which in turn increases greenhouse gas emissions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">America’s fossil fuel bounties have put the <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24098983/biden-oil-production-climate-fossil-fuel-renewables">Biden White House in the awkward position</a> of taking credit for facilitating their production while simultaneously trying to curb their use.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden’s policies have also created friction within his climate goals.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">His signature legislation, the IRA, has provisions mandating that cleantech companies <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/5/9/23712675/inflation-reduction-act-climate-change-trade-policy-joe-biden-nationalism-china">build their products and supply chains in the US</a> if they want to tap the money in the law. The provision has <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/IPOL_IDA(2023)740087">angered allies in places like Europe</a> that want to sell products like solar panels and efficient appliances to US customers. Biden has also <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/cost-trumps-trade-war-china-still-adding">retained many of former President Donald Trump’s tariffs</a> on foreign goods and is <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/2024/3/4/24087919/biden-tariff-chinese-ev-byd-battery-detroit">imposing new ones on cheap electric vehicles made in China</a> by companies like BYD, currently <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/07/03/byd-top-tesla-worlds-largest-ev-maker-2024/">vying with Tesla to be the largest pure EV maker in the world</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This protectionism for US companies raises prices for American buyers and means that the shift to clean energy is more expensive and slower than it needs to be. On the other hand, if cheaper cars and solar panels did enter the US market, they could get more Americans off of coal, oil, and natural gas at a faster pace.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>America’s progress on climate change is fragile</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The question now is whether US climate policies will continue to gain momentum, stall, or reverse. The main hinge point is who wins the next election.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, has her <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/362131/biden-drop-out-kamala-harris-climate-record">own history with tackling climate change</a> as California’s attorney general. And with Biden’s endorsement, the <a href="https://x.com/findareaction/status/1588718308060168193">Venn diagram</a> of their climate policies will have a lot of overlap.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, there are some big obstacles. Few Americans grasp how they can <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/2023/8/16/23815837/inflation-reduction-act-joe-biden-impact-manufacturing-consumers">benefit from the programs in the IRA</a>, and the money in the law has been slow to trickle out to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2024/03/28/ev-charging-stations-slow-rollout/">build things like EV charging stations</a>. Shortages of specialized labor and permitting issues have <a href="https://www.constructiondive.com/news/manufacturing-delay-permits-labor-projects/694064/">delayed big clean energy manufacturing projects</a>. Energy demand is poised to grow as well, driven by population growth and <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/2024/3/28/24111721/ai-uses-a-lot-of-energy-experts-expect-it-to-double-in-just-a-few-years">technologies like artificial intelligence</a>, and already <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/05/ai-could-drive-natural-gas-boom-as-utilities-face-surging-electric-demand.html">fossil fuels are feeding</a> some of that <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/2024/3/28/24111721/ai-uses-a-lot-of-energy-experts-expect-it-to-double-in-just-a-few-years">new appetite</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden’s policies are facing legal setbacks too. Republican state attorneys general are <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/red-states-go-to-court-over-biden-fuel-efficiency-standards/">suing the White House</a> to block new fuel efficiency regulations for cars and trucks. The Republican-led Supreme Court has also eroded the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/6/30/23189610/supreme-court-epa-west-virginia-clean-power-plan-major-questions-john-roberts">federal government’s ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions</a>, and with the recent reversal of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/357900/supreme-court-loper-bright-raimondo-chevron-power-grab"><em>Chevron </em>doctrine</a>, agencies like the EPA will have much less leeway to craft environmental rules.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also not clear voters will reward the effort. A majority of Americans <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/08/09/what-the-data-says-about-americans-views-of-climate-change/">support addressing climate change and deploying more clean energy</a>, but it ranks as a much lower priority behind issues like <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/02/06/economy-remains-the-publics-top-policy-priority-covid-19-concerns-decline-again/">crime and inflation</a>. According to the <a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/understanding-pro-climate-voters/">Yale Program on Climate Change Communication</a> in a survey conducted in April 2024, 37 percent of US voters consider climate change to be “very important.” &nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-1816160054.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.736007856427,100,78.527984287147" alt="Kamala Harris standing at a lectern that has United Nations Climate Change COP28 UAE." title="Kamala Harris standing at a lectern that has United Nations Climate Change COP28 UAE." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Vice President Kamala Harris speaks at the COP28 climate change summit in the United Arab Emirates in 2023. | Hollie Adams/Bloomberg via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Hollie Adams/Bloomberg via Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">On the other hand, Trump, the Republican nominee, is openly disdainful of action on climate change. A key focus of his first turn in office was systematically <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/1/29/16684952/epa-scott-pruitt-director-regulations">undoing or blocking environmental regulations</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/11/14/16634480/us-coal-nuclear-climate-change-cop23-protest">promoting fossil fuels</a>, going as far as <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/11/9/16619120/trump-administration-removing-climate-change-epa-online-website">removing the words “climate change” from government websites</a>. Many of these rollbacks were stalled because they were poorly structured, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/1/19/22239074/affordable-clean-energy-rule-vacated-trump-court-climate-change-obama-biden">blocked by courts</a>, or <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/7/5/17192716/scott-pruitt-resigns-epa-administrator-andrew-wheeler">undermined by bad staffing choices</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Conservative activists are working to ensure they don’t squander another opportunity in the White House to achieve their goals. The Heritage Foundation laid out a strategy for this in <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce">Project 2025</a>, which aims to staff federal agencies with people who will reduce regulations and increase fossil fuel development. Though Trump has sought to distance himself from the plan, many alumni from his administration and campaign personnel were among the authors.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And there’s always the chance of another shock — a war, a pandemic, a depression — that could take the wind out of the sails of curbing climate change.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite this uncertainty, it’s increasingly clear that the turn toward cleaner energy is likely to endure. Worldwide, wind and solar are the cheapest sources of new electricity, and in some cases more cost-effective than existing fossil fuel sources. Market forces and climate policies are starting to have an effect, and according to some estimates, the world may be close to reaching <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24139383/climate-change-peak-greenhouse-gas-emissions-action">peak greenhouse gas emissions</a>, if it hasn’t already crossed this line.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even with so many potential setbacks, some of the big changes Biden set in motion are likely to stick, as the cleaner, more efficient technologies become cheaper and more polluting sources of energy enter their final days. Even if Trump were to retake the White House, it’s likely that <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-trump-election-win-could-add-4bn-tonnes-to-us-emissions-by-2030/">US emissions will continue to decline</a>, albeit not as quickly as they would under a Democrat.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Changing this course took decades of persistent effort from scientists, engineers, leaders, and activists. Joe Biden deserves some credit for helping turn the rudder.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When President Joe Biden announced Sunday he was dropping out of the presidential race, a chorus of Democratic Party officials breathed a sigh of relief. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent weeks, Democratic bigwigs ranging from Nancy Pelosi to Barack Obama had been ratcheting up a pressure campaign to get Biden to step aside. Back in 2022, former Obama adviser and current political pundit David Axelrod was one of the first prominent Democrats to suggest Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/11/us/politics/biden-2024-election-democrats.html">should withdraw.</a> But yesterday’s news left him with mixed emotions. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“When I got the news yesterday, I was very, very sad,” Axelrod told <em>Today, Explained</em> co-host Sean Rameswaram Monday morning. “I thought he was a tremendous asset in the White House. Always enjoyed being with him, always appreciated the points that he was making. I think history will be a lot kinder to him than voters are right now, for the things that he’s accomplished.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Listen to Sean Rameswaram’s full conversation with Axelrod and follow <em>Today, Explained</em> on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/today-explained/id1346207297">Apple podcasts</a>,<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3pXx5SXzXwJxnf4A5pWN2A"> Spotify</a>,<a href="https://www.pandora.com/podcast/today-explained/PC:140"> Pandora</a>, or wherever you find podcasts. Below is a transcript of their discussion, edited for length and clarity. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Rameswaram&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You were part of this mounting call for [President Biden] to step aside. Did you think that was actually in the cards? Did you think the party was capable of what it’s going through right now?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">David Axelrod&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I thought it was almost inevitable after the debate. The debate kind of crystallized what had been a big and growing problem, which was doubts about his fitness to serve another four years. Those were not just magnified, but calcified by the debate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And then you had the bookend of Trump and the assassination attempt. And his preternatural marketing instincts to find the precise spot to take the hero pose. The two things read weakness and strength, which was the essence of the Trump message that the world was out of control. “Biden is not in command. He’s weak. Trump is strong. Vote for Trump.” That was their whole campaign. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now they have a complication because they don’t have Biden. So, it does change the nature of the race. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A lot of the people who were calling for Biden to step aside are now jubilant, if not endorsing Vice President Harris. Your friend and former colleague, former President Barack Obama, has not yet done that. What do you think is going on there?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">David Axelrod</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I don’t think he wanted to prescribe for the party what the party should do, but rather be available to be a force for pulling the party together once the party made its choice. I think what’s very clear as we sit here this morning, the day after the president made his announcement, is that Kamala Harris is going to be the nominee of the Democratic Party. I don’t think there’s any real debate about that. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She very quickly consolidated support in a way that should actually inspire some confidence, because that’s a political task and she did it. She did it very well. I think the last of the prospective opponents will endorse her and she’ll move on to the business of choosing a vice presidential candidate.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Rameswaram<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So you don’t think she’s going to do what the Republicans did and wait until the DNC to announce who’s going to be on the ticket with her?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">David Axelrod</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I don’t think she can, because they are committed to an early vote of the delegates to nominate two candidates in order to accommodate all the states filing deadlines for the fall ballot. They’re scheduled to meet next week to codify the ticket. I don’t think that they really can put this off until the convention. I anticipate that we’ll know relatively quickly who the vice presidential nominee is going to be.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You host a podcast with a Republican strategist named Mike Murphy, who’s anti-Trump, but he’s one of the few voices saying that it’s happening too fast with Harris. Do you understand his perspective on that?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">David Axelrod</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I do, but I think that she would be the nominee if there were a process or if there were not a process, for a variety of reasons.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One, she has more of a relationship with the delegates to the convention. Biden-Harris delegates were chosen by the Biden campaign. And so they’re naturally going to gravitate towards her. The composition of those delegates favors her. I think she might have benefited from more of a competition just to show that she could win. But I get Mike’s point of view. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the reasons why I spoke out as early as I did about my concerns about the president moving forward was that had he made this decision last year, we would have had a Democratic primary. In the Democratic primary is how you pressure test these candidates. Remember, Ron DeSantis was viewed as a behemoth in the fall of 2022, and then he had to go through the nominating battle, and he ended up not faring as well. You do find out about people through that process. That said, she’s been vetted quite a bit. She ran for president. She’s been vice president for three and a half years. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No matter what level of politics you’re at, there’s no training for it. There’s no simulator you can pop into to find out what the pressures of a presidential campaign are like. In many ways, the campaign simulates the sort of relentless pressure that presidents themselves will feel. She’s experienced that, she has been swimming in the deep end of the pool, and that, to me, is a big thing. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The other thing is she has apprenticed. She has been in those rooms. She has been in those meetings. She knows a lot about what the presidency entails. That, too, is something that’s very hard to learn, on the fly. So I think she’s got a lot of arguments on her side for this.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It seems like the Republicans really want to come after Biden, and now Harris, probably, on immigration, on inflation. Does Harris have the same weaknesses as Biden there, if not even more so?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">David Axelrod</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, they will try to depict her as the immigration czar, and I’m sure they’ve got about 100 ads in the can on this. But the truth is, she’s not Joe Biden. She can chart her own course now. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’m old enough to remember the ’68 campaign when Lyndon Johnson quit. Ultimately, his vice president, Hubert Humphrey, became the presidential candidate, and the heavy burden of Vietnam hung over him. He ended up losing by a point, but he also was like 20 points behind when he got nominated. And if that race had gone another month, another week, I should say he would have won. So, you know, she needs to chart her own course. Talk about what she would do. I think there are also points on this immigration issue that are vulnerabilities for Trump.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Are you looking forward to that debate?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">David Axelrod</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Oh, yes. You know, what’s interesting is that the addled old man on the platform is not going to be Joe Biden this time.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kamala Harris is a historic vice president. She’ll be an even more historic president, obviously. Do you think she leans into that, or do you think she leans into the issues? She leans into Donald Trump’s various criminal battles, what have you.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">David Axelrod</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Listen, when Barack Obama was running for president, we never talked about the historic nature of his candidacy because we thought that was obvious. Others might be talking about it, but he always said, I am proudly of the Black community, but I’m not limited to it, and I’m not running to be the first Black president or the Black president. I’m running to be president of the United States. The people who step forward and say, you can’t bypass her because she’s the first Black woman vice president? They were diminishing her. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The case they should have been making and should be making today is why she’s the best candidate, why she has the best chance to win, what she brings to this race. I know there’s a lot of enthusiasm among some folks about the historic nature of the race. But there are a lot of voters for whom other things are more important. And they want to know, are we going to have someone who understands our lives and is fighting for us? The more she focuses on that, I think the greater her chances of success.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Rameswaram&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You started saying that the news yesterday made you sad, but you obviously helped turn hope into a political strategy in 2008. Do you feel hopeful right now?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">David Axelrod&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I do, because I think that what was not a race yesterday is a race today. I see the enthusiasm that the vice president has generated in the first 24 hours. She raised $46 million in a matter of hours, online and small donations. That’s a record. It’s a gauge of enthusiasm which has been absent. So I am encouraged by what I see. It’s better to have hope than despair. And this morning, a lot of Democrats have hope that they didn’t have yesterday morning. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During every Olympic Games, lesser-known professional athletes are catapulted into household names overnight. Typically, they have to win medals. Other times, their personalities are enough to build their own fandoms. Heading into this summer’s Olympics in Paris, Noah Lyles expects to be recognized for both.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you don’t follow track and field, you may not be familiar with Lyles — although his name could soon become inescapable. Already, the new Netflix docuseries <em>Sprint</em>, set around the <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/olympics/news/track-and-field-world-championships-results-2023">2023 World Athletics Championships</a> in Budapest, has shone a bigger spotlight on him. The six-part series follows track and field’s brightest stars in the 100- and 200-meter sprints, including the fastest woman on Earth, Sha’Carri Richardson; Jamaican gold medalist Shericka Jackson; and British record-holder in the 100 and 200 meters, Zharnel Hughes. Despite this star power, the series’s main attraction has been Lyles, whose ambitions to outrun retired legend Usain Bolt have ruffled <a href="https://www.essentiallysports.com/us-sports-news-olympics-news-track-and-field-news-not-likable-at-all-noah-lyles-receives-heavy-criticism-from-twitters-track-field-community-for-netflixs-sprint-documentary/">some feathers</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many of Lyles’s soundbites in <em>Sprint</em> have been <a href="https://x.com/BadgyalTerryG/status/1811176867061260790">perceived</a> by <a href="https://x.com/willthefred/status/1811185176766038069">viewers</a> as <a href="https://x.com/pernillatweets1/status/1809892070334570956">arrogant.</a> In one scene, he says that to be a successful athlete, “you have to have the mindset of a God.” “I’m a true believer in that the moment isn’t bigger than me, the moment was made for me,” he says in another. Compare this attitude to Shericka Jackson’s. When asked by someone off-camera about claims that she’s the best in the sport, she refused to comment. Meanwhile, others seem confused about Lyles’s claim to “the fastest man in the world” title while Bolt is still living. Still, much like <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/shacarri-richardson-august-2024-digital-cover-interview" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vogue.com/article/shacarri-richardson-august-2024-digital-cover-interview">Richardson</a>, his bravado, personal style, and penchant for trash-talking has given Americans someone to place their bets on at the upcoming Olympics.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Currently, Lyles holds the title of the fastest man in the world after winning the 100 and 200 meters — also known as the sprint double — at last year’s World Championships. (He ran the 100 meter in 9.83 seconds and the 200 meter in 19.52.) Altogether, he holds six world titles. He also earned the bronze medal in the 200 meter at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, a disappointing result that he says inspired his lofty goals at this year’s games. Not only does he want to beat Bolt’s record times, he plans to take home four gold medals.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether he can actually achieve this feat is anyone’s guess. Regardless, it seems like he’ll leave this year’s Olympics having achieved another career goal — having everyone talk about him.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Lyles may have his critics, but it’s all part of his mythmaking&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When we think of celebrity athletes whose fame extends beyond their sport, sprinters aren’t exactly the first people to come to mind. While Bolt has practically become synonymous with running, it’s fair to say the sport doesn’t offer its athletes the same level of visibility that the NBA, for example, offers even its most unassuming players. For instance, it took a <a href="https://www.vox.com/22565419/shacarri-richardson-olympics-marijuana-ban-war-on-drugs">drug-test scandal</a> — coming up positive for marijuana, not performance-enhancing drugs — and her subsequent suspension from the Tokyo Olympics for Richardson to become a national talking point and a currently beloved underdog.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lyles wants this to change. “You have all these other athletes as stars, rockstars, popular wherever they go,” he says in the first episode of <em>Sprint</em>. “Track and field needs to be the same.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The 26-year-old has certainly been doing his part to bring attention to the sport, or maybe just to himself. While he doesn’t represent the most head-turning style in track and field right now — that may belong to Richardson with her occasionally flame-colored hair, numerous tattoos, and Flo Jo-esque acrylics — he frequently shows up to meets in snazzy, designer looks, like F1 champion Lewis Hamilton or one of a handful of NBA stars. Also in the spirit of ’80s icon Florence Griffith Joyner, he even enjoys a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nbcolympics/video/7344869517991922990">flashy manicure</a>. His accomplishments, thus far, have also gotten him a few magazine covers, most recently <a href="https://time.com/6991825/noah-lyles-olympics-2024-interview/">Time</a>, and an extremely lucrative contract for a track star with Adidas. </p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On social media, he delivers the same high-quality, fashion-forward content of a major influencer. (In <em>Sprint</em>, he refers to himself as an “artistic director.”) On his Instagram (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/nojo18/?hl=en">@nojo18</a>), where he’s approaching a million followers, you’re just as likely to see high-res photos of his pre-meet fits, posts with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C8k6QGHI7qq/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1">Snoop Dogg</a>, and wardrobe selections inspired by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8yKXDnRYer/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">his favorite anime</a> as you are content related to track. He also posts playful videos with his girlfriend, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C9LDOhMvteN/?hl=en">fellow runner Junelle Bromfield</a>, the pair seeming to be a power couple in the making.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On his way to becoming America’s most beloved track star, though, Lyles has already rubbed some sports fans the wrong way. In an interview following his World Championship wins last year, he questioned why NBA Finals winners are referred to as “world champions.” “World champions of what?” he asked at a post-meet conference.“The United States?” Soon came a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/29/sport/noah-lyles-nba-backlash-spt-intl/index.html">pile of responses</a> from NBA players, including Kevin Durant, Aaron Gordon, and Devin Booker denouncing his comments. Drake, a supporter of the Toronto Raptors, even chimed in, poking fun at Lyles. Others, like Ghanaian sports journalist <a href="https://twitter.com/garyalsmith/status/1696087026154541245?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1696087026154541245%7Ctwgr%5E95a150cf499700a49eda9372113c58a1dfff9e17%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.npr.org%2F2023%2F08%2F28%2F1196396026%2Fnoah-lyles-nba-world-champions-basketball-drake-kevin-durant">Gary Al-Smith</a>, said Lyles was simply observing a larger problem of American exceptionalism in basketball.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ironically, Lyles has been accused of displaying the same superior, <a href="https://x.com/wiiissssss/status/1810777524630397169">culturally American</a> attitude in his own sport. On the fourth episode of <em>Sprint</em>, Lyles discussed the backlash he received after he posted his predicted times in the 100 meter and 200 meter at last year’s World Championships on Instagram, which he ultimately fell short of, despite taking home the gold. “What the heck does me saying my goal have to do with you?” he asks in a talking-head interview. It’s a good question, considering that it’s every athlete’s goal to perform at their best and destroy their opponents, whether or not they vocalize it as much as Lyles does. Fans’ negative responses to this sort of behavior have also confused Richardson, who says in the docuseries that there should be “more trash-talking” in the sport.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This poor reception online can at least be partially explained by a heated rivalry between American and Jamaican sprinters that intensified at the<a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1269260-olympic-track-2012-breaking-down-team-usas-rivalry-with-jamaican-sprinters"> 2008 Beijing Olympics</a> where Bolt won the gold in the 100 meter and 200 meter, while achieving record times in both sprints. Jamaican track stars Shelly Ann-Frazer and Veronica Campbell-Brown also won the 100 meter and 200 meter, respectively. More than any athlete, though, Bolt has become a national symbol and icon in Jamaica, where track and field is the dominant sport. Announcing your plans to overthrow him, as Lyles has done, expectedly has some repercussions.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>All eyes are on Lyles at the Paris Olympics&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the US claims both the fastest man and woman in the world right now, one can assume an even larger number of American viewers will be tuned in to track this year, and there’s a lot at stake for Lyles’s reputation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Historically, the Olympics have been fraught territory for the runner. In 2020, fans&nbsp;witnessed the emotional toll that training for and competing at the Olympics has had on Lyles, and how he handles disappointment when he’s fallen short of his goals.&nbsp;After landing in third place in the 200 meter in Tokyo, Lyles broke down during a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2021/08/04/noah-lyles-bronze-olympics-depression/">post-meet interview</a> with the Washington Post. Tears started to fall when talking about his brother, Josephus Lyles, another professional sprinter, who failed to qualify for the Olympics that year. He spoke&nbsp;about his mental health and his journey with antidepressants leading up to the Olympics, as well as his experience marching alongside his brother in 2020’s Black Lives Matter protests, and the pressure he feels as a Black American athlete and a Black American man.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I knew there were a lot of people out there like me who were too scared to say something or start that journey,” he said. “I wanted them to know if you guys see me in a big light, I want you to know that it’s okay not to feel good and you can go out and talk to somebody … This is a serious issue.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-2158934967_fdcc65.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Noah Lyles, pictured from below, wears a red track suit and a gold medal around his neck, stands beside a replica of the Eiffel tower." title="Noah Lyles, pictured from below, wears a red track suit and a gold medal around his neck, stands beside a replica of the Eiffel tower." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Noah Lyles celebrates with the gold medal after winning the men’s 100-meter final on day three of the 2024 US Olympic Team trials Track &amp; Field at Hayward Field on June 23, 2024, in Eugene, Oregon. | Patrick Smith/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Patrick Smith/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, following a double-sprint win at the World Championships, Lyles is displaying more confidence than ever. During a recent appearance on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZRVEX2OG10"><em>The Tonight Show</em></a>, Lyles took the opportunity to tell the country what he planned to achieve in Paris. For one thing, he wants to beat Bolt, who holds the top two times in the 100-meter dash at 9.63 and 9.69 seconds. But he also wants to take home four gold medals. “It’s not just good enough to be faster than that,” Lyles told Fallon. “You also have to have the medals to go with it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition to taking home the gold in the 100 and 200 meter, Lyles wants to win in the 4&#215;100&nbsp;and 4&#215;400 meter relays. It wouldn’t be the first time an American sprinter nabbed four gold medals at one Olympics. For instance, Jesse Owens, Alvin Kraenzlein, and Carl Lewis have each won four. Their wins included the long jump, however; Lyles would be making history for those four sprints. Beyond any potential medals, the energy surrounding him and Richardson feels like a new era for American track stars, one defined by attitude and swagger. If Lyles can impress the world with his personality, he’ll at least have achieved half of his goals.&nbsp;</p>

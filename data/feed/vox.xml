<p class="has-text-align-none">Steven Phillips-Horst had a problem — er, “problem,” depending on who you ask — that plagues many a modern Spotify listener. No matter what song the podcaster and comedian played, whether by Taylor Swift or Celine Dion, Morgan Wallen or the band How to Dress Well, the platform would immediately queue up Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso” next.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“How is it that no matter what direction my unique personality takes me in, it leads me back to this same song that I only heard three days ago that I don’t even really like that much?” he asks over the phone, not knowing that the same thing had been happening to me, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The disco-inflected soft pop hit, performed by a Polly Pocket-sized former Disney Channel star, was <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2024/5/14/24155699/sabrina-carpenter-espresso-career-olivia-rodrigo-explained">deemed the song of summer</a> nearly as soon as it was released in mid-April. But Phillips-Horst wondered, was that because the song was good? Or, as he <a href="https://twitter.com/gossipbabies/status/1790841532745953781">proposed on X</a>, was it because of the tantalizing (if unfounded) theory that Carpenter’s label was paying Spotify to force-feed “Espresso” down the throats of listeners the world over?</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">No matter what song you listen to on Spotify, it will play Espresso as the next track.

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s not an ‘algorithm,’” he wrote. “The label is paying for radio play in an old school, industry plant kinda way and it’s honestly refreshing. We are so back etc!” Responses flooded in, with hundreds of others saying they too couldn’t escape “Espresso” or other hits from new-ish entries into the pop game, namely Chappell Roan’s “<a href="https://x.com/deliclit/status/1795831409116053814">Good Luck, Babe!</a>” and Tommy Richman’s “<a href="https://x.com/JasmynBeKnowing/status/1795479334561726950">Million Dollar Baby</a>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The theory seems to be an increasingly popular one: that the biggest music streaming platform in the world has arrangements with record labels to boost streams for particular songs and artists. It’s not exactly a far-fetched conclusion. The history of pop music is rife with payola scandals, in which <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/hit-men-fredric-dannen/1102301782">powerful executives</a> (and sometimes the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/08/archives/moblinked-conduits-get-subpoenas-in-payola-case-u-s-officials.html">literal mafia</a>) manufactured hits by paying for radio play, and, after the practice was first outlawed in 1960, finding loopholes to get around each new restriction. “When publicity is valuable, people will inevitably find ways to pay for it,” says <a href="https://soc.ucla.edu/person/gabriel-rossman/">Gabriel Rossman</a>, a sociologist at UCLA who studies bribery in the music industry. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s no hard evidence to suggest that labels are directly paying Spotify to boost certain artists and songs, according to the music industry scholars and insiders I interviewed. Yet it’s almost impossible to prove that it’s <em>not</em> happening: Deals between record labels and streaming platforms are confidential and algorithms are intentionally designed as black boxes. (Spotify would not agree to an interview, but said in a statement that “The remarkable growth of fan bases for artists like Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan, and Tommy Richman on Spotify is a testament to their hard work and artistry.”)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the most likely explanation is the most boring — that certain songs take off on music discovery algorithms because listeners seem to like them — the question of why users keep getting served Sabrina Carpenter is far more complex than that. No wonder so many of us think something shady is going on, even if we can’t quite put our fingers on what.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Spotify’s algorithm works</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Users tend to refer to a singular, all-powerful Spotify algorithm, but there is no single one that determines what songs are served to its 600 million listeners. Rather each of the platform’s features work differently and have specific (albeit similar) goals. “Smart Shuffle,” for example, queues new songs to a playlist you’ve already made, while the personalized “Discover Weekly” uses an algorithm meant to design a playlist of new songs that are similar to the music you’ve recently listened to. Newer features like <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/spotify-daylist-trend-how-to-find-search-music-rcna134708">daylists</a> and the AI-powered <a href="https://thetacomaledger.com/2024/02/19/my-affair-with-spotifys-ai-dj/">DJ X</a> are also based on users’ “taste profiles.” Search for a specific song and Spotify will typically autoplay music that’s sonically similar to the one you searched for, while <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/FAQs/Spotify-Radio-how-does-it-work/ta-p/4757060#:~:text=Spotify%20Radio%20is%20a%20feature,what%20mood%20you're%20in.">Spotify Radio</a> creates personalized playlists out of any song, album, or artist you choose. </p>

<blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/C52KrcSR5jW/?utm_source=ig_embed&#038;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14"><div> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C52KrcSR5jW/?utm_source=ig_embed&#038;utm_campaign=loading" target="_blank"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div>View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C52KrcSR5jW/?utm_source=ig_embed&#038;utm_campaign=loading" target="_blank">A post shared by Sabrina Carpenter (@sabrinacarpenter)</a></p></div></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many of these features are the subject of mistrust and theorizing among the listening public. The website <a href="https://www.popfiltr.com/articles/all-top-50-artists-on-spotify-have-sabrina-carpenters-please-please-please-at-number-2-on-their-artist-or-song-radios">PopFiltr found</a> that Carpenter’s new single “Please Please Please” took the No. 2 spot on dozens of artists’ Radio playlists. This would make sense for modern pop acts like Harry Styles or Lana Del Rey but less so for, say, Frank Sinatra, Creedence Clearwater Revival, or one playlist based on the artist “Fart Fest,” which publishes literal fart noises. (I wasn’t able to recreate these findings, as they’re algorithmically tailored to each user, but “Please Please Please” was second in Radio playlists for Clairo, Boygenius, Charli XCX, and Dua Lipa, and was almost always followed by a Chappell Roan song and “Espresso.”) </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You’d think all this means that somewhere in the depths of Spotify’s servers, there’s a giant lever that pushes Carpenter’s music out to millions of people at once. But, as Glenn McDonald, the former “data alchemist” at Spotify and founder of the music microgenre catalog <a href="https://everynoise.com/">Every Noise at Once</a>, explains, “None of it is as centralized as you’re imagining — it’s not like there’s a master sticker on the song that causes everybody to promote it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">McDonald, who understands how Spotify works better than perhaps anyone, says that the question shouldn’t be about payola or some other seedy arrangement between Spotify and music labels, but about algorithms: “A lot of things on Spotify are trying to keep you in your comfort zone and play you the right things.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://noahaskin.com/about/">Noah Askin</a>, a computational social scientist who studies the music industry, says that algorithms like Spotify’s typically use collaborative filtering, a concept used by recommendation engines to predict what users want to be served next. The gist is that if User A and User B have overlapping tastes, User A will probably enjoy the other music that User B is listening to.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-text-align-left"><blockquote><p>“It’s not like there’s a master sticker on the song that causes everybody to promote it.”<br><br> —Glenn McDonald</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He also points to the Matthew Effect, or the idea that the already successful will have an easier time becoming more successful. Music recommendation algorithms can make big songs <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/research-into-the-impact-of-streaming-services-algorithms-on-music-consumption/the-impact-of-algorithmically-driven-recommendation-systems-on-music-consumption-and-production-a-literature-review">even bigger at the expense of others</a>. “Once you have a bunch of attention, it’s much easier to get more attention,” Askin says. “When a Beyoncé song comes out, it’s more likely to get played because she’s already more popular … and so the people who don’t listen to her but are into pop music, guess who they’re going to get fed?” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He compares this to the Google and Netflix algorithms, which take an impossibly large slew of content and present it to users in a way that will make them spend as much time as possible on their platforms. The platforms do this by pushing out what’s already proven catchy with people with similar tastes. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Neither Roan nor Carpenter is anywhere near as famous as Beyoncé, but Askin suspects part of the reason they keep showing up on pop fans’ Spotify algorithms is due to a sociological concept called “optimal distinctiveness” that explains many listeners’ tastes. “What we found was that the songs that are pretty similar to what&#8217;s popular but a little bit distinctive are the ones that do best,” he says. “If it all just sounds the same, it gets boring. On the other end of the spectrum, anything that’s too weird, it’s like &#8230; I’m not interested in really pushing my listening horizons that much.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1368430209102841">2009 study</a> on optimal distinctiveness found that young people preferred and identified more with music styles at “intermediate” popularity levels, as opposed to either massively popular or esoteric ones. Spotify’s algorithms likely reflect and strengthen that bias, to its own benefit. “What Spotify cares about [is that] you continue to listen on their platform, that you stay on their platform for as long as possible. And what’s going to do that is providing people with songs that sound like what they like but have some degree of novelty to them,” says Askin.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">McDonald’s assessment of the Spotify algorithm echoes Askin’s: “Especially if [the artist] is slightly less popular and a bit more attuned to what you usually like, then that makes them a better match than someone who’s very popular and crosses genre or audience boundaries.” A Taylor Swift listener, then, would be more likely to get fed “Espresso” or “Good Luck, Babe!” than a Carpenter or Roan listener would get served Swift. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are also less tangible reasons why certain songs appear to be overnight successes when they’re anything but. “Espresso” may sound like a lot of disco-inspired pop these days, but Carpenter’s opening stint on Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour, her buzzy romance with <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24085155/irish-cillian-murphy-paul-mescal-andrew-scott-barry-keoghan">actor Barry Keoghan</a>, and a fun persona as “a proudly flippant ditz who is so much savvier than she seems,” as <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2024/5/14/24155699/sabrina-carpenter-espresso-career-olivia-rodrigo-explained">my colleague described it</a>, all undoubtedly played a part in making the song the sensation it became.&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Chappell Roan, meanwhile, has been publicly trying to “make it” in music for years; she was dropped by her label after her 2020 single flopped — a single that just entered the <a href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/">Billboard Hot 100</a> for the first time. <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/fans-are-hot-to-go-for-chappell-roan-photos-videos-show-crowds-clamoring-for-pops-rising-star-214817320.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJJOZUmzoopBsGHUdRsQbOKP4pWjVdewFP2ooo7vr9fi9ZndwmetklJR-Vo1NwZNF785s-lAC7zylDz8IfIQw6C3GtJPOq3t4DnIt5vd_Wam4vP-SYeMCevmjxjSp5qFaCZ96dYtduZ4SF4DDak-kZssMRf1GWHUav1ZN1AAReic">After scoring a spot</a> on Olivia Rodrigo’s tour earlier this year and an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4WiXKGCJhg">NPR Tiny Desk concert</a>, more fans were exposed to her high-energy, drag-inspired stage performances, drawing <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/17/entertainment/chappell-roan-bonnaroo-2024/index.html">enormous crowds</a> at music festivals this spring. Despite the accusations Roan and Carpenter have <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24114819/industry-plants-music-pop-rap-internet-hottest-conspiracy">faced of being “industry plants”</a> (allegations often marred in sexism), there are clearly other explanations for their recent success beyond literally paying Spotify for it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Even if it’s “payola,” it’s not payola</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If record labels were paying Spotify for streams, it still wouldn’t technically be payola. US laws against payola, or the practice of paying a radio station to play a specific song without disclosing the payment, only apply to public airwaves. Because there is a finite amount of bandwidth for radio, they have to be managed in the public interest, Rossman explains. “The [Federal Communications Commission] gets to tell broadcasters as a condition of their license that they have to follow certain rules.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The internet, on the other hand, is capable of disseminating virtually limitless data, and therefore the payola laws don’t apply. In theory, anyone can build a Spotify competitor and queue up whatever songs they desire (fun dinner party question: you’re the CEO of Spotify, what’s your “Espresso”?). </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Spotify actually <em>does</em> offer a version of pay-for-play that’s theoretically available to any artist who opts in. In 2020, it debuted a feature that allowed recording artists to forfeit 30 percent of streaming profits in order to increase the likelihood that a song will be played during a listening session. The program, called <a href="https://artists.spotify.com/en/discovery-mode">Discovery Mode</a>, was immediately likened to payola <a href="https://www.recordingacademy.com/advocacy/news/does-spotifys-new-discovery-mode-resemble-anti-creator-payola">by the Recording Academy</a> when it launched.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While music managers said they loved the program — <a href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/spotify-discovery-mode-congress-managers/">some said it</a> increased a song’s streams by 200 to 300 percent — three members of Congress slammed Discovery Mode for penalizing up-and-coming artists in an effort to beef up Spotify&#8217;s bottom line, according to a letter <a href="https://variety.com/2022/music/news/congress-spotify-troubling-discovery-mode-policy-1235226722/">obtained by Variety</a>. The program “may set in motion a ‘race to the bottom’ in which artists and labels feel compelled to accept lower royalties as a necessary way to break through an extremely crowded and competitive music environment,” they wrote to Spotify co-founder and CEO Daniel Ek.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The artists using Discovery Mode are likely not the Sabrina Carpenters of the world. In its <a href="https://artists.spotify.com/en/discovery-mode">marketing materials</a>, Spotify highlights the success stories of a handful of smaller acts signed to independent record labels who have used the service. But because of the stigma associated with pay-for-play, it’s understandable that few would be transparent about it. It’s impossible to say for sure how many or which artists use Discovery Mode, however, because Spotify doesn’t label its songs as such.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-text-align-right"><blockquote><p>“Usually, these songs will have an entire team behind it that’s literally social engineering the whole thing.” <br>—George Goodrich</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Major label artists may not need to use Discovery Mode in part because two of the three biggest labels in the world, Universal and Sony, own between 6 and 7 percent of Spotify stock, according to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/news/who-really-owns-spotify-955388/">one 2020 estimate</a>. “Spotify is reliant on the major labels in particular for access to the catalogs of music that are driving its growth. It needs to play to their tune,” one music business scholar <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/music-features/espresso-sabrina-carpenter-spotify-streaming-3757741">told NME</a>. The major labels “have these tier one relationships with people that work at Spotify … and opportunities can come from that.” explains George Goodrich, founder and CEO of <a href="https://playlistpush.com/?">Playlist Push</a>, an agency that allows artists to pay for consideration on top Spotify playlists and in influencers’ TikTok videos. “It’s all just about connections.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, “playlisting” has been another important strategy for marketers since the 2010s. Artists and their teams enlist agencies to submit songs to independent playlist curators ($285 for consideration in 48 playlists, $3,000 for <a href="https://playlistpush.com/pricing">500</a>), who can either choose to include them or not; services like Playlist Push are clear in noting that paying for editorial consideration is no guarantee that a song will end up in a popular playlist. Playlist Push says they have worked with more than 25,000 artists, labels, and managers since 2017. A prime spot in a big playlist can launch an artist’s career: One <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/09/spotify-rapcaviar-most-influential-playlist-in-music.html">record exec compared</a> the Spotify editorial playlist RapCaviar to “Hot 97 in the early ’90s,” helping to blow up songs like Cardi B’s 2017 breakout “Bodak Yellow” and Lil Uzi Vert’s “XO TOUR Llif3.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One illicit way music marketers have paid for artificial boosts: stream farming. In 2021, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/digital-marketing-streaming-manipulation-1138529/">Rolling Stone investigated</a> the pay-for-play “black market” where third-party companies promise to net hundreds of millions of streams per month, typically via bot accounts, for a certain network of artists. “There are a few third-party companies out there running this for a lot of the major companies,” one anonymous record label employee told the magazine. “We use them too for some of our artists.” It’s risky business, though. Spotify penalizes artists whose songs have been found to be targets of artificial streams, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/music/news/spotify-artists-streaming-fraud-1235965379/">even in cases where</a> the artist or label wasn’t involved in the scheme. “It’s really terrible for your data profile on Spotify,” says Goodrich. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@the615house/video/7348577086778477867" data-video-id="7348577086778477867" data-embed-from="oembed"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@the615house" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@the615house?refer=embed">@the615house</a> <p>Uhhh are we getting some posty and wallen?! 🤫 <a title="country" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/country?refer=embed">#country</a> <a title="newmusic" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/newmusic?refer=embed">#newmusic</a> </p> <a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - The 615 House" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7348577221956635435?refer=embed">♬ original sound &#8211; The 615 House</a> </section> </blockquote> 
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Without resorting to stream-farming or some other hidden algorithmic boost, music marketers have gotten far savvier at predicting what will hit with listeners. What seems like sudden ubiquity for a song or artist is often extremely canny strategizing by well-connected industry insiders who are adept at responding to online chatter and listening habits. “People will tease songs for weeks, if not months, where the audio is already on short-form platforms but not commercially available on streaming services yet. People also test singles that way to see if their feelings on songs are right,” says Jenny Kaufman, the head of global streaming promotion at Crush Music. Post Malone and Morgan Wallen <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/morgan-wallen-post-malone-song-i-had-some-help-1234934967/">teased their song</a> “I Had Some Help” on social media for months before it was released in May; it was recently the No. 1 song on the Billboard charts (though now second to “Please Please Please.”) “We’re seeing more and more artists drop full albums, we’re seeing more and more artists do less lead-in singles. That in part is due to the interest in seeing which songs fans will react to.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On TikTok, which wields <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1m-KgEpoow">enormous influence</a> on the music industry, labels will often partner with talent agencies to pay influencers to use their music in videos. Goodrich points to the success of “Million Dollar Baby,” which Richman <a href="https://www.complex.com/music/a/eric-skelton/tommy-richman-million-dollar-baby-hit">teased on TikTok</a> in April and which blew up on the platform immediately. He guesses it capitalized on the savviness and connections of manager Ty Baisden, and artist and agency founder Brent Faiyaz. “Usually, these songs will have an entire team behind it that’s literally social engineering the whole thing,” says Goodrich. “They have extremely creative people who are thinking about how they can make the song take off, and they’re usually pretty good at it. And they’ve figured out some type of formula that no one else has.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why people are inclined to believe a Spotify conspiracy theory&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Considering all the unseen, mysterious ways that algorithms function and music marketers do their work, it’s almost easier to think that everything we’re hearing on streaming platforms amounts to straightforward payola. Perhaps it’s not a coincidence that Phillips-Horst’s tweet expresses a bit of ironic nostalgia for the days when payola was a reasonable explanation for a song’s popularity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">True, other kinds of pay-for-play transactions could very well be happening — again, those contracts are confidential, and none of the record labels I reached out to responded to my request for comment — but it wouldn’t fall under the FCC’s payola law. Though experts on algorithms disagree, Rossman says he could still envision labels paying the platform to promote certain songs. “It seems plausible,” Rossman says. “And I would expect it to happen.”&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@tommyrichman/video/7357455205916757294" data-video-id="7357455205916757294" data-embed-from="oembed"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@tommyrichman" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tommyrichman?refer=embed">@tommyrichman</a> <p>Million dollar baby </p> <a target="_blank" title="♬ Million dollar baby - Tommy Richman" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/Million-dollar-baby-7357455282735909675?refer=embed">♬ Million dollar baby &#8211; Tommy Richman</a> </section> </blockquote> 
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rossman suggests that such agreements should fall under the Federal Trade Commission’s laws that require influencers to disclose advertisements. If Spotify “wanted to be safe, all they’d have to do is include something in the metatext saying, ‘This artist opted into the Discovery Mode program,’” he says. “Or, ‘You got this certain song because it has these attributes and we provide this weight to those attributes.’ They’re doing that internally somewhere on the Spotify servers, they’re just not sending it to the user.” (An FTC spokesperson told me it does not comment on specific companies unless it has publicly announced an action against them.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The only reason we’re having this conversation at all is because Spotify and other streaming platforms intentionally obscure how they work. “As a listener, I wish I could tell on any given song, ‘Why is this here? Why should I trust you?’” says McDonald. But crucially, he says, “To me, this is not a Spotify-specific problem, not a music-specific problem. It’s everything about how technology mediates human interaction, if it goes through these black boxes of machine learning or AI. You’re just left [asking] ‘Here&#8217;s the answer, how do I trust it?’ … I think that&#8217;s a bad state, that we as people who work on technology have to improve.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2023, Spotify <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/04/tech/spotify-layoffs-third-round/index.html">laid off</a> around 2,200 workers, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/12/every-noise-shut-down-spotify-layoffs/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJRvvHvdZxbpve1UomQXrJfI77lWQyaOFDoItfV5qafCBO_ej37OFBFSJX6mRZgULl03c-kFYmJw11_MZmMzCx1ddoeYeKbDmC1udHhC-_AGi4I0W4sG-iqv1Pc55_aTadELys_Mjb3dmNL3NtOFyekUHo74M2oSFg_m2aulx1_k">including McDonald</a>. Its efforts of late have centered around launching new AI features, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/8/24124070/spotify-ai-playlist-music-beta-launch-premium-uk-australia">one</a> in which users can prompt an AI tool to create a playlist based on a few words. Pricing for the service <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/spotify-price-hike-premium-plans-2024-1235913620/">rose again this June,</a> with individual plans going up $1 per month, up to $11.99. The result will no doubt be more anxiety and confusion among its listeners, who will continue to wonder why its algorithms have so much power over the soundtrack to their lives, or whether it’s even an algorithm at all.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“People should demand transparency and control over their own experience,” McDonald adds. “Algorithms are tools, but many times these tools are only operated by the people who run the streaming platform, the search engine, or the shopping site. To the extent that those tools can be given to you, the person, to empower yourself and to amplify your curiosity &#8230; that’s more interesting to me than things that just ask you, ‘Hold still, and we’ll discover something for you.’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For now, the summer of Spotify conspiracy theories rages on, while the internet debates which artists are industry plants and which labels are doing payola, even if — and in fact, because — we can’t quite grasp who or how. “And the grammy for the best autoplay song of the year goes to,” wrote <a href="https://x.com/_dakshin_43/status/1802553045886419262?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1802553045886419262%7Ctwgr%5E39c5986fcc6debc385d74f120f299d508548ffa1%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fthetab.com%2Fuk%2F2024%2F06%2F17%2Fdoes-sabrina-carpenter-always-autoplay-after-any-song-on-spotify-an-investigation-370252">one person on X</a>, “our payola queen Sabrina Carpenter.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For a fractious coalition that at times seems to be held together with spit, baling wire, and old memories of Barack Obama, the Democratic Party has a remarkably singular message: Donald Trump is an existential threat to the country.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the Biden campaign, the existential threat to democracy has become the overriding theme in his bid for reelection. “There is one existential threat: It’s Donald Trump,” Biden <a href="https://rollcall.com/2024/03/04/one-existential-threat-in-shift-biden-gives-trump-a-tongue-lashing/">said</a> at a fundraiser in February.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the environmental activists in the party, climate change is the existential concern, and a Trump victory would be devastating for the planet, as Biden himself <a href="https://norfolkdailynews.com/news/a-halting-biden-sparks-democratic-anxiety-about-his-candidacy/article_fa12172e-355a-11ef-8d78-979198cd5876.html">argued</a> at Thursday’s debate: “The only existential threat to humanity is climate change, and [Trump] didn’t do a damn thing about it.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Reproductive rights, too, are cast in existential terms. “Trump poses an existential threat to abortion rights in Pennsylvania,” Democratic US Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/democrats-reproductive-rights-biden-campaign-bucks-county/">said</a> at a press conference in April. “If given the chance, he will ban abortion across the country with or without Congress.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Existential math</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As it happens, I know a little bit about existential threats, having <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/bryan-walsh/end-times/9780316449601/?lens=hachette-books">written a book in 2019</a> on the subject. <a href="https://www.existentialriskobservatory.org/risks/">It refers to those threats</a> that could conceivably risk the extinction or widespread destruction of humanity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The real way to tell the difference between an existential threat and a more ordinary one is not what people warning say, it’s what they do. Existential threats demand existential responses. After all, if you conceivably felt the country and perhaps even the world were truly at risk, you’d presumably do everything you could to prevent that catastrophe. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When it comes to the Democrats and the left — from the Biden campaign on down to the activists — it is impossible to look at what they’re doing and conclude that they truly believe Donald Trump is an existential threat. And that may pose an existential challenge to the party.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Winning is the only thing</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden entered Thursday night’s debate clearly losing, and it’s safe to say that afterward, very few people — outside perhaps Biden’s inner circle — think the president is positioned to win this election. The debate spotlighted the one issue that voters have repeatedly told pollsters is a serious problem, the one issue Biden can do almost nothing to change: his age. And rather than seizing a rare opportunity to disprove those fears, Biden’s halting, often disoriented performance did the opposite. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cue the Democratic panic and an entire New York Times editorial board worth of columnists urging Biden to step aside. The campaign instantly said, as it has said every time these calls have been made, that the president would do no such thing, and at this point there’s little reason not to believe them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of this is risk aversion: A president has never called off a reelection bid this late in the campaign, and no one really knows what would come next. Some of it is presumably pride. Biden is a proud man who was on his third try for the presidency when he finally won in 2020. Giving up is not really in his DNA. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of it is political calculation. If the president steps aside, the logical candidate is Vice-President Kamala Harris, but Harris has struggled in office and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/12/kamala-harris-favorability-poll-00162093">her poor poll ratings</a> mirror those of Biden. If the Democratic Party tries to sideline Harris and open the door to other candidates through an open convention, they risk alienating her and her supporters and opening up further wounds in the Democratic coalition. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bad choices, all. But the nature of an existential threat is that everything else — feelings, ambition, everything — is put aside. Yet even as the chance of a second Trump presidency rises by the day, the Democratic political establishment does nothing. That’s not how you act in the face of an existential threat.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/gettyimages-2158937115.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="US President Joe Biden during the first presidential debate with former US President Donald Trump, not pictured, in Atlanta, Georgia, US, on Thursday, June 27, 2024. | Eva Marie Uzcategui/Bloomberg via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Eva Marie Uzcategui/Bloomberg via Getty Images" />
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Existential until it isn’t</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not just politicians, though. The winners of presidential elections pick Supreme Court justices, and it was obvious that a then-83-year-old Ruth Bader Ginsburg might not make it through the next presidential term after the 2016 election, potentially imperiling abortion rights, among other Democratic priorities. Yet Ginsburg — buoyed by a number of Democratic supporters who viewed calls for her retirement as sexist — refused to step down. We all know what happened later. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One would think that sitting Democratic justices would have learned from Ginsburg’s example and acted differently in the face of a new supposedly existential threat from Trump. Yet Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan — who are 70 and 64, respectively — have so far refused to heed <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/354381/supreme-court-sotomayor-kagan-retire-now">increasingly desperate calls</a> from writers like my colleague Ian Milhiser to step down and lock in their seats for decades. Each has perfectly good reasons to stay on, as did Ginsburg; none of those reasons make sense in the face of a true existential threat.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nowhere is the gap between existential rhetoric and existential action greater than in climate change, which has emerged in recent years as one of the top priorities for Democrats. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can’t find a climate activist — and, increasingly, a Democratic politician — who doesn’t frame climate change as an existential issue. With reason — the worst-case climate scenarios really do <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/segments/why-its-so-important-study-climate-worst-case-on-the-media">represent something like an existential threat</a> to the future of not just the US, but the entire world. And given Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/26/climate/climate-policies-trump-would-reverse.html">determined opposition to actual climate policy</a>, it’s fair to view his potential return to the White House as a part of that threat. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet there <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerpielke/2019/09/19/the-yawning-gap-between-climate-rhetoric-and-climate-action/">is a clear and yawning gap</a> between climate rhetoric and climate action. On the Democratic political side, that’s perhaps understandable; climate change is <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/08/09/what-the-data-says-about-americans-views-of-climate-change/">not a top priority</a> for most voters, and politicians have to grapple with that fact. (You can’t save the Earth if you don’t have the votes.) </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Too often, though, climate activists and groups <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/04/06/environmentalists-climate-clean-energy-regulation/">end up opposing</a> many of the new energy projects that are needed to actually decarbonize energy, from transmission lines to solar projects to wind power, often tying them up in years of litigation. The Sunrise Movement, one of the most radical climate activist groups out there, has <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/06/04/scoop-group-that-aided-climate-plan-wont-back-biden?utm_campaign=editorial&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">bafflingly withheld its endorsemen</a>t from Biden so far, even though he prioritized passage of the most ambitious climate bill in US history. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The groups have reasons for what they’re doing — there are always reasons — but if climate change were treated as the existential threat the loudest activists say it is, those reasons wouldn’t matter.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do you believe what you say?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Treating an existential threat as existential requires the one thing that the Democratic coalition has increasingly struggled to do: prioritization. It means putting aside personal feelings, individual ambition, and subjective preferences in favor of a single goal: success. Otherwise, it’s just empty rhetoric.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As New York Times<em> </em>columnist Ezra Klein, who has been pushing the possibility of an open convention to replace Biden, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-presidential-debate.html">said on his podcast after Thursday’s debate</a>: “If the fate of American democracy is hinging on this election — as Democrats are always telling me it is and as I think there is a chance that it is — then you should do everything you can to win it.” That a strategy, any strategy, might make people or groups uncomfortable cannot be a reason not to pursue it in the face of an existential threat. Not if you believe what you’re saying.   </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What is “maternal mortality”?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The dry, clinical term obscures a devastating loss: A person dies as a result of bringing a child into the world. That child loses a parent; a household is plunged into grief; a family that should be celebrating is left to mourn. Pretty much everyone can agree that such deaths are tragic and that even one is too many. What experts don’t agree on is how to count them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For years, researchers have been warning the public that maternal deaths in America were rising, more than doubling between the 2000s and 2010s, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That spike, shocking for one of the wealthiest countries in the world, drew concern from health professionals and policymakers alike, with <a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/community/adults/women/task_force_maternal_mortality/">many</a> <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2018.0463">states</a> and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/08/08/maternal-mortality-biden/">federal government</a> establishing task forces to make birth safer. Last year, for example, the Department of Health and Human Services <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/about/news/press-releases/hrsa-address-maternal-health-crisis">announced $90 million in awards</a> to fight maternal mortality.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024/3/16/24102224/maternal-mortality-rate-study-united-states">some scholars</a> are arguing that the CDC’s methods have become too broad in recent years and capture deaths that aren’t related to pregnancy. Others, meanwhile, say the CDC numbers remain the best way to capture a complicated picture, in which underlying conditions can combine with poor prenatal and postpartum care to cause preventable illness and death. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This debate is about more than just numbers. It has thrown into question two decades of policies and practices around childbirth and its risks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Is the maternal mortality crisis referenced repeatedly in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/16/opinion/reduce-maternal-mortality-strategies.html">American</a> media <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-maternal-mortality-hits-highest-level-since-1965-f9829776">outlets</a> (including <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/24092448/black-mothers-maternal-mortality-crisis-solutions">Vox</a>) overblown? And if so, are the initiatives meant to fix the problem — and the many other efforts experts and advocacy groups have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/16/opinion/reduce-maternal-mortality-strategies.html">long recommended</a> — still necessary? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Answering these questions will determine how we think and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/05/no-more-women-arent-dying-in-childbirth/678486/">talk about pregnancy and childbirth</a>, and how the US cares for people at an incredibly vulnerable time in their lives.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What the CDC says about maternal deaths</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Maternal deaths in the US are counted in a few different ways, including analysis by <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/maternal-mortality/php/mmrc/index.html">state and local committees</a>. But the topline national numbers that get the most attention come from the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. According to the agency, maternal mortality is a serious problem in America, one that’s only grown over the past two decades.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2022, the most recent year for which data are available, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2022/maternal-mortality-rates-2022.pdf">the agency reported</a> that 817 women died during or soon after pregnancy from causes “related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management.” Maternal mortality is often expressed as a ratio of maternal deaths to live births: For 2022, that ratio was 22.3 deaths per 100,000 births. That was less than in 2021, when the rate was 32.9 per 100,000, but still a marked increase from 2003, when the rate was 12.1 per 100,000.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also much higher than rates around the world. A recent <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2024/jun/insights-us-maternal-mortality-crisis-international-comparison">study by the Commonwealth Fund</a>, a foundation focused on health care access, found the US had the highest maternal mortality rate of any wealthy country. For comparison, Canada had 8.4 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 2022, Japan had 3.4, and Switzerland had just 1.2.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The CDC has also found severe inequities within the US — in 2022, the mortality rate for Black women was 49.5 deaths per 100,000 births, more than twice the rate for white women — and the agency reports that more than 80 percent of pregnancy-related deaths in the US <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthequity/features/maternal-mortality/index.html">are preventable</a>, based on analysis by teams of OB-GYNs, midwives, and other experts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The criticisms of the CDC’s measurement stem from a change in the way the agency counts maternal deaths. Until the 1990s, countries typically counted a death as maternal if pregnancy or a related condition was listed as the “underlying cause of death” on a death certificate, according to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/rise-us-maternal-mortality-rates-measurement">an analysis published in May by Saloni Dattani at Our World in Data</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But this approach missed many deaths in which pregnancy or childbirth exacerbated an underlying condition, like AIDS or cardiovascular disease. Officials with the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), a system used around the world for classifying death and illness, came to the conclusion that maternal deaths were being undercounted, and in 1994, they recommended that countries add a “pregnancy checkbox” to death certificates to signify whether the deceased had been pregnant or had recently given birth. This would help analysts determine if pregnancy contributed to a death.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">US states began adding the checkbox to their death certificates in 2003; by 2017, all had done so. Over this period, nationwide maternal mortality also rose significantly, from 12.1 deaths per 100,000 in 2003 to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2020/202001_MMR.htm">17.4 per 100,000 in 2018</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, some experts are taking a closer look at the checkbox and the effect it has had on how we understand childbirth in America. They have two separate but related criticisms. Let’s break them down.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Some critics argue that the maternal mortality rate isn’t really rising</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dattani, a researcher who specializes in global health, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/rise-us-maternal-mortality-rates-measurement">writes that</a> in order to prevent maternal deaths, “it’s crucial to have accurate data.” To that end, her May analysis at Our World in Data explains research first conducted by <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_03/sr03_044-508.pdf">the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics</a> (NCHS) in 2020, adding background and context. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dattani concludes that the increase in maternal deaths between 2003 and 2017 — the period when states were adding the pregnancy checkbox to their death certificates — can be attributed largely, or maybe even entirely, to the addition of the box. That is, pregnancy didn’t get more dangerous during that time period, officials just got better at measuring the deaths connected to it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This conclusion is a big deal because a lot of <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/07/04/1185904749/u-s-maternal-deaths-keep-rising-heres-who-is-most-at-risk">recent</a> <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-maternal-mortality-rates-are-getting-worse-across-the-u-s/">coverage</a> of maternal mortality has been based on the notion that rates are skyrocketing. If that narrative is false, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/05/no-more-women-arent-dying-in-childbirth/678486/">some argue</a>, such coverage risks baselessly frightening people who are considering having kids.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In this case, the critics are right, to a point. Most experts agree with Dattani’s conclusion. The CDC’s research “shows that observed increases in nationwide maternal mortality rates between 2003 and 2017 were largely due to the implementation of the checkbox, which increased identification of maternal deaths,” a spokesperson told Vox in a statement. The CDC has been open about that fact since at least <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2020/202001_MMR.htm">2020</a>, but the issue of the checkbox received little public attention until now.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, the number of maternal deaths also continued to rise after 2017, when all states had adopted the checkbox. Some of the rise after 2020, Dattani and <a href="https://parentdata.org/revisiting-cdcs-maternal-mortality-data/">others</a> say, may be due to Covid, which was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/16/health/covid-pregnancy-protection.html">especially dangerous for pregnant people</a>, particularly before the arrival of vaccines. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The bottom line is that the pregnancy checkbox probably explains a lot of the increase in reported maternal mortality over the past several decades, but not all of it. Meanwhile, there’s another big point of contention around the checkbox and its impact.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Other researchers say the CDC overcounts maternal deaths</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The addition of the pregnancy checkbox has led the CDC to classify deaths as related to pregnancy when they really aren’t, contends a research team led by K.S. Joseph, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of British Columbia. For example, pregnant women who die of cancer can be classified as cases of maternal mortality, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024/3/16/24102224/maternal-mortality-rate-study-united-states">the researchers argued</a> in <a href="https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(24)00005-X/fulltext">a paper</a> published in March in the <em>American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology</em>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Using a more conservative methodology, the researchers calculated a maternal mortality rate of 10.4 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2018-2021, compared to the 23.6 per 100,000 reported by the CDC for that timeframe.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Critics of the CDC numbers are not advocating for pulling resources away from maternal health initiatives. Women’s reproductive health in general <a href="https://www.vox.com/health/23744536/fibroids-black-women-chemicals-phthalates-hair-relaxers-stress-diet-vitamin-d">remains</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/23715434/baby-pregnancy-labor-due-date-premature-birth">underfunded</a>, and money set aside to combat maternal mortality is often a drop in the bucket of state and federal budgets. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, some scholars and advocates are concerned that criticism of the CDC’s count could lead to maternal health work being deprioritized. “It would be an unfortunate setback to see all the hard work of health care professionals, policy makers, patient advocates, and other stakeholders be undermined by this publication,” Christopher Zahn, interim CEO of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, wrote in <a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2024/03/despite-new-manuscript-incontrovertible-evidence-proves-unacceptably-high-us-maternal-mortality-rate">response</a> to the research by Joseph and his team.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The CDC also strongly disputes that research, arguing that the methodology used by Joseph and his team would significantly undercount maternal deaths. A pregnant woman who dies of cancer is actually an example of maternal mortality if she has to pause her chemotherapy during pregnancy and her cancer advances as a result, the CDC spokesperson told Vox.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Without the checkbox system, the spokesperson said, many deaths would simply be missed: “Capturing these otherwise unrecorded maternal deaths is critical to understanding the scope of maternal mortality in the United States and taking effective public health action to prevent these deaths.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Others also agree that capturing deaths from underlying conditions that may be worsened by pregnancy is crucial for public health. “We know that poor health entering into pregnancy can lead to mortality postpartum in the ‘fourth trimester,’” Louise King, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology at Harvard University, told Vox in an email. “Shouldn&#8217;t we want to classify the death of a pregnant person with hypertension as a maternal death? So that we can address what might be the underlying cause of this — lack of preventative health care, lack of appropriate postpartum care given current insurance coverage in [the] US?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And many scholars, including Dattani, agree that the introduction of the checkbox has led to better data, not worse. “My view is not that this is overestimating,” she told Vox. “In fact, it&#8217;s identifying maternal deaths that had been missed in the past.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So, is there a maternal mortality crisis in the US?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even if the CDC data isn’t perfect, many scholars agree that far too many people are dying during and after childbirth in the United States.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We have many sources of information about maternal mortality, said Laurie Zephyrin, a senior vice president for advancing health equity at the Commonwealth Fund. The CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics releases the numbers that have been most debated recently, but the agency also has a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/maternal-mortality/php/pregnancy-mortality-surveillance/index.html">Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System</a> that employs medical epidemiologists to comb through death records from pregnancy up to a year after birth. Meanwhile, state and local <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/maternal-mortality/php/mmrc/index.html">maternal mortality review committees</a> also independently investigate maternal deaths. “All three of these ways of collecting data are showing that we have a problem in this country,” Zephyrin said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We can also understand US maternal health better by putting it an international context. Comparing maternal mortality across countries can be complex, for some of the same reasons it’s complicated to count maternal deaths within the US. Some countries use a pregnancy checkbox like the one added in the US while others do not, leading to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/rise-us-maternal-mortality-rates-measurement">concerns</a> that other nations may be underreporting maternal deaths, making the US <a href="https://www.governing.com/management-and-administration/no-the-maternal-mortality-rate-is-not-rising">look worse</a> by comparison.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, we know that the US lags behind other countries when it comes to policies proven to improve maternal (and overall) health. Among wealthy countries, the US is the only one without universal health care, said Munira Gunja, a senior researcher with the Commonwealth Fund’s International Program in Health Policy and Practice Innovations. It&#8217;s also the only one without federally mandated paid parental leave, and it&#8217;s the only country that doesn’t provide home visits and other comprehensive postpartum care, instead often limiting birthing people to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2020/07/14/many-new-moms-are-cleared-six-weeks-after-birth-postpartum-period-isnt-over/">a lone doctor’s appointment</a> six weeks after birth. “The US is a clear outlier, particularly when it comes to postpartum support,” Gunja said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, everyone involved in the debate over counting maternal deaths agrees that Black birthing people are dying at a disproportionately high rate. That disparity shows up whether you use the CDC’s method or Joseph’s, and it’s indicative of bigger problems within the US health care system, experts say. Black Americans in general have <a href="https://www.kff.org/racial-equity-and-health-policy/issue-brief/what-is-driving-widening-racial-disparities-in-life-expectancy/">a lower life expectancy</a> than white Americans, and Black babies are <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/death-rates-among-black-people-in-the-u-s-are-rising-after-falling/">more likely to be stillborn</a> or die in infancy. “This is across the board, not just in maternal health,” said Angela D. Aina, co-founder and executive director of the <a href="https://blackmamasmatter.org/">Black Mamas Matter Alliance</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some have argued that the language of “crisis” is unproductive, frightening pregnant people and prospective parents and clouding the search for solutions. “The constant drumbeat that maternal mortality is ‘<a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/05/12/527806002/focus-on-infants-during-childbirth-leaves-u-s-moms-in-danger">commonplace</a>’ and that pregnancy is ‘<a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/amr51/007/2010/en/">deadly</a>’ doesn’t empower me with information to make my own decisions,” Jerusalem Demsas writes at <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/05/no-more-women-arent-dying-in-childbirth/678486/">the Atlantic</a>. “It just stresses me out.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Reasonable people can disagree over what constitutes a crisis and over the best way to measure how often Americans experience the tragic situation in which a person who is already sick dies from their illness after giving birth. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But experts do not disagree on the basic premise that too many pregnant and birthing people are dying in America, that many of their deaths are preventable, and that we already know some of the reforms — from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7367791/">paid leave</a> to <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/24092448/black-mothers-maternal-mortality-crisis-solutions">better prenatal and postpartum care</a> — that would save their lives.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 1955, the philosopher Charles Frankel was troubled. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/11/archives/charles-frankel-resigned-a-post-under-johnson-he-left-state.html">committed civil libertarian</a>, he had come to believe that the prevailing winds of public life had turned against his beloved liberalism. He wrote a book, <a href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/a/charles-frankel-2/the-case-for-modern-man/"><em>The Case for Modern Man</em></a>, defending it from critics on the left and right alike.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">His concluding chapter, titled “The Revolution of Modernity,” argued that liberalism had succeeded on a more fundamental level than most appreciated. Liberal modernity has not only been the era of technological progress and rapid economic growth, but also “a moral revolution of extraordinary scope, a radical alteration in what the human imagination is prepared to envisage and demand.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One contemporary reviewer <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2022641">urged Frankel to expand on these concluding remarks at book length</a> — to explain how this moral revolution worked and how it would shape our world. But Frankel never did. In fairness, he was quite busy: He left his post at Columbia University to join the State Department, only to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/11/archives/charles-frankel-resigned-a-post-under-johnson-he-left-state.html">quit in 1967 in protest of the Vietnam War</a>. He spent the rest of his shortened life advocating for civil liberties and the humanities, murdered in 1979 during a robbery at his New York home.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Frankel lived just long enough to see his optimism vindicated by events. The rise of the civil rights movement, feminism, and LGBT activism proved that liberalism had indeed altered the kinds of moral equality that Americans were prepared to demand. Liberalism’s central idea, that society should allow all people to live their lives as free and equal citizens, had never come closer to reality in all of human history.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Our moment, like Frankel’s, is a seemingly dire time for liberalism: a moment where it faces an extinction-level threat from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reactionary-Spirit-Insidious-Political-Tradition/dp/154170441X/">the rise of authoritarian movements</a> inside its historical bastions. Intellectuals are once again <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/9/20750160/liberalism-trump-putin-socialism-reactionary">predicting liberalism’s imminent doom</a>. Is there any hope that they are as wrong as the obituaries penned during Frankel’s time?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The answer, I believe is yes. To understand why, we should turn to a new book that finally delivers on the promise of Frankel’s concluding chapter&nbsp;— and, in the process, helps us understand what a future liberal revival might look.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Our liberal soul</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Liberalism as a Way of Life</em>, by Canadian political theorist Alexandre Lefebvre, is an unusual work of philosophy — pairing exposition of John Rawls’ theory of moral psychology with analyses of <em>The Good Place</em> and headlines in <em>The Onion</em>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The goal is to illustrate something Lefebvre believes has been lost: the idea that liberalism is not merely a political philosophy, but rather a set of implicitly shared values and norms that define social life in advanced democratic societies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Written into our foundational institutions, and underlying so much of the culture we daily live and breathe, liberalism has seeped into our pores so as to profoundly and personally shape who we are,” Lefebvre writes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Think about what you believe about the world, on a really elementary level. Does it start with the idea that all people deserve to be treated equally? That no one person is fundamentally better than any other? That each person should be free to live life in the way that they want, and still be treated with kindness and respect?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These, Lefebvre argues, are liberal beliefs — ones that have spread only recently and to only some parts of the world. But in those parts, these liberal values are so widely and commonly accepted that most people consider them nothing more than common sense. We are liberals and we don’t even know it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of Lefebvre’s most vivid illustrations is his discussion of English-language swear words.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It used to be that the worst curses focused on hygiene, religion, and sexual morality. But words like “shit,” “fuck,” and “damn” have lost their sting, now considered more impolite than offensive. We print them in Vox without much pushback from either readers or editors. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The words that actually cause offense nowadays are slurs — especially ones that target minorities and marginalized groups. These are the words that truly shock people today, language that could blow up a dinner party or give cause for a hostile workplace lawsuit. I can’t imagine a circumstance in which I would publish an article with uncensored versions of them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Lefebvre, this shift in linguistic norms reflects a deeper moral regime change.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Swear words derive their power from transgression, a kind of verbal shorthand that communicates disregard for prevailing social norms. The classic four-letter words transgressed against Victorian ideals of sexual morality and purity; their declining power represents the declining hold of those ideas on our collective morality. Slurs have taken their place because they transgress against liberalism — specifically, the liberal idea that all humans deserve equal respect regardless of their identity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“A slur is a missile aimed at self-respect. It diminishes a person’s value, dismisses their goals, and undermines their confidence,” he writes. “If you condemn slurs no matter who they are aimed at … and if you are provoked by them in a way no other word has the power to do, then you are liberal in at least this respect.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The slurs example, and many others, illustrate how liberalism has become more than a political doctrine about rights and democracy: It is, in liberal countries, the invisible source of many of our most basic ways of living. Liberal ideas shape the way we think about everything from government to religion to sports to friendship. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is, as Lefebvre writes, “the water in which we swim:” as omnipresent and taken-for-granted as the ocean is for its fish.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Liberalism versus “liberaldom”</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lefebvre’s analysis raises an obvious question. If liberal ideas about equality and freedom are so dominant in places like the United States, how come our country is so unequal and unfree?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To explain the gap, Lefebvre borrows a concept from the 19th-century Christian philosopher Søren Kierkegaard. For Kierkegaard, true Christianity was a radical moral doctrine that preached total devotion to others and the renunciation of worldly pleasures. This was, of course, at odds with the way nominally Christian societies — including their churches — <a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/10283/chapter-abstract/158011027?redirectedFrom=fulltext">operated at the time</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thus, Kierkegaard distinguished between Christianity, on the one hand, and “Christendom” on the other. In Christendom, church leaders said the right things and performed the right rituals, but flagrantly violated Christian ethics in their actual lives. In Christendom, Kierkegaard wrote, the pastor is “a royal office holder, advancing steadily, making a career—and now he dramatically plays at Christianity, in short, he is performing comedy.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, Lefebvre argues, we are living in liberaldom — a liberalism as compromised, infected and diluted by other forces as Christianity was in Kierkegaard’s time. “Liberaldom, we could say, is the craven capitulation to unliberal values that threaten to destroy your and my spirit,” he writes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lefebvre doesn’t offer a macro-solution to the problem of liberaldom. His task isn’t to theorize about politics traditionally conceived, like mass movements and elections. Instead, he aspires to write something like self-help: instructing liberals on how they can live a good life even when faced with the reality of liberaldom, detailing a list of “spiritual exercises” that can help us be more authentic liberals.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Liberaldom is not something ‘out there’ in the world but rather anchored in a pattern of wants, aspirations, and habits built up over a lifetime. Unlearning it takes work and effort,” he writes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a novel idea (most of Lefebvre’s ideas are). But it also can feel a bit unsatisfying at a moment of liberal crisis. The New Yorker’s Adam Gopnik, for example, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/05/27/why-liberals-struggle-to-defend-liberalism">writes that Lefebvre’s idea of spiritual exercise</a> “seems scarcely more likely to get us through 2024 than smoking weed all day.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Surely that’s an unfair standard. But it’s also a misunderstanding of Lefebvre’s project. His aim is not merely to help liberals be happier or calmer, but to rescue them from liberaldom. His goal is for readers to think through where their values and lives conflict, and figure out how to bring them in line. It is to create ways for people to confront the contradictions inherent to their lives and, ultimately, to resolve them in favor of their values.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Toppling liberaldom</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The clearest pathway forward can be found in Lefebvre’s treatment of “reflective equilibrium,” a tool of moral reasoning developed by Lefebvre’s intellectual hero (and mine): John Rawls. The greatest liberal philosopher of the 20th century, Rawls is best known for his book <em>A Theory of Justice </em>— which almost single-handedly revived political philosophy in the Anglophone world.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Reflective equilibrium” is one of Rawls’ less well-known concepts (at least outside of academic philosophy). It is a deliberate process where people start with a basic thing they believe to be true, draw out its implications, and see whether there are any contradictions that must be resolved. You repeat this process until you’re satisfied that everything is consistent — in equilibrium, so to speak.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Take an example: thinking through the morality of killing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you start from the premise that killing is always wrong, you’re quickly led to the conclusion that killing in self-defense is also wrong. But most people don’t think that it seems like if someone is trying to murder you, you should be able to fight back. Therefore, upon reflection, you should probably modify the original principle: instead of saying that killing is always wrong, you probably want to say that killing is <em>almost</em> always wrong. You keep testing and probing, figuring out what conditions should count as exceptions to the “no killing” rule. When you think you’re done, and that all your beliefs about killing are consistent, you’ve arrived at reflective equilibrium.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Lefebvre, reflective equilibrium can be a means of testing whether our lives actually live up to our liberal values —&nbsp;and for refining our beliefs, and even everyday practices, to better fit with what we profess.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The person who achieves such an equilibrium will be less susceptible to hypocrisy,” he says. “They will have brought their ideas, feelings, principles, and desires into alignment. Fluency and candor, grace and self-command, will be theirs.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If he is right — and I believe he is — then the implications are not merely individual. If human beings are creatures who can reflect on our ideas and, when confronted with contradiction, believe that we need to change, then that creates a potential pathway for broader <em>social</em> change. Even in liberaldom, many people genuinely believe in liberal ideas; they get angry when they’re flouted by the state and its agents. Under such circumstances, identifying a gap between liberal belief and liberaldom’s reality can be a potentially radical act.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the United States, this is the history of successful movements for social change. In his famous address “<a href="https://loveman.sdsu.edu/docs/1852FrederickDouglass.pdf">What to the Slave is the Fourth of July</a>,” abolitionist Frederick Douglass made the contradictions between the liberalism of America’s founding and the liberaldom of the slaveholding South a central theme.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Would you have me argue that man is entitled to liberty? That he is the rightful owner of his own body? You have already declared it,” Douglass said. “For revolting barbarity and shameless hypocrisy, America reigns without a rival.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But “notwithstanding the dark picture I have this day presented, I do not despair of this country,” he added. “There are forces in operation, which must inevitably work the downfall of slavery.” No modern society, in Douglass’ view, could long survive the ruinous tension between slavery and freedom. Eventually, something had to give —&nbsp;and Douglass was convinced that, given the “obvious tendencies of the age,” liberalism would win out over liberaldom.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, he was right: The rising popularity of the abolitionist cause led to Abraham Lincoln’s election. While the motivating power of America’s liberal ideas was hardly the <em>only</em> reason for slavery’s doom, it was a vital one.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This holds true in the grand contest for liberalism today. In my own forthcoming book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reactionary-Spirit-Insidious-Political-Tradition-ebook/dp/B0CMQB8S94"><em>The Reactionary Spirit</em></a>, I argue that elected authoritarians —&nbsp;like Donald Trump and Viktor Orbán — are vulnerable precisely because they claim to stand for democracy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The contradiction between their stated beliefs and actions creates fertile ground for their opponents to appeal to the pro-democracy consensus in their societies. And indeed, there is <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/12/19/23453073/2022-year-democracy-russia-ukraine-china-iran-america-brazil">substantial evidence</a> from recent elections in the United States, Brazil, Poland, and India that this can be a winning tactic.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But this tactic is not merely useful in defending liberalism from its enemies. It has also proven effective in improving our liberal societies: enacting reforms that bring them closer to their stated ideals.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Take, for example, the pro-housing YIMBY movement. The very name, Yes in My Backyard, is a play on the older term NIMBY  — referring to the kind of faux-liberals who like the idea of wind power or affordable housing but won’t support such projects if they affect local property values. YIMBYs argue that, if you take the beliefs of liberal urban dwellers seriously, you must support building more and building faster to deal with America’s catastrophic housing crisis.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And guess what? It’s working!&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I used to keep track of individual YIMBY policy wins, but at a certain point I stopped because there were just too many,” <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/yimbys-keep-winning">Matt Yglesias writes at Slow Boring</a>. “I have met actual human beings living in Arlington who read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Color-Law-Forgotten-Government-Segregated/dp/1631492853">Richard Rothstein’s ‘The Color of Law,’</a> found that it genuinely changed their mind, and now are eager to fight the legacy of white supremacy by opening the door to expanding housing supply.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Back in 1955, Charles Frankel called on his comrades to “reconstruct the liberal tradition to make it applicable to an age of technical specialization, bureaucratized power, and mass movements.” Today, liberals like the YIMBYs are doing just that by acting on the insights embedded in Lefebvre’s book. Their successes should give us hope that contemporary liberaldom is no more inevitable than the liberaldoms of 1854 or 1954 — and that liberalism’s reigning status as dominant moral doctrine provides resources to beat back illiberal challenges.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ali Jackson had been single for about four years, and like so many women, felt burned out on dating apps. Swiping had become a monotonous routine, something to do when she was bored.&nbsp;So Jackson decided to delete the apps and try something novel: Meet people in person.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In October, she made a commitment to attend two social events a month where she didn’t know many people. Initially, Jackson signed up for singles mixers and speed dating parties but found she had more fun at non-dating get-togethers, like adult summer camp and run club. It was at one of these social gatherings, hosted by a friend on the periphery of her friend circle, where Jackson met her now-boyfriend. Her only intention going into the event was simply to talk to people. Finding romance was a bonus.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I feel very strongly that one of the reasons that we clicked so well is because, at least on my end, I was just hanging,” says Jackson, <a href="https://findingmrheight.com/">a dating and relationship coach</a> who also hosts a popular dating advice podcast, <a href="https://findingmrheight.com/podcast/"><em>Finding Mr. Height</em></a>. “I wasn&#8217;t thinking about how I was coming across or trying to meet someone.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the last few years, many singles’ disillusionment with dating apps seems to have reached a breaking point. Some app users are tired of the lack of civility of online dating: According to a Pew Research Center Survey, over 85 percent of respondents ages 18 to 34 said <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2020/02/06/the-virtues-and-downsides-of-online-dating/">someone on a dating app continued to contact them</a> even after they said they weren’t interested. Others bemoan the jarring nature of going from strangers to romantic interests within days. A Forbes Health/OnePoll survey found <a href="https://www.forbes.com/health/dating/dating-app-fatigue/">79 percent of Gen Z respondents were burned out by dating apps</a>. On TikTok, videos with views in the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@foreverathlete/video/7134885994871950638?q=delete%20dating%20apps&amp;t=1719242714345">hundreds of thousands</a> urge <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@y0sher0se/video/7324290839801318688?q=dating%20apps&amp;t=1719242340116">viewers</a> to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@wildflowerhairsuite/video/7359567019093527839?q=delete%20dating%20apps&amp;t=1719242714345">delete their apps</a>, while <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/tiktok-videos-single-women-crying.html">tearful young women recount their dating disasters</a>, both on and off apps, wondering why it’s so hard to meet someone or make a genuine connection. The market value of Bumble and Match Group — which owns Tinder, Match.com, OkCupid, Hinge, and more — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/12/business/dating-apps-tinder-bumble.html">has plummeted by over $40 billion since 2021</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although would-be lovers have, for nearly all of existence, found other ways to meet, some singles — especially ones whose only dating experience has been digitally mediated — may find their in-person flirting skills lacking. The key to connecting with someone in the flesh, experts say, is to focus on quality conversations with everyone you meet and not to take rejection personally.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prioritize social events where you know you’ll meet new people</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the biggest challenges to in-person dating is not knowing where to meet people. There’s the clichés — bars, parties — and locations ripped from rom-com plots — elevators, bookstores. But the key is to find a place where there are people you don’t know. Think of an activity you like to do and find a club or gathering around that pursuit, says relationship expert <a href="https://susanwinter.net/">Susan Winter.</a> Try not to think of these social events as opportunities to meet a potential romantic partner, but as chances to learn more about something you’re genuinely interested in, Winter says. If you’re having fun, it takes the pressure off.</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The best tips for IRL flirting</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Go to recurring social events — like a softball league — where you don’t know many people</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Uncross your arms, take off your headphones, and make eye contact</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Chat with three, four, or five strangers, regardless of whether you’re interested in them romantically</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">If the person you&#8217;re talking to is giving short, clipped answers and isn&#8217;t making eye contact, best to exit gracefully</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re into someone, ask them if they want to get together outside of the event</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Don’t beat yourself up if they don’t reciprocate your feelings</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These can be one-offs, like a concert, or a routine event, like an amateur softball league. However, the more frequently the group meets, the less intimidating it is to approach people, since they’re already familiar with you. “My biggest tip for people that feel more introverted or like they&#8217;re scared to walk up to people,” Jackson says, “is to do that more recurring event so you can establish bonds with people until they&#8217;re not strangers and it doesn&#8217;t feel so scary.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re up for attending these events alone, go for it — it’ll push you to chat with more people. To signal that you’re open to being approached, <a href="https://williamsburgtherapygroup.com/meet-the-team/dr-ida-taghavi">Ida Taghavi</a>, licensed clinical psychologist at Williamsburg Therapy Group, suggests making eye contact with others, uncrossing your arms, and squaring your face and body toward people you want to talk to. Take off those headphones, too. (If you’re unsure whether someone is interested in being approached, look for these same signs in others.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Winter says there’s nothing wrong with asking a friend to tag along, ideally someone who is also open to talking to new people. Small groups of two or three are great, Jackson says. The larger the crew, the less likely a stranger will approach you. “If you&#8217;re in a group of eight people, [it’s] highly unlikely that somebody is going to approach that group,” she says. “That&#8217;s just super intimidating.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the few places where it’s not a good idea to meet a prospective partner: the workplace. Think twice about attempting to date a coworker. Sure, you may have a good read on their personality, but you risk making the office uncomfortable if the relationship doesn’t pan out. Plus, any power imbalance between you and your romantic interest may create an inappropriate relationship. If you do decide to pursue a colleague, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/02/23/1233443278/im-dating-my-coworker-help">review your company’s rules about dating coworkers</a> and let things develop slowly at social gatherings outside of work, Jackson says.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Take romance out of the equation</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dating apps take the ambiguity out of meeting people: The fact that a person is on the platform and has matched with you is a pretty good indicator that they’re open to dating you. IRL interactions are far murkier. While people are rightfully concerned not to come across as creepy when approaching others, experts say the best course of action is simply to chat with someone not because they’re a “prospect,” but because they are a person worth talking to.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Don’t focus on flirting and instead <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/24083942/master-small-talk-interesting-conversation-strangers">flex your conversational skills</a>. Try complimenting a stranger at the bus stop or asking if the person sitting next to you at the bar would recommend the book they’re reading. Listen carefully to their responses, Winter says, and ask follow-up questions based on what they’ve said. Soon you’ll find something you’re mutually interested in. “If you get boxed up, forget that they are a romantic prospect,” Winter says. “Actually tell yourself they are a human being and your task is to engage with this human being.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s completely fine to be nervous approaching someone you don’t know, says <a href="https://www.smartdatingacademy.com">Bela Gandhi</a>, dating coach and host of the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/smart-dating-academy-the-podcast/id1583496218"><em>Smart Dating Academy</em></a> podcast. But the best way to overcome those jitters is to talk to more people, she says. Start in low-stakes environments, like the grocery store, and try chatting with the least intimidating person you encounter. “Have a couple of icebreakers in your back pocket that you can talk to people about,” Gandhi says. “It’s about doing the reps. Doing the reps builds confidence.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another way to get your conversational reps in, Gandhi says, is involving your friends. For instance, while at a volunteering event, challenge yourself and a pal to have conversations with three new people over a 30-minute period. Then, you can touch base after.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“You might need to be the conversational leader — that’s not desperation, it’s socializing”</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s important to pay attention to the other person’s verbal and nonverbal cues to determine whether they’re enjoying the conversation. If they’re giving you short, clipped answers and aren’t making eye contact, they might not be interested, Winter says. You might consider gracefully exiting the conversation to avoid wading into creepy territory.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most of us would love for an attractive stranger to approach us at a party, but “everybody wants someone else to do the approach,” Gandhi says. You might need to be the conversational leader — that’s not desperation, it’s socializing. Even if you don’t connect with someone romantically, they have the potential to be a new friend, a professional connection, or even someone who can set you up with one of their single friends.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Asking someone out doesn’t need to be awkward</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Maybe you’ve been chatting to someone for a while and the conversation is flowing: You’re laughing at each other’s jokes, there’s lots of eye contact, you’re both asking the other questions. All signs are pointing to mutual interest in getting to know each other better.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You don’t need to explicitly mention you’d like to go on a date with them, Jackson says, but keep it light by saying, “This was really fun. Maybe we could try that new [wine bar/restaurant/tennis court] you mentioned sometime,” or “We should totally exchange numbers and meet up at the [mutual favorite band] show next week.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You could take another approach for crushes you see at recurring events. If the object of your affection is, say, another student in your pottery class, try asking the entire group if anyone wants to grab food afterward, Jackson suggests.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The ball is in their court now and you have to be open to any outcome, good or bad.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Be chill if you get rejected (and be chill when rejecting someone)</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">People might have a multitude of reasons for turning down a date. They could be in a relationship already, they might be moving to a new city in a few months, or they may just not feel the romantic spark. It’s okay to take it personally, Winter says. If they were brash and unkind in their response, you dodged a bullet.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Try not to get stuck feeling like you’re not worthy of love or attractive enough, Gandhi says. Instead, put yourself in their shoes, Jackson suggests. Imagine a time when a perfectly fine person asked you out but you weren’t feeling the spark. Chances are you weren’t thinking the person was unworthy of romance. “I wouldn&#8217;t feel embarrassed for a guy if he came up to me and struck up a conversation and asked for my number, and I was like, ‘I actually have a boyfriend. I&#8217;m not interested,’” Jackson says.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>If they were brash and unkind in their response, you dodged a bullet&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As obvious as it may seem, do not insult the other person if they decline a date. “Respect the other person’s decision and simply move on,” Taghavi says. “The relationship that is for you is one where both you and your partner feel aligned on your intentions.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re the one turning someone down, always be kind and direct. You might say, “I’m so flattered, but I’m seeing someone. I’m sorry,” or “I really enjoyed our conversation, but I’m not interested.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s always the risk that the other person might not take your rejection kindly. That’s their problem, Jackson says. Now you know for certain you made the right call. “If somebody reacts to your very clear, kind communication with that attitude,” she says, “that sucks for them. That&#8217;s really unfortunate that they move through the world with that lens and I feel bad for them.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dating IRL can be an emotional minefield, but you can take the pressure off. So long as your expectations are to simply have a pleasant conversation with someone, the romance will soon follow.&nbsp;</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I’ve been on the consumer health beat for a few months now. That means I stand directly in the path of a lot of strikingly bad “wellness” advice on social media. For example: <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11808007/Doctors-warn-against-dangerous-TikTok-trend-drinking-raw-potato-juice.html">Take potato juice</a> instead of antibiotics for strep throat (<a href="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2009/0301/p383-s1.html">what? no</a>); <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/tiktoks-beer-tanning-beauty-hack-can-increase-your-risk-of-sunburn-and-cancer">douse yourself in beer</a> for a better tan (ouch — <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/354203/sunscreen-sunblock-spf-sun-damage-skin-cancer-tiktok-confusion">use sunscreen or stay in the shade</a>); <a href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/fitness/dry-scooping-why-health-experts-warn-against-trying-the-viral-tiktok-trend/">scoop dry protein powder directly into your mouth</a> (<a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/dry-scooping-tiktok-trend#:~:text=If%20your%20first%20lift%20for,dangerous%20%E2%80%94%20and%20even%20potentially%20deadly.">bad idea!</a>).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It also means I think a lot about the consequences of the bullshit fire hose. People are <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2024/03/15/covid-misinformation-spreads-4-years-after-pandemic/72896725007/">getting hurt</a>, and experts, struck with horror at the spectacle, are sinking countless hours and dollars into attempts at a fix. A variety of scientists and health care providers are trying to flood the zone with debunking content. However, it’s <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386505624001412#b0450">not at all clear that the content is reaching or changing many minds</a> among those most susceptible to health misinformation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As someone relatively new to doing debunking work, I hate it. It is boring, and it is endless. The “one weird hack” videos influencers barf up seem to come in multipacks of a thousand; before I’ve whack-a-moled even one of them, 10 more have cropped up. And because I’m not convinced that what’s written actually reaches the people most likely to believe the health bullshit they see online, the work often feels pointless.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s plenty of fault to go around for this bleak state of affairs. I blame the <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2024/03/18/think-out-loud-uw-study-social-media-influencers-misinformation/#:~:text=Some%20of%20those%20influencers%20are,false%20information%20about%20COVID%20vaccines.">snake oil salespeople</a> who profit off others’ desperation and confusion, and the tech platforms that allow them to proliferate. I blame the regulators and legislators who <a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2023/11/21/hany-farid-to-limit-disinformation-we-must-regulate-internet-platforms/">drag their feet</a> on bringing these massive corporations into check. I blame the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/11/18/what-house-republicans-want-do-public-education-funding/">underfunding</a> of <a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/06.24.24-Education-Privatization-Report.pdf">public education</a>, which would otherwise be teaching kids better critical thinking skills. I blame the government agencies whose best intentions still haven’t led to effective communication, and the politicians and other public figures who undermine those agencies for clout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But I have to admit that, in my heart of hearts, I also find myself wanting to shake the consumers who blindly follow the internet’s unvetted health “advice” without interrogating its source. Sorry, but you’re going to trust a rando shilling a “parasite cleanse” and telling you to <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/7/29/23811639/tiktok-borax-challenge-dangerous-laundry-detergent">drink laundry detergent</a> — and not the government scientist who’s literally forbidden from monetizing engagement? I am occasionally guilty of wanting to give up on humanity.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is not a response I’m proud of. After all, the public is on the pointy end of some of the most <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6679162/">skilled</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44640959">attention</a> <a href="https://www.fairobserver.com/business/are-addiction-inducing-algorithms-in-social-media-lawful/#">manipulators</a> of all time. We know that the rising reach and power of health misinformation is directly tied to a very reasonable <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563223003436">distrust in systems</a>, including government, the health care industry, and scientific experts. Certain players in each of these institutions have <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/">serious</a> <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/medical-debt-hospitals-sue-patients-threaten-credit-khn-investigation/">integrity</a> <a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/today/the-business-ethics-of-elon-musk-tesla-twitter-and-the-tech-industry/">problems</a>, and they may well have failed many people in very personal ways. I don’t question anyone’s right and reason to view these systems with healthy skepticism.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But friends, we simply cannot go on like this. You and I both know it: In a recent <a href="https://www.edelman.com/trust/2024/trust-barometer/special-report-health">survey</a> conducted by health communications firm Edelman, 63 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds were worried about health misinformation.(Notably, that’s the same demographic that, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, is most likely to <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-misinformation-and-trust/poll-finding/kff-health-misinformation-tracking-poll-pilot/">go to social media</a> for health information or advice.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Furthermore, people are well aware of the harms of believing the bullshit, and have insight into how that bullshit has harmed them personally. Fifty-five percent of young adults in the Edelman survey <a href="https://www.edelman.com/trust/2024/trust-barometer/special-report-health">regret</a> a health decision they made based on misinformation they got from an ad, their family or friends, or a content creator online.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, the bullshit fire hose persists. It’s insidious — more often than not, misinformation finds people by oozing into their feeds uninvited. While it’s more likely to leave people <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-misinformation-and-trust/poll-finding/kff-health-misinformation-tracking-poll-pilot/">confused than convinced</a>, it plants a seed of lingering doubt that can have an impact when it comes to making health decisions further down the line.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In other words, seeing a TikTok about <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/putting-garlic-in-nose-to-clear-sinuses">shoving a garlic clove in your nose</a> might not send you running for the crisper drawer — but the next time you hear about it, you might react with a “huh” instead of a “hell no.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Try as they might, public health is having a hell of a time keeping up with all the nonsense out there, especially when so much of it is in video form. The <a href="https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/parents-educators/lesson-plans/legit-accessing-valid-and-reliable-health-information">rules</a> of <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/healthy-aging/how-find-reliable-health-information-online">engagement</a> health experts have created to help consumers vet written health information don’t always apply to video, and simple tools to help people assess the quality of short videos about health are <a href="https://colab.ws/articles/10.1016%2Fj.ijmedinf.2024.105426">scarce</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So what’s a person on the internet to do next time social media serves up “one weird trick” that promises a jacked bod, a dewy complexion, immaculately balanced hormones, and a cancer-free eternity?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, let your bullshit meter guide you. If a wild health claim is too good to be true, it probably is. It’s also a red flag when the person making the claim is relying on language or visuals that elicit super-intense emotional reactions like fear and outrage, Cambridge University misinformation expert Sander van der Linden recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/16/well/health-misinformation.html">told</a> the New York Times.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>So what’s a person on the internet to do next time social media serves up “one weird trick” that promises a jacked bod, a dewy complexion, immaculately balanced hormones, and a cancer-free eternity?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Is the person sharing the information trying to sell you something by making a health claim? If so, that’s a concerning sign, and you should be especially careful to further check the accuracy of what they’re saying.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When in doubt, Google anything that causes even a slight tingle of your spidey senses. Has the claim been verified by news sites that value accuracy? (Here’s some <a href="https://newslit.org/educators/resources/is-it-legit/">guidance</a> on determining whether a news site is trustworthy, and a <a href="https://libguides.ala.org/InformationEvaluation">list of news vetting resources</a> from the American Library Association.) You can also check specific assertions on one of many fact-checking websites, including <a href="http://factcheck.org">FactCheck.org</a>, and on the sites of medical institutions — the <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/health-conditions">Cleveland Clinic</a> does some <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/tiktok-health-trends">good work</a> in this space. You can also take an offline approach by asking your own health care provider, or enlisting a local or university library to help you fact-check certain claims.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, all of the groups involved here should be doing a lot more to protect us — and if we’re obliged to do hand-to-hand combat with a ceaseless stream of health misinformation, we need to be doing a much more sophisticated job of it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Better education around news literacy that teaches young people to critically assess everything they read online — basically, <a href="https://www.apa.org/topics/journalism-facts/misinformation-interventions">pre-bunking</a> —<strong> </strong>is a good start. Government agencies and other health institutions could also get far better at communicating information to people in the ways they want and need to hear it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The problem is that my videos &#8230; are, like, an hour long, and they’re super boring,” Kristen Bibbins-Domingo, editor-in-chief of the Journal of the American Medical Association, a leading health research publication, said while speaking at <a href="https://youtu.be/PPO-8LN173U">Aspen Ideas: Health</a>. “And all of the other ones — they’re super interesting and engaging! I don’t need to be in the business of dumbing down ideas,” she said, but “consumers are consuming.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Good information can be engineered to seep into users’ feeds just as often as bad information does. But for that to happen, both government employees and health care providers need to be enabled to do this work far more effectively. That means respecting and compensating the debunking work scientists and providers do on social media and training them to make content that’s as likely to go viral as the worst nonsense in the fire hose.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s always the possibility that something will compel social media platforms to take some responsibility and actually do something to protect the public from misinformation. But in the meantime, please listen to that faint buzzing noise you now hear almost constantly. It’s your bullshit meter, it’s working harder than ever — and your health could depend on whether you’re paying attention. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It has been a month since Google’s spectacular goof. Its new AI Overviews feature was supposed to “<a href="https://blog.google/products/search/generative-ai-google-search-may-2024/">take the legwork out of searching</a>,” offering up easy-to-read answers to our queries based on multiple search results. Instead, it told people to <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/google-explains-why-its-ai-overviews-told-users-to-eat-rocks-and-glue-pizzas#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20queries%20that,important%20for%20your%20body's%20health.%E2%80%9D">eat rocks</a> and to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-search-ai-overview-answers-pizza-glue-fix-2024-5">glue cheese on pizza</a>. You could ask Google what country in Africa starts with the letter “K”, and Google <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/11/google-generative-ai-search-featured-results/675899/">would say none of them</a>. In fact, you can still get these wrong answers because AI search is a disaster. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This spring looked like a turning point for AI search, thanks to a couple of big announcements from major players in the space. One was that Google AI Overview update, and the other came from Perplexity, an AI search startup that’s already been labeled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/01/technology/perplexity-search-ai-google.html">as a worthy alternative to Google</a>. At the end of May, Perplexity launched a new feature called Pages that can create custom web pages full of information on one specific topic, like a smart friend who does your homework for you. Then <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/randalllane/2024/06/11/why-perplexitys-cynical-theft-represents-everything-that-could-go-wrong-with-ai/">Perplexity got caught plagiarizing</a>. For AI search to work well, it seems, it has to cheat a little.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s a lot of ill will over AI search’s mistakes and missteps and critics are mobilizing en masse. A group of online publishers and creators <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/06/26/google-ai-overviews-congress-web-publishers-raptive/">took to Capitol Hill on Wednesday</a> to lobby lawmakers to look into Google’s AI Overviews feature and other AI tech that pulls content from independent creators. This is just a couple days after the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and a group of major record labels <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/24/24184710/riaa-ai-lawsuit-suno-udio-copyright-umg-sony-warner">sued two AI companies</a> that generate music from text for copyright infringement. And let’s not forget that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/business/media/newspapers-sued-microsoft-openai.html">several newspapers</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html">including the New York Times</a>, have sued OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement for scraping their content in order to train the same AI models that power their search tools. (Vox Media, the company that owns this publication, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/352849/openai-chatgpt-google-meta-artificial-intelligence-vox-media-chatbots">has a licensing deal with OpenAI</a> that allows our content to be used to train its models and by ChatGPT. Our journalism and editorial decisions remain independent.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Generative AI technology is supposed to transform the way we search the web. At least, <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2023/3/4/23624033/openai-bing-bard-microsoft-generative-ai-explained">that’s the line</a> we’ve been fed since ChatGPT exploded on the scene near the end of 2022, and now every tech giant is pushing its own brand of AI technology: Microsoft has Copilot, Google has Gemini, Apple has Apple Intelligence, and so forth. While these tools can do more than help you find things online, dethroning Google Search still seems to be the holy grail of AI. Even OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, is reportedly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-plans-announce-google-search-competitor-monday-sources-say-2024-05-09/">building a search engine</a> to compete directly with Google.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But despite many companies’ very public efforts, AI search won’t make finding answers online effortless any time soon, according to experts I spoke to.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not just that AI search isn’t ready for primetime due to some flaws, it’s that those flaws are so deeply integrated into how AI search works that it’s now unclear if it can ever get good enough to replace Google.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It&#8217;s a good addition, and there are times when it&#8217;s really great,” Chirag Shah, a professor of information science at the University of Washington, told me. “But I think we&#8217;re still going to need the traditional search around.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rather than going into all of AI search’s flaws here, let me highlight the two that were on display with the recent Google and Perplexity kerfuffles. The Google pizza glue incident shows just how stubborn generative AI’s hallucination problem is. Just a few days after Google launched AI Overview, some users noticed that if you asked Google how to keep cheese from falling off of pizza, Google <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24162896/google-ai-overview-hallucinations-glue-in-pizza">would suggest adding some glue</a>. This particular answer appeared to come from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pizza/comments/1a19s0/my_cheese_slides_off_the_pizza_too_easily/">an old Reddit thread</a> that, for some reason, Google’s AI thought was an authoritative source even though a human would quickly realize that the Redditors are joking about eating glue. Weeks later, The Verge’s Elizabeth Lopatto reported that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/11/24176490/mm-delicious-glue">Google’s AI Overview feature was still recommending pizza glue</a>. Google <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/01/technology/google-ai-overviews-rollback.html">rolled back its AI Overview feature</a> in May following the viral failures, so it’s difficult to access AI Overview at all.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The problem isn’t just that the large language models that power generative AI tools can hallucinate, or make up information in certain situations. They also can’t tell good information from bad&nbsp;— at least not right now.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll ever be at a stage where we can guarantee that hallucinations won&#8217;t exist,” said Yoon Kim, an assistant professor at MIT who researches large language models. “But I think there&#8217;s been a lot of advancements in reducing these hallucinations, and I think we&#8217;ll get to a point where they&#8217;ll become good enough to use.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The recent Perplexity drama <a href="https://www.platformer.news/how-to-stop-perplexity-oreilly-ai-publishing/">highlights a different problem with AI search</a>: It accesses and republishes content that it’s not supposed to. Perplexity, whose investors include Jeff Bezos and Nvidia, made a name for itself by providing deeper answers to search queries and showing its sources. You can give it a question and it will come back with a conversational answer, complete with citations from around the web, which you can refine by asking more questions. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Perplexity launched its Pages feature, however, it became clear that its AI had an uncanny ability to rip off journalism. Perplexity even makes Pages it generated <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/discover">look like a news section of its website</a>. One such Page it published included <a href="https://x.com/JohnPaczkowski/status/1799135156051255799">summaries of some Forbes’s exclusive, paywalled investigative reporting</a> on Eric Schmidt’s drone project. Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/randalllane/2024/06/11/why-perplexitys-cynical-theft-represents-everything-that-could-go-wrong-with-ai/">accused Perplexity of stealing its content</a>, and Wired <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/perplexity-is-a-bullshit-machine/">later reported</a> that Perplexity was scraping content from websites that have blocked the type of crawlers that do such scraping. The AI-powered search engine would even construct incorrect answers to queries based on details in URLs or metadata. (In an interview with Fast Company last week, Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91144894/perplexity-ai-ceo-aravind-srinivas-on-plagiarism-accusations?partner=rss&amp;utm_source=feedly&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=rss+fastcompany&amp;utm_content=rss">denied some of the findings</a> of the Wired investigation and said, “I think there is a basic misunderstanding of the way this works.”)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The reasons why AI-powered search stinks at sourcing are both technical and simple, Shah explained. The technical explanation involves <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">something called retrieval-augmented generation</a> (RAG), which works a bit like a professor recruiting research assistants to go find out more information about a specific topic when the professor’s personal library isn’t enough. RAG does solve a couple of problems with how the current generation of large language models generate content, including the frequency of hallucinations, but it also creates a new problem: It can’t distinguish good sources from bad. In its current state, AI lacks good judgment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When you or I do a Google search, we know that the long list of blue links will include high-quality links, like newspaper articles, and low-quality or unverified stuff, like old Reddit threads or SEO farm garbage. We can distinguish between the good or bad in a split second, thanks to years of <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/why-ai-search-blew-up-in-googles-face.html">experience perfecting our own Googling skills</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And then there’s some common sense that AI doesn’t have, like knowing whether or not it’s okay to eat rocks and glue. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“AI-powered search doesn’t have that ability just yet,” Shah said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of this is to say that you should turn and run the next time you see an AI Overview. But instead of thinking about it as an easy way to get an answer, you should think of it as a starting point. Kind of like Wikipedia. It’s hard to know how that answer ended up at the top of the Google search, so you might want to check the sources. After all, you’re smarter than the AI.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kenya, one of east Africa’s more economically developed and democratically stable countries, has been rocked this week by a political crisis that reveals the deep cracks in both sides of that stability.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Massive protests broke out earlier this week after parliament passed a bill increasing taxes — including on a bevy of everyday essentials like cooking oil, diapers, and bread — on a population already suffering from inflation and high rates of unemployment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As protests increased in size and intensity, even breaching parliament’s chambers, they were met with violent repression. Nearly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/world/africa/kenya-protests-taxes-president-ruto.html">two dozen people were killed Tuesday</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After initial recalcitrance, President William Ruto said Wednesday he would not sign the controversial bill. His decision was a victory for the protesters, but the saga leaves the country’s future more uncertain than ever, both economically and politically. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ruto requested the bill to cover Kenya’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/26/business/kenya-tax-protests-debt.html">approximately $80 billion</a> in domestic and external debt. Around $35 million of that debt is owned by foreign creditors, primarily China and powerful international groups like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). If Kenya doesn’t pay it, the possibility of borrowing in the future will become more difficult in the short term; over time, it could mean more unemployment, more poverty, and <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/explainers/what-happens-when-a-country-goes-broke">overall worse outcomes for Kenyans</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kenya’s troubles are a distillation of the problems facing several dozen developing nations, crushed under debt: “More than 3 billion people across the world live in countries that are spending more on servicing their debt than public spending on education or health,” Binaifer Nowrojee, the president of the Open Society Foundations, <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/06/28/kenya-protests-ruto-imf-taxes-poverty-broke-social-contract/">wrote in Foreign Policy</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Complicating matters are Kenya’s other economic problems. Corruption, cronyism, financial mismanagement, and the vestiges of colonialism have hobbled Kenya’s <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/african-lions-tapping-the-potential-of-kenyas-economic-growth/">once-impressive</a> economic development and exacerbated class and ethnic inequalities.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of that has led to a long-simmering political crisis: Ruto was elected on a promise that he would improve the lot of Kenya’s youth and lower classes, presenting himself as a break from the old, corrupt, politically incestuous elite. But he’s been unable to deliver, despite the country’s wealth in resources and economic boom in the early 2000s — and that has left large swaths of the population displeased with him, and his government, leading to the rancorous protests of recent days.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though Ruto has backed off from the taxation bill, Kenyans, especially young people, are mobilized against the government and the status quo — and they aren’t backing down. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/kenya-protests-finance-bill-taxes-43fef18b87cd6f7c1cfd002709fd8a20">Protests continued Thursday</a> in Nairobi and other cities despite military patrols. After the bill and the violent repression, some protesters are now <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/world/africa/kenya-protests-taxes-president-ruto.html">calling for Ruto to resign</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Amid serious distrust of his administration, Ruto now must find a way to manage the East African country’s debt load and avoid default without further harming the economy or inflaming people’s very real anger. It’s unlikely he’ll be able to do all of these things. But inaction could drive Kenya further into economic disaster.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">What happened at Kenya’s protests, and how Kenya’s economic situation got this bad</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kenya’s Finance Bill of 2024 was supposed to increase government revenue through taxes, satisfying a condition of the IMF loan. But Kenyans already struggling with high inflation and organizing on social media <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/kenya-braces-fresh-protests-despite-presidents-tax-climbdown-2024-06-27/">came out in cities</a> including Nairobi, Mombasa, Homa Bay, and Kisumu to condemn the bill after it passed in parliament. Protesters <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/06/27/a-new-breed-of-protest-has-left-kenyas-president-tottering">breached the parliament</a> on Tuesday, setting fire to part of the building and sending lawmakers fleeing. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The seeds of the recent protests, however, have been sown for years, as Kenyans see an <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/06/27/microfinance-kenya-predatory-lending-international-development/">economic and financial system stacked against them</a>. They started to come to a head in earnest during last summer’s anti-tax protests, but they’ve taken on a slightly different character this year; so far, the movement seems to be composed of young people, leaderless and coordinated online. That’s no surprise, <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/gov/cheeseman-nic">Nic Cheeseman</a>, professor of democracy and international development at the University of Birmingham, told Vox. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Young people were the first to get sacked during Covid, had higher unemployment, are less likely to be registered to vote, and are under-represented in parliament,” he said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During his campaign, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/09/world/africa/kenya-elections-william-ruto.html">Ruto made his pitch to these young people</a>, dubbing them the “hustler nation” and emphasizing his own rags-to-riches story. But his promises for “bottom-up” economic reform have rung hollow as Kenyans still suffer from <a href="https://www.oxfam.org/en/kenya-extreme-inequality-numbers">severe economic inequality</a> and lack of educational and job opportunities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Kenya’s economic woes didn’t start recently; the nation’s immense debt stems from an economic boom in the early 2000s, when the government borrowed money from a variety of international creditors to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/kenya-china-beijing-loans-train-55dd517978a020b255a461f8ad372546">fund public infrastructure projects</a>, supporting agriculture and small and medium businesses and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-19/kenya-gets-210-million-loan-as-eurobond-maturity-looms?sref=qYiz2hd0">external debt servicing</a> but failed to invest those loans in ways that could grow the economy. Add to that a series of costly natural disasters (including floods and Covid-19), ineffective taxation strategy, and the long-term pattern of politicians overspending to make good on campaign promises, and Kenya was poised for crisis. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The drivers of [the] debt crisis are predominantly political, in other words, and can only be solved by political solutions,” Cheeseman said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By that he means a deeper problem needs to be solved: Ultimately, Kenyans don’t trust their government, and understandably so; high levels of government waste and corruption, as well as a patronage system that relies heavily on favors, nepotism, and quid-pro-quo relationships with roots in Kenya’s British colonial period, mean the government isn’t responsive to the Kenyan people. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though Ruto positioned himself as an alternative to this system, promising voters that he was a break from the political dynasties of the past, that’s simply not true. Ruto has been in the government in some form <a href="https://www.president.go.ke/administration/office-of-the-president/">since 1997</a>, and he was part of the system that brought this crisis about. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, protesters have stormed the parliament and called for his resignation —&nbsp;and say they won’t stop until he is gone.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What happens to Kenya now?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The question of what’s next — both politically and financially —is murky at best. For now, Ruto has refused to sign the tax bill, but the government will have to enact austerity measures to both save money and comply with a <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Countries/KEN/kenya-qandas">2021 loan agreement</a> with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-27/protest-deaths-in-kenya-echo-decades-of-angst-over-imf-orthodoxy?sref=qYiz2hd0">the IMF</a>, which requires Kenya to increase taxes and cut government spending while also protecting and strengthening the social safety net. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That agreement is likely to cause Ruto more political headaches, if other countries in similar situations are any indication.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It happens again and again,” W. Gyude Moore, a fellow at the Center for Global Development and former public works minister of Liberia. “Countries go to the IMF, get recommendations, and do everything they can to remain on the good side of the IMF. And in the process of doing that, people end up hurt.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the meantime, Ruto has said that he will <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-28/kenya-prepares-spending-cuts-after-scrapping-2-3-billion-taxes?srnd=homepage-africa&amp;sref=qYiz2hd0">introduce austerity measures</a> aimed at cutting government spending to align with the IMF’s guidelines, starting with slashing his own office’s budget. Those austerity measures don’t seem to be cutting into public programs like infrastructure, health care, and education yet — but such cuts could still come. The central government could decrease cash transfers to Kenya’s counties, further fueling the inequality that plagues Kenyan society, and could cut into critical programs like <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/eadf0d8a-730c-4934-8c10-8edd075982ff?shareType=nongift">meals for school-age children</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kenya spends about 60 percent of its revenue <a href="https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/business/why-kenya-is-still-debt-distressed-despite-eurobond-repayment--4533300">on debt payments</a>; a third of that revenue <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/kenyas-double-digit-debt-costs-sign-tough-times-2024-02-13/">goes toward interest</a>. While continuing to service its debt plays well for creditors, it negatively affects the population, because that money isn’t being spent on programs and services for them. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kenya doesn’t have many options when it comes to dealing with its debt burden. It could default on its payments — simply not pay the loan back, in other words. While this could ease some of the burden on Kenya’s population in the short term, it would tank the country’s credit rating, impacting the country’s ability to borrow in the future. Should it need fast cash for another Covid-level crisis after defaulting, it could find itself out of luck. It could also have even more trouble accessing foreign currency and struggle to pay for imports, leading to higher inflation as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/sri-lankas-economic-crisis-debt-restructuring-efforts-2024-04-16/#:~:text=At%20the%20start%20of%202022,%2478%20million%20bond%20coupon%20payment.">Sri Lanka</a> experienced in 2022 — which resulted in ended in mass civil upheaval and the ouster of the country’s president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Renegotiating the terms of its loans is another option. That could help lower the amount that the country pays to external creditors so Kenya isn’t paying more than half of government revenue to service its debts. That would likely still mean implementing some austerity measures and increased taxes, though perhaps not as extreme as the shelved tax bill.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, Kenya could keep its present course. But again, that means little to no money would be left for stoking internal economic development, and scant resources for the sorts of services citizens expect from their governments. Ruto has proposed a two-week period to <a href="https://www.president.go.ke/president-ruto-declines-to-sign-finance-bill-calls-for-its-withdrawal/">discuss options for a new economic plan</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All that means Kenya does need to find some money from somewhere. Any increase in taxes, Cheeseman said, would have to be targeted at Kenya’s ultra-wealthy, to demonstrate a sensitivity to the plight of ordinary Kenyans, if Ruto hopes to regain some of their support. However, that’s unlikely to be popular among Kenya’s powerful elite.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, even raising capital is a short-term financial fix to the long-term political problems of corruption, waste, and mismanagement. Efforts to undo those patterns are likely to anger the ultra-wealthy, whose businesses depend on corrupt relationships with the government to thrive.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether or not the Ruto administration finds a way to manage its debt payments, the problem is that Kenyans don’t feel that their government is looking out for their best interests. That has played out in protests over the economy, but those circumstances are a product of Kenya’s political culture and international financial institutions that have failed developing countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fans of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) have had Saturday blocked off on their calendars for months. They were all anticipating the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/apr/14/conor-mcgregor-to-make-long-awaited-ufc-return-against-michael-chandler#:~:text=Conor%20McGregor%20will%20make%20his,president%2C%20Dana%20White%2C%20said.">long-awaited return</a> of former UFC featherweight and lightweight champion <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3022677/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a> in <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/fightcenter/_/id/600043173/league/ufc">UFC 303</a>. But a <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10125598-conor-mcgregor-posts-photo-of-injured-toe-after-ufc-303-fight-vs-chandler-canceled">broken toe</a> ruined those plans just two weeks before fight night.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead, viewers are tuning in for what ultimately might be a much better contest between light heavyweight champion <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4705658/alex-pereira">Alex Pereira</a> and former champ <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3156612/jiri-prochazka">Jiří Procházka</a>. The fight will be a rematch between the two brawlers, who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHGomATiHvU">last met in November 2023</a>. That first fight was a back-and-forth bout, with each fighter landing big blows and takedowns. Pereira won via TKO after a devastating hook allowed him to take Procházka to the ground for an old-fashioned pounding, landing punches and elbows before the referee stopped the fight.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This time around, the two will meet in front of more than 20,000 fans at a sold-out T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas — with <a href="https://www.ufc.com/news/ufc-300-pereira-vs-hill-numbers-behind-record-breaking-success?language_content_entity=en">an estimated more than 2 million viewers watching from home</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">UFC 303 is expected to bring in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/trentreinsmith/2024/05/13/dana-whiteufc-303-mcgregor-vs-chandler-will-top-20-million-gate/?sh=1ae37eaec848">a record-breaking gate of $20 million</a>, which is a feather in the cap for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2008/0505/080.html">the most dominant league in the world of mixed martial arts (MMA)</a>. The UFC was recently valued at an eye-popping <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/justinteitelbaum/2024/04/18/the-most-valuable-combat-sports-promotions-2024/#:~:text=The%20two%20brands%20each%20had,Forbes'%20Highest%20Paid%20Athletes%20List.">$11.3 billion</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the UFC is more than just a sports sensation that lures fight fans and uninitiated looky-loos toward pricey pay-per-view events promising violence and excitement. The league is a cultural phenomenon. It’s turned fighters into celebrities; it’s created new expectations for what fighting looks like in movies and media; and it’s even intersected with national politics. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In fact, how UFC got this big says a lot about America today — and where American politics could be headed next.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How the UFC got so huge</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The UFC hasn’t always been a behemoth. In its earliest days, it was unpolished; one of the company’s taglines was “<a href="https://30for30podcasts.com/episodes/no-rules-birth-ufc/">there are no rules</a>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Its no-rules violence led Sen. John McCain to call the UFC “<a href="https://slate.com/culture/2018/08/john-mccain-ufc-how-he-grew-to-tolerate-mma-the-sport-he-considered-human-cockfighting.html">human cockfighting</a>.” The lifelong boxing fan wrote letters to governors in every state asking them to ban the organization’s events saying, “I’ve seen people repeatedly getting smashed in the face with a guy sitting on top of them. That’s not sport!”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“That really sent [the UFC] to a pretty terrible place. It got kicked off of Pay-Per-View. A lot of states didn&#8217;t even want anything to do with it, they would shut down [fights] at the last minute,” Luke Thomas, a combat sports analyst for CBS Sports, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/today-explained/id1346207297?i=1000659810536">told the <em>Today, Explained</em> podcast</a>. “And in January 2001, the guys who originally founded the UFC, they threw in the towel. They sold it for $2 million to Dana White, [and] Lorenzo and Frank Fertitta.”<br><br>UFC’s new owners struggled too. Then Donald Trump called, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsMpZtyU0-Q">White said on a podcast</a>, and said, “Come to my place. We’ll have you here at the Taj Mahal.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s invite helped the UFC’s new owners in the short term, but it was really when they seized upon a new trend — America’s love of reality television in the early 2000s — and created the reality TV series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6fw68fUEsY"><em>The Ultimate Fighter</em> on Spike TV</a> that the league’s fortunes turned around.<br><br>“For the casual audience who had maybe heard of UFC this put a brand new face on it,” says Thomas. “The world got to see really unique people doing a really crazy thing at the height of the reality TV show boom. And it worked!”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And the success of the first season led to more seasons. It led to deals with ESPN. The UFC was eventually valued as a billion-dollar sports organization. And it’s only improved its value and stature in culture since. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How MMA turned MAGA</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Journalist <a href="https://x.com/sam_eagan?lang=en">Sam Eagan</a> has been a longtime fan of combat sports. He writes and podcasts pretty often about UFC, MMA, and domestic extremism. And he says that he began to see the topics overlap after reporting on the growth of <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7evgw/neo-nazi-fight-clubs-robert-rundo-fat-shaming-white-nationalism">neo-Nazi fight clubs</a> in the US.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I would say fighting is in no way inherently a conservative sport, but it presents as being about the individual. It’s one person competing against one person in a very violent, dominant fashion,” Eagan <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/today-explained/id1346207297?i=1000659810536">told the <em>Today, Explained </em>podcast</a>. “So there’s these themes of domination and violence — and in the case of the really, really far right … they’re very easily paralleled in MMA.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it’s not on the extremes where Eagan sees an overlap. He pointed to the 2016 Republican National Convention where Dana White became one of the first people to publicly endorse Trump.<br><br>“For over 15 years, Donald Trump has been a loyal and supportive friend,” White said.“And I know that if I needed Donald, he would be there for me, just like he was when I first met him.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Soon after that Trump was elected president. But in 2019 he was pretty unpopular. He was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQjd9GPG3LA">booed at the World Series</a> in Washington, DC. “And so, he makes an appearance at a UFC event shortly after. And, you know, it gets the full treatment, the cameras panned to him, and fighters are cheering his name and talking about him in their post-fight interviews,” Eagan says. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump continues to appear at events periodically for the next few years. But then in 2023, it really takes off, Eagan says. “By my count, he appeared at three separate events in that year alone. [And] as I was watching these events, I would notice this feels like a captive campaign stop for Trump.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I&#8217;m sure there will be many more in the lead-up to the election.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it’s not just Dana White showing love for the former president. Former title contender <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3088810/colby-covington">Colby Covington</a> has built <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul2Wq77cSCc">a whole persona</a> around being a Trump fan. He <a href="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/12/1200/675/colby-1.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1">wears MAGA hats</a> all the time; in post-fight interviews, he makes shoutouts to first responders, members of the military, and to Trump himself; and throws around phrases like “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA-2yXPxmeA">fake news</a>” regularly. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jorge Masvidal, a Cuban American fighter from Florida, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/29/mma-trump-election-433529">held a series of pro-Trump rallies</a> called Fighters Against Socialism. “We either re-elect President Trump and keep America great,” Masvidal said at one rally. “Or we let Joe Biden destroy the greatest country the world has ever seen.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite the rising popularity of the UFC, and its owner’s and fighters’ embrace of conservative politics, Eagan says, “I do not think that the UFC will sway the election [for Trump].” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But he does believe that Trump’s embrace of UFC and combat sports has created a sort of blueprint for appealing to young men who “may be vaguely conservative but are generally sort of apolitical.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to the sports data site <a href="https://www.imgarena.com/about/">IMG Arena</a> 75 percent of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17430437.2022.2033218#:~:text=The%20UFC%20has%20over%20300%20million%20fans,and%20stratification%20(MacDonald%2C%20Lamont%2C%20and%20Jenkins%202019).">UFC’s fans</a> are men and 88 percent of those men are between the ages of 18 and 44. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A demographic any candidate would be happy to tap into.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What becomes of the mighty when they don’t merely fall from glory, but leap headlong while crowing about their own greatness?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In this case, the mighty is Kevin Costner, and he hath not only fallen but hurtled over the edge with <em>Horizon: An American Saga — Chapter One</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The new three-hour behemoth, released Friday, is the first of a four-film epic Western that Costner <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/05/francis-ford-coppola-kevin-costner-interview-megalopolis-horizon-1235359148/">says</a> he’s wanted to make since 1988. Directed, co-written, and self-financed by Costner, <em>Horizon</em> features an all-star ensemble cast, has a $100 million budget, and will be, when all four films wrap, approximately 12 hours long. It’s a bizarre work about the settling of a small Western town that critics are accurately calling “<a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/26/entertainment/horizon-an-american-saga-chapter-1-review-kevin-costner-quit-yellowstone-for-this/">an embarrassing</a>, poorly told mess,” “<a href="https://ew.com/movie-reviews-horizon-an-american-saga-chapter-1-three-hours-stable-clearing-8669810">dull as dirt</a>,” “<a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2024-06-27/horizon-american-saga-chapter-1-review-kevin-costner-western">overindulged tedium</a>,” and “<a href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20240520-horizon-an-american-saga-review-kevin-costners-western-is-a-numbingly-long-incoherent-disas-ter">a numbingly long</a>, incoherent disaster.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also, despite its best efforts at creating sympathy for Indigenous Americans, borderline offensive, with an intense, violent depiction of a nominally unprovoked Apache raid that takes up nearly the first third of the film. The sequence does its very best to make settlers seem like the innocent victims in all this. While the rest of the film tries to undo the initial impression that the Apache are the true aggressors, it’s the only thing that lands. That isn’t surprising when you consider that Costner can be an excellent director, creating a gripping action sequence but failing to deliver on the quieter parts of the film, but it is surprising when you consider that he’s generally been far more sympathetic to Indigenous concerns than <em>Horizon</em>’s first chapter shakes out to be. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That leads us to the inevitable question: What happened here?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To understand how we reached this baffling point, we have to understand just how big Costner was at the peak of his stardom — and how quizzical his career has been ever since.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>In the early 1990s, there was no bigger star than Costner</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s hard to overstate just how successful Kevin Costner was at the height of his career. Somewhat unusually for an actor of his caliber, Costner, who was born in 1955, didn’t start working in the field until his mid-20s, and didn’t break through until he was 30. He did so, however, with a string of iconic film roles — as wayward outlaw Jake in <em>Silverado</em> (1985), federal agent Eliot Ness in <em>The Untouchables</em> (1987), heartthrob baseballer Crash Davis in <em>Bull Durham</em> (1988), and Ray Kinsella, the builder (and dreamer) of <em>Field of Dreams</em>’ titular field in 1989. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These early roles identified Costner with both mythologized Americana and iconoclastic heroes. Then, in 1990, Costner doubled down on this persona and elevated his stature to a whole new level by directing himself in one of the most influential films of the decade: <em>Dances With Wolves</em>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Dances With Wolves</em> typically gets credited with revitalizing and reinventing the epic Hollywood western for modern audiences — a craze that kicked off with <em>Wolves</em>, by 1991, grossing over $175 million and winning seven Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Faithfully adapted by Michael Blake from his own bestselling novel, <em>Dances With Wolves</em> depicts the journey of a lone soldier (Costner) assigned to a wayward Western outpost during the Civil War. There, he interacts primarily with Lakota and Pawnee, sympathizing with them and their concerns until he ultimately stands with them against an encroaching Union army encampment. The film has a <a href="https://crookedmarquee.com/the-complicated-legacy-of-dances-with-wolves/">complicated cultural legacy</a>, as it both galvanized important cultural conversations about Indigenous rights and <a href="https://filmschoolrejects.com/dances-with-wolves-native-lens/">typified</a> the “<a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23832310/michael-oher-blind-side-adoption-tuohy-white-savior">white savior</a>” narratives that until recently dominated Hollywood’s treatment of marginalized communities. Still, it’s a true cinematic achievement with grand cinematography, stunning landscapes, and a soaring depiction of a troubled time in the country’s history. It still earns accolades as a true American epic. </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/gettyimages-159824459.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,12.02928192313,100,75.941436153741" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Kevin Costner holding an American flag in &lt;em&gt;Dances With Wolves&lt;/em&gt;. | Tig Productions/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Tig Productions/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">For a heady few years after <em>Wolves</em>, Costner was unstoppable: He became the A-lister’s A-lister, hopping from blockbuster to blockbuster in quick succession. <em>Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves </em>was a fun anachronistic romp with an all-star ensemble that <a href="https://screenrant.com/robin-hood-prince-of-thieves-90s-classic-still-holds-up-relevant/">still slaps</a>, as well as one of the <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/the-biggest-summer-songs-of-all-time-bryan-adams-everything-i-do-i-do-6634483/">bestselling theme songs</a> in history. <em>The Bodyguard</em> saw Costner star opposite Whitney Houston as a hardened security guard in what was considered a groundbreaking interracial romance between two titans at their peaks. Its cultural legacy has <a href="https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/the-paranoid-prescience-of-the-bodyguard-whitney-houston/">been kinder</a> than critics were at the time, but its $400 million box office and <a href="https://www.grammy.com/news/bodyguard-soundtrack-25-years-after-whitney-houstons-masterpiece">the biggest soundtrack of all time</a> are hard to argue with. Even pivoting away from type and toward weirder fare, Costner still did numbers, with Oliver Stone’s conspiratorial <em>JFK</em> grossing $<a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0102138/">70 million</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s important to remember the chronology here. Costner enjoyed phenomenal career success after an astonishingly short time as an actor; just five years out from his first major role, he directed a film that swept the Oscars. Then he quickly followed that feat up with a truly incredible run of films.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because he did so many important and successful films after it, most people probably catalog <em>Dances With Wolves</em> as coming early, toward the start of his incredible run of success, until the infamous back-to-back cringe flops of <em>Waterworld</em> and <em>The Postman</em> torpedoed his trajectory for years. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But <em>Wolves</em> was instead arguably his pinnacle — the peak of both his creative achievements and his cultural impact. That’s significant as a predictor of what <em>Horizon</em> eventually became, both because of its Western theme and because of its outsized ambition.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Costner personified red-blooded rugged individualism onscreen — and Hollywood divadom offscreen</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The idea of a prestige movie this immense being released by a major studio now is absurd,” Will Leitch <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/130346/dances-wolves-best-picture-25-years-later">argued</a> of <em>Dances With Wolves</em> in the New Republic in 2016. “This was the last time a movie star had so much clout that he could do something so patently crazy and expensive, and get a major studio to finance it—and thus the last time it could pay off.”  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In other words, even though it was an important film in many ways, <em>Dances With Wolves</em> was effectively the last of its kind — as Costner would soon learn. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Alongside the runaway success Costner enjoyed between the late ’80s and the mid-90s, he was gaining a reputation within Hollywood as an egomaniac — “either exacting to a fault or an unjustified pain in the ass,” as Puck’s Matthew Belloni <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/02/22/when-hasnt-kevin-costner-been-a-pain-in-the-you-know-what/">summarized</a> last year. By 1994, the sands had begun to shift. That year, <em>Wyatt Earp</em> flopped, even with Costner heading another all-star ensemble and once again proving his chops as a leading man in a Western. But then came <em>Waterworld</em>, an infamously expensive post-apocalyptic film. Costner was reportedly so difficult and demanding during its creation that director Kevin Reynolds <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a33443888/why-waterworld-is-actually-good-25th-anniversary-essay/">walked out of the editing process</a>, leaving the actor to wrap things up. “In the future Costner should only appear in pictures he directs himself,” Reynolds <a href="https://ew.com/article/2012/05/18/kevin-costner-and-kevin-reynolds-speaking-feuds/">reportedly told</a> <em>EW</em> after the split. “That way he can always be working with his favorite actor and his favorite director.” (Though that quote seems prescient, the pair would go on to make up and work together again on 2012’s History channel series <em>Hatfields &amp; McCoys</em>. )</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Waterworld</em>, about a waterlogged society, became perhaps the most notorious of Hollywood “flops.” Even though it ultimately grossed over $250 million worldwide, its bloated $175 million production budget was the most expensive in Hollywood history at the time; the film’s marginal profits were <a href="https://screenrant.com/how-much-money-waterworld-lost-box-office-bomb/">swallowed</a> in marketing and production costs. Reynolds commented in a <a href="https://edcaesar.co.uk/2008/09/14/kevin-costner-sunday-times/">2008 interview</a> that the pressure was intense: “The press were after us from early on, willing us to fail.” It didn’t help that Costner displayed diva behavior on set, making finicky demands of production and <a href="https://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/articles/2895997/kevin-costner-difficult-reputation-waterworld/">reportedly</a> lounging in an “$1800-a-day oceanfront villa” while the crew <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150729011111/http://moviepilot.com/web/20150729011111/http://moviepilot.com/posts/3402322">reportedly</a> languished in shoddier quarters. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, <em>Waterworld</em>, which has since enjoyed a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20200916-waterworld-at-25-reappraising-cinemas-biggest-flop">markedly</a> warmer <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a33443888/why-waterworld-is-actually-good-25th-anniversary-essay/">critical reception</a>, didn’t fully sink Costner’s career; it took a second post-apocalyptic flop, even stranger than the first, to do that. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>The Postman</em>,<em> </em>directed by Costner, is a true oddity. Considered a post-apocalyptic Western a la <em>The Road</em>, it clocks in at three hours and boasts a screenplay by absolute GOAT Brian Helgeland, writer of a range of bangers from <em>Mystic River</em> to <em>A Knight’s Tale</em>. Fun fact: Helgeland won the Oscar for <em>L.A. Confidential</em> and a Razzie for <em>Postman</em> in the same weekend. <a href="https://ew.com/gallery/oscar-winners-who-have-razzies/">The Razzies</a> took delight in perpetually nominating Costner and all his projects throughout the ’90s; <em>The Postman</em> was like Christmas come early for the infamous “worst-of” awards, which gave the film the prize in five different categories and later nominated it for Worst Picture of the Decade. (It lost to <em>Showgirls</em>). </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unlike <em>Waterworld</em>, <em>Postman</em>’s reception has stayed flaccid over time, largely thanks to the bleakly authoritarian, pseudo-fascist ideology that undergirds its story of a lonely troubadour who tells people false stories of a new US government springing up to replace the one that no longer exists, spreading the myth until it sparks a real movement. Helgeland said in a <a href="https://guru.bafta.org/brian-helgeland-screenwriters-lecture">2012 interview</a> that he wrote Costner’s unnamed character as a con man, spinning a darkly satirical fantasy of American greatness, but Costner wanted the character to be more “sympathetic” and “sincere.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Helgeland noted this is where the film “went wrong” — but for Costner, the vision he committed to film was clearly the vision he wanted: an essentially hopeful, essentially kind, but fundamentally conservative vision of American greatness. And he’s continued to build that narrative, more or less, ever since.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Costner’s directorial and ideological oeuvre has stayed consistent since </strong><strong><em>Wolves</em></strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although <em>The Postman</em> flopped so badly it essentially paused Costner’s career for half a decade, he began a self-made revival with 2003’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rd1tXbsOGxs"><em>Open Range</em></a>, which revived: 1) Costner in the lead 2) directing himself 3) in a panoramic western 4) as a lone hero standing up to injustice, armed only with a bunch of guns and a Personal Code. <em>Open Range </em>met a warm critical and audience reception, and Costner’s career meandered back on track through the 2000s and early 2010s with a wide range of films. He took smaller roles in ensemble movies like <em>The Company Men</em> (2010) and romantic leads in rom-coms like 2005’s eyebrow-raising flop <em>Rumor Has It</em> (where he sleeps with three generations of women in one family). </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">His most mainstream hit in this period, <em>Hidden Figures</em> (2016), saw him once again in a white savior role, albeit a historical one, facilitating structural change at NASA.  The film’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNK8FCFpmm4">most famous scene</a> has him taking out his frustration at systemic inequality by physically destroying a segregated bathroom sign. It was on the heels of that renewed success that <em>Yellowstone</em> creator Taylor Sheridan came calling in 2017. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rest, as viewers of that juggernaut know, is history: Costner’s cantankerous relationship with Sheridan notwithstanding, he propelled the show, about an iconoclastic family of maverick ranchers, to becoming <a href="https://www.vox.com/22759551/yellowstone-kevin-costner-paramount-peacock-tv">TV’s biggest hit</a> since <em>Game of Thrones</em>. And despite rumors swirling about why he left after five seasons, leaving the show to flounder to complete a sixth without him, he <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/kevin-costner-disappointed-rumors-yellowstone-exit-1235927434/">claims</a> he still loves that world and would even come back to it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s easy to see why Costner loves <em>Yellowstone</em>: Sheridan’s universe of morally off-center individuals playing by their own rules fully aligns with all of Costner’s major works to date; in 2018, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/08/arts/television/kevin-costner-interview.html">called</a> his character, John Dutton, equivalent to “a modern-day CEO.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Costner’s conservatism isn’t that of the extreme far right; recall that he <a href="https://www.politico.com/blogs/click/2012/05/kevin-costner-waiting-on-obamas-call-124733">supported</a> Obama in both terms, <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/kevin-costner-blasts-american-politics-140038203.html">thinks</a> Michelle Obama would make a good candidate, and faced major backlash among his <em>Yellowstone</em> faithful when he publicly supported Liz Cheney’s failed 2022 bid for reelection after her stand against the January 6 insurrection. In <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2022/11/10/yellowstone-kevin-costner-john-dutton-season-5-preview/8296024001/">an interview</a> where he touted Cheney’s “brave, clear-headed stance,” he also said he wished politicians “had a bigger vision and more of a morality about how they see the country evolving.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Costner, that morality seems to boil down to a kind of broad populism. “I feel I’ve made a movie for the people, period,” he recently <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/05/kevin-costner-horizon-an-american-saga-yellowstone-controversy-1235907679/">told Deadline</a> about <em>Horizon</em>. “This isn’t a movie from me. I felt like it was my turn in my career to tell a story. This is the one I choose to tell. It’s just my turn.”  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The story he seems to be telling in <em>Horizon</em> is one of settler communities facing and overcoming hardships, embracing the call of the West in the 1850s and ’60s, and battling Indigenous Americans, who are themselves trying to assert their identity and maintain their way of life amid encroaching colonization. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Or, at least, that’s the story he may be telling. Eventually. The story onscreen in <em>Horizon</em>’s first chapter is an incongruous muddle with a bizarre, difficult-to-parse script that often vibes like Thornton Wilder writing dialogue for the Shire. Subplots that never connect play out amid sweeping vistas and a constantly bombastic soundtrack, as though someone ran John Ford and Sergio Leone through ChatGPT and got an enthusiastic community theater troupe to fully commit to the bit. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Amid all of it, there&#8217;s that horrific Apache raid — conveying what, exactly? Unfortunately, it’s too early to tell; its settler apologetics coast on a thin layer of empathy for a small group of pacifist Apache characters who disappear halfway through the movie, presumably to return in later films. Where any of this is going, or if any of it will even carry over to the second film, is unclear. A final hasty montage appears unprompted at the end of the film — a long, confusing barrage of disjointed clips that could be an attempt to wrap up the current plot, preview the next movie, or just quickly use up all the footage they ran out of time to squeeze into this one. Who knows?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What is clear is the sense of gravitas, of a man with a strong mission carrying it out at long last. Costner’s ego fills every frame; we can sense from the outset how desperately he wants this film sequence to restore to him the industry’s <em>Wolves</em>-era respect for his artistry and talent as a director. As it stands, however, there’s too much that’s baffling and unchecked about this project to make that likely. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If, however, Costner means what he says about making a film for “the people,” he might have better luck. Currently, despite its muddled, messy state, the audience score for <em>Horizon</em> on Rotten Tomatoes currently <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/horizon_an_american_saga_chapter_1">hovers</a> around 70 percent. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Will it be enough to make up for Costner <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/06/02/kevin-costner-risked-home-to-fund-100m-30-year-film-series/">mortgaging</a> his beachfront Santa Barbara mansion in order to create the ultimate American cinema?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Probably not, but it wouldn’t be an American dream if it weren’t giant, over the top, and fueled less by reason than by sentiment. All in all, that’s the essence of Costner himself — and why <em>Horizon</em> might surprise us in the end.</p>

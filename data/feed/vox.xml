<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/350915/icc-arrest-netanyahu-israel-sinwar-hamas-khan-prosecutor-gallant-idf-haniyeh">International Criminal Court (ICC)</a> has formally issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif for war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The arrest warrants do not guarantee that the men will be tried at The Hague, the Dutch city where the ICC is located. Nor do they guarantee any of them will even be arrested.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But they do make life more complicated for Gallant and Netanyahu in particular. (It’s unclear whether or not Deif is currently alive.) Both Israelis will find it more difficult to travel abroad, as signatories to the treaty that created the ICC are obligated to arrest and turn over those accused of crimes. That means “there are now 124 countries” — all&nbsp;<a href="https://asp.icc-cpi.int/states-parties">signatories</a> —&nbsp;“where they would be unwise to travel,” Adil Haque, a law professor at Rutgers University, told Vox.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And the warrants will likely be a complicating factor for some of Israel’s allies. Some have domestic laws prohibiting the transfer of weapons to nations that might use them to commit atrocity crimes. Others may find the warrants put a strain on diplomatic relationships.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The warrants <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-state-palestine-icc-pre-trial-chamber-i-rejects-state-israels-challenges">accuse Gallant and Netanyahu</a> of violating the laws of international armed conflict by intentionally depriving civilians in Gaza of “food, water, and medicine and medical supplies, as well as fuel and electricity” by consistently blocking humanitarian aid into Gaza. They also accuse both men of intentionally directing attacks against civilians in Gaza in at least two instances. <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-state-palestine-icc-pre-trial-chamber-i-issues-warrant-arrest-mohammed-diab-ibrahim">Deif is also accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity</a> including murder, torture, and sexual violence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel has denounced the issuance of the warrants; Netanyahu’s office said Thursday, “There is nothing more just than the war that Israel has been waging in Gaza.” At least 44,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel began its assault on the territory last year in response to an October 7 attack by Hamas that killed <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/israel-hamas-war-death-toll-1-year/story?id=114458943">roughly 1,200 people</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Are Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant actually going to be arrested by the ICC?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Netanyahu and Gallant are in no danger of an immediate arrest. Israel is not a signatory to the ICC, meaning it doesn’t recognize the Court’s jurisdiction in its territory. The US — Israel’s closest and most powerful ally — isn’t a signatory either, and in the past <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/12/14/us-sanctions-international-criminal-court">has even sanctioned ICC officials</a> attempting to investigate war crimes committed by <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/03/05/icc-greenlights-afghanistan-investigation">the CIA and US military personnel in Afghanistan</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That means Israeli law enforcement isn’t obligated to arrest Netanyahu or Gallant, and the US is highly unlikely to pressure either man to turn himself in.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel has tried to argue that the ICC doesn’t have jurisdiction over Israelis at all, but the state of Palestine has been a signatory since 2015 —&nbsp;so crimes committed by anyone in occupied Palestinian territory like Gaza are, in fact, the ICC’s purview.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel has also tried to claim that the Court shouldn’t be involved in this case because Israel has a strong and competent court system; though that may be true, that court system is not investigating either man for the crimes the ICC prosecutor claims.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan recommended the arrest warrants in May; at the time, he also recommended warrants for former Hamas leaders who have since been killed by Israeli forces. The Court doesn’t try people in absentia, so the cases against the dead would be moot.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Court does not have its own police force and relies on signatory nations’ law enforcement for arrests. Nations generally don’t make arrests on behalf of the ICC outside of their borders, which means the most likely path for Netanyahu and Gallant to end up in ICC custody would be apprehension by a nation they’re visiting that has a record of taking international treaty obligations very seriously.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The warrants could have other consequences outside of arrests</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although Netanyahu and Gallant are reasonably safe from arrest, the warrants could have diplomatic and military consequences for Israel, especially in Europe.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think that even Israel&#8217;s allies who are ICC member states will face internal domestic pressure to cut off diplomatic contacts with Netanyahu,” Haque said. For example, “not only can he not travel to Germany, I also would be surprised if [German leaders] will fly to Israel and be photographed with him shaking hands and whatnot, or even to talk to him electronically, just because within their country, they&#8217;re going to get a lot of domestic pushback.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Staunch allies that aren’t ICC member countries — namely the United States — aren’t as likely to change their relationship with Israel, however. “The ICC has no credibility and these allegations have been refuted by the U.S. government,” Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Florida), President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for national security adviser, <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelgwaltz/status/1859589936967512244">wrote on X</a>. “You can expect a strong response to the antisemitic bias of the ICC &amp; UN come January.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant could also complicate weapons transfers from European states and <a href="https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2024-10/news/canada-and-uk-restrict-arms-sales-israel-over-gaza-war">nations with laws limiting transfers</a> in situations in which there’s credible reason to believe a country will use them to commit atrocities.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We&#8217;ve already seen a Dutch court saying that the Netherlands cannot send <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/dutch-supreme-court-hears-arguments-over-exporting-fighter-jet-parts-to-israel/">fighter jet [parts]</a>, for example, to Israel. We&#8217;ve seen the termination or expiration of various <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/03/nx-s1-5098300/uk-suspends-arms-israel">arms contracts that the UK had</a>,” said <a href="https://www.wm.edu/as/government/faculty-directory/zvobgo_k.php">Kelebogile Zvobgo</a>, professor of government at the College of William &amp; Mary. Those decisions came in the wake of proceedings at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), in which the court agreed to hear a case <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g9g63jl17o">accusing Israel of genocide</a>, and ordered Israel to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/01/26/1227078791/icj-israel-genocide-gaza-palestinians-south-africa">stop any actions</a> that could cause genocide. (The <a href="https://theconversation.com/what-are-the-icj-and-the-icc-and-how-do-their-power-and-jurisdiction-differ-230573">ICJ is the UN’s court</a>, which focuses on inter-country disputes.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are many steps between the issuance of a warrant in the ICC and a judgment at The Hague, including the arrest of Netanyahu and Gallant, as well as gathering evidence that connects the men to the specific alleged crimes — something that’s not simple in active war zones. But as Zvobgo pointed out, Khan, the ICC chief prosecutor, “only brought charges that he thought would realistically result in conviction.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And even if the men accused do not end up in The Hague, Zvobgo said, “even if Netanyahu never steps on Dutch soil, never stands trial at the ICC, he will forever be someone who has been charged with atrocities.” And the charges won’t go away once the war ends, Zvobgo added: “There is no statute of limitations on a trial.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Every episode of <em>Say Nothing</em>, the FX/Hulu show based on the nonfiction book of the same name, ends with a disclaimer: “Gerry Adams has always denied being a member of the IRA or participating in any IRA-related violence.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Disclaimers aren’t unusual in film and television (arguably <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24147537/baby-reindeer-who-is-martha-stalking">even more shows</a> should employ them) but the Adams disclaimer still stands out.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Say Nothing</em> takes place across and beyond the 30-year period in late 20th-century Ireland known as “The Troubles.” Viewers experience this time and its fallout largely through the eyes of Catholic combatants in the Irish Republican Army (IRA), Dolours Price (played on the show by Lola Petticrew, and later Maxine Peake), and to a lesser extent Brendan “The Dark” Hughes (played by Anthony Boyle as a youth, Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as the elder Hughes), along with those affected by their actions. It was an era marked by bloodshed and fear, with political and psychological ramifications that can still be felt by many in the country today.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The problem? If this disclaimer is accurate, it would negate or at least undermine nearly everything the <em>Say Nothing </em>viewer has just witnessed. So what’s going on here? And what’s the real effect of this repeated legal language? Let’s break it down, piece by piece.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is Gerry Adams?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Officially, today, Gerry Adams is a retired Irish politician. He’s played in <em>Say Nothing</em> by Josh Finan as a young radical, and Michael Colgan as an older statesman.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 1998, Adams was integral to and present for the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-65294128">peace deal</a> brokered by US President Bill Clinton that brought an end to the everyday violence in Northern Ireland. Adams did this in his capacity as the president of the Sinn Féin party, a position he held from 1983 to 2018.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Throughout The Troubles, Sinn Féin was widely <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sinn-Fein">understood</a> to be the political wing of the IRA.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GettyImages-627729924.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="A man in glasses stares forward." title="A man in glasses stares forward." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="The real Gerry Adams, circa the 1980s." data-portal-copyright="" />
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>And what is the IRA?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The IRA stands for the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Irish-Republican-Army">Irish Republican Army</a>, a paramilitary association that was first founded under that name in 1919, although it grew out of a long history of Irish resistance to British rule. The purpose of the IRA was to reunite Ireland by reclaiming the whole of the island, specifically the area that became known after the partition of Ireland in 1921 as Northern Ireland.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Irish Republican Army was known in particular for its use of guerrilla warfare tactics, from <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3gBpB1kl43kMQkGg4bxhMZ7/the-mystery-behind-northern-ireland-s-26-5m-bank-heist">bank robberies</a> to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Omagh-bombing">car bombs</a>, as well as the practice of <a href="https://www.iclvr.ie/en/iclvr/pages/thedisappeared">disappearing</a> accused informers, known as “touts,” and turncoats. The US labeled the IRA a terrorist group in the <a href="https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/terrorism-under-democratic-conditions-case-ira-irish-republican">1980s</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What were the British doing in Ireland?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The British had been politically and militarily involved with their Irish neighbors to the west since the Anglo-Norman Invasion in 1169. That conquest kicked off 800 years of dispossession, bloodshed, and strife across the region and usually along religious lines — with the majority Catholics on one side, and the Protestant minority aligned with British forces.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This timeline is briefly mentioned at the very top of the TV series <em>Say Nothing</em>. What’s less explored on screen, but takes up a good chunk of the meticulously reported nonfiction book of the same name — written by journalist Patrick Radden Keefe, who also executive produced the show — is the history of the conflict. Let’s go back, if not quite to the beginning. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 1914, after centuries of rebellion and retaliation, <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/legislativescrutiny/parliamentandireland/collections/home-rule-1914/gov-of-ireland-act-1914/">“Home Rule”</a> — under which the Irish would be in charge of themselves — was set to become law. Shortly before it was to be enacted, however, the British made the change contingent on military conscription, right at the start of the first World War.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 1916, Irish Republicans fought back, in a rebellion known as the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/history/1916/">Easter Rising</a>. This operation was a resounding failure that would nonetheless endear the nascent IRA to the Irish public, after the resulting British occupation of Dublin saw the jailing of 1,400 Republicans and the execution of 16 of their leaders. Following the brutal War of Independence and the Anglo-Irish Treaty, the Partition of Ireland was established in 1921, dividing the country into two self-governing entities, and a year later the Irish Free State was established in the south.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By the late 1960s, things weren’t great for the Catholics of Northern Ireland. There was clear evidence of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/zs2ncxs">discrimination</a> against Catholics in the north in hiring, housing, voting, and policing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At this time, the IRA was by most accounts not engaged in armed struggle, but a bombing on the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising helped inspire the formation of the <a href="https://bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-11313364">“Ulster Volunteer Force</a>” — another paramilitary group, but this time with British loyalties and, as per <em>Say Nothing</em>, occasionally government support, whose operations were largely marked by gun violence against Catholic civilians. This was the approximate start of what is known as The Troubles.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Say Nothing</em>, both book and show, depicts the resumed violence among the IRA, British forces, and loyalist paramilitary groups, which lasted from around 1968 to the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, as well as the fallout for Irish families that, in many ways, persist today.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Okay, Gerry Adams is a politician with a group affiliated with the IRA. But does that mean he’s responsible for the violence?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That might be a complicated question, were it not for the fact that <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/gerry-adams-ira-denial-a-lie-veteran-republican-says-in-tv-series-1.4020604">pretty</a> <a href="https://www.britannica.com/summary/Gerry-Adams">much</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Secret-History-Ira-Gerry-Thirty/dp/0141028769">everyone</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-68028109">agrees</a> that Adams not only participated in the Irish Republican Army and violent attacks the group carried out, but personally orchestrated much of it. This is exactly what we see on screen throughout <em>Say Nothing</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Keefe’s book carefully details<em> </em>Adams’s history in the movement, including the conception and execution of robberies and bombings, such as the Old Bailey bombing in London that saw Dolours Price and her sister Marian arrested and jailed for eight years. Among other sources and interviews, that book used the first-person accounts collected for the Belfast Project, an oral history of The Troubles compiled by researchers at Boston College from 2000 to 2006. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In other words, many, many IRA members are on the record saying that Gerry Adams was among them. Dolours Price has said he was her “<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1326593/Gerry-Adams-was-my-commander-says-IRA-bomber.html">commander</a>.” Brendan Hughes has <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried">said</a> he never did anything without Adams’s say-so. (Additionally, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/114076.A_Secret_History_of_the_IRA">historians</a> and contemporaneous media accounts link Adams to IRA violence.)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>If all that’s true, how did Gerry Adams get elected to political office?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Adams’s status as an IRA leader didn’t hurt his political life; if anything, it helped! Adams’s political persona has always been, knowingly, built on his <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-27238602">Republican bona fides</a>. In the book, Keefe details the way Adams would deny membership in the IRA out of one side of his mouth and raise the specter of violence out of the other, but you don’t need to decode his speeches to see the connections. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 1972, Adams was released from prison — where he was being held without charge, although he claims only as a political activist — to participate in ceasefire talks at the request of the IRA. He was 24. Nine years later, he played a “key role,” as per the BBC, in encouraging IRA hunger strikes, which saw 27-year-old IRA leader <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-56937259">Bobby Sands</a> starve himself to death in prison, just one month after Sands was elected MP.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Adams was himself elected as a Belfast West MP two years later, but refused to sit in the House of Commons, a Sinn Féin policy. That same year, 1983, he became the head of the party. A decade later, secret peace talks well underway, he carried the coffin of Thomas Begley, an IRA bomber who died in the Shankill bombing, after a premature explosion.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/Ep-7_23-10-23_0028R.jpg.webp?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4613147178592,100,93.077370564282" alt="A young man in glasses and a blazer" title="A young man in glasses and a blazer" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Josh Finan as young Gerry Adams. | FX" data-portal-copyright="FX" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">During the approximately five-year talks, Adams was meeting with more moderate Irish political parties, representing the promise of bringing the IRA to the table. His status as IRA leadership was key to his stewardship of Sinn Féin — not just at the outset, but throughout his entire career.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>So if this is all such an open secret, why is the disclaimer included?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In an interview with <a href="https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a62764745/say-nothing-hulu-gerry-adams-ira-disclaimer-explained/">Town &amp; Country</a>, author and executive producer Keefe explained, “It was ultimately FX legal that determined that we needed that disclaimer.&#8221; The reason why is simple: Adams himself. As Keefe told T&amp;C, &#8220;It&#8217;s not that he will take issue with little bits and pieces of what we show. He takes issue with the whole premise of the series, which is that he was in the IRA.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the show’s disclaimer seems to be more corporate necessity than rhetorical flourish, it ends up being a bit of a gift to the <em>Say Nothing</em> producers. It would be hard to find a more succinct way to communicate the doublethink necessary for life during The Troubles. It puts a darkly comic, increasingly absurd stinger on each episode of a show that sees only occasional lightness and crackles of Irish wit, while also giving a sense of the unspeakability of what you’re watching unfold.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s what Irish poet Seamus Heaney calls “the tight gag of place and times” in <a href="https://www.blueridgejournal.com/poems/sh-what.htm">“Whatever you say, say nothing</a>,” the poem from which the book and show take their name. This is the omertà that comes with the existence of the IRA. It’s a policy that, in this setting, makes intuitive if not entirely practical sense. Of course an insurgent political group can’t go shouting in the streets, and your friends and neighbors had better stay quiet, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the book and show, we see Gerry Adams employing his own baroque version of it early on: denying to arresting officers not just his role in the IRA but himself. He’s not Gerry Adams, he claims, but a man named John.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Price, on the other hand, doesn’t deny her name nor that she supports the goals of the IRA. She declares herself not guilty for the London bombing simply because she doesn’t recognize English authority.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Later in the show, as in real life, Price and Hughes definitively break this code of silence, speaking to the Belfast Project — and in Price&#8217;s case, some notable others — about the things they did and the little good they felt it accomplished. The Boston College tapes weren&#8217;t intended to be distributed until after the participants’ deaths, but some were later subpoenaed in the renewed investigation into the death of Jean McConville, the IRA disappearance that frames <em>Say Nothing</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Adams never cracks, though, in the show or reality. But Adams <em>isn’t</em> saying nothing. His persistent denial works as an admission that the methods of the Irish Republican Army violate some part of the collective moral consciousness (not to mention the law), while hinting that obscuring the facts doesn’t violate Adams’s own. It’s worth noting that Adams had real-life political colleagues, including eventual deputy first minister <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/02/martin-mcguinness-biography-divides-irish-opinion-as-he-did-in-life">Martin McGuinness</a>, who did not disavow their time in the IRA.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For some of Adams’s former compatriots, Price and Hughes among them, his public ascent was not about peacemaking, but little more than the fulfillment of his political aspirations. For those IRA members, even the signing of the Good Friday agreement was not something to be heralded; it leaves Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom — for as long as its majority Protestant citizenry chooses.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The episode disclaimers, along with this tension, effectively make Gerry Adams the show’s villain — willing to ask others for the ultimate sacrifice; not even loyal to the cause. You watch Adams, along with Price and Hughes, plan and execute acts that wound their enemies, their neighbors, their cities, and eventually themselves; you’re shown his rise, their fall; and over and over, you see his denial. But the only people who truly say nothing are the dead.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Welcome to Know-It-All. In the age of intellectual property grabs, docudramas, and so very many sequels, it can be difficult to find a way into the complicated worlds we see on screen. In this series, Vox experts explain what you need to know to get into the latest hot release.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Human existence is full of an unfathomably infinite number of things — real and fake, abstract ideas and actual physical objects, past and present and future — to consider, fixate on, learn about. Still, for many men, there’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2023/09/14/roman-empire-trend-men-tiktok/">one thing</a> they specifically think about constantly: <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2018/6/19/17469176/roman-empire-maps-history-explained">the Roman Empire</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Director Ridley Scott, a man, very clearly thinks about it a lot. But maybe not in exactly the same way others do.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Friday, Scott’s new movie <em>Gladiator II</em> will officially hit theaters. The sequel stars Paul Mescal, a man with the most adored side profile in Hollywood, and is set within the same world — with many of the same characters — as <em>Gladiator</em>, <a href="https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2001/memorable-moments">Scott’s Oscar-winning film from 2000</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many things happen in the movie. Mescal’s character, Lucius, bites a CGI baboon and chokes it with handcuffs; Denzel Washington’s Macrinus flounces around in caftans, terrorizing Roman senators about loyalty. There’s also a lot that doesn’t seem quite based in history: a naval battle in the Coliseum where sharks eat human competitors,&nbsp;at least one domesticated battle rhino, and what seems to be a newspaper despite Ancient Rome predating the printing press.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While your mileage may vary on the movie, there’s something entertaining about how Scott imagines Ancient Rome to be more exciting than it was. Maybe one day our descendants will imagine our mundane lives with as much anachronistic gusto as Scott.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To get a better understanding of what Scott was aiming for in this movie and what he was inspired by, I chatted with <a href="https://www.vox.com/authors/christian-paz">Vox senior writer Christian Paz</a>, another man who thinks about Ancient Rome often. Since middle school, Paz tells me, he was obsessed with the Roman Empire and that fixation has only grown stronger in adulthood. Paz is also slightly fascinated by Paul Mescal and, now, Ridley Scott’s off-kilter version of Ancient Rome. We talked about Roman naval battles, the egos of emperors, and what is, really, so endlessly fascinating about this period in history.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>How often do you think about the Roman Empire?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think about it quite a lot. Its influence and legacy are everywhere. I see reminders of it when I walk around DC, when I scroll TikTok and get videos about the Galactic Senate, the Galactic Republic, and the Empire, and when I watch videos about what ancient and historical peoples <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/vqJai-flawE?si=_nRuAufBj30uLwK0">used to cook and eat</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Also I took Latin in high school.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>How often do you think Ridley Scott thinks about the Roman Empire?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Insofar as he thinks about big battles, big historical events, and believes in the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/non-fiction/napoleon-ridley-scott-great-man-myth-history/">Great Man theory of history</a>, probably often enough to want to recreate the magic of the original <em>Gladiator</em>. And he probably wants an Oscar, no?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>If his movies reflect his personal desires and needs, I believe that man wants a lot of things. And sometimes I think this world simply does not have enough to offer Ridley Scott, so he sensationalizes. It feels like he is constantly tarting up the world he lives in or learned about.</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>For example, in </strong><strong><em>Gladiator II</em></strong><strong>, Paul Mescal bites a baboon in one of the arenas. Were there actual baboons in Roman gladiator fights?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lol, most definitely not. I was trying to track down where he got this idea for baboons, and apparently it came to him from a trip he took to South Africa where he saw some <a href="https://www.avclub.com/ridley-scott-gladiator-ii-baboons">tourist approach a baboon in a parking lot</a>. The baboon, naturally, freaked out when the man tried to pet it, and attacked — and that seems to be Scott’s inspiration for wanting this group of captives and future gladiators to fight something “formidable.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But how would [the Romans] capture and release these, like, 12 baboons?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Well, obviously one would need to train and house the baboons too!&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Also, if these are based on the baboons Scott saw in South Africa — the Roman legions never got that far!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>There’s also a moment where they fill the Colosseum with water and stage a naval battle with sharks.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Right, and to prep for that battle, Paul’s character is forced to practice rowing a boat until his hands bleed and blister. God,<strong> </strong>this Colosseum scene was actually ridiculous because, where are they finding these sharks? How would they catch them and transport them back to Rome?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Modern-day aquariums have a tough time </strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/7/26/16033996/white-shark-aquarium"><strong>keeping sharks alive</strong></a><strong>. But Ridley Scott believes Ancient Rome could.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sharks can’t really survive in freshwater, so where are they holding these massive amounts of salt water and tanks and sharks? Flooding the Colosseum with water was actually <a href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/encyclopaedia_romana/gladiators/naumachiae.html">a thing</a> that was done <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/ancient-rome-once-filled-the-colosseum-up-with-water-and-staged-epic-mock-sea-battle">a few times</a> earlier in the Roman imperial period — but that was fresh water transported through aqueducts and diverted from the Tiber River. On every level, that’s actually an insane decision to make.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GL2-FF-087K.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=9.6777777777778,0,80.644444444444,100" alt="The Roman Colosseum full of spectators watching a mock naval battle taking place in the flooded center." title="The Roman Colosseum full of spectators watching a mock naval battle taking place in the flooded center." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="The simulated naval battle in &lt;em&gt;Gladiator II&lt;/em&gt;. You can’t see them but there are sharks in the water. | Paramount Pictures" data-portal-copyright="Paramount Pictures" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">But mock naval battles were once actually fought in the Colosseum, or in bigger locations around Rome, as early as <a href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/encyclopaedia_romana/gladiators/naumachia.html">Julius Caesar’s reign</a> toward the end of the Republic. They were a hugely extravagant and expensive thing to do, so they didn’t happen too frequently. Even gladiatorial games were an irregular occurrence —&nbsp;happening like three to four times a year at most&nbsp;— because they were just so expensive to hold. And that’s the bottom line of why they went out of commission. It was just too expensive to run an empire, and to keep these circuses going contributed to the empire’s resource drain<strong> </strong>—&nbsp;and the gradual spread of Christianity finished the games off<strong>.</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>How do they get the sharks in and out?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Movie magic.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>There’s also one gladiator who rides a trained rhino. I’m guessing that’s a bit of embellishment too.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yup, another wild decision — made for great cinema action, but it’s not likely that Romans would train and ride a rhino into battle. There are records of rhinoceroses being brought into the Colosseum — like during the celebrations for when it was <a href="https://www.tertullian.org/fathers/martial_on_the_games_of_domitian_01_text.htm">inaugurated</a> and when the emperor Commodus, the inspiration for Joaquin Phoenix’s villain from the first Gladiator, <a href="https://ancienthistorybulletin.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AHBReviewsHopeOnToner.pdf">killed a rhinoceros</a> with spears and arrows from an elevated platform <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Day_Commodus_Killed_a_Rhino/gIKCoAEACAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;printsec=frontcover">in 192 AD</a>. When used, rhinos would fight other animals instead of gladiators.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Could you imagine all that effort to bring a rhino into the Colosseum, telling all your friends about it, getting the gladiators set, and then have it just run around killing a lion — a lion that may have been hanging around in the bowels of the Colosseum for ages because everyone was out trying to find a rhino? So then the rhino waits for another crew to find a hippo or something and the cycle repeats itself!&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">God, I’d hate to be a rhino and just be killed because of ego.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the whole point of having rhinos and other exotic animals in the Colosseum was to represent and demonstrate the power, wealth, and reach of the empire, and more specifically, of the emperor.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Another surprising thing: the Roman newspaper that one of the senators is reading.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This was one of the more ridiculous things in the film; it has been <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/gladiator-ii-fact-fiction-ai-1236047785/">ridiculed</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/19/gladiator-ii-ridley-scott-historical-inaccuracies-rhinos">extensively</a>. It was actually in two scenes, if I recall — in the pseudo-cafe in which a senator is having a beverage (which I will assume is wine, or a spiced wine, because the Romans didn’t really have tea or coffee yet) and then at the senator’s home when Macrinus shows up.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For those who need clarification: Paper, of the mass-produced variety, has not been invented yet, never mind the printing press.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Sadly, the Ancient Romans never knew the font that is Times New Roman.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Romans did have a version of, like, important announcements and news that were <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Acta">inscribed</a> into a stone tablet and which was primarily placed in public places — the Acta Diurna, or “Acts of the Day.” But it wasn’t very widely circulated to people&nbsp;— it might have been sent to some senators but was primarily shared with governors and administrative government officials.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Was the gladiator system — that wins could make you a celebrity and eventually a free man — real?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes and no.&nbsp; It was absolutely a system with schools and cells, and sponsors and teachers, and funding and people who fed you and tended to you; you were specially trained, and became a master essentially of a particular kind of weapon and armor and dress usually based on your ethnic or national origin —&nbsp;like Gauls, Thracians, Britons. Gladiators lost personhood and became a form of property — prisoners of war, enslaved people, people with significant debts who sought to repay those debts, and poor, lower-class people who volunteered. So the whole operation that Denzel Washington’s character is running was very real.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yes, you could essentially become a celebrity, and aristocratic women, of high society, would take them as lovers —&nbsp;but even if you got discharged or won your freedom after winning or surviving matches, there wasn’t much you could do in society —&nbsp;so they would return to teach other gladiators or fight again as free men.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>The real gladiator “system” feels more like an </strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area/24115013/pyramid-scheme-america-mlm-multilevel-marketing-wellness"><strong>MLM</strong></a><strong> than whatever’s happening in Scott’s movie. Why do you think Scott is so obsessed with it?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Honestly, I was thinking that too. When you’re in, you’re kind of stuck. You get nice perks on occasion but it was a nasty, brutish, short life. And I think that is probably part of his fascination — to trade up freedom for something greater, or to make the most of the hellish lot life has cast you.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I feel like you and Ridley Scott think about different things when thinking about the Roman Empire. What is it about the Roman Empire that fascinates you?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think we think very differently about the Roman Empire. Scott loves the battles and the concept of great men — and don’t get me wrong, me too! My favorite games are Rome Total War and Empire Total War. In middle school I recreated a Roman camp in Gaul in my school’s cafeteria for a class project and made a set of armor like what Julius Caesar’s legionaries probably wore.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GL2_29680RC2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.568687156345,100,78.86262568731" alt="Denzel Washington in blue and gold Roman dress sitting on a golden throne-like chair." title="Denzel Washington in blue and gold Roman dress sitting on a golden throne-like chair." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Denzel Washington in &lt;em&gt;Gladiator II&lt;/em&gt;. Washington is a gladiator owner, which seems like a very predatory MLM by today’s standards. | Paramount Pictures" data-portal-copyright="Paramount Pictures" />
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Did this make you popular? Like, did you have a lot of friends?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Um. First of all, that’s rude. And second of all, I didn’t go there to make friends. I came to win and put on a spectacle.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But also, I was fascinated by the politics of the Roman Republic, specifically — the concept of the senate, the idea of the “Senate and the People of Rome” being the source of power and legitimacy, of consuls and of aediles and of quaestors, of a civil service. And I was fascinated by its fall, the rise of a rag-tag system of tyrannical government in the form of the empire —&nbsp;which, for most people, didn’t really mean anything different in their lives but changed the world.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And so I think specifically of the tenuousness of democracy, the appeal of strongmen, and the fact that what binds so many nations today — representative democracy and imagined community —&nbsp;has its roots in Rome’s centuries of existence. I think what fascinates me the most is the “fall” of Rome —&nbsp;something that <em>Gladiator II </em>delves into with its talk about the “dream” of Rome, the threat of “tyranny,” and the idea of “civitas” or Roman citizenship. They were all such amorphous, delicate concepts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What do you think men who think about the Roman Empire a lot will think about </strong><strong><em>Gladiator II</em></strong><strong>?&nbsp; Will the historical inaccuracies and sensationalizing turn them off?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">True Roman history nerds will probably be annoyed and laugh at the inaccuracies and sensationalizing. But let’s be honest. We’re going to see this movie either because of the nostalgia, because we want to see battles and fights on the big screen, because of Denzel Washington’s stunning performance (which will be noted in my Letterboxd review because he’s basically the main character), or because we want to admire Paul Mescal’s … everything.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>In the next life, may you be reborn as a baboon in Paul Mescal’s Ancient Rome.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I am ready to be bitten, Paul.</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), an <a href="https://www.vox.com/donald-trump/384967/matt-gaetz-donald-trump-attorney-general">accused sex offender known for his firm loyalty to Trump</a>, will not lead the Department of Justice. (Gaetz has denied wrongdoing.) Several other lawyers President-elect Donald Trump has close personal ties to, however, remain up for<strong> </strong>top DOJ jobs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This means that, regardless of who eventually becomes attorney general, at least three of the highest jobs in the Justice Department, the office that brings federal prosecutions, will be held by people whose records suggest they will advance Trump’s personal interest. And unlike Gaetz, Trump’s nominees for these three jobs have serious legal credentials and institutional knowledge, and thus are likely to be effective in advancing those interests.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/us/politics/todd-blanche-deputy-attorney-general-trump.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">chose Todd Blanche</a>, the criminal defense lawyer in his <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24126338/trump-new-york-trial-stormy-daniels">New York hush money trial</a> (the one where he faced charges related to money paid to keep a sexual encounter quiet), to be deputy attorney general. That’s the No. 2 job in the Justice Department. The DAG, as this position is known within the department, wields tremendous power over federal criminal prosecutions. If successfully appointed, Blanche will <a href="https://www.justice.gov/doj/office-deputy-attorney-general#:~:text=The%20mission%20of%20the%20ODAG,organizational%20units%20of%20the%20Department.">supervise the 93 regional US attorneys</a> who bring the bulk of all federal prosecutions in the United States. So Blanche will have a great deal of authority over who is prosecuted.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, Trump wants <a href="https://x.com/kleavittnh/status/1857199006146822425">John Sauer</a>, the lawyer who represented him in the Supreme Court case holding that Trump is allowed to use the <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship">powers of the president to commit crimes</a>, to serve as solicitor general. The role <a href="https://www.justice.gov/osg/about-office">oversees the Justice Department’s legal strategy in the Supreme Court</a>, including arguing many of the most important cases. They also decide which cases the DOJ will appeal if the federal government loses a case in a trial court.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another one of Trump’s personal criminal defense lawyers, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/11/14/trump-todd-blanche-deputy-attorney-general">Emil Bove</a>, will serve as principal associate deputy attorney general, and will hold the DAG spot on an acting basis until Blanche or some other Trump nominee is <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/384356/trump-recess-appointments-explained-senate-confirmation-thune-scott-cornyn-cabinet">confirmed or otherwise formally appointed to the job</a>. Unlike the DAG and the solicitor general, Bove’s new role <a href="https://rollcall.com/2024/11/14/trump-picks-legal-defense-team-for-top-justice-department-roles/">does not require Senate confirmation</a>. So he will be able to move into this job on the first day of Trump’s second presidency.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This isn’t the first time a president has tried to put one of his personal lawyers in a position of high responsibility within government. President Lyndon Johnson, for example, <a href="https://thinkwy.org/columns/justice-abe-fortas-life-as-a-lawyers-lawyer-and-a-greek-tragedy/">named Abe Fortas</a>, his friend and personal lawyer, to the Supreme Court in 1965. If you know anything about Fortas’s very brief tenure on the Court, you may know that <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/cautionary-tale-abe-fortas">appointment didn’t end well</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Based strictly on their résumés, all three men are conventionally qualified for these jobs. Both <a href="https://04q.7c7.myftpupload.com/betsy-wright-2/">Blanche</a> and <a href="https://blanchelaw.com/emil-bove/">Bove</a> previously worked as federal prosecutors for nine years before entering private practice. Sauer is a former law clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia who <a href="https://fedsoc.org/contributors/d-john-sauer">previously served Missouri’s solicitor general</a>. It’s easy to see all three joining the Justice Department without much controversy if they were picked by, say, President Nikki Haley.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Trump talks often about using the DOJ to target his political adversaries and people he views as foes. An NPR report on October 22 found that Trump “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/21/nx-s1-5134924/trump-election-2024-kamala-harris-elizabeth-cheney-threat-civil-liberties">made more than 100 threats to prosecute or punish perceived enemies</a>.” That includes a threat to, in Trump’s words, “appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump also accused former Rep. Liz Cheney, a prominent Republican critic of the incoming president, of “TREASON” and threatened “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/21/nx-s1-5134924/trump-election-2024-kamala-harris-elizabeth-cheney-threat-civil-liberties">TELEVISED MILITARY TRIBUNALS</a>.” (Which, if they were to actually happen, would presumably take place in the Defense Department’s legal structure, but could involve some DOJ personnel.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s decision to name Gaetz, a staunch loyalist, to lead the Justice Department created <a href="https://www.vox.com/donald-trump/384967/matt-gaetz-donald-trump-attorney-general">considerable alarm</a>. Historically, the White House has <a href="https://www.vox.com/donald-trump/383152/donald-trump-criminal-indictments-supreme-court-reelected">obeyed strong norms</a> against interfering with Justice Department prosecutorial decisions, but these norms have no legal force. A Trump loyalist like Gaetz could have torn down this barrier altogether. (If someone like him is confirmed atop the Justice Department, that barrier could still go.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s decision to appoint his personal lawyers to top DOJ jobs is equally concerning. Federal lawyers are supposed to represent the interests of the United States, not of any particular politician, while they work for the government. But Trump has selected three people who aren’t simply accustomed to representing his personal interests, but who have also likely collected considerable legal fees from him.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Blanche, Sauer, and Bove’s conventional résumés also mean that, if they use their DOJ posts to pursue Trump’s personal campaign of vengeance, they are likely to be fairly effective in doing so. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Blanche and Sauer still need to be confirmed — assuming that Trump doesn’t <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/384356/trump-recess-appointments-explained-senate-confirmation-thune-scott-cornyn-cabinet">use recess appointments</a> or some other method to get around the Senate confirmation process. But if Trump gets his way, his attorney general will now be backed by people who know the Justice Department and the culture of elite federal lawyers quite well.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Donald Trump’s nominee for attorney general, former<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/13/politics/matt-gaetz-attorney-general?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_google">Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL)</a>, has withdrawn from consideration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He was nominated just over a week ago. Since then, numerous details of a House investigation into alleged sexual misconduct — including a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/21/politics/matt-gaetz-second-sexual-encounter-minor/index.html">CNN report</a> on Thursday that investigators were told Gaetz twice had sex with a 17-year-old girl — have been made public. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gaetz has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, but <a href="https://x.com/mattgaetz/status/1859649045553402285">posted Thursday afternoon on X</a> that he was removing himself from consideration as attorney general because “my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gaetz was a startling pick, not just because of the sexual misconduct allegations that have long loomed over him. He is also<strong> </strong>a longtime Trump loyalist who could have tried to remake the Department of Justice. The department has traditionally adhered to strong norms against interference by the president; Trump and his allies have been explicit <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/381094/trump-second-term-2024-election-justice-department-civil-rights">in arguing that should change</a>. Trump has also repeatedly called for legal action against his political enemies, including <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/21/nx-s1-5134924/trump-election-2024-kamala-harris-elizabeth-cheney-threat-civil-liberties">promising</a> to “appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family,” in 2023.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Enforcing those sorts of threats would have fallen to Gaetz, had he been confirmed by the Senate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before being nominated to be attorney general, Gaetz received press primarily for two things. One is his <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/10/1/23898555/kevinn-mccarthy-speakership-matt-gaetz">longstanding feud with former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy</a> (R-CA), who was eventually ousted in no small part because of Gaetz. The other is the aforementioned<strong> </strong>string of sexual misconduct allegations. Again, Gaetz denied these allegations, and the Justice Department <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/doj-decides-not-charge-rep-matt-gaetz-sex-trafficking-investigation-rcna70839">dropped its investigation into them in 2023</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Gaetz had ended up running that same department, he’d be in a uniquely powerful role. The attorney general is be tasked with overseeing all federal prosecutions, providing legal advice to the president and the Cabinet, and has the final say on any legal stance that the United States takes in court. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of greater significance perhaps is the fact that the attorney general has enormous authority over who is prosecuted, who is allowed to get away with committing federal crimes, and who might be targeted for politically motivated prosecutions in an authoritarian administration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has repeatedly promised “<a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy">retribution</a>” against his Democratic rivals. And his fellow Republicans on the Supreme Court ruled last July that he can order the Justice Department to <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/366855/supreme-court-trump-immunity-betrayal-worst-decisions-anticanon">bring politically motivated prosecutions without consequence</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the first Trump administration, Trump reportedly wanted to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/11/20/18105462/trump-clinton-comey-order-justice">order the Justice Department to prosecute</a> his former political opponent Hillary Clinton and former FBI Director James Comey, but was dissuaded from doing so by White House Counsel Don McGahn. Gaetz’s strong support for Trump, by contrast, made it seem he’d have been much less likely to resist such an order. Whether Trump’s next nominee is cut from the same loyalist cloth remains to be seen.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Just who is Matt Gaetz?<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gaetz has a law degree, and he <a href="https://gaetz.house.gov/about">did previously practice law in northwest Florida</a>. He’s been a representative since 2017, and became known both for stunts on the House floor — like wearing a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/04/politics/gaetz-coronavirus-gas-mask/index.html">gas mask</a> to protest masking policies during the coronavirus pandemic — as well as his <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/10/23/20929023/house-republicans-impeachment-stunt-trump">staunch support for Trump</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2021, it was revealed that Gaetz was the subject of an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/us/politics/matt-gaetz-sex-trafficking-investigation.html">investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The allegations arose out of his relationship with Joel Greenberg, a former county-level tax collector who was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/politics/joel-greenberg-sentencing/index.html">sentenced to 11 years in prison</a> by a federal judge in 2022. Greenberg pled guilty to a wide range of crimes, including underage sex trafficking, wire fraud, identity theft, and conspiring to defraud the federal government. Judge Gregory Presnell, who sentenced Greenberg, said he’s “never seen a defendant who has committed so many different types of crimes in such a relatively short period.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to CNN, Greenberg also “cooperated extensively with the Justice Department’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/politics/joel-greenberg-sentencing/index.html">sex-trafficking probe into GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz</a>.” Among other things, Greenberg reportedly told investigators that he <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4751778-matt-gaetz-joel-greenberg-sex-trafficking-florida/">witnessed Gaetz having sex with a 17-year-old girl</a>. (Gaetz in 2021 issued a blanket denial of the allegations via a statement from his office, writing: &#8220;No part of the allegations against me are true.”)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a general rule, sex offenses such as soliciting prostitution are handled by state-level prosecutors, as the Constitution only gives the federal government <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3801442224983217117&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr">limited authority over sex crimes</a>. The Justice Department can get involved, however, in narrow circumstances.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The department’s investigation into Gaetz looked into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/us/politics/matt-gaetz-sex-trafficking-investigation.html">whether he had sex with this teenager and paid for her to travel with him</a>. It is a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2423#g">federal crime to transport someone</a> someone across state lines, with the intent that they engage in prostitution or “illicit sexual conduct.” The most serious violations of this statute carry a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In any event, the Justice Department <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/doj-decides-not-charge-rep-matt-gaetz-sex-trafficking-investigation-rcna70839">eventually decided not to charge Gaetz</a>. Its reasons for declining to do so have not been made public, but the lack of charges does not necessarily clear him of the allegations. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There was also a separate <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/witness-tells-house-ethics-committee-matt-gaetz-paid/story?id=111217102">House ethics investigation into Gaetz</a>. A report on that investigation’s findings was nearly complete when Gaetz resigned from the House upon being nominated for attorney general. That report hasn’t been made public, though reporters have begun to obtain information gathered by House investigators.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Besides CNN’s reporting on allegations of sexual encounters with a minor, other outlets, have reported that investigators were told Gaetz <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/20/gaetz-investigation-house-ethics-committee-vance/">compensated a number of women for sex</a>. The House is reportedly in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/19/politics/matt-gaetz-house-ethics-testimony-lawyer/index.html">possession of photos</a> taken during times two women who said they were paid for sex were in Gaetz’s company. Other witnesses called by the ethics committee said they were paid to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cew2z48rp70o">attend parties that Gaetz also attended</a>, where attendees used drugs and had sex. Again, Gaetz has denied any misconduct.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Reports also emerged that <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/20/congress/readout-from-vance-gaetz-meetings-00190682">some Republican senators</a> were growing concerned by these allegations, raising questions of whether Gaetz could get the votes needed for confirmation. Also complicating matters was Gaetz’s generally poor reputation on Capitol Hill. In 2023, for example, Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-OK) said that “<a href="https://x.com/mkraju/status/1709765049051381761">there’s a reason why no one in the [Republican] conference defended</a>” Gaetz after seeing some of the evidence against him.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sen. Markwayne Mullin on Matt Gaetz: “We had all seen the videos he was showing on the House floor … of the girls that he had slept with. He’d brag about how he would crush ED medicine and chase it with an energy drink so he could go all night.”<br><br>Gaetz responds: “This is a lie” <a href="https://t.co/h55hj0ag29">pic.twitter.com/h55hj0ag29</a></p>&mdash; Manu Raju (@mkraju) <a href="https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1709765049051381761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 5, 2023</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As <a href="https://x.com/ezraklein/status/1856798502484910130">New York Times columnist Ezra Klein writes</a>, Trump’s decision to nominate Gaetz should be read as an effort to gauge whether Republican senators will permit him to take absurd and dangerous actions. “These aren&#8217;t just appointments,” Klein writes of Gaetz and Defense Secretary nominee Pete Hegseth, who also faces sexual misconduct allegations, “They&#8217;re loyalty tests.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Depending on who Trump choses in Gaetz’s stead, senators may have one less test to take.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Update, November 21, 1:55 pm ET:</em></strong><em> This story was originally published on November 13 and has been updated with Gaetz withdrawing his nomination for attorney general and the circumstances leading up to it.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But these numbers are just population-wide averages — they don’t tell us much about the diverse range of dietary habits among 335 million Americans, nor about how many people swear off meat and other animal products altogether.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Surveys on vegetarianism and meat consumption are “notoriously unreliable,” <a href="https://www.zachfreitasgroff.com/">Zach Freitas-Groff</a>, an economist at the University of Texas at Austin, told me.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In an attempt to understand what people are actually eating, Freitas-Groff and two fellow economists — <a href="https://www.trevorwoolley.com/">Trevor Woolley</a> at the University of California, Berkeley and Carl Meyer at Stanford University — reviewed people’s grocery receipts. The team analyzed tens of thousands of households’ grocery purchases from 2005 to 2020 to see how Americans’ meat consumption had changed over time. Their findings were <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4867295">published in June</a> as a working paper — not yet peer-reviewed, so the results should be viewed as tentative — by the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Their findings represent a growing chasm in American meat consumption: The number of households that avoid meat has increased slightly, while all other households have increased their meat purchases by an average of nearly 15 percent by weight relative to other foods. Overall grocery sales declined during this period, as Americans ate more of their meals outside the home, but as a share of groceries, meat purchases increased significantly.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From 2005 to 2020, the share of households that didn’t purchase any meat at the grocery store increased from 4.1 to 4.6 percent — a 12 percent jump. The share of households purchasing no animal products — meat, milk, or eggs — doubled, from a tiny 0.5 percent to a still-tiny 1 percent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The increase in meat avoiders is promising, but over 15 years, the increase appears very modest,” <a href="https://www.cgu.edu/people/joshua-tasoff/">Joshua Tasoff</a>, an economics professor at Claremont Graduate University who was not involved in the study, told Vox in an email.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"><img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-20-at-4.20.04%E2%80%AFPM.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,13.364279160145,100,73.271441679711" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="From 2005 to 2020, the average share of groceries that were meat (by weight) rose from 7.7 percent to 8.8 percent — a 14.3 percent increase. | Freitas-Groff et al (2024)" data-portal-copyright="Freitas-Groff et al (2024)" />

<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-20-at-4.21.50%E2%80%AFPM.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,5.3773811322767,100,89.245237735447" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="From 2005 to 2020, the share of households that didn’t purchase meat at the grocery store rose from 4.1 percent to 4.6 percent — a 12 percent increase. | Freitas-Groff et al (2024)" data-portal-copyright="Freitas-Groff et al (2024)" /></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The authors are hesitant to make sweeping generalizations about the state of American meat consumption based on these findings. The study only looked at food purchased at the grocery store, they note, which accounts for about <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=109781">two-thirds of caloric intake</a>, while the other third is eaten at restaurants and schools, which was not included in the study. The data also excludes meat sold at grocery store deli counters, including both raw meat and meat in prepared deli dishes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the paper provides a more granular view into consumers’ relationship with meat than we’ve had before, dovetailing with other recent research findings, like a 2023 study showing that just <a href="https://news.tulane.edu/pr/how-mere-12-americans-eat-half-nations-beef-creating-significant-health-and-environmental">12 percent</a> of Americans — mostly men and older people — eat 50 percent of the nation’s beef.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tasoff called the study an “impressive paper” that uses the best available data for consumer analysis.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The study’s time period, from 2005 to 2020, coincides with a growth in news coverage of farm animal welfare — a time in which numerous animal rights groups grew from tiny grassroots organizations into well-oiled machines; <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/8/31/9223391/undercover-videos-meat-america">undercover investigations into factory farms</a> gained national attention; around a <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23745935/proposition-12-pigs-pork-california-eggs-veal-hens">dozen states</a> passed farm animal welfare laws; cultural icons like <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-47085214#">Beyoncé</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/384508/billie-eilish-singer-songwriter-vegan-climate-animal-rights-activism-future-perfect-50">Billie Eilish</a> promoted the benefits of plant-based eating; and plant-based meat and milk, made by companies such as Beyond Meat, Impossible Foods, and Oatly, went <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/5/28/18626859/meatless-meat-explained-vegan-impossible-burger">mainstream</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But can increased media attention on factory farming — resulting from a growth in animal rights activism — and better vegetarian products explain the shift away from meat among a small but increasing share of American households? That might be part of it, the researchers concluded, but most of the shift, they found, can be attributed to other factors, including rising meat prices.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Digging into the data on America’s shifting meat consumption</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Around two-thirds of the increase in meat avoidance, the researchers estimate, is attributable to higher meat prices and to people buying less food at grocery stores and more at restaurants and elsewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The remaining third? Some of it could stem from older generations dying and younger people becoming heads of households. According to the paper, households in which the head was born after 1980 are 50 percent more likely to avoid meat and around twice as likely not to buy any animal products compared to other households.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2004, these households made up just 1 percent of the sample; by 2020, they accounted for 15 percent. If this trend holds, it could lead to a continued increase in households abstaining from meat in the decades to come, representing a bright spot in the paper’s otherwise discouraging findings. (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/738851/vegan-vegetarian-consumers-us/">Younger generations</a> also tend to <a href="https://today.yougov.com/consumer/articles/27440-veggie-meat-burger-poll">report higher rates</a> of vegetarianism, flexitarianism, pescetarianism, and veganism in surveys.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The difference among age groups is even more stark when looking at rates of all animal product avoidance. About 2.5 percent of households whose heads were born after 1990 didn’t purchase any animal products; for other age groups, the share hovers around 0.5 to 1 percent.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"><img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-20-at-4.15.29%E2%80%AFPM.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,14.094998106827,100,71.810003786346" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="Freitas-Groff et al (2024)" />

<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-20-at-4.15.44%E2%80%AFPM.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,12.631907332556,100,74.736185334889" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="“AP” is short for animal product. | Freitas-Groff et al (2024)" data-portal-copyright="Freitas-Groff et al (2024)" /></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though the study didn’t attempt to explain why younger people are avoiding animal products at such higher rates, it’s not unreasonable to think that animal advocacy — often directed at younger generations — could be changing social mores. That said, younger consumers have less money, so they could be more sensitive to rising meat prices, and they’re also <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/86401/eib-186.pdf">more likely to eat away from home</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The researchers also looked at whether the growth in media coverage of factory farming played a role in meat avoidance.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It “depends on the model we use,” Woolley wrote in an email. “Taken all together, it looks like media coverage probably played a role, but it&#8217;s hard to determine the magnitude of the effect given that it isn&#8217;t consistently statistically significant (unlike the effect of prices and total grocery purchase volume). It does seem to hold some explanatory power though.”&nbsp; </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1477-9552.2010.00266.x">2011 study</a> found that from 1991 to 2008, media coverage of cruelty on pig and poultry farms led to reduced demand for pork and poultry by <a href="https://agmanager.info/sites/default/files/AW%2520Media%2520Demand%2520Impacts%2520%28NIAA%2520_4.12.2011%29.pdf">2.6 percent and 5 percent</a>, respectively.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As for the role of plant-based meat alternatives, while they’ve generated a lot of buzz in the media and pop culture, and the sector’s sales have grown significantly in recent years, it’s still far too small a market to explain why more households have moved away from meat. The study found that plant-based meat products had no discernible displacement effect on animal meat sales. However, some of the most popular brands, like Beyond Meat and Impossible, didn’t become widely available in grocery stores until the final years of the data used in the paper.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Plant-based milks like oat and soy, however, displaced cow’s milk on a nearly 1-to-1 basis.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Meat’s price isn’t right</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The overall picture painted by the study is grim for factory-farmed animals and our warming planet. A small number of households have started avoiding meat at the grocery store in recent decades, but they’re overshadowed by all other households, which seem to be buying more meat.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The findings illustrate how critical the price of meat is to consumer behavior — a reality that’s painfully obvious to economists but often neglected in advocacy focused on animal cruelty. Work to change people’s hearts and minds may only go so far; changing the sticker price consumers see at the grocery store would likely have a much greater impact.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite rising food prices over the last two decades, meat and other animal products remain relatively cheap. That’s not because raising and slaughtering animals is an inexpensive endeavor, but because livestock companies have been <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/31/23852325/farming-myths-agricultural-exceptionalism-pollution-labor-animal-welfare-laws">exhaustively deregulated</a>, which in turn has diffused their costs throughout society.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Farmed animals pay the cost with their <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/3/9/22967328/animal-cruelty-laws-state-federal-exemptions-pennsylvania-martin-farms-dairy-calves-dehorning">suffering</a>, as do wild animals in the form of <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22287498/meat-wildlife-biodiversity-species-plantbased">mass deforestation</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/31/23852325/farming-myths-agricultural-exceptionalism-pollution-labor-animal-welfare-laws">polluted rivers</a>. Many farmers pay the cost by taking on a <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect-podcast/21363914/chicken-factory-farming-debt">mountain of debt</a>, while slaughterhouse workers pay the cost in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/05/amputations-serious-injuries-us-meat-industry-plant">lost fingers and limbs</a>. Ultimately, all of us pay it in the form of <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22905381/meat-dairy-eggs-climate-change-emissions-rewilding">climate change</a> and increasingly <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/1/8/23542789/big-meat-antibiotics-resistance-fda">ineffective antibiotics</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If livestock producers were to internalize these costs — and if we were to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/11/22/23471771/cory-booker-meat-farming-industrial-agriculture-accountability-act">do away</a> with much of the <a href="https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/2024/10/usda-livestock-subsidies-top-59-billion">subsidies</a> doled out to industry — meat would cost a lot more, causing some consumers to reduce or eliminate their meat purchasing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to True Price, a Dutch nonprofit that estimates the environmental cost of food, internalizing the environmental harms alone (excluding costs like animal cruelty and public health) of certain animal products would increase their price between <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/19/climate/food-costs-protein-environment.html">two- and five-fold</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Beef increases from $5.34 to $27.36 per pound</li>



<li>Cheese increases from $3.74 to $7.50 per pound</li>



<li>Chicken increases from $2.20 to $4.03 per pound</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Advocating for raising meat prices, especially after an election in which inflation and rising grocery bills played a <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/385932/biden-inflation-record-worse-unpopular-mistakes">major role</a> in ousting the incumbent party, feels — to put it lightly — insensitive and politically risky. But at the same time, consumers enjoy low meat prices at a steep cost to society, while polluting meat companies <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/meat-packers-profit-margins-jumped-300-during-pandemic-white-house-economics-2021-12-10/">celebrate record profits</a>. Some governments are reconsidering this longstanding deregulatory paradigm.<br><br>Just this week, the Danish government passed a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20nq8qgep3o">modest tax</a> on livestock emissions, and it’s also <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/384515/rune-christoffer-dragsdahl-vegetarian-society-denmark-animal-welfare-future-perfect-50">investing in programs</a> to make plant-based foods, which are much more environmentally friendly than meat, more affordable. If we’re serious about ensuring planet Earth is habitable for future generations, and mitigating one of humanity’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/363550/factory-farming-human-progress-sustainable-food-movement">greatest moral crimes</a>, the rest of us will need to follow their lead.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>This story originally appeared in&nbsp;</em><strong><em><a href="https://www.vox.com/family/369020/kids-children-generation-alpha-gen-school" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kids Today</a></em></strong><em>, Vox’s newsletter about kids, for everyone.&nbsp;</em><strong><em><a href="https://www.vox.com/pages/kids-today-newsletter-policy-childhood-policy-culture" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sign up here for future editions</a></em></strong><em>.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Kids can’t read anymore.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We heard this refrain earlier this month, when some <a href="https://x.com/ishaantharoor/status/1854187377943515637">connected a decline in reading</a> among young people, as well as a shift toward getting news and information from short-form video, with the recent presidential election victory of Donald Trump. But the concerns about kids’ reading have been piling up for years, with educators and other commentators worrying that students can’t recognize letters, that kids’ novels are falling out of fashion, and that young people are getting into college without being able to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/11/the-elite-college-students-who-cant-read-books/679945/">read a full book</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I know that the pandemic took a toll on <a href="https://www.vox.com/education/372475/math-reading-school-covid-education-learning-loss-kids">kids’ test scores in reading and math</a>. But I also know that older generations love to complain about ne’er-do-well young folks who can’t be bothered to crack open a book. So I reached out to educators and literacy scholars to find out how far behind kids really are, and what their reading skills (or lack thereof) mean for their future as voters, news consumers, and citizens of the world.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While kids’ reading performance has slid in recent years, some experts say <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/12/lucy-calkins-child-literacy-teaching-methodology/680394/">the language of “crisis”</a> is overblown. In fact, reading scores on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), one of the most widely used nationwide measures of student achievement, <a href="https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/highlights/ltt/2022/">haven’t changed that much</a> since the tests were introduced in 1969, <a href="https://www.gse.harvard.edu/directory/faculty/catherine-snow">Catherine Snow</a>, a professor of cognition and education at Harvard Graduate School of Education, told me.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“They haven&#8217;t plummeted,” Snow said. “They didn&#8217;t even plummet during Covid. They went down a little bit.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What has plummeted, however, is how much kids read, especially outside of school. In 1984, the first year for which data is available, 35 percent of 13-year-olds reported reading for fun “almost every day,” <a href="https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/ltt/reading/student-experiences/?age=13">according to NAEP</a>. By 2023, that figure was down to 14 percent, and 31 percent of respondents said they never read for fun at all. Kids are also faring worse on <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/icils/icils2023/international.asp">tests that measure their information literacy</a>, including their ability to recognize reliable sources.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div><iframe title="Today, Explained" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/show/3pXx5SXzXwJxnf4A5pWN2A?utm_source=oembed" allowfullscreen allow="clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture;"></iframe></div>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those results are indicative of a broader problem. Kids may be learning basic literacy, but “they&#8217;re not reading in the ways that they need to read in order to be prepared for the tasks of learning and critical thinking,” Snow said. And a decline in those critical thinking skills has big implications not just for young people today, but for society as a whole.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“These are our voters,” Christina Cover, a special education teacher in the Bronx who leads the <a href="https://seekcommonground.org/pal">Project for Adolescent Literacy</a> at the nonprofit Seek Common Ground, told me. “These are people that are really going to be taking us into what&#8217;s next for our country and for our world.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Kids’ reading scores have been (relatively) stable for decades</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The NAEP tests, administered every two years for five decades, <a href="https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/highlights/ltt/2022/">offer a bird’s-eye view</a> of how American kids’ reading proficiency has changed over time. After climbing through the 2000s, scores began to dip around 2012, a trend that <a href="https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/highlights/reading/2022/">intensified with the pandemic</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That drop has educators concerned, with many calling for expanded tutoring, summer school, and other supports to help kids get back on track. At the same time, even the post-Covid numbers aren’t that far off from historical norms. In 1971, the first year for which data is available, the <a href="https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/highlights/ltt/2022/">average NAEP score for 9-year-olds</a> was 208 out of a possible 500. In 2022, it was 215.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To be clear, those scores aren’t great. It’s also disappointing to see students losing some of the ground they gained through the 2000s, and the pandemic dealt <a href="https://www.vox.com/education/372475/math-reading-school-covid-education-learning-loss-kids">very real setbacks</a>, especially for low-income students and other already-underserved groups. Teachers now have to “reach back, and maybe grab or review those previous standards” that students should have been taught in 2020 and 2021, Evelyn Rudolph, a reading interventionist at LEAD Academy, a public charter school in Montgomery, Alabama, told me.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the story of students’ reading scores over the last several decades is one of “a very stable level of mediocrity,” <a href="https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2024/09/harvard-reading-wars-literacy-education">Snow has said</a>, not of sudden crisis.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">But reading for pleasure has plummeted</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s the good-ish news. More worrisome — or at least more precipitous — is the decline in kids’ reading for pleasure. While there were <a href="https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/ltt/reading/student-experiences/?age=13">hints of a decrease</a> in the ’90s, the slide seems to have started in earnest in the 2010s — in 2012, 27 percent of 13-year-olds read for fun every day, compared with just 17 percent in 2020.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Experts aren’t exactly sure why so many kids stopped reading, but the trend coincides with the widespread adoption of smartphones, said <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/staff/staffdetl.asp?empid=698">Ebony Walton</a>, a statistician at the National Center for Education Statistics, which administers the NAEP tests. Other hypotheses include <a href="https://theconversation.com/children-arent-reading-for-pleasure-according-to-new-research-heres-how-you-can-help-them-love-books-243108">funding cuts to libraries</a>, and an <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/03/children-reading-books-english-middle-grade/673457/">excessive focus on standardized testing</a> that has crowded out practices that instill a love of reading, like teachers reading books aloud to students.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whatever the case, the decline of reading for fun is a problem, and not just for <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/03/children-reading-books-english-middle-grade/673457/">children’s authors</a>. “When a student reads for fun and enjoys reading outside of school, there are so many benefits that they might not even realize,” from learning new vocabulary to gaining “the background knowledge needed to approach different academic areas in school,” Cover said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The skills that students use when reading for fun — especially reading longer texts — are also the same ones they need for everything from reading car manuals to “listening to political discourse and making sense of it,” Snow said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The importance of reading skills for civic engagement has been a hot-button topic lately, with <a href="https://x.com/ishaantharoor/status/1854187377943515637">Washington Post columnist Ishaan Tharoor</a> calling young people today a “generation trending toward post-literacy” that “gets its information from bits and bobs of video while scrolling.” While “post-literacy” might be a stretch, Snow and other experts are concerned that the decline in reading could make young people more susceptible to disinformation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s some evidence that this is already happening. US eighth-graders’ average score on the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/icils/icils2023/international.asp">International Computer and Information Literacy Study assessment</a>, which measures skills including recognizing reliable online sources, dropped 37 points between 2018 and 2023, to 482 out of a possible 700. American students fared worse on the assessment than students in most European countries, as well as South Korea and Taiwan.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The decline in reading for pleasure can feel impossible to reverse, given the number of alternatives available to kids today. But experts say some simple strategies can help. For Snow, it’s about treating reading not simply as an academic skill to master, but “as a tool for engaging in important activities, like learning about things you&#8217;re interested in.” Reading can be a way to engage with the social justice issues that many tweens and teens are <a href="https://www.vox.com/life/369953/skibidi-tweens-gen-alpha-brainrot-ipad-kids">passionate about</a> — “but those connections are not always made in schools,” Snow said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also important to encourage students to read what they like, in the way they like, whether that’s in a book or on an iPad or other device, Cover said. More companies are springing up to create reading materials specifically for Gen Alpha audiences, like <a href="https://www.storyshares.org/">Storyshares</a>, which offers books written by young people themselves.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kids “are reading in the world around them every single day,” Cover said. It’s up to educators to show them that “it&#8217;s not just something in isolation, but something that can enrich every other area of their life.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What I’m reading</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The accessories retailer Claire’s, a staple of many ’90s mall outings, is <a href="https://www.glossy.co/beauty/claires-double-downs-on-fragrance-to-target-gen-zalpha-consumers/?utm_campaign=glossydis&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=general-rss">launching a fragrance collection</a> in an effort to appeal to what it calls “Gen Zalpha” customers. The scents, priced at $24.99 or less, include one that smells like pistachio and vanilla.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Schools in <a href="https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2024/11/education-policy/">California</a> and <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/education/4988623-trump-return-colleges-universities-k-12-dei-trans-students/">around the country</a> are racing to prepare for the Trump administration and its potential effects on undocumented and LGBTQ students.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/health/385541/rfk-jr-trump-hhs-vaccines-fluoride">Trump Health and Human Services pick Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a> is correct that chronic diseases like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/15/health/rfk-chronic-diseases-children.html">diabetes and asthma</a> are worryingly common in American children, according to the New York Times. He is wrong, however, to blame vaccines and <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter/369470/fluoride-iq-kids-brain-development-toothpaste-water-science-study">fluoridated water</a> for the problem.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">My 2-year-old and I have been enjoying <em><a href="https://www.littleowlsnight.com/">Little Owl’s Night</a></em>, a very sweet board book that flips the bedtime story script by having its protagonist go to sleep when morning comes. It also includes the eerie line, “Mama, tell me again how night ends.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">From my inbox</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last week, I asked about your kids’ experiences with reading, and one reader, Kelly, had an experience that might be helpful for kids who struggle with reading for fun. “Two of my four children have dyslexia, so we were a little slower to become a ‘read to yourself’ family,” Kelly wrote. “But audiobooks meant they still grew up loving reading from an early age&#8230; just in a different form.” The kids’ grandmother “introduced my then-3-year-old daughter to Peter Pan on audiobook on her iPod, earbuds attached, and my daughter was hooked,” Kelly wrote. “In the nine years since, we&#8217;ve checked out literal thousands of audiobooks on <a href="https://libbyapp.com/interview/welcome#doYouHaveACard">Libby</a> — for free thanks to the Los Angeles Public Library — and my kids listen for several hours every day.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether he is writing novels about young love, contemplating our species’ long-term prospects, or supporting public health projects abroad, <a href="https://www.johngreenbooks.com/">John Green</a> is driven by one mission: “I&#8217;m trying to make the case that humanity is worth it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It began with a YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/vlogbrothers">Vlogbrothers</a>, in which he and his brother, Hank, an author and entrepreneur, exchanged messages with each other and their audience ranging from the mundane to the esoteric, and in doing so, nurtured a massive community focused on global problems.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">John Green’s 2012 young adult novel, <a href="https://www.johngreenbooks.com/the-fault-in-our-stars"><em>The Fault in Our Stars</em></a>, became <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/entertainment/arts/2017/10/20/john-green-book-event-balances-anxiety-laughs/769477001/">one of the best-selling books</a> of this century and propelled him to celebrity status, giving him the metaphorical equivalent of a “giant robot suit,” as he put it in his characteristically nerdy parlance. With the newfound fame, the brothers aspired to make the world “suck less.”(Green credits their parents, both activists, for that passion.)&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/PQ_0-12_5fd0bf.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,13.232055519596,100,73.535888960808" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">In the intervening years, their YouTube following has grown to 3.8 million, and they have become genuine forces in global health philanthropy, organizing massive fundraising drives for their chosen causes and <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/podcast/john-green-vs-johnson-johnson-part-1/">confronting global pharmaceutical giants</a>. These interests have inspired Green’s creative pursuits, including <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/anthropocene-reviewed">the podcast <em>The Anthropocene Reviewed</em></a> and its <a href="https://anthropocenereviewedbook.com/">follow-up book</a>, both of which grapple with the world as humanity has made it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">His next book, <a href="https://www.johngreenbooks.com/everything-is-tuberculosis"><em>Everything Is Tuberculosis</em></a>, which is set to come out in March, will center on Green’s latest obsession: TB, the infectious disease that kills <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death">more people than any other</a>. Last year, Green launched <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-advocates-pushed-big-pharma-to-cut-tuberculosis-drug-prices/">a successful campaign</a> to pressure pharmaceutical company Johnson &amp; Johnson to stop reported patent abuses that were inflating the cost of a lifesaving tuberculosis drug. He has also raised <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgQEKHBg5g0">more than $35 million</a> for a Partners in Health project to reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone, which until <a href="https://www.afro.who.int/countries/sierra-leone/news/sierra-leones-determination-stem-maternal-and-child-mortality">recently</a> had <a href="https://www.unicef.org/sierraleone/maternal-neonatal-child-and-adolescent-health#:~:text=The%20maternal%20mortality%20rate%20in,in%20every%20100%2C000%20live%20births.">the highest rate</a> of women dying in childbirth in the world. That money will help pay for a new government hospital set to open in the coming months.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Green and I spoke in October about his humanitarian work, how it has complicated his awkward relationship with celebrity, and why he retains a stubborn optimism about humankind.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>You started Vlogbrothers with </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeAUQslfFP4"><strong>this idea</strong></a><strong> that “We want to make the world suck less.” How do you conceptualize why the world sucks?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are ways that the world sucks that the world just sucks. This species has been around for 250,000 years; for 249,800 of those years, about half of children died before the age of 5. That just sucks. It&#8217;s completely unfair. It&#8217;s wildly unjust. But there was nothing that we could do about it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The ways the world sucks that most interest me are the ways the world sucks because of human-built systems, because those problems have human-buildable solutions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Your forthcoming book is called </strong><strong><em>Everything Is Tuberculosis</em></strong><strong>. What does that mean exactly?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24128530/tuberculosis-vaccine-efficacy-solutions-tb-bcg">Tuberculosis</a> is the deadliest infectious disease in the world. It kills <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/29-10-2024-tuberculosis-resurges-as-top-infectious-disease-killer">about 1.3 million people</a> every year. It&#8217;s gonna kill over 100,000 people this month. All of those deaths are needless because we&#8217;ve had the cure to tuberculosis since the mid-1950s.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/PQ_0-13_626ff4.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,27.710962259551,100,44.578075480898" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">What does it mean to live in that world? What does it mean to live in a world <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/28/17914344/tuberculosis-united-nations-funding-india-china">where the deadliest infectious disease</a> has been curable since my father was born?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It means that we&#8217;re doing an extraordinarily poor job of distributing resources. Our systems of marshaling and distributing resources have obviously failed in this case. It&#8217;s clearly a human-built problem that has a human-buildable solution, which is encouraging to me. We are the cause of tuberculosis, which also means that we can be the cure of tuberculosis.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When I say in the book title that everything is tuberculosis, I really do mean it. Tuberculosis radically shaped American geography. It&#8217;s the reason that cities like Pasadena and Colorado Springs and <a href="https://www.citizen-times.com/story/life/2015/07/20/ashevilles-growth-began-th-century-tb-treatment/30408281/">Asheville, North Carolina</a>, exist. It&#8217;s the reason <a href="https://www.historicsantafe.org/imported-products/chasing-the-cure">New Mexico</a> is a state. It&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wddYMBNv40o">one of the reasons World War I happened</a>. It radically reshaped almost everything about our lives. It&#8217;s been this quiet force throughout human history that&#8217;s pushing us this way and that, that we often don&#8217;t notice, but it&#8217;s a really, really profound force in human history.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I just listened to </strong><a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/anthropocene-reviewed/episodes/anthropocene-reviewed-humanitys-temporal-range"><strong>your podcast episode about humanity’s temporal range</strong></a><strong>. I&#8217;ve more than once heard you describe how your existence would be completely unrecognizable to somebody who lived a couple of centuries ago.</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Why is it so challenging for us to remember that context, the long history that has created the world in which we now live?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, in the dreary grind of daily living, as I think <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/robert-penn-warren">Robert Penn Warren</a> called it, it&#8217;s really hard to remember historical context because we&#8217;re busy trying to pay the mortgage and trying to make sure our kids get to school on time and trying to get them to eat some breakfast before they go. I feel that too. Believe me, I struggled to get my kids to eat breakfast this morning.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s so easy to feel hopeless in our current moment. I&#8217;m someone who&#8217;s unusually prone to despair. Maybe I&#8217;ve been fighting this for a long time, which is why I&#8217;m so focused on it. Part of the reason we feel despair is because we don&#8217;t see long-term change when we&#8217;re just looking at crisis after crisis after crisis after crisis.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When I try to contextualize my life and the world and our place in that world, I feel more hopeful because I see more examples that give me cause for hope. In the last 30 years, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24100883/child-mortality-rate-worldwide-united-nations">we&#8217;ve reduced child mortality by over 50 percent</a>, the fastest decline in human history.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet, the last 30 years have sucked terribly. Both of these things are true at the same time and holding those competing ideas together is really challenging, but I also think it&#8217;s essential.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>You&#8217;ve touched on something I wanted to ask you about, that I think about a lot. I have three kids under the age of 6. They are ignorant of all of the world&#8217;s problems.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">God bless you.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Something that we talk about at Future Perfect is </strong><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/fifty-six-percent-of-young-people-think-humanity-is-doomed/"><strong>the perception among a lot of young people that the world sucks</strong></a><strong>, that it&#8217;s getting worse, and that it could end catastrophically, maybe even pretty soon, whether that&#8217;s because of climate change or some other existential risk.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What do you hear from your audience about their outlook on humanity&#8217;s future and how do you respond to their concerns? How do you resolve that tension for yourself?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A lot of the people I hear from feel very hopeless and very scared, and they do feel like the world sucks and is getting worse. In important ways, they&#8217;re right, and I think it&#8217;s really important to acknowledge that they&#8217;re right. I don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s like to have my high school graduation ruined by a global pandemic. I don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s like to see <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24113340/biden-housing-2024-election-campaign-renters-tenants-mortgage">housing</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/2023/10/6/23903808/student-loan-payments-debt-budget">education</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/17/21024614/us-health-care-costs-medical-prices">health care</a> all become progressively less affordable than they&#8217;ve ever been. I don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s like to grow up in the world that they&#8217;re growing up in.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/PQ_0-14_2e9677.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,24.343144408008,100,51.313711183984" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, they don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s like to grow up in a world where 12 million kids die every year before the age of 5, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24100883/child-mortality-rate-worldwide-united-nations">whereas now fewer than 6 million do</a>. When I talk to young people about this, I try not to minimize their concerns because I think their concerns are real. Climate change is a catastrophe and it has the potential to be a catastrophe beyond our current imagining. There are profound and growing inequities in our world today. That&#8217;s all real.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But at the same time, it is also true that people have been predicting the end of the world since the moment that they realized the world might end. By the end of the world, of course, I don&#8217;t mean the end of life on Earth. Life on Earth will be just fine without us — arguably, from its perspective, better. I mean the end of humanity in the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I&#8217;m very afraid of that. It&#8217;s my biggest fear because I think we are good news or have the potential to be good news. It&#8217;s my biggest fear because I think we&#8217;re the most interesting thing that ever happened to this planet. It&#8217;s my biggest fear because I love humanity and I think we&#8217;re worth fighting for.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What exactly is the human endeavor?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We started out, as I think somebody once put it, as an animal of no consequence. Now we know approximately what&#8217;s keeping the stars apart and approximately how far away our star is from our planet. We know that we&#8217;re on a planet and we know that we can read <em>Hamlet</em> anytime we want. We can listen to Billie Holiday records and communicate with the dead.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That&#8217;s a pretty impressive series of accomplishments to me and I think it&#8217;s worth celebrating. That&#8217;s what I mean by the human endeavor: the overall attempt by each member of our species to take care of each other and to push us forward in our knowledge and understanding of the world.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I find our ability to make art everywhere all the time, no matter what, really fascinating and really encouraging. My son and I were just on a tour of World War I battle sites last week, and we saw all of this so-called trench art, which is art that was made in the trenches by soldiers on both sides of World War I, often taking exploded shells and carving onto them beautiful sunrises or landscapes or portraits. Some of these works of art are astonishing and nobody made those works of art hoping to get rich. Nobody made those works of art hoping to find an audience of millions of people. They made those works of art because there was value in the making and value in the sharing even if it was only sharing it with your buddies in the trenches.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Last year, </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMhgw5SW0h4"><strong>you targeted Johnson &amp; Johnson</strong></a><strong> for its patent practices and artificially inflating prices for life-saving treatments. That is a different tactic than encouraging people&#8217;s curiosity, empathy, and optimism. When is confrontation the right approach?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I really dislike any form of confrontation, including confrontation with big pharmaceutical companies that have a lot of power and employ a lot of nice people. I find that very stressful.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/PQ_0-15_56ecba.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.924216878161,100,68.151566243677" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">But when Doctors Without Borders and Partners in Health and Treatment Action Group were all reaching out saying this is a huge problem and it&#8217;s making it really difficult for us to get the medicine to the people we need to get it to, I felt like I had to listen. I&#8217;m a big believer in listening to people who know a lot more than I do. That&#8217;s kind of the foundational concept of my philanthropy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I&#8217;ll be honest, I tried to have some private conversations [with Johnson &amp; Johnson], and they didn&#8217;t go anywhere. So then I felt the only conversation I can really have is a public conversation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I was thinking about the people I&#8217;ve known who died of drug-resistant tuberculosis and feeling angry on their behalf, feeling frustrated by the systemic failures on their behalf. Maybe that gave me a little more strength of conviction than I might otherwise have had.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What is your project with Partners in Health in Sierra Leone?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Our project is centered around the maternal mortality crisis, which is also a child mortality crisis because children are much more likely to die or otherwise experience serious disability and serious illness if their mothers die in childbirth. At the time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfpXgkKTwmg">we started this in 2019</a>, Sierra Leone had the highest maternal mortality rate in the world. About 1 in 17 women could expect to die in pregnancy or childbirth, which wasn&#8217;t that different from the rate we would have seen 500 or 5,000 years ago. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the arguments that Partners in Health and our community wanted to make is that there are no excuses for not expanding access to maternal health care. That means not just in Sierra Leone — it means everywhere. But our hope is that this project could provide a blueprint for how to do that with more community health workers, with more nurses, and also ultimately with a world-class maternal care center at Koidu Government Hospital. That is where the lion&#8217;s share of the money that we&#8217;ve raised so far will go.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the first time, there will be a neonatal intensive care unit. There will also be adequate operating theaters for emergency C-sections. So many people die in Sierra Leone for want of an emergency C-section, or they die because they have high blood pressure, or they die because of hemorrhaging after giving birth. All things that are very treatable in rich countries and that should be treatable no matter who you are or where you live.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Five years ago, when </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfpXgkKTwmg"><strong>you were announcing your and Hank’s initial $6.5 million donation to Partners in Health</strong></a><strong> for the Sierra Leone project, you said you were trying to take lessons that you had learned from earlier philanthropic ventures and apply them to this effort in Sierra Leone. Now that you&#8217;ve had five more years of experience trying to stand this up, what else have you learned?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The biggest thing I&#8217;ve learned is that when you get community buy-in, things go much better than when you don&#8217;t.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most of the people building the Maternal Center of Excellence are women. Most of the welders, the masons, the steel workers. But they all had to be trained. I had no idea about the complexity of that. That was something that never crossed my mind, that you&#8217;re going to need to train up a workforce alongside building a hospital. Now that turns out to be an amazingly good investment because those people now have skills that they&#8217;re going to take with them the rest of their lives.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">People from rich countries or especially rich individuals kind of come into a community thinking that they have the solutions, which generally means that they don&#8217;t really understand the complexity of the problems.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>How do you know when your work is effective?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We&#8217;re obsessed with quantifying the good that we&#8217;re doing, with testing it, with making sure that we can evaluate kids and making sure that we know that they&#8217;re learning what we think they&#8217;re learning.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The risk is that it&#8217;s easy to conflate what is important with what is easily measurable. We need to be very careful not to apply what&#8217;s easily measurable and assume that it is therefore what&#8217;s most important.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/PQ_0-16_066c51.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,20.364516447693,100,59.270967104613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The obvious way that we measure the success of this project is by how many kids are surviving childbirth and how many mothers are surviving childbirth. But I also think you need to look at what, if anything, is the overall effect on reducing poverty. Is it improving educational access? Because we know that kids are more likely to be in school if their moms survive childbirth, but we haven&#8217;t yet proven that lower maternal mortality will lead to higher educational attainment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I want to look at that through a 20- or 30-year lens, not through a three- to five-year lens. I&#8217;m pretty tired of health care interventions that attempt to prove something in 18 months or with a three-year grant.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What do you think is the biggest blind spot people today have that future generations will look back on and think, “What were they doing?”</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think there are a lot of ways that people in the future will look back on us and think, “How did they do that?” The way that we think, “How did they let everybody smoke on airplanes?” The way that we treat non-human animals, especially the animals that we consume as meat, will be one.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The ways we distribute resources and build systems will be another. I hope people of the future will be absolutely astonished that within a single country, depending on your zip code, your life expectancy <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/08/health/life-expectancy-by-county-study/index.html#:~:text=Life%20expectancy%20at%20birth%20differs,medical%20journal%20JAMA%20Internal%20Medicine">could vary by 25 or 30 years</a>. I think people will be astonished that there were places where health care systems were so robust that someone like my brother could get diagnosed with cancer and be in remission within six months and other places where somebody diagnosed with that same cancer would be dead within six months.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What advice do you have for ethically minded people who are trying to figure out how to contribute to this project of improving humanity?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, it&#8217;s so easy to get overwhelmed and have decision paralysis. There are so many problems and there are so many people trying to address them and it can be so <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/15/17924288/future-perfect-explained">hard to know who&#8217;s addressing them most effectively</a> or what the problems beneath all the other problems are. And that&#8217;s okay. I think it&#8217;s okay to pick a problem and trust that other people are going to be addressing other problems with the same passion and interest that you&#8217;re addressing yours.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/PQ_0-17_6642d6.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,18.228963271358,100,63.542073457285" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">I don&#8217;t labor under the delusion that tuberculosis is the biggest problem in the world or that it&#8217;s the only problem that we should be paying attention to. I just think it&#8217;s one that we should be paying attention to and it&#8217;s the one that I happen to pay attention to.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">My second piece of advice would be <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23627382/progress-climate-change-poverty-global-health-doom-industrial-revolution-vaccines">don&#8217;t listen to the doomsayers</a>. Don&#8217;t buy into the people who are telling you that none of this matters because it&#8217;s all worthless anyway.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That&#8217;s a really compelling ethical argument in some ways because it&#8217;s so simple, it&#8217;s so straightforward. “This is all dumb.” “None of it matters.” “We should give up” is chef&#8217;s kiss from the perspective of wanting to have an explanation that has extraordinary explanatory power.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The problem with despair, of course, is that it&#8217;s untrue, like any super-simplistic worldview. Fight against despair and believe that together we can make the world better for each other.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Please do not judge me: I love U2, and therefore I love Bono. I think he&#8217;s a notable example of how perilous this transition can be from pop-culture curio to being an actual expert who can influence even more influential people.</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yeah, I think about Bono a lot.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Okay, there you go. How have you managed that transition?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I want to approach it with real humility because you can do so much unintended damage when you have a lot of power and when you have a really loud voice. It&#8217;s so easy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">My brother described it to me once as having a giant robot suit. I have this giant robot suit and it makes me super powerful. But when I walk around, it&#8217;s really easy for me to step on houses.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I&#8217;ve been given a lot of power, and I don&#8217;t think that I should have it, to be honest with you. I think that our social order gives way too much power to celebrities, even like seventh-tier celebrities like myself. It freaks me out and I think we should be freaked out by it. I just try to remember that I&#8217;m very, very rarely the smartest person in the room.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Do you see a unifying thread across your work, from </strong><strong><em>The Fault in Our Stars</em></strong><strong> to </strong><strong><em>The Anthropocene Reviewed</em></strong><strong> and Vlogbrothers to the maternal health project in Sierra Leone?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I&#8217;m trying to make the case that humanity is worth it. That humanity is worth the trial and travail and suffering and injustice and oppression, the catastrophe and horrors that we visit upon ourselves and each other. That, despite all of that, it&#8217;s a blessing to be here and humanity can be good news. I really believe that. I don&#8217;t know that we are good news, but I think we can be.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I don&#8217;t want to sound too pretentious about it, but I need to make that case for myself as much as I need to make it for anybody else.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What do you mean by that?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I&#8217;m very prone to desperate hopelessness, and I need every morning to be able to make the case to myself that it&#8217;s a good idea to get out of bed and go on.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>You talk about resiliency being one of humanity&#8217;s defining traits.</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I love how resilient we are. We&#8217;re so underrated as a species, Dylan. It drives me crazy. Does anybody think raccoons would be better at having this kind of power? Does anybody think dolphins would be better at having this kind of power? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/06/health/evidence-puts-dolphins-in-new-light-as-killers.html">Have you read about dolphins?</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Which is not to say in any way that we aren&#8217;t terrible. I want to be clear that I&#8217;m very pissed off. I&#8217;m infuriated by humanity&#8217;s many failures. What kind of insanity is it to have the deadliest infectious disease in the world be something that we&#8217;ve known how to cure for 75 years? That&#8217;s monstrous.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s just that we rate ourselves so lowly. There&#8217;s a lot to recommend about us.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A couple years ago, just before Black Friday, I decided to replace my old, cracked Apple Watch with a non-cracked equivalent. One thing led to another, and I had spent less than I’d planned on a nicer watch than I thought I could afford. The catch: It was refurbished.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The “r” word used to be a bad one in the gadget world. A decade ago, to many people, refurbished meant used, scuffed, and maybe a little bit broken. Secondhand devices didn’t always have the best reputation. However, as <a href="https://pirg.org/campaigns/right-to-repair/">the right to repair movement</a> has pushed consumer technology companies to make their products easier to fix, a new crop of marketplaces for used and refurbished goods has captured the attention of anyone who either loves a deal or cares about the environment, or both. And these cheaper options are better than ever.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You may have heard of <a href="https://www.backmarket.com/en-us">Back Market</a>, a Paris-based refurbished marketplace that promises to sell you “tech that’s better for the planet.” Then there are more specialized sites, like <a href="https://www.gazelle.com/">Gazelle</a>, which primarily sells refurbished phones and laptops, and <a href="https://vipoutlet.com/">VIP Outlet</a>, which specializes in refurbishing retail returns. <a href="https://www.decluttr.com/">Decluttr</a> sells old CDs and DVDs alongside refurbished tablets and gaming consoles. Even big retailers, including Amazon, eBay, Walmart, and Best Buy, are in the refurbished marketplace game now, too. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Prices and warranties vary, based on what you&#8217;re buying and when, but no matter where you shop, purchasing secondhand <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/refurbished-iphones-market-apple-sales-slump-android-cell-phones-cheaper-2024-10">comes with a certain cachet</a>. It’s the sensible thing to do, according to Lucas Gutterman, director of the Designed to Last Campaign at the US PIRG Education Fund.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It&#8217;s not a bad thing for people to buy new phones,” Gutterman told me. “It’s just the idea that we should buy them every year, every other year — that seems like it&#8217;s way too much for the environment.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We certainly can’t make an infinite amount of devices with <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/10/22/7031243/china-grip-rare-earth-metals-supply-weakening">the finite number of rare earth metals</a> on this planet. And extending the lives of phones already on the market comes with huge upside. A <a href="https://labo.societenumerique.gouv.fr/en/articles/environmental-impact-of-smartphones-what-benefits-of-reconditioning-relate-to-nine/">recent study</a> from the French government claimed that buying a refurbished phone instead of a new one avoids the extraction of 180 pounds of raw materials and emitted 50 pounds of greenhouse gasses. Put differently, buying the refurbished device over the new one lowers the overall environmental impact by as much as 91 percent.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Taking the refurbished route wasn’t always framed as a way to fight climate change. The practice grew out of corporate IT departments&#8217; constant need to supply machines to employees in the early days of personal computers. If an employee left the company, rather than buy a new computer, IT wiped their machines, repaired it if needed, and then assigned it to a new employee. It didn’t take long before a cottage industry emerged to sell used but restored devices to consumers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That industry is now huge and getting bigger every year. The number of used and refurbished smartphone shipments <a href="https://www.telecoms.com/mobile-devices/used-smartphone-market-shipments-topped-300-million-in-2023">grew nearly 10 percent</a> from 2022 to 2023, while the number of new smartphone shipments declined by over 3 percent, according to the market intelligence firm IDC. That adds up to the secondary market for phones being worth about $65 billion in 2023, and it&#8217;s expected to grow to nearly $110 billion by 2027.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These big numbers reflect an industry that’s gone from mom-and-pop shops selling fixed-up laptops to multiple mainstream marketplaces where millions of people buy everything from phones and computers to watches and video game consoles. The competition between those marketplaces also means that quality and customer experience is vastly improved. Now, refurbished gadgets often come with the same long warranties, trade-in options, and payment plans as new devices.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">One surprising thing</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">The logistics of online shopping <a href="https://earth.org/online-shopping-and-its-environmental-impact/">comes with a significant carbon footprint</a>. However, the original manufacturing process for devices like phones are much more significant. Shipping a phone in a 1-pound package 500 miles <a href="https://consumerecology.com/carbon-footprint-of-package-shipping-transport/#:~:text=The%20carbon%20footprint%20of%20a,0.98%20kg%20CO2e.">produces</a> about 1.3 pounds of greenhouse gas emissions. Manufacturing an iPhone 16 Plus, <a href="https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/products/iphone/iPhone_16_and_iPhone_16_Plus_PER_Sept2024.pdf">according to Apple</a>, produces 110 to 167 pounds of emissions.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Plus, the latest devices tend to have fewer new features that would make upgrading worthwhile.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“People are less excited about getting another camera lens on their phone or getting a new button on the side of the iPhone,” Gutterman said. Spending less on a refurbished phone and feeling better about your environmental impact is just a better choice for a growing number of people, he explained.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The refurbished market is also more transparent than it’s ever been. It all starts with a gadget that ended up in the inventory of a refurbisher or original equipment manufacturer. Often, it’s simply a device <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-apple-and-the-carriers-want-your-old-iphone-4279cc8d">that someone else traded in</a> or sent back for a warranty or insurance claim. Both refurbishers and manufacturers refurbish these kinds of devices by wiping them, fixing any hardware issues, repairing any cosmetic damage, cleaning them, and boxing them back up. (This can happen several times over the lifespan of a product.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then the device goes on the market. Most marketplaces also give you options to buy items in different conditions, from poor to premium, at different prices. Some devices sold on the secondhand market are actually new, too. Cleland explained to me that some of the inventory that ends up in the refurbishers’ hands includes products that were sold and returned but never used.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s thanks, in part, to the boom in online returns, especially since the pandemic, which has led to a liquidation market <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddbb2nPwC-c">worth hundreds of billions of dollars</a> that’s finding new homes for all kinds of secondhand goods, from furniture to construction equipment. For phones and tablets, there’s even a <a href="https://www.ctia.org/news/ctia-updates-wireless-device-grading-standard-to-help-extend-the-lifecycle-of-pre-owned-wireless-devices">standardized method for grading the condition of used devices</a> to streamline the process of reselling and refurbishing them. It all adds up to better, cheaper secondhand goods.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It&#8217;s estimated now that anytime a new iPhone comes out, it&#8217;s going to have at least three different users over its lifespan, because it&#8217;s going to get either traded or dropped and then resold,” <a href="https://www.ctia.org/news/blog-member-spotlight-meet-sean-cleland-of-b-stock-solutions">Sean Cleland</a>, vice president of mobile at the marketplace B-Stock Solutions, told me. “Like, back in the day, people would just put their old phone in the drawer.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you zoom out, what’s happening with refurbished phones and other electronics is a shining example of what a circular economy can do.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A circular economy aims to keep products in use as long as possible through refurbishing, repairing, and recycling <a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/5-opportunities-circular-economy">to conserve resources</a> and open up new economic opportunities. While the term has been around since the late 1980s, the circular economy concept has gained popularity in recent years. The European Union even adopted a <a href="https://environment.ec.europa.eu/strategy/circular-economy-action-plan_en">circular economy action plan in 2020</a> that set forth a number of policies and strategies to promote sustainable development. These government incentives have perhaps helped marketplaces such as the Back Market to thrive in France and across Europe.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Going circular and finding ways to reuse the old inventory to create new things, I think, is necessary,” Cleland said. “As resources dip but consumer demand increases, you’ve got to figure out a new way.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">American companies are embracing the circular economy model as well. Amazon now has Amazon Renewed, which launched in 2017 and features the same fast shipping you get with other Amazon products as well as a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G4ZAA22U35N373NX">90-day free return policy</a>, which goes up to one year for some premium products. Meanwhile, eBay offers a <a href="https://pages.ebay.com/refurbishedprogramwarranty/index.html">two-year warranty</a> on certified refurbished products, which are delivered like new, as well as one year on lower-grade used goods. Walmart Restored similarly has a <a href="https://www.walmart.com/help/article/walmart-restored/1cd5cc0c3cef40c79a4b2305890b1370">one-year minimum warranty</a> on premium refurbished goods, and 90 days on everything else. Target sells items refurbished by the original manufacturer with a <a href="https://www.target.com/c/target-refurbished-pre-owned/-/N-l6d4n">six-month minimum warranty</a>. Back Market’s warranty is <a href="https://www.backmarket.com/en-us/legal/warranty">good for one year</a> across the board.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Warranty is only one factor to consider when choosing where to buy refurbished goods, says PIRG’s Gutterman. You should avoid buying refurbished items that aren’t designed to last, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/9/16/23875582/apple-airpod-repair-battery-right-to-repair-act">like Apple AirPods</a>, as well as bulky items like TVs, which can be easily damaged. You should also make sure manufacturers still support software updates on older devices. Here’s <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iphone-models-compatible-with-ios-18-iphe3fa5df43/ios">a list of iPhone models</a> that support the latest iOS 18 software, for instance. (You can find more tips in this recently updated <a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/fixed-for-the-holidays/">guide to buying — and gifting — refurbished products</a> that Gutterman co-authored.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re like me, you might just want to find the best deal. My Apple Watch battery is starting to fail, so I’m actually thinking about <a href="https://support.apple.com/watch/repair">getting it repaired</a> or getting a new one. Since the market for refurbished gadgets has blown up so much in the past few years, I have more options to upgrade than I did a few years ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And as much as I’d like to try the new features, it might feel better to trade mine in, let it find its way to a new owner, and live a little longer.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As <a href="https://www.vox.com/science/24141780/summer-hot-national-weather-service">this summer</a> has already made clear, <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/23800261/tips-extreme-heat-heatwave">extreme heat</a> is here, and it’s poised to get worse in the coming years. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Due to soaring temperatures, more and more people are also at risk for severe health concerns that come with them, including heat stroke, cardiovascular problems, and respiratory issues.<strong> </strong>That’s particularly <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/351471/heat-waves-increase-the-number-of-risky-premature-births">true for already-vulnerable groups</a> including elderly people, those who are pregnant, and those with preexisting conditions like heart disease or diabetes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Texas — a state that often sees some of the hottest temperatures in the country — extreme heat killed <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/01/12/texas-heat-deaths-2023-record-climate-change/#:~:text=Green%20was%20among%20the%20334,which%20are%20not%20yet%20final.">more than 330 people in 2023</a>, setting a new record. More recently, millions of people in cities like <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/heat-wave-hits-texas-amid-power-outages-from-beryl/">Houston have had to deal with a massive heat wave</a> while navigating power outages caused <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/11/weather/texas-heat-beryl-power-outage-thursday/index.html">by Hurricane Beryl.</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite the growing toll, there’s shockingly little regulation around protecting people from the effects of heat. It’s a stark contrast to how policies tend to treat the extreme cold. And while extreme cold continues to be <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/Which-Kills-More-People-Extreme-Heat-or-Extreme-Cold">deadlier than extreme heat</a>, as heat waves become more dangerous, the gap between the two is likely to shrink.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For example, very few states have laws that require landlords to provide air conditioning for their renters. Conversely, <a href="https://www.zumper.com/blog/is-it-illegal-for-a-landlord-to-not-provide-heat/">most states</a> have policies that mandate the provision of heat in the winter. But even navigating what is and isn’t required around extreme heat is difficult. A comprehensive state-by-state cooling policy resource doesn’t yet exist, which speaks to the sparse landscape of regulations considering heat exposure.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s largely due to policymakers lagging behind climate change, the opposition from <a href="https://laist.com/brief/news/housing-homelessness/los-angeles-cooling-air-conditioning-extreme-heat-renter-landlord-tenant-requirement-climate-change-housing">landlord groups</a> to such requirements, and the hefty cost of both energy bills and equipment that would actually address the problem. There are questions, too, over who would bear those costs, including concerns that mandates for air conditioning would simply fall on tenants in the form of higher rents.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The need for adequate cooling will only become more pressing, though. And the growing prevalence of heat waves — <a href="https://www.vox.com/22538401/texas-heat-wave-weather-definition-record-temperature-climate-change">which are getting stronger, longer, and more frequent</a> — underscores the fact that air conditioning is no longer a luxury but a necessity and that the lack of it in people’s homes could prove fatal.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>There are big gaps in cooling policies</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cooling policies for rental properties vary state by state, often city by city. There’s no federal law or regulation governing them, and many states don’t have them either. Although some cities like <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2016/09/28/dallas-makes-rules-tougher-on-landlords-with-new-housing-standards/">Dallas</a> have approved ordinances mandating that landlords provide air conditioning, for instance, Texas doesn’t <a href="https://www.sll.texas.gov/faqs/tenants-rights-ac-heating/">offer the same protections</a> statewide. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There’s no baseline right to air conditioning or anything like that at the federal level,” David Konisky, Indiana University’s co-director of the Energy Justice Lab, told Vox.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a result, such measures — known as habitability laws— are highly dependent on where people live. These laws, which determine what requirements a landlord must meet for the housing they provide, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/home/2024/07/10/do-landlords-have-to-provide-ac/">rarely include cooling</a>. For heat, meanwhile, these policies tend to say that rental properties need to include a heating unit that keeps them above a certain temperature. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Unlike heat, cooling is really not incorporated into habitability standards or enforced in increasingly hot summers,” says Ruthy Gourevitch, a housing policy manager at the Climate and Community Project. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some state policies, like those in <a href="https://www.kahnair.com/rules-regarding-air-conditioning-in-rental-units/">California</a> and <a href="https://wyrk.com/landlord-air-conditioning-nys/">New York</a>, require landlords to maintain air conditioning that’s already in a unit, but they don’t mandate that they provide AC in the first place. Most states have experienced scorching heat waves in recent years yet many still have no state law on the books to require cooling systems.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A similar dynamic is evident when it comes to federal energy assistance programs, which often dedicate most of their funds to assisting tenants in the winter to cover heating costs. About 80 percent of the funds allocated to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) are doled out in the winter, while far less is distributed in the summer, says Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. That’s largely a byproduct of the underfunding of the program, with much of the money running out after it’s been used in the winter, Wolfe says. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This breakdown can leave tenants in need of such aid struggling to cover costs in the summer even if they have access to air conditioning.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/23274788/heat-wave-ac-energy-bill-utilities">Rebecca Leber previously reported for Vox</a>, this same trend holds true when utility companies shut off power, something they do when a customer misses their payments.<strong> </strong>Many states will offer protections to customers in these situations during the cold months of winter. Not so with the increasingly fierce, hot months of summer. According to Vox’s previous <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/23274788/heat-wave-ac-energy-bill-utilities">reporting</a>, 41 states offer customer protections from utility shut-offs during the extreme cold if they fail to pay a bill, while just 18 states offer the same for extreme heat. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Preventing such shut-offs is one key way to ensure that people have air conditioning access during dire spikes in temperature, Leber writes. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There are lots of areas of policy where we have this distinction historically, between cold and heat,” says Konisky. “[We’ve thought that] trying to protect people from extreme cold temperatures has been more important.” But, now, “heat is just as deadly, just as big of a concern.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>These omissions could have severe consequences</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As extreme heat becomes more common and more hazardous to people’s health as a result, the impact of these gaps will become increasingly apparent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Low-income tenants, in particular, are disproportionately affected by such omissions, experts say, because they’re less likely to be able to afford their own cooling systems. Black Americans are also more likely to live in places where they are exposed to extreme heat, <a href="https://info.primarycare.hms.harvard.edu/perspectives/articles/african-americans-extreme-heat">a 2020 study found</a>. According to research by climate and health scientists Adrienne Hollis and Kristy Dahl, “counties with large African American populations are exposed to extreme temperatures two to three more days per year than those counties with smaller African American populations.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The risks of being indoors without air conditioning or other cooling options during these heat waves are high especially for older people, infants, pregnant people, and those with serious health conditions like heart disease and high blood pressure. Severe complications that could result include blood clots, kidney impairment, and asthma. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“With access to cooling, unfortunately, it’s heading that direction of being another one that shows the economic divide in the country and also the globe,” says Wolfe. <a href="https://www.acdirect.com/blog/many-us-households-dont-air-conditioning/">Roughly 13 percent</a> of US households lack air conditioning, with renters more likely to go without than homeowners. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The consequences of that lack have been increasingly evident in recent years, with multiple cities like Phoenix <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/06/phoenix-arizona-extreme-heat-deaths#:~:text=Last%20year%2C%20Phoenix%20suffered%20a,rise%20over%20the%20past%20decade.">recording record-high deaths from heat</a>. In 2023, Phoenix experienced 30 consecutive days of heat over 110 degrees Fahrenheit and saw 645 deaths, almost double the number from the year before. A large proportion of these deaths included people who were low-income or unhoused, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7227d0nl20o#:~:text=Last%20year%2C%20645%20people%20died,county%20has%20risen%20each%20year.">according to Phoenix officials</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Being inside during such heat waves, without air conditioning, is particularly hazardous.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It can actually get hotter indoors than outside, and this is a really important environmental justice issue,” Leah Schinasi, an assistant professor of environmental and occupational health at Drexel University,<a href="https://www.cell.com/heliyon/fulltext/S2405-8440(24)01832-2?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2405844024018322%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"> concluded in a 2024 <em>Heliyon</em> study</a>.  </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The policies that could change</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition to regulations that treat cooling systems like a necessity, experts say there needs to be more funding to cover the costs associated with them. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some cities, where temperatures have been consistently high and climbing, like Dallas, have approved ordinances in recent years to mandate that landlords provide air conditioning that keeps units under a specific temperature. <a href="https://ktla.com/news/local-news/l-a-county-weighs-air-conditioning-mandate/">Other cities, like Los Angeles</a>, are considering similar proposals.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such policies add to a handful of laws at the state level.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Seth Gertz-Billingsley, a Harvard law student who has studied heat protection policies across different states, <a href="https://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/news-and-ideas/in-a-warming-world-is-air-conditioning-a-right">notes that the Oregon law</a> is one of the most expansive. That law — <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2022/07/new-oregon-law-established-renters-right-to-ac-but-some-landlords-still-threaten-fines.html">which passed in 2022</a> — allows renters to install air conditioning, and also sets up an emergency fund to help low-income tenants afford AC. It doesn’t, however, mandate that all landlords offer air conditioning.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition to strengthening requirements for air conditioning and other cooling systems, advocates say it’s important that such policies account for the costs that would accompany these changes, so they aren’t simply passed on to tenants.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Federal and state governments could offer subsidies to landlords, for instance, says Wolfe. And more funding is needed for energy assistance programs directly focused on tenants.<strong> </strong>Wolfe estimates that LIHEAP could use an additional $3 billion annually to cover the costs people face in summer.<strong> </strong>Tenant protection from rent increases and potential evictions needs to be baked into such proposals, too, says Gourevitch. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another key consideration is the need to install cooling options, like heat pumps, that won’t also contribute to the climate crisis. <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/23067049/heat-wave-air-conditioning-cooling-india-climate-change">The paradox of air conditioning</a> has long been that it’s crucial to help preserve people’s health during heat waves but that it simultaneously spews a sizable amount of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. Devices like heat pumps, which move air from indoors to outdoors and vice versa, are a more efficient alternative because they <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/heat-pump-systems#:~:text=During%20the%20heating%20season%2C%20heat,comfortable%20temperatures%20for%20your%20home.">“transfer heat rather than use energy to generate heat.”</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To change such policies, however, lawmakers need to catch up with how quickly climate change is taking place and affecting people’s lives. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/25/weather/us-summer-heat-forecast-climate/index.html">Forecasts for this summer</a> and beyond show that the world is poised to get hotter. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Many of our habitability laws and enforcement policies are many decades old, and need to be updated to confront the new reality that we live in,” says Gourevitch.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you weren’t astutely aware already: Kids live in the same tech-dominated, phone-addled world that the rest of us do. Babies as young as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10122061/">6 months old spend over an hour a day in front of screens</a>. The average tween <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2022/11/children-mobile-phone-age.html">gets their first phone before they turn 12</a>. Recently, the US Surgeon General went so far as to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/health/surgeon-general-social-media-warning-label.html">call for warning labels on social media platforms</a> to inform parents about the apps’ mental health impacts on young people. Deciding how to introduce children to tech and the kinds of boundaries to draw around their use is no longer a matter of if but when.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The available research on smartphones’ effects on children is somewhat mixed, which can make it confusing for parents trying to make decisions when it comes to their kids’ tech exposure. Studies show when 1-year-olds spend more than four hours a day looking at screens, they have <a href="https://healthmatters.nyp.org/what-does-too-much-screen-time-do-to-childrens-brains/">developmental delays and issues with communication, fine motor skills, and problem-solving</a> at ages 2 and 4 (although only <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2808593">4 percent of the study’s participants</a> were exposed to more than four hours of screen time a day). As little as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6059409/">one hour on mobile devices has been linked to behavioral issues</a> and inability to pay attention, according to a study among Japanese first graders. Constant use of devices <a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news-events/publications-archive/brain/screen-time-brain">prevents children from getting bored and letting their young minds wander</a>. Frequent internet use can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9273128/">impede a child’s ability to create interpersonal relationships</a>. In his new book <em>The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness,</em> social psychologist <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area/353979/this-is-your-kid-on-smartphones">Jonathan Haidt argues</a> that a “phone-based childhood” is to blame for negative mental health outcomes in kids. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These findings about negative impacts may be alarming, but they don’t present the entire picture. A May 2023 advisory from the American Psychological Association, reviewing the available evidence to date, found that “<a href="https://www.apa.org/topics/social-media-internet/health-advisory-adolescent-social-media-use">using social media</a> is not inherently beneficial or harmful to young people.” In fact, there may be a silver lining: Rather than completely sequester and alienate young users, technology use can actually <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9658971/">help adolescents form social connections and explore their identities</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, experts say children should have limits and rules when it comes to their tech use. There are no clear, one-size-fits-all answers about when kids should be given their first phones or the amount of monitoring they need as they grow older. Parents will need to make decisions based on their values, judgment, and priorities. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ask yourself — and your kids — why they need a phone</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When it comes time to decide whether to give your child their own phone, it’s important to interrogate the reason why. If that reason is to assuage your own anxiety, it’s worth reconsidering, says Emily Cherkin, founder of the Screentime Consultant and author of <a href="https://thescreentimeconsultant.com/book"><em>The Screentime Solution: A Judgment-Free Guide to Becoming a Tech-Intentional Family</em></a>. Many parents mean well; they want to know where their children are or be able to get in touch in case of an emergency. But they are far more likely to encounter other dangers on smartphones. “The work that parents have to do is to dial down our anxiety about what I call the scary, but not the dangerous,” Cherkin says. “What’s scary is kidnapping, but it’s not dangerous. It’s so, so, so unlikely. Dangerous is youth mental health and bullying.” If your “why” is truly communication-related, Cherkin suggests giving your kid a flip phone.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When kids are old enough to start clamoring for their own device, it’s worth hearing them out, says <a href="https://www.wcwonline.org/Active-Researchers/linda-charmaraman-phd">Linda Charmaraman</a>, a senior research scientist and founder and director of the Youth, Media, and Wellbeing Research Lab at Wellesley Centers for Women at Wellesley College. They could have any range of answers that touch on peer pressure, a desire to connect with friends, or an interest in learning more about their interests.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But you also have to weigh those considerations against how tech fits in with your family’s values, Cherkin says. Pick two or three of your most important values — respectfulness, responsibility, or honesty, for example — and create a screen time boundary that corresponds. “If you value togetherness and communication, and everyone has a phone in their hand at the dinner table, that’s not in alignment with your value,” Cherkin says. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“I would say as young as 4, you could talk about the trickiness of tech”</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cherkin has found families who have strong communication, trust, and familial relationships are more likely to find a screen time balance that works for them, rather than those who impose hard and fast time limits. At the same time, it’s reasonable to set rules based on values, such as no phones at dinner time (so everyone can catch up) and at bedtime (because you want your kids to get a good night’s sleep). </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Crucially, parents must also follow these rules, too. “Children hate hypocrisy,” Cherkin says. “They can smell that out. Then it’s a lot harder to get their buy-in because it’s like, ‘Well, you’ve told me not to do this.’” If you can’t commit to completely separating from your phone at night, for instance, make sure to put it on a table on the other side of the room or just outside your bedroom door. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Make a smartphone contract</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While some parenting movements — like <a href="https://www.waituntil8th.org/">Wait Until 8th</a> — suggest waiting until the end of eighth grade to give a child a smartphone, experts suggest using your best judgment based on your child’s personality and those aforementioned family values. Experts say that children under 13 should not have access to social media. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563221003769">In a study of youth social media use</a>, Charmaraman found teens aged 13 and up were more responsible, less secretive, and engaged in less cyberbullying than users under 10 years old.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://drsherylziegler.com/">Sheryl Ziegler</a>, a licensed clinical child psychologist, also suggests adjusting any privacy or security settings before you hand over a smartphone. Go to the parental controls setting on the device (Apple has <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/105121">many built-in features on its products</a>) and any apps. (For example, <a href="https://parents.snapchat.com/parental-controls">Snapchat’s Family Center</a> allows parents to see who their kids are chatting with.) Turn off all notifications to avoid distraction during homework or a movie. Download only the apps you permit them to use. If they want to download any additional apps, they need to ask permission first, Ziegler says. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also essential to establish clear-cut rules before your child gets their own device. Ziegler suggests modifying the template created by <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/common_sense_family_media_agreement.pdf">Common Sense Media </a>— a nonprofit focused on media and technology safety for children — to your family’s needs. You and your child should be in agreement on privacy and safety, the amount of time they’re allowed to spend on the device (including during the summer), and pledge to consistently communicate about what they’re doing on the device. These rules can be applied even when kids start using family devices, Ziegler says. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is no hard and fast rule for how much time kids should spend on their devices. If they have school-issued laptops and they prefer to study on their iPads, that means they spend most of their waking hours looking at a screen. Take stock of how long kids are spending in front of a device versus other activities, like hanging out with friends, homework, or extracurriculars. “The younger the child,” Cherkin says, “the lower we want that number” on screens.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends <a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/138/5/e20162591/60503/Media-and-Young-Minds?autologincheck=redirected">children under 2 years old have no screen time</a> (other than video chatting with a relative) and children between the ages of 2 and 5 be limited to one hour of quality children’s programming. Ziegler recommends children ages 6 to 12 get no more than two hours a day of screen time. Parents will need to monitor the quality of that time, too: Watching a movie with the family is different from scrolling TikTok for two hours straight. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Keep certain rooms and times of day phone-free. Experts agree children should not have phones in their bedrooms overnight. <a href="https://devorahheitner.com/">Devorah Heitner</a>, author of <a href="https://devorahheitner.com/growing-up-in-public/"><em>Growing Up in Public: Coming of Age in the Digital World</em></a>, suggests keeping phones away before they go to school and during homework time, too. You might also suggest they go phone-free while hanging out with friends and family. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Be transparent with your kids about why you’re making the contract, Ziegler says. “I like to tell kids the reason why I’m going to be doing that is it’s going to be really hard for you to [turn the device off] because it’s so fun and these things were created to keep you on here as long as possible,” she says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There should be an understanding that you don’t expect your kids to be perfect and that they will mess up. Remind them that you don’t want to bust them for doing something wrong, but you’ll be there to help them navigate sticky situations. This way they’ll feel comfortable coming to you if they said something rude in a text that got back to another student, for instance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When they inevitably sneak out of their room in the middle of the night and grab their phone, don’t let anger take over. Ziegler suggests saying, “I get it, you really wanted to get back on the group chat. This is a sign to me, and to you, that we need to take a break. We’re going to give it a rest all day tomorrow.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Keep having conversations about safety, privacy, and online behavior </h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether or not your child has their own phone, it’s important to get deeply familiar with how they’re browsing the internet and engaging with social media, Heitner says. Ask your kids what games and programs they use at school and on shared devices at home. This can range from Roblox to Google Docs. Take time to watch videos from your child’s favorite influencer, Heitner suggests, to determine whether their content is trustworthy and appropriate. Ask your child to explain how, say, Discord works or to show you a funny video on TikTok so you can see how your kids are spending their time on various platforms. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“These are ways into having conversations with kids about what they’re seeing,” Heitner says. You might observe how negative the comments section is on a particular YouTube video. You could ask your kid, “How does it make you feel to see that? What would you do if somebody made a comment like that to you?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another way to have conversations around the dangers of certain apps includes reading the terms and conditions, Cherkin says. As tedious as it may seem, reading through them with your kids can illustrate how the platform handles their data. You could say, “It says here in the Snapchat agreement that they actually don’t guarantee that your snap is deleted if you say you’ve deleted it. They’re essentially tricking you.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I would say as young as 4, you could talk about the trickiness of tech,” Cherkin says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Discussions around online privacy and safety should be ongoing. You can start at the most straightforward tips — don’t share passwords or personal information online, for example — and progress to more difficult topics. Ask your children how they communicate with friends online. “If I call [someone] a loser with 60 exclamation points [online], I just called my friend a loser with 60 exclamation points,” Heitner says. “That&#8217;s going to have an impact on our relationship even though they’re not in the room with me &#8230; It&#8217;s really important to lean into teaching kids that we&#8217;re all human beings behind these screens, and we want to act like nice people, and if someone isn&#8217;t being nice, we have the freedom to leave and to not pursue further interactions.”</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>If you’re checking emails at dinner, your kids will learn that phone use is acceptable anywhere — and that it’s a salve for boredom</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If your adolescents are going to be on apps like Instagram and TikTok, make sure they know not to post images of other people without their consent, Charmaraman says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Teach your kids strategies if they start to feel distress online. Can they change the subject in the group chat if things get really negative? If things get too upsetting, could they leave it entirely? Encourage your kids to reach out to you if any of their peers or people they chat with online mention bullying or self-harm, Heitner says.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Help them anticipate inevitable feelings of exclusion or social comparison, Heitner continues. Explain that they will see friends hanging out without them and what they can do to feel better: Get off their phone, watch Netflix, walk the dog, ask their neighbor to hang out.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.885819/full">Research shows</a> the closer a parent is with their child, the less likely they’ll have problematic internet use. Rather than interrogating kids about what they’re doing on their phones, you might ask, “Is there anything interesting or surprising that’s come up on your phone lately?” or “I heard from so-and-so’s parents about this wild video going around. What’s your take on that?” </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to think about parental monitoring apps</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Experts are split over whether to use parental monitoring apps, like Bark, which send parents notifications if their children’s texts, emails, or apps showcase sexual content or signs of bullying, violence, or suicidal ideation. Ziegler personally uses Bark with her teens — and the filter is, in her experience, quite comprehensive. For instance, she once received a notification that her son was looking at drug-related content on his phone only because she sent him a text reminding him to take his medication.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given the breadth of sexual, violent, or addictive content available online, Ziegler likes how Bark offers notifications in real time that she can choose to open or ignore. “The chances of you being like, ‘Every Friday night I’m gonna go check my kid’s phone’ is probably pretty small,” she says. “Physically taking their phone to look at, it feels very invasive to them.” Always be honest with your child about the level to which their activity will be monitored.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cherkin believes that engaging in absolutism or fear-based parenting will only drive kids to seek that same content behind your back. Similarly, Charmaraman suggests parents speak to their children about their phone use directly rather than monitor their activity. Adolescents will inherently find themselves in awkward positions online, Charmaraman says, because that’s the nature of adolescence. “People are just trying to figure out who they are and sometimes they say or do socially awkward things,” she says, “That’s really what you’re going to be seeing when you’re monitoring.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Know when smartphone use is becoming too much</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Notice how your child reacts when they’ve reached their screen time max for the day. Do they beg you for more time? Are they irritable? Are they unsure of what to do next? These are all signs they’re probably spending too much time on their phones, Ziegler says.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Taking the phone away outright may not be the best course of action; your child might be afraid to open up to you because they’re scared they’ll get their phone taken away, Charmaraman says. Help them realize the root of their problems may be related to their phone or social media use. Try saying “I noticed you’re really stressed out and annoyed. I’m making a connection that it might be related to the phone, but I want to hear what your explanation for it is. Is there something else going on?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You might suggest your kid delete an overused app or block a classmate on social media. “Rather than taking away the phone completely,” Charmaraman says, “you can just say, ‘Maybe we can take a break on this one app.’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Maybe your child stays up all night watching YouTube videos on their phone. Instead of removing it from their room the next day, ease them into the transition, Charmaraman suggests: The phone stays on a nightstand one night, then the next night it’s across the room, until finally they feel comfortable with it charging overnight in another room.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Model healthy phone boundaries for your kids</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you want your children to live balanced lives online and off, you need to set a good example. If you’re checking emails at dinner or scrolling Instagram while waiting in line at the grocery store, they’ll learn that phone use is acceptable anywhere — and that it’s a salve for boredom. Limit your own screen use as much as possible. Should you need to take a work call during screen-free time, explain to your family that you don’t want to be distracted while hanging out with them, but you need to make one quick call and then they have your undivided attention, Cherkin says.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Be open with your feelings around phone use, too. Maybe you feel dread about the upcoming election after scrolling on X. Or you find it hard to pull yourself out of a TikTok binge. Call out any unpleasant feelings “so that when our kids have struggles, we can say, ‘That persuasive design is getting you, too. It’s hard for me as a parent to put this down. I can understand why this is so frustrating,’” Cherkin says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, parents don’t need to go into panic mode the moment their child picks up a device. So long as you set up a system of transparency and communication, kids will know to turn to you if they’re having any problems online.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With the future of his reelection campaign in doubt, President Joe Biden made a move on Thursday that was very unusual for him: He answered a lot of questions from reporters in a press conference. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The press conference, at the close of this week’s NATO summit in Washington, went fine for Biden. He took questions for about an hour, speaking about several foreign policy, economic, and political issues. Some of his foreign policy responses in particular were praised as detailed and substantive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, he did at one point mention “Vice President Trump” when he meant to say “Vice President Harris.&#8221; And at an earlier event he accidentally introduced Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky as “President Putin.” But they were simple slips of the tongue and not borne of substantive confusion — Biden spoke extensively on the Ukraine/Russia war and about Harris’s qualifications. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden’s performance was not exactly commanding, but he didn’t ever seem lost or fully out of it as he did at points in the debate. He did just fine.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The question is whether “just fine” is good enough to stem what’s becoming a tide of Democratic calls for him to step aside.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Biden’s okay press conference came after two very bad days for him — and more bad days may be coming</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Just a few days earlier, it seemed Biden had managed to ride out the storm over his bad debate performance. But a slew of bad news Wednesday and prior to the press conference Thursday ensued.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">His fundraising <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/10/dems-fear-biden-fundraising-cratering-00167496">is plummeting</a>. His own campaign aides are telling reporters <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/biden-reelection-insiders-no-path-debate-rcna161296">he should quit</a>. More Democrats <a href="https://x.com/haleytalbotcnn/status/1811517306276888924">have come out</a> publicly against him staying in the race, with one going so far <a href="https://www.kgw.com/article/news/politics/national-politics/marie-gluesenkamp-perez-statement-biden/283-c293250b-ed80-4360-bce5-532931e8700a">as to say</a> he should resign the presidency. Reports circulated that top party figures — <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2024/07/11/what-obama-and-pelosi-are-doing-about-biden-00167520">Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi</a>, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/10/schumer-biden-dump-donors-2024-election">Chuck Schumer</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/uaws-fain-tells-board-hes-worried-trump-could-beat-biden-sources-say-2024-07-11/">United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain</a> — have in private been less than fully supportive of Biden.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden’s team <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-debate-doggett-election-2024-pelosi-970ac9eca4cf397faea9306a0e4e7442">had announced</a> plans for the presser last week, as part of a strategy for the president to prove his fitness by doing more unscripted public events. In addition to his <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/abc-news-anchor-george-stephanopoulos-exclusive-interview-biden/story?id=111695695">interview with ABC News</a> last week and a call-in chat with <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/08/joe-biden-morning-joe-interview-2024-00166784">MSNBC’s <em>Morning Joe</em> program</a>, the president called into two local radio stations last week. But the radio interviews became problematic when it <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/06/biden-interview-draft-questions-wurd">was reported</a> that the Biden campaign had drafted the questions the hosts would ask and that the <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/11/milwaukee-radio-station-says-it-agreed-to-edit-interview-with-biden/74369012007/">campaign had requested</a> that two comments Biden made be edited out.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then, by the time the NATO press conference drew near, leaks suggested that, even if it went well, it might not help him much. <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/11/biden-house-democrats-call-drop-out">Axios’s Andrew Solender reported</a> that House Democrats were poised to issue “a flood of new statements urging Joe Biden to exit the 2024 race” no matter how the presser went. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Margaret Brennan of CBS News <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/potentially-dozens-of-democrats-expected-to-call-on-biden-to-step-aside-after-nato-conference/">said</a> that “dozens” of such statements from lawmakers were expected in a pre-planned coordinated effort and that a source predicted that, by next week, Biden would find it untenable to stay on the ticket.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So far, Biden remains unmoved</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the press conference, Biden professed utter confidence that everything would be fine for his campaign.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Asked if he’d free Democratic convention delegates pledged to him to back someone else, Biden said such delegates were “free to do whatever they want.” If delegates decided at the convention to back someone else, that would be democracy in action, he said, but “that’s not gonna happen.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Asked what would spur him to end his campaign, he said he’d only do so if his advisers told him “there’s no way you can win.” But, he added, “No one’s saying that.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other presidents, he asserted, had been trailing at this point by more than he is now. He would campaign hard and turn things around.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We’re just gonna keep moving,” he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Shortly after the press conference ended, <a href="https://x.com/natalieandrews/status/1811558570745376903">Rep. Jim Himes</a> (D-CT) released a statement calling President Biden “a remarkable leader.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I hope,” Rep. Himes added, that he “will step away from the presidential campaign.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Which means that, despite the presser, Thursday ended close to where it began: with Democrats at an impasse between a party skeptical of its nominee and a nominee resolute about staying in the race.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Americans are <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/per-capita-meat-usa">eating more meat than ever</a>, but livestock giants still see plenty of room to grow. As pressure mounts for meat producers to improve their treatment of animals and environmental footprints, they’re turning to a tried-and-true strategy — used in the past by the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/3/21/8267049/merchants-of-doubt">tobacco and oil industries</a> — to expand their markets and shore up the public’s trust in their products: funding favorable research from university scientists.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last year, the National Pork Board, a pork marketing group sponsored by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), funded a nearly $8.5 million program in partnership with researchers from Iowa State University, the University of Georgia, the University of Minnesota, North Carolina State University, and North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University to research popular perceptions of the pork industry and improve its reputation, according to federal <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f13ca3e0d7b7a5d4bf7abc8/t/65da7fa3688e982d508a23a1/1708818344236/Real+Pork+Consortium+Proposal.pdf">records</a> obtained by <a href="https://www.vox.com/23906572/crystal-heath-veterinarian-medicine-factory-farming-ventilation-shutdown-future-perfect-50-2023">Crystal Heath</a>, a veterinarian and founder of animal advocacy nonprofit Our Honor. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The project, called the Real Pork Trust Consortium, aims to counter “consumer misperceptions of pork production practices,” including about its impacts on animals and the environment, a grant proposal obtained by Heath states. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The grant proposal, reproduced below, notes that some consumers, like those in coastal states, hold more negative views of the pork industry and that “by analyzing the traits and tendencies of these specific groups, we can create targeted communication strategies which influence consumers’ knowledge and understanding of pork production methods, inform decision-making related to political activity, and encourage pork consumption across diverse consumer groups.” Researchers will create communications to share with consumers, with the aim of improving trust in the industry and “ensuring its social license to operate.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Heath questions why it should be the job of university researchers to protect the reputation of pork producers. The industry has “enlisted university faculty to serve in its public relations apparatus,” hoping to use researchers’ credibility to prop up an industry that has been implicated in animal cruelty, zoonotic disease risk, and environmental harms, she told Vox in an email. “It’s sort of like increasing public trust in coal mining-based energy production, lead-based paint manufacturing, leaded fuel-dependent transportation, asbestos-dependent construction methods, or DDT-based pest control.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The National Pork Board (NPB) did not initially respond to requests for comment. After publication, Iowa pork producer and president of NPB’s board of directors Al Wulfekuhle told Vox in a statement that “land-grant colleges and universities are an important source of scientific expertise and hands-on experience when it comes to advancing animal agriculture. &#8230;<strong> </strong>So that we can continue to produce affordable, nutritious protein <a href="https://www.porkcares.org/proof/decades-of-improvement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more efficiently and sustainably,</a> the Pork Board intentionally partners with organizations, academic institutions and researchers who are committed to following objective research practices and guidelines.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lead researcher Nicholas Gabler, a professor in Iowa State University’s animal science department, did not respond to Vox’s request for comment but <a href="https://www.feedstuffs.com/agribusiness-news/real-pork-trust-consortium-works-to-resolve-gaps-in-understanding-of-pork">stated</a> in a recent interview with the animal agriculture trade publication Feedstuffs that the consortium is “not a marketing program. It is a science-driven program for understanding how we can communicate better” to improve trust between pork producers and consumers.&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Real Pork Trust Consortium is far from the only partnership between meat producers and universities. Close collaboration between the meat industry and academic scientists stretches back to the early days of land-grant universities in the US, when researchers were enlisted to boost the productivity of agriculture in the rapidly growing nation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, some of these partnerships have shifted to focus on contemporary challenges like addressing animal agriculture’s outsize contribution to climate change. But land-grant universities’ original mandate to serve the interests of the agriculture industry<strong> </strong>is colliding with <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/3/20/24105735/peak-meat-livestock-emissions-plant-based-climate-deadline">clear calls from climate scientists about the need to scale down</a> the livestock industry to meet climate targets and minimize risks to public health and animal welfare.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To mitigate their emissions, meat and dairy companies are pinning their hopes on a suite of technological solutions including adding <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/14062022/cow-seaweed-methane/">seaweed to cattle feed</a> or <a href="https://grist.org/agriculture/biogas-boom-ira-incentives/">implementing manure digesters</a>: massive pools meant to capture methane from livestock poop, for use as a fuel source. These practices do shave off emissions, but in many cases they’re difficult to scale, and their potential to mitigate the carbon footprint of highly emitting industries like beef and dairy is overstated. Climate scientists <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02409-7#:~:text=By%202050%2C%20dietary%20changes%20could,people%20ate%20less%20meat%3F')">agree</a> that they have to be accompanied by reductions in livestock production and shifting diets to eat less meat and dairy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the livestock industry has its own scientists, in some cases, emissions-reduction research is carried out by public, land-grant universities, like the University of California Davis, University of Nebraska, Colorado State University, Texas A&amp;M, and others. As with the Real Pork Trust Consortium, animal science programs at these institutions are sometimes funded with millions of dollars in donations from meat and dairy corporations and trade groups and conducted by researchers with ties to industry.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These partnerships largely prioritize animal agriculture’s continued profitability and can serve to sow doubt about livestock’s role in the climate crisis. Critics say they amount to greenwashing. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The animal agriculture industry is now involved in multiple multimillion-dollar efforts with universities to obstruct unfavorable policies as well as influence climate change policy and discourse,” wrote <a href="https://law.yale.edu/viveca-morris">Viveca Morris</a>, an environmental lawyer at Yale Law, and <a href="https://jenniferjacquet.com/">Jennifer Jacquet</a>, an expert on corporate influence at the University of Miami, in a sprawling <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-024-03690-w">2024 paper</a> analyzing university-industry partnerships in the livestock sector. “These efforts have downplayed the livestock sector’s contributions to the climate crisis, minimized the need for emission regulations and other policies aimed at internalizing the costs of the industry’s emissions, and promoted industry-led climate ‘solutions’ that maintain production.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The university mission,” they warned, “is at risk when universities allow industries to shape research and fund communications with the appearance of academic independence.” </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Land-grant universities were set up to boost ag productivity</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The close partnership between farmers and America’s public universities dates back to 1862, when the federal <a href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/morrill-act">Morrill Act</a> allowed states to establish public universities funded by the sale of federal land (much of which had been <a href="https://www.landgrabu.org/">stolen from Native American tribes</a>). That’s why these universities are called “land-grant” institutions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The goal was to provide education in fields that would help Americans build a successful country, including engineering, military science, and agriculture, said <a href="https://www.aplu.org/about-us/who-we-are/staff/steele/">Doug Steele</a>, the vice president of food, agriculture, and natural resources at the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU). </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Public universities’ relationship with farmers was further formalized in 1914 with the creation of the USDA’s <a href="https://www.nifa.usda.gov/about-nifa/how-we-work/extension/cooperative-extension-history#:~:text=The%20Smith%20Lever%20Act%20formalized,address%20exclusively%20rural%2C%20agricultural%20issues.">Cooperative Extension System</a>, which established university-government partnerships with the goal of increasing farm productivity and profitability and addressing the research needs of rural, farming communities. These programs offered free educational resources to the public and produced research in direct response to questions from farmers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Extension services aimed to help rural people (particularly white landowners) survive the modern world, especially as an economic gap widened between rural and urban communities, said <a href="https://history.missouri.edu/people/deutsch">Chris<strong> </strong>Deutsch</a>, a historian of the meat industry at the University of Missouri. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the 1920s and ’30s, when crop failures began to prevent American farmers from producing cotton and fruit such as peaches (significant cash crops at the time), extension services stepped in to give farmers another way to make money, said <a href="http://www.rogerhorowitz.com/about-roger.html">Roger Horowitz</a>, a historian of the US food system at the Hagley Museum.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Extension agents became more connected to the meatpacking industry and more interested in encouraging commercial livestock production as an alternative,” Horowitz said. Since livestock was (and still is) mostly fed grass, hay, and grains, which weren’t as hard hit by crop failures, the sector was seen as a viable alternative.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After World War II, agriculture and land ownership increasingly consolidated, and the nature of land-grant universities’ relationship with agriculture began to shift away from a focus on individual farmers’ needs toward more industrial and commercial interests.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thus began a close partnership between public universities and livestock producers that would eventually lead to the factory farms that exist today: animal production and slaughter operations run in large industrial facilities that resemble factories more than traditional farms and raise far more animals, far more quickly, than any previous agricultural system.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Public universities, and especially extension services, “were a key part in the creation of the intensive agricultural system that we have, and particularly the animal side &#8230; because of all the myriad problems that emerge from trying to concentrate animals in a singular point,” said Deutsch.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jacquet put it even more bluntly: “You don&#8217;t get the industry that we have now without the land-grant institutions.”</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>“The university mission is at risk when universities allow industries to shape research and fund communications with the appearance of academic independence</em>”</p><cite>VIVECA MORRIS AND JENNIFER JACQUET</cite></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The livestock sector began to thrive via all kinds of advancements in farming methods made possible by the work of university scientists. Dubbed the “<a href="https://www.asas.org/docs/default-source/midwest/mw2020/publications/footehist.pdf?sfvrsn=59da6c07_0">first great biotechnology</a>” by one researcher, modern <a href="https://extension.umn.edu/dairy-milking-cows/artificial-insemination-cattle">artificial insemination</a> — the process of collecting sperm from a male animal and depositing it in the reproductive organs of a female — arose after work from extension program researchers at Cornell University (one of seven private land-grant universities in the US) and public university faculty at the University of Minnesota, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and others. Today, the technology is ubiquitous across the meat and dairy industries, giving farmers an unprecedented level of control over the reproductive lives of animals and allowing for rapid production speeds.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Feed additives developed by public universities supercharged animals’ ability to metabolize food and convert it into body mass, said Deutsch. In the 1950s, for example, Iowa State University researcher <a href="https://isubios.pubpub.org/pub/ljwww8lm/release/1">Wise Burroughs</a> helped develop and patented a feed additive called diethylstilbestrol, a synthetic form of estrogen that led cows to gain weight 12 percent faster while eating 8-10 percent less feed. Iowa State later partnered with feed and pharma giant Eli Lilly to produce the hormone (Eli Lilly has since split from animal-health subsidiary Elanco and now focuses on human health). By the 1970s, it was banned in the US, in part due to its link to cancer in humans. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Also in the 1950s, extension programs began to push farmers to use more antibiotics, since they made animals grow faster while requiring less feed, said Horowitz.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Publicly supported scientists affiliated with land-grant universities also contributed much of the early research into poultry genetics, nutrition, and health, propelling the US chicken industry into the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/2/10/23589333/cecile-steele-chicken-meat-poultry-eggs-delaware">behemoth</a> that it is today. The use of medicated feed and new research into poultry diseases created a booming chicken industry that helped increase American chicken production almost 30-fold in the last century.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Genetics research transformed the chicken from a “backyard scratch, hunt, and peck animal into, essentially, a technology,” said <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Chicken.html?id=iwh3yAEACAAJ">Paul Josephson</a>, an environmental historian at Colby College who has written a book about the history of chickens. High-profile <a href="https://livestock.extension.wisc.edu/articles/the-chicken-of-tomorrow/">contests</a> in the 1940s, resulting from partnerships between the poultry industry and extension programs including at the University of Delaware and the University of Arkansas, sought the “Chicken of Tomorrow,” a breed that would have a larger percentage of breast, leg, and thigh meat.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, Americans eat more than 9 billion broiler chickens every year — animals that are <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119385505">more than four times</a> as massive as a chicken of the 1950s, a transformation that has come at a high cost to animal welfare. Modern chickens <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/aug/17/from-farm-to-factory-the-unstoppable-rise-of-american-chicken">grow so big and so fast</a> that their legs often can’t support the immense weight of their bodies. Research out of public universities made this transformation possible through developments in feed, antibiotics, and genetics. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today’s public universities continue to develop methods that push animals to their biological limits to allow the US to produce ever more animals at higher speed and lower cost. A 2015 New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/20/dining/animal-welfare-at-risk-in-experiments-for-meat-industry.html">investigation</a>, for example, found that the US Meat Animal Research Center, a cooperative program between the USDA and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, was breeding female pigs and cows to give birth to ever more offspring, leading to mass mortality and severe animal welfare problems. The USDA told the Times that the center follows federal animal welfare rules.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2016, public records <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/04/14/killing-chickens-bird-flu-vsd/">obtained</a> by animal welfare group Animal Outlook revealed that research at North Carolina State University funded by the US Poultry and Egg Association, an industry trade group, played a major role in developing ventilation shutdown: a method used to mass kill chickens and turkeys by trapping them inside barns and pumping in extreme heat. The method kills the animals by heatstroke and is now being used to cull tens of millions of poultry birds to stop the spread of bird flu; it’s been <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23963820/bird-flu-surge-us-ventilation-shutdown-veterinarians">criticized</a> as the cruelest culling option.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This type of research is “unethical, particularly &#8230; when the very things you’re doing to increase production are causing harm to animals,” said <a href="https://www.vermontlaw.edu/directory/person/winders-delcianna">Delcianna Winders</a>, an associate professor of animal law at Vermont Law and Graduate School.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Ag industry-aligned researchers want to develop climate solutions without sacrificing growth</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The supercharged growth of the livestock industry has brought huge consequences for the environment, for the public, and for the animals themselves. “It’s ecologically illogical,” said Deutsch. “It shouldn’t be possible to gather a million [animals] into one small contained room and have that be sustainable.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, Deutsch said, the livestock industry still depends on university research to maintain conditions where <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23963820/bird-flu-surge-us-ventilation-shutdown-veterinarians">disease thrives</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/31/23852325/farming-myths-agricultural-exceptionalism-pollution-labor-animal-welfare-laws">ecological issues</a> are rampant, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/3/9/22967328/animal-cruelty-laws-state-federal-exemptions-pennsylvania-martin-farms-dairy-calves-dehorning">animal welfare violations persist</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meat and dairy production account for <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/novel-meat-and-dairy-alternatives-could-help-curb-climate-harming#:~:text=The%20animal%20agriculture%20industry%20is,cent%20of%20global%20GHG%20emissions.">14-20 percent</a> of global greenhouse gas emissions, while fertilizer and manure runoff from concentrated animal farms has created widespread water quality issues in the US Midwest, <a href="https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/2021/06/midwest-farm-states-nitrate-pollution-tap-water-more-likely-lower-income">particularly</a> for disadvantaged communities. Forcing animals into crowded spaces also heightens the risk of <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/4/22/21228158/coronavirus-pandemic-risk-factory-farming-meat">zoonotic disease spillover</a> — as we’re seeing now with <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24128700/bird-fludairy-meat-industry-h5n1-cows-milk-eggs-safety">bird flu infections</a> among US dairy herds and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/s0522-human-case-h5.html">dairy workers</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, public universities are hard at work assisting the industry in finding sustainability solutions that don’t sacrifice growth. Much of that work surrounds efforts to reduce <a href="https://www.epa.gov/gmi/importance-methane#:~:text=Methane%20is%20the%20second%20most,trapping%20heat%20in%20the%20atmosphere.">methane</a> — a greenhouse gas nearly 30 times <a href="https://www.epa.gov/gmi/importance-methane">more potent</a> than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere&nbsp;<strong> </strong>— released by beef and dairy cattle.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Researchers at universities across the country, including Colorado State University, the University of California Davis, the University of Nebraska, and others, are working to research various feed additives that promise to reduce cows’ methane emissions, as well as breeding cattle to select for low-methane traits. While that’s framed as a sustainability strategy, it comes with an added benefit for the industry’s bottom line: When cows emit less methane, they likely also convert their feed into meat more efficiently and may require less food, according to <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fanim.2021.641590/full">some</a> <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1828051X.2017.1404945">studies</a>. In this way, creating combinations of cattle breeds and feed additives that reduce methane may also create more profit for producers and allow for growth in the sector.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Environmental advocates have <a href="https://modernfarmer.com/2024/04/biogas-mega-dairies-problem/">raised concerns</a> that methane-reduction strategies such as feed additives and manure digesters may ultimately end up creating more, not less, pollution, since they offer farmers additional income streams and promote growth of the industry. In <a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/low-carbon-fuel-standard">California</a>, for example, dairy producers can receive <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/28122023/milking-it-battle-underway-california-dairy-biogas-market/">lucrative financial credits</a> for producing biogas by capturing methane from manure. Public university research and extension programs have<strong> </strong>advanced the <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=106096">increasing popularity</a> of manure digesters by <a href="https://extension.psu.edu/agricultural-anaerobic-digesters-design-and-operation#:~:text=Earlier%20anaerobic%20digesters%20for%20biogas%20production&amp;text=Laboratory%20experiments%20to%20produce%20methane,treat%20settled%20waste%2Dwater%20solids.">testing prototypes</a> in their own research facilities and creating <a href="https://learningstore.extension.wisc.edu/products/anaerobic-digestion-from-animal-manure">educational resources</a> for farmers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One <a href="https://foe.org/resources/biogas-or-bull/#:~:text=Herd%20sizes%20at%20facilities%20with,nearly%2085%2C000%20dairy%20cows%20total.">study</a> by the environmental nonprofit Friends of the Earth found that herd sizes at livestock facilities with manure digesters grew 3.7 percent, on average, each year — 24 times the growth rate of overall dairy herd sizes.<strong> </strong>“We are not saying that this is like a primary driver of [dairy industry] consolidation, more that it is a factor that can exacerbate an existing trend toward consolidation,” said <a href="https://foe.org/team-members/chloe-waterman/">Chloë Waterman</a>, senior program manager for FOE’s Climate-Friendly Food Program. Consolidating livestock can lead to worsening pollution and increased animal welfare harms.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/AP24030658867435.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.73733135571,100,78.525337288581" alt="Dairy cows are lined up in a metal circular indoor &quot;milking parlor,&quot; where they&#039;re each milked by machines." title="Dairy cows are lined up in a metal circular indoor &quot;milking parlor,&quot; where they&#039;re each milked by machines." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Cows are milked on a large carousel at an industrial dairy farm in Wisconsin. | Morry Gash/AP Photo" data-portal-copyright="Morry Gash/AP Photo" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">These methane-reduction strategies can shave off emissions, but only at the margins. Without pairing those technologies with a plan to reduce meat and dairy production, we stand <a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/without-changing-diets-agriculture-alone-could-produce-enough-emissions-surpass-15degc">little chance</a> of limiting global warming below targets set by global climate experts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That reality is hard to square with land-grant researchers’ role in the livestock industry. As they provide the basic research that advances temporary solutions such as feed additives and manure digesters, public university researchers simultaneously lend a patina of scientific expertise to industry-backed claims that the animal agriculture industry shouldn’t be blamed for climate change and does not need to scale down. The <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f13ca3e0d7b7a5d4bf7abc8/t/65da7fa3688e982d508a23a1/1708818344236/Real+Pork+Consortium+Proposal.pdf">Real Pork Trust Consortium</a> offers a particularly extreme example, with its goal to “enhance pork’s image among global consumers and societies.” But it’s hardly alone.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The rise of “climate-smart” meat and dairy</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2022, records gathered by <a href="https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2022/10/31/frank-mitloehner-uc-davis-climate-funding/">Unearthed,</a> an investigative journalism project funded by Greenpeace, and also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/31/climate/frank-mitloehner-uc-davis.html">covered</a> in the New York Times, found that the Clear Center, a research institute at UC Davis run by prominent animal industry scientist Frank Mitloehner, had <a href="https://www.desmog.com/2022/11/03/animal-agriculture-industry-commits-millions-to-prominent-university-animal-science-research-center-documents-show/">received millions of dollars</a> in gifts from the animal feed and livestock industry, particularly Ifeeder, a nonprofit founded by an industry association whose members include meat giants Cargill, Tyson Foods, and a subsidiary of JBS, the world’s largest meat company.<strong> </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The research funded by Ifeeder was, in part, meant to investigate the role of feed additives in reducing enteric methane emissions. Industry funding is common in academic research and isn’t, on its own, necessarily compromising. But Mitloehner is also an outspoken <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGG-A80Tl5g">defender</a> of livestock farming and downplays animal agriculture’s role in the climate crisis, acting as a climate expert for the industry’s needs via written articles, media interviews, and presentations.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In one <a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/23259351-clear-center-about">document</a> explaining the Clear Center’s purpose, Ifeeder wrote that “Mitloehner provides a neutral, credible, third-party voice” and that data produced by the Clear Center will “show consumers that they can feel good about the choice they are making to include protein in their families’ diets.” Mitloehner told Unearthed that “the Clear Center works with the livestock sector to make it better for the environment. To suggest we’re doing anything other than that is a gross mischaracterization of what we do,” and that “the Clear Center and myself are not concerned with the financial interests of stakeholders or others in the livestock industry.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A similar story emerged at Colorado State University in 2020, when a partnership between the university and various beef industry groups formed AgNext, a program dedicated to research that advances sustainability in the livestock sectors, according to its <a href="https://agnext.colostate.edu/about/">website</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">AgNext’s first director, Kimberly Stackhouse-Lawson, who used to work as the chief sustainability officer for JBS USA, has received at least $574,467 from the cattle, pork, dairy, feed, and pharmaceutical industries (including NCBA and JBS) to, in part, research livestock sustainability, according to records obtained by <a href="https://aria.info/about-us/">ARIA</a>, a research organization focused on climate. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Both Stackhouse-Lawson and AgNext researcher Sara Place, who worked previously for animal pharmaceutical company Elanco and was senior director of sustainable beef production research at the National Cattlemen&#8217;s Beef Association, completed their PhDs under Mitloehner’s supervision. Place’s doctoral work evaluated the impact of an Elanco feed additive on methane emissions in dairy cattle. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Like Mitloehner, Stackhouse-Lawson has <a href="https://agriculture.house.gov/uploadedfiles/stackhouse-lawson_testimony_package.pdf">spoken</a> about her belief that regulations of greenhouse gas emissions should not burden producers financially and that sustainability goals should not hinder “value chain profitability.” Like the Clear Center, AgNext has emphasized communicating to the public that animal protein is an <a href="https://perma.cc/82H7-KRMP">essential part of a healthy diet</a> and not the climate culprit that other scientists make it out to be. Mitloehner and Stackhouse-Lawson have both been involved in advancing policies aligned with the livestock industry’s interests and have given congressional testimony regarding climate change and animal agriculture.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“To the extent Mitloehner and Stackhouse-Lawson publish peer-reviewed research related to climate change, their work focuses primarily on the use of feed additives or other technological and industry-led solutions, or promoting greenhouse gas accounting metrics that are favorable to the US meat and dairy industries,” write Jacquet and Morris in their <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-024-03690-w">paper</a> about the Clear Center and AgNext.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“In recognition of the impact of agriculture on climate change, AgNext researchers work with members of the entire livestock value chain to understand current practices and systems and identify viable and scalable options that can move the industry toward a sustainable future,” Place said in an email. “While it is common for industry and government to fund programs, equipment and even research, university research is independent and objective — funding sources have no influence on AgNext research outcomes. To be clear, it is not true that AgNext promotes ‘greenhouse gas accounting metrics that are favorable to the US meat and dairy industries.’” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At Pennsylvania State University, meanwhile, researchers were <a href="https://www.psu.edu/news/agricultural-sciences/story/penn-state-awarded-grant-help-dairy-farmers-develop-climate-smart/">granted up to $25 million</a> from the USDA to work with the Center for Dairy Excellence, a consortium of Pennsylvania dairy trade groups, and ag tech company Proagrica to develop “climate-smart” dairy farming practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Penn State program ultimately aims to assess the climate impacts of methods Pennsylvania dairy farmers are already using.&nbsp;With a better idea of the emissions reductions of certain farming practices, dairy farmers could participate in a voluntary climate market, where the greenhouse gas reductions of their practices are sold as carbon offsets for which farmers receive a payment, according to Caroline Novak of the Professional Dairy Managers of Pennsylvania, a trade group that has partnered with Penn State for the project. “Implementing and maintaining climate smart practices costs farmers money. They have to find a way for the practices to pay for themselves. If they are forced to do it without financial sustainability,&nbsp;there will be no farms left to feed people,” Novak said in an email. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s reminiscent of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/8/23863100/tyson-climate-friendly-beef-burger-usda">“climate-smart” label piloted by Tyson</a> last year for beef that the company claimed emitted 10 percent less than its overall beef herd. The actual emissions reductions of the program are unclear, and even with a 10 percent emissions reduction, beef is far from climate-smart: It’s by far the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food">worst food</a> for the climate, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/dining/climate-change-food-eating-habits.html">dairy</a> is not far behind.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/Untitled.png.webp?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=6.6270833333333,0,86.745833333333,100" alt="Aerial view of hundreds of cows concentrated in a feedlot." title="Aerial view of hundreds of cows concentrated in a feedlot." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="An aerial shot of Nebraska-based Adams Land &amp; Cattle Co., Tyson’s sole supplier of its Brazen Beef line. | Google Maps/Environmental Working Group" data-portal-copyright="Google Maps/Environmental Working Group" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">As is the case with feed additives, manure digesters, and the Tyson program, farmers may be earning more without having to change much about the way their farms operate.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">“<strong>Science depends on the questions we ask</strong>”</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">University research, Jacquet and Morris argue, offers legitimacy that corporations themselves cannot achieve.<strong> </strong>As universities partner to advance the livestock sector via projects like the Clear Center, AgNext, and the Real Pork Trust Consortium, they miss opportunities to use their resources to advance sustainability solutions that decenter productivity and profitability and prioritize the public interest, including environmental health, public health, and animal welfare.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>Research shows that industry funding can influence the types of questions asked, and studies that are unlikely to find information useful to industry are less likely to get funding</em></p></blockquote></figure>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none"></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Asking who this serves is really important,” Jacquet said. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Research aimed at increasing profit is “yet another form of subsidy to the industry,” Winders said. “That&#8217;s not a public service. It&#8217;s not like those profits are going to be spread across society. Those profits are going to the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census">highly, highly concentrated</a> industry. And so it&#8217;s helping these already extremely profitable multinational corporations make even more money.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Research shows that industry funding can influence the types of questions asked, and studies that are unlikely to find information useful to industry are less likely to get funding. One <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6187765/">2018 study</a> of research across multiple STEM fields found that corporate sponsorship of research “can drive research agendas away from questions that are the most relevant for public health.” At the moment, much of the public research into animal farming is following this path by pushing advancements only into climate solutions that allow for industry growth while employing public university researchers to spread the message to consumers that industrial animal farming isn’t as harmful as they might think.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, research into alternatives to the livestock sector, such as cell-cultivated meat and plant-based alternatives, receives comparatively little public funding, <a href="https://www.cell.com/one-earth/pdf/S2590-3322(23)00347-0.pdf">as shown by recent research</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Projects more relevant to environmental concerns and public health could include studies that advance production of plant-based proteins, Winders said, or initiatives that educate farmers on organic farming methods, said Horowitz. Such initiatives could also help farmers unhappy with exploitative contracts with meatpacking companies to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22609382/plant-based-meatless-future-transition-farmers-meatpacking-workers">escape the industry</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Right now, land-grant researchers have strong incentives to prioritize the interests of powerful, highly polluting incumbent industries. But there are infinitely many paths that university research could take.“Science depends on the questions we ask,” Heath said. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The murmurs about President Joe Biden’s health — and particularly commentary about whether he’s exhibiting signs of Parkinson’s disease — have reached a fever pitch.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Monday, the New York Times reported that a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/08/us/politics/parkinsons-expert-white-house.html">Parkinson’s specialist visited the White House</a> eight times between July 2023 and March 2024, raising questions about whether the president was quietly being evaluated and treated for the condition.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That was followed by a contentious White House press briefing in which press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was bombarded by questions about the president and Parkinson’s. “Has the president been treated for Parkinson’s? No. Is he being treated for Parkinson’s? No, he’s not. Is he taking medication for Parkinson’s? No,” Jean-Pierre parried. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Later that evening, the White House released a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Letter7.8.24.pdf">letter</a> from Kevin O’Connor, the president’s physician, which noted that the president “has not seen a neurologist outside of his annual physical.” The letter also implied that the Parkinson’s specialist mentioned in the New York Times story, Kevin Cannard, had been to the White House over the years to see other staffers and military members in his capacity as neurologist to the White House medical unit, which he’s held since 2012.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">O’Connor referred back to the results of a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Health-Summary-2.28.pdf">medical exam</a> released in February that reported “no findings which would be consistent with … Parkinson’s,” among other conditions. The neurological exams as part of the annual physicals were conducted by Cannard, according to O’Connor’s letter.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But that letter has not tamped down the speculation. On Wednesday morning, NBC aired an interview with a neurologist, who declared, “He has Parkinsonism. That is a fact. He has degeneration of the brain.” (More on “Parkinsonism” below.)</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">On NBC, a neurologist says Biden has Parkinson’s. “That is a fact. He has degeneration of the brain. Show me the MRI. Show me he doesn&#039;t…. He definitely has it.&quot; A med student who looked at Biden’s symptoms and didn’t diagnose Parkinson’s, says the doctor, would be failed. <a href="https://t.co/VpaBGMCJY7">pic.twitter.com/VpaBGMCJY7</a></p>&mdash; Mike (@Doranimated) <a href="https://twitter.com/Doranimated/status/1811028953458512080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 10, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To be clear, it’s hard to make a Parkinson’s diagnosis from afar, says <a href="https://tanz.med.utoronto.ca/anthony-lang">Anthony Lang</a>, a neurologist and researcher who leads Parkinson’s disease research at the University of Toronto’s Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases. “I’d be very reluctant to come to any specific conclusion without a clear, hands-on assessment of the individual,” he says.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the reason doctors like<strong> </strong>CNN medical correspondent and neurologist <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/05/health/gupta-biden-cognitive-testing-analysis/index.html">Sanjay Gupta</a>, among others, have been vocal is that the movement changes typical of Parkinson’s — even if they’re caused by a different condition — can be<strong> </strong>fairly straightforward to the trained eye. And according to Lang and doctors I’ve spoken with, and in my own view as a doctor, further neurological testing would be the most reasonable recommendation based on what we’ve observed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s why speculation about the disease has picked up — and why the controversy might linger.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Why we’re suddenly talking about Biden and Parkinson’s</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a well-known fact that Joe Biden is 81 and moves his age. What kickstarted the latest bout of speculation about deeper health problems was his disastrous June 27 debate performance against Donald Trump.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During the debate, Biden often spoke haltingly, occasionally losing his way mid-thought, and while his opponent spoke, his face was often frozen and expressionless. A tsunami of commentary about his health followed, including speculation about Parkinson’s.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/05/health/gupta-biden-cognitive-testing-analysis/index.html">column</a> published on CNN&#8217;s website July 5, Gupta wrote that he and “more than a dozen” of his neurologist colleagues had been stunned by the president’s “confused rambling; sudden loss of concentration in the middle of a sentence; halting speech and absence of facial animation, resulting at times in a flat, open-mouthed expression.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What Gupta and some medical experts seized upon were some classic symptoms. Parkinson’s involves changes in the way people move, and often, later in the disease, cognitive problems like dementia. In this illness, many of these symptoms are caused by a problem with the brain’s production of dopamine, a molecule involved in signaling body parts to move.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The changes in movement caused by the condition are so characteristic that doctors often group them together using the condition’s name, whether or not the diagnosis has been made. Parkinsonism is an umbrella term that describes a combination of slowness, stiffness, a flexed posture, decreased facial expressiveness, soft speech, gait changes (including a slower, shorter stride), and often, tremors.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although primary care doctors are commonly the first to identify these findings based on a patient’s physical exam, specialists are often involved in confirming a Parkinson’s diagnosis and managing treatment. A full neurologic exam aimed at making the diagnosis includes observing a patient in action and putting them through a range of active and passive movement exercises.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other tests, including brain MRIs and spinal taps, can help rule other conditions out, or are used in research settings to help make a diagnosis in select patients — but “it really is mainly clinical diagnosis,” says Lang. In other words, it’s a diagnosis made by observing and examining a patient, not by doing lab tests or CT scans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">People can have Parkinsonism without having Parkinson’s disease. Drugs that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8227528/">block or deplete dopamine</a> — for example, antipsychotic drugs and medicines used to treat some gastrointestinal conditions — can cause these symptoms. Less commonly, so can brain tumors and strokes. That’s part of why doctors are hesitant to speculate on Biden’s diagnosis (or anyone else’s) purely on the basis of observing his movements and speech on video.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although Parkinson’s motor symptoms can be minimized with medication, it’s a progressive and&nbsp;debilitating illness with cognitive components that loom larger with age. Stress <a href="https://www.parkinson.org/blog/how-stress-and-stress-management-impact-parkinsons#:~:text=People%20with%20Parkinson's%20disease%20(PD,symptoms%2C%20particularly%20anxiety%20and%20depression.">temporarily worsens</a> the disease’s symptoms, and<strong> </strong>maintaining stamina can be especially challenging for people with the condition: About half of all people with Parkinson’s say <a href="https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/non-movement-symptoms/fatigue">fatigue is a major problem</a>. Dementia is <a href="https://memory.ucsf.edu/dementia/parkinsons/parkinson-disease-dementia">incredibly common in older people with</a> the disease, affecting around 80 percent, and can come on relatively quickly.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Oral medications and other treatments exist that help <a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/current-research/focus-disorders/parkinsons-disease-research/parkinsons-disease-challenges-progress-and-promise#:~:text=However%2C%20much%20work%20remains%20to,people%20with%20more%20advanced%20PD.">reduce the condition’s physical symptoms</a>, although there’s no known way to slow its associated cognitive changes. Synthetic forms of dopamine are a cornerstone of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/parkinsons-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20376062">Parkinson’s treatment</a>, and other medicines (including some that mimic dopamine’s effects) may also be helpful. Some people in late stages of the disease may benefit from a surgically implanted device called a deep brain stimulator, which sends electrical impulses from a tiny pacemaker-like box implanted in the chest to electrodes implanted in the brain.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Doctors inexperienced in evaluating Parkinson’s may miss the diagnosis, attributing its symptoms to normal aging. However, the condition involves findings that skilled clinicians can typically identify using certain <a href="https://stanfordmedicine25.stanford.edu/the25/parkinsondisease.html">maneuvers</a>. A physical exam also involves close observation of the patient for the posture and gait changes, masked face, tremor, and other typical signs. Not all patients have all the symptoms, and especially early in the disease, some symptoms may be absent, which may complicate or delay diagnosis and treatment.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Why the controversy might linger </strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Joe Biden, the president of the United States, the stakes of getting that assessment are higher than the average person’s.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For his part, Lang echoes what Gupta and other expert sources have floated: The president should undergo cognitive testing and other evaluations to determine the causes of his physical changes. “If the results indicate an issue, then they should deal with it honestly and appropriately,” Lang says.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is simply not enough evidence from observing Joe Biden on TV to say that he definitely has Parkinson’s. But the reason why some medical experts have felt comfortable piping up is there is enough evidence to recommend further testing — even with the results from the February medical exam. Barring a sudden change in how the president moves, talks, and acts, the speculation isn’t likely to go away anytime soon.</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It was probably the ninth time <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/357907/spotify-sabrina-carpenter-espresso-chappell-roan-algorithm">Sabrina Carpenter’s hit single “Please, Please, Please” played, unprompted</a>, that I decided it was time to quit Spotify. I’d been a Premium subscriber since the company started offering it in the United States in 2011 and I’ve generally been a Spotify fanatic who obsessively cultivates his collection of playlists. But, please, I can only take so much.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Spotify raised its prices in July <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170301/spotify-us-price-increase-plans">for the second time in as many years</a>. And while that price hike is part of why I quit, it’s still not the whole story. Basically, Spotify just started annoying me. I’d get peeved by ads for concerts popping up without warning and not being able to find a way to turn them off. The app also didn’t work as well as it used to. It froze sometimes, struggled to play music over my earbuds, and almost never connected to my Sonos speakers when I wanted it to. These are little gripes, but they add up, especially when you’re paying money for a service. And Spotify wants me to pay even more!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So I went shopping for a new music streaming service, which sent me down a rabbit hole as I tried to understand the state of the streaming entertainment industry in general. If I knew a little bit about the motivations of these companies, I thought I might make better choices and possibly even save some money. I ended up spending more money, but I also get more than music from my new subscription.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You see, I fell into the bundle trap. After quitting Spotify, I signed up for <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-apple-one/">Apple One, a bundle</a> that includes several Apple services, including Music and iCloud storage. I ended up giving Apple the money I’d stopped spending on Spotify and then some. And I got some services I didn’t really want — looking at you, Apple Arcade — although maybe I will want them in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Signing up for bundles is what almost all the streaming entertainment companies want you to do. That doesn’t mean bundling has to be bad. The constantly changing bundling offerings <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/streaming-bundles-are-here-and-you-may-need-a-ph-d-to-navigate-the-options-104dc079">from media companies, phone companies, and tech companies</a> can be confusing, and a bundle of subscriptions can cost more than what you’re already paying for. If you’re willing to be flexible, however, you can get bundles to work in your favor. In other words, you fall into a bundle trap but climb right back out in better shape.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bundling <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/2/18518666/bundle-tv-hbo-disney-netflix-apple-amazon-war">is hardly a new strategy</a>. It’s how cable television worked decades ago: You pay one set rate for cable service that includes a bunch of channels you don’t want. In the streaming era, bundling usually means you get access to several streaming services for one price, although you might also get access to services beyond TV, including music and games.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are several ways to fall into the bundling trap. Like me, you might want one service, like Apple Music, and take the bundle because it’s not much more expensive. You might also want to get Hulu to watch the latest season of <em>The Bear</em>. But when you can also get access to Disney+ and Max for a few dollars more, why not try it? You can always cancel in a month.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There’s this constant tug and pull with audiences,” Anthony Palomba, an assistant professor of business administration at the University of Virginia, told me. “They’ve given too much content to people.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Again, this is not new. What is new this year, however, is that bundles <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/streaming-bundles-are-here-and-you-may-need-a-ph-d-to-navigate-the-options-104dc079">are getting bigger and more confusing</a>. Back in 2019, for example, you could <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20757626/disney-plus-espn-hulu-bundle-price-date-streaming-service#">pay $13 for a bundle</a> that included Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu, all ad-free. Makes sense since all three services are Disney-owned. Fast forward to this spring, however, and major media companies started offering bundles that include services outside their own properties. Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery will soon offer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/business/media/disney-plus-max-streaming-bundle.html">a bundle with Disney+, Hulu, and Max</a>, though they haven’t announced a price. Verizon already offers its customers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23987425/verizon-netflix-max-bundle-price-myplan">a bundle with ad-supported versions of Netflix and Max</a> for $10. And don’t forget about StreamSaver, a bundle for Comcast internet customers that includes Peacock, Netflix (with ads), and Apple+ <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/05/comcast-streamsaver-bundle-launches-xfinity-apple-netflix-peacock-1235943481/">for just $15 a month</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Is your head spinning yet?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is the plan. In the past couple of years, media companies have faced a reckoning: They realized they <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2023/1/5/23539590/streaming-losses-netflix-hbo-peter-kafka-media-column">could no longer spend millions</a> to win over new streaming subscribers, as legacy brands, like Disney, tried to catch up with Netflix. These new streaming services needed to start making money. On top of that, they have a loyalty issue: Many people subscribe to one service, likely to watch a hit show, and then unsubscribe a month later. I did this<em> </em>for <em>Succession </em>on HBO Max (RIP), for example, and you’ve probably done it for your favorite show, too. (Pro tip: If you do this, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/28/technology/personaltech/streaming-service-subscription-costs.html">don’t forget to cancel</a>.) Churn rates at the major streaming services <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2024/04/01/reducing-svod-churn-should-be-the-next-priority-with-media-companies/">have more than doubled</a> in the past five years, according to the research firm Antenna. But when bundles are involved, <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/06/streaming-bundles-churn-subscribers-comcast-disney-apple-1235970400/">multiple research</a> <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/streaming-bundles-churn-cancel-resubscribe-ampere-analysis-1235941007/#">companies say</a> customers tend to stick around. So confusing or not, bundles are back.</p>

I used an app called Playlisty that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.obdura.com/playlisty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made it easy</a>&nbsp;to import dozens of playlists from my Spotify account to Apple Music for a one-time fee of $3. The only thing I’m really missing is the personalized recommendations Spotify’s algorithm spent years perfecting. But I’m sure Apple’s algorithm will surprise and occasionally delight me, too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I realize we’ve strayed quite a bit from my gripes about Spotify, but the chaos in the world of streaming video bundles has spread to the audio world. Because all music streaming services offer the same catalog of songs, each one has to find a way to stand out, and that often means access to other features or services. For Apple Music, which is included in Apple One, that’s generally been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/apple-music-lossless-audio/">its lossless audio offerings</a> and interoperability with Apple devices. YouTube Music lets you watch a song’s music video with a single tap, and it comes free with YouTube Premium. Amazon Music is essentially a perk you get with Prime membership.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Spotify is competing with companies that never need to make a dollar on music or streaming businesses,” said Larry Miller, director of the music business program at NYU Steinhardt. “They use music as a tool to help pull users into their ecosystems.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In other words, the streaming music services are bundling up — except for Spotify. Spotify did start <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-10-03/audiobooks-included-in-spotify-premium/">offering an audiobook service</a> to its Premium members late last year. (Songwriters <a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/nmpa-files-complaint-with-us-federal-trade-commission-against-spotify-over-audiobook-bundle/">have complained</a> that they’re being paid less as a result.) But don’t expect Spotify to launch a Netflix competitor any time soon. Paying $12 a month just for music seems like a different proposition in 2024 than it did a decade ago. Why stop at music when I know I’m going to want to watch TV, play video games, and even enjoy some celebrity-narrated fitness classes one day. Much to my surprise, thanks to Apple Fitness+, I <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248678/apple-time-to-walk-celebrity-guided-audio-dolly-parton-shawn-mendes">actually love going on walks narrated by Dolly Parton</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For me, when I got annoyed with Spotify, Apple Music was an obvious choice. The audio quality is definitely better than Spotify, and the app glitches less often. The fact that I could bundle Apple Music with some other Apple services I was already using, especially iCloud storage, sealed the deal. And after spending a couple of weeks with my new bundle, I feel good about it. I even canceled Max, since I gained a streaming video service in Apple TV+. Time will tell if it all holds my attention, and if it doesn’t, I can always try something else or even go back to Spotify. Remember that the service you sign up for today won’t be the same in a month or a year, given how quickly the industry is changing. You can always cancel and choose a different path.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This all means there’s no better time to be an assertive consumer when it comes to spending money on music, TV shows, and movies. When you feel like the services you’ve been using aren’t serving you anymore, there’s little downside to unsubscribing and spending your money elsewhere. You’ll probably even get a free trial.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These are some examples of the dangers of extreme heat just in the past week. As the climate grows hotter and <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/23805954/extreme-heat-waves-el-nino-climate-change-solutions">extreme heat</a> becomes <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/23800261/tips-extreme-heat-heatwave">our new normal</a>, the summer will continue to bring reminders that high temperatures are a sinister threat. &nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And hot weather has already proven even more devastating in other countries. At least <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn05rz3w4x1o">30 people in Pakistan</a>, more than <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn05rz3w4x1o">100 people in India</a>, and more than <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/extreme-heat-killing-more-than-100-people-in-mexico-hotter-and-much-more-likely-due-to-climate-change/#:~:text=Main%20findings,heat%20stroke%2C%20and%20power%20outages.">125 in Mexico</a> have died due to heat waves this year. At the annual <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/356624/hajj-mecca-heat-saudi-arabia-pilgrims-climate-change-prophet">Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia</a>, extremely hot weather played a role in the deaths of more than 1,300 people. According to the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-heat-and-health">World Health Organization</a>, heat stress is the leading cause of weather-related fatalities, and as global average temperatures rise, the <a href="https://www.lancetcountdown.org/about-us/interact-with-the-key-findings/">risk is mounting</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s odd then that in so many aspects of our culture, we view severe heat as something that should be willingly embraced, bravely endured, blithely ignored, or in the case of some marginalized communities, entirely deserved.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Our books, movies, TV shows, common tropes, idioms, and social media often reinforce the idea that heat is something that — with enough mental acuity — we can overcome. But because of climate change, “pushing through” the heat is something we can no longer physically do. It’s just simply not possible in some parts of the world as temperatures rise <a href="https://www.vox.com/22951182/climate-change-report-ipcc-un-adaptation-warming">past the point of practical survival</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We’ve already passed the point at which the millions of Americans who work outdoors in the summer, or who spend significant amounts of recreational time outside, can do so safely without regular access to shade and hydration — and increasingly even that isn’t enough. Yet ironically the more we rely on air conditioning and other human-made cooling systems for relief, the more we detach ourselves from the urgency of the issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It doesn’t help that heat itself, outside of an emergency like a wildfire, isn’t an immediate problem. It sneaks up on us, gradually inducing health problems over a number of hours, during which everything may seem fine — until it isn’t.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s worth examining our attitudes about heat: Where they come from, what kinds of built-in biases they might hold, and why it’s so hard to let go of the idea that failure to adapt to extreme heat is some kind of personal failing — even in a global heating crisis.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No one has to be miserably hot, and certainly no one has to die.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>All our narratives about heat are about breaking through it. What if we can’t?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We don’t question the necessity of heating during the winter. Why, then, do we consider cooling during the summer a luxury? Even after the <a href="https://www.vox.com/23969523/climate-change-cop28-paris-1-5-c-uae-2023-record-warm">hottest year on record</a> and likely the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/record-heat-deadly-climate-change-humidity-south-11de21a526e1cbe7e306c47c2f12438d">deadliest year for extreme heat</a>, the policies needed to cope with hot weather are alarmingly weak in the US, if they exist at all. For instance, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the federal agency in charge of workplace safety, is only this year beginning to put together <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/356217/osha-federal-workplace-heat-standard-protections">federal workplace safety standards for extreme heat</a> despite <a href="https://www.vox.com/22560815/heat-wave-worker-extreme-climate-change-osha-workplace-farm-restaurant">workers around the country regularly dying on the job</a> due to high temperatures for years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How did we get here? The delay in developing federal protections for workers exposed to the heat might be tied to the idea that if they couldn’t take it, it’s because they weren’t tough enough — a literal application of “if you can’t take the heat, stay out of the kitchen” and a deeply embedded cultural trope.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In fact, heat has been associated with physical and emotional endurance since the earliest modern novels — Don Quixote was very much toughing it out on his way to tilt at windmills. Narratively and thematically, heat typically represents hot tempers, madness and paranoia, and a growing tension and unease that often leads to aggression. It also co-exists with the concept of coolness — of “never letting them see you sweat.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One character who <em>did</em> let us see him sweat did so in a movie that embodies the concept of calm under pressure — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxKUupk0kbY">Paul Newman as <em>Cool Hand Luke</em></a>. The 1967 classic saw Newman nonchalantly dripping all over the celluloid while delivering an iconic performance as an unflappable prisoner serving a brutal term under grueling, sweltering conditions. Newman typified idealized masculinity that only grows stronger when put to the test — a test that in <em>Cool Hand Luke</em> includes enduring the heat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The idea that oppressive heat is a phase that has to be borne until it&nbsp;passes — usually thanks to a climactic “break” in the weather like a rainstorm — exists in the narrative DNA of too many stories to count. Novels from <em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em> to <em>The Great Gatsby</em> to <em>Atonement</em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/04/atonement-call-me-by-your-name-summer-inspired-literature">use heat as a structural and thematic device</a> to intensify emotion and conflict, push things to a breaking point, and then generate catharsis.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This theme gets reified in cultural tropes as well — most prominently, the idea that increased temperatures lead to aggression and mental unwellness. The quintessential example of this — Spike Lee’s 1989 classic <em>Do the Right Thing</em>, which was originally titled <em>Heatwave</em> — has at its narrative center a heat wave that <a href="https://brightlightsfilm.com/cant-stand-the-heat-weather-and-climate-change-in-spike-lees-do-the-right-thing/">slowly ratchets racial tensions</a> throughout one Brooklyn neighborhood until they explode.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why we reported this story</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">As rural Southerners, my family has always had a very casual yet ambivalent relationship with air conditioning; I inherited the attitude that I could generally tough out a hot summer without it.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Once I learned about the wet bulb threshold — the temperature at which the human body can no longer self-regulate against heat — I shifted toward not only increasing my own awareness of heat-related safety, but also trying to communicate the significance of wet bulb temperatures to family and friends. The more I tried — there’s a temperature at which you can’t sweat! That you can’t cool yourself down! And we’re hitting it with increasing frequency! — the more I sounded alarmist. My family tended to shrug off my pleas to stay indoors when the weather grew intense; their resistance toward using the AC was partly about saving energy, but also about that “just tough it out” mentality.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s an attitude I’ve noticed more often — in my own life and in my forays through social media — as heat waves have become the new norm, and I wanted to understand why and how this belief became so culturally embedded.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">I also began to realize just how difficult it is to convey the urgency of hot weather as a health risk. Reporting this piece, I realized that the language we use to talk about climate change needs to evolve to address these concerns in a way that’s simple and direct. The sooner, the better.<em> —Aja Romano</em></p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The notion that heat waves lead to violence typically gets mentioned in discussions and depictions of racial tensions, protests, riots, and other forms of civil and urban unrest, but <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200817-the-sinister-ways-heatwaves-warp-the-mind">reams of academic research</a> also tie hot weather to increased car-honking, rioting, and domestic violence.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s important to stress, however, that correlation doesn’t equal causation. “It is not heat that triggers these incidences,” research scientist Adam Yeeles <a href="https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/2015/03/heat-hotheads-effect-rising-temperatures-urban-unrest/">blogged</a> in 2015. “There are economic, political, and cultural conflicts that bring people into the streets.” Yet it’s also true that <a href="https://time.com/6280073/how-heatwaves-impact-your-brain/">extreme heat can seriously impact mental health</a> and wellness, and all of this translates into the ongoing narrative that heat pushes people to physical, mental, and behavioral extremes — character tests to which they either succumb or overcome and push past.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This idea has unfortunately become a running theme in Hollywood. Erich von Stroheim’s silent film masterpiece <em>Greed </em>climaxes in Death Valley and was actually <a href="https://mojaveproject.org/dispatches-item/the-technicolor-desert-cinema-and-the-mojave/">filmed</a> in grueling temperature conditions reaching 120 degrees Fahrenheit in the Mojave Desert for months as cast and crew battled heat exhaustion. A third of the location crew had to be discharged and one lead actor was hospitalized after filming wrapped. The film’s brutal production was a precursor to the <a href="https://www.vox.com/22940904/oscars-2022-real-people-acting-spencer-ricardos">method mentality</a> that often valorizes intense set conditions — think <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2021/07/klaus-kinski-has-a-tantrum-on-the-set-of-werner-herzogs-fitzcarraldo.html"><em>Fitzcarraldo</em></a> or <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> and the recent <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/351737/furiosa-movie-review-backstory-sexism-filming-conditions"><em>Furiosa</em></a>, which all saw actors undergoing physically and psychologically intense productions with the aim of enhancing the emotional intensity and verisimilitude of their performances.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These types of performances tend to become mythologized in pop culture, and they contribute to the illusion that real people, if we’re tough enough, can habitually survive prolonged exposure to the elements.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The reality, however, is that such intense prolonged exertion can be dangerous; witness the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/godfrey-gao-dead-actor-died-collapsing-reality-tv-shoot-china-1258244/">2019 death</a> of rising film star Godfrey Gao while participating in a grueling running-themed reality show. The risks associated with such activities are only growing. But public attitudes aren’t changing. Instead, they’re arguably growing more detached from the problem of climate change as the mercury climbs.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">We’ve insulated ourselves from the reality of climate change</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the problems with communicating heat risks is that they’re often obscure.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The average person lacks the context that helps us realize how dangerous things are actually getting. A graph can show us things like incremental temperature increases, for example. But it doesn’t convey urgency.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The problem is that nobody really suffers from global warming, right? Global warming is an abstraction.” That’s historian On Barak, author of the forthcoming book <a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520403925/heat-a-history"><em>Heat, a History: Lessons from the Middle East for a Warming Planet</em></a><em> </em>(publishing in August 2024).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“When you put these numbers on a graph and you connect them with a line, you see that the line tilts upwards,” Barak told Vox in an interview. “So this is global warming, but this doesn&#8217;t tell us almost anything about heat and about how people experience heat. Heat is differential. Women suffer differently from men, the old differently from the young, the rich differently from the poor. So everything that’s political about our encounter with heat gets thrown out of the picture when we reduce our language to ‘global warming.’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the paradoxes of modern life is that as we insulate ourselves from the heat and retreat indoors, we also numb ourselves to the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-2159849200.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602" alt="Farm workers take a break and drink water in the shade of a tent as they weed a bell pepper field in the sun as southern California is facing a heatwave, in Camarillo, on July 3 2024." title="Farm workers take a break and drink water in the shade of a tent as they weed a bell pepper field in the sun as southern California is facing a heatwave, in Camarillo, on July 3 2024." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Barak points out that tools like air conditioning and refrigeration are powerful for combating the heat, but they also <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/23067049/heat-wave-air-conditioning-cooling-india-climate-change">exacerbate the climate crisis</a> by heating the outdoors, combusting fossil fuels, and leaking heat-trapping gasses. Additionally, they’ve ushered in a cultural unlearning of other older methods for dealing with hot temperatures, such as architecture that promotes passive cooling, or reclaiming and encouraging sweat as a natural method of temperature regulation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Not only that, but our bodies may actually be growing less able to adapt; he notes that when people are raised in air conditioned environments, their ability to sweat diminishes. “We have created a world, a physical environment and a body that is the product of this unlearning and this maladaptation.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We’re adapting, but we’re oblivious to the price that we and future generations are and will be paying for these adaptations.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He further stresses that there’s a physical limit to how much humans can adapt, pointing out the <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/354977/heat-wave-wet-bulb-temperature-climate">wet bulb temperature</a> as a significant metric, since it alerts us to the upper limits of the human body’s ability to regulate itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The wet-bulb globe temperature, or WBGT, measures multiple elements associated with heat at once. The <a href="https://nicholasinstitute.duke.edu/project/heat-policy-innovation-hub/what-is-wet-bulb-globe-temperature-wbgt">US military developed this measurement in the 1950s</a> after learning the hard way that no amount of fortitude can keep soldiers standing when weather conditions drive bodies beyond their physiological limits. It accounts for air currents, exposure to direct sunlight, as well as its namesake, “wet bulb,” which involves placing a wet cloth over a thermometer to get a reading of when sweating can no longer cool us down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The frustrating thing about the wet-bulb temperature is that its thoroughness makes it complicated to describe.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This means it’s hard to convey to the public the importance of having a measurement like this, one that can help us prepare for increasingly extreme outdoor conditions. That, in turn, makes it more difficult to standardize and normalize checking the wet-bulb temperature as often as we check “the weather.” (The <a href="https://www.weather.gov/tsa/wbgt">National Weather Service has a prototype tool</a> that can estimate WBGT near you.) Despite increasing media attention given to the phenomenon, with little government promotion of the measurement and little public education on heat risks, most people either aren’t paying attention or don’t understand what the wet-bulb’s significance is when they do.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, the wet-bulb temperature works to help people understand when they should avoid exposing themselves to the sun. But that idea presupposes that we have a choice.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What happens when you don’t have a choice?&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Too many people are compelled to endure dangerous heat</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite the increasing danger heat exposure poses, many people face immense pressure to endure dangerous temperatures, if they have a choice at all.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the US, about one-third of workers have jobs that <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2023/32-9-percent-of-employees-had-regular-outdoor-exposure-in-2022.htm">require them to be outside</a>, like farm laborers, construction crews, and delivery drivers, putting them at risk of heat-related illnesses during heat waves. Indoor workers like those in kitchens, warehouses, and assembly lines can also experience extremely hot temperatures. Workplace cultures can push employees to ignore their own discomfort to continue working past their limits. And when paychecks are on the line, workers can and do die on the job. In sectors like construction, heat illnesses and deaths have become all too routine.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/heat-workplace-deaths_figure1_2024.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,8.473173132859,100,83.053653734282" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/closer-look-heat-related-workplace-deaths&quot;&gt;Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt;" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Last month, a <a href="https://turnto10.com/news/local/construction-worker-death-medical-distress-police-fire-department-providence-rhode-island-heat-wave-june-20-2024">construction worker in Rhode Island</a> collapsed on scaffolding on a hot day. His coworkers tried dousing him in cold water but he died in a hospital less than an hour later. High temperatures can also cause fatigue, impair judgment, and increase reaction times, leading to more injuries. A <a href="https://docs.iza.org/dp14560.pdf">2021 study</a> found that in California, high temperatures cause about 20,000 additional workplace injuries per year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Regulators are trying to make some changes and stepping up enforcement of worker protections. The <a href="https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20240626">US Department of Labor</a> last month fined a labor contractor more than $30,000 for failing to protect a Florida farm worker who died from heat stroke while harvesting oranges during a winter heat wave.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But only five states have workplace heat safety standards and the US federal government is still working on <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/356217/osha-federal-workplace-heat-standard-protections">finalizing a national rule</a> that may not take effect until 2026. Even the military has <a href="https://www.ready.marines.mil/Stay-Informed/Natural-Hazards/Extreme-Heat/Flag-Conditions/">tougher and better-defined heat safety regulations</a> than most workplaces.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While workers in theory have some choice in the jobs they take and momentum is building toward keeping them cool, the US also forces people to suffer dangerous levels of heat. At the end of 2022, the US incarcerated <a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/prisoners-2022-statistical-tables">more than 1.2 million people</a>, more than any other country in the world. America’s approach to penitentiaries hasn’t changed much since <em>Cool Hand Luke</em>: Many prisons today are cheaply designed, poorly maintained, and lack adequate ventilation. At least <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2023/08/14/stifling-prison-heat-used-to-be-just-a-southern-problem-not-anymore/">44 states have prisons without air conditioning</a>, including <a href="https://www.cbs19.tv/article/weather/as-temperature-continue-to-rise-14-of-texas-prison-facilities-are-feeling-the-heat-with-no-air-conditioning/501-e0cf7ae7-bbd4-4e02-a145-f734301741d4">states like Texas</a> that face some of the hottest temperatures in the country. According to the <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/08/21/texas-prison-heat-deaths/">Texas Tribune</a>, at least 41 people died in Texas prisons last year during heat waves. High temperatures likely played a role in the <a href="https://news.wttw.com/2024/06/25/after-earning-degree-northwestern-while-incarcerated-michael-broadway-dies-custody-51">death of a prisoner in Illinois</a> last month as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The heat doesn’t just afflict the prisoners; it also makes prisons a more dangerous work environment for corrections officers and other staffers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Part of the challenge in improving conditions inside prisons and jails is the view that these facilities are supposed to be uncomfortable, and that people who are incarcerated somehow deserve to be hot.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“‘Prisons are supposed to suck’ — that’s a fundamental fallacy,” said <a href="https://dream.org/team-members/john-fabricius/">John Fabricius</a>, a legislative campaigner at Dream.org, a group advocating for prisoner rights and against mass incarceration. “Prisons are supposed to be about making the public safe. And if the prisons are actively executing policies that are decreasing public safety, then we have a problem.” In a <a href="https://dream.org/news-articles/extreme-heat-in-americas-prisons/">blog post</a>, Fabricius argued that severe heat exposure in prisons is forcing a reckoning between the stated goals of the criminal justice system and its actual implementation. Overheating prisons run contrary to the idea of these institutions as places for rehabilitation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://dream.org/team-members/janos-marton/">Janos Marton</a>, chief advocacy officer at Dream.org working on criminal justice, explained that there is also a constitutional requirement to protect incarcerated people under the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment and when someone is in custody, the government must preserve their welfare and avoid suffering. Unbearably hot jail cells don’t just harm the people inside them but undermine society as a whole. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Ninety-five percent of people who are sentenced to prisons are meant to come home,” Marton said. “So if you&#8217;re sentenced to three years on some sort of low-level felony and then you die in prison from this overheating crisis, then that’s the state’s complete failure to live up to their obligation.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some also argue people in jails and prisons don’t need cooling because plenty of people outside of prison sweat it out without the benefit of fans or air conditioning. But in a <a href="https://casetext.com/case/cole-v-collier-2">2017 ruling</a> requiring a Texas prison to lower temperatures in a notoriously hot prison unit, US District Judge Keith Ellison said he found this logic unpersuasive.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ellison wrote that “there will be many among the public who will recount stories of having survived abodes in hot climates without the benefit of modern technology” but noted that “treatment of prisoners must necessarily evolve as society evolves.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Poverty also leaves people little choice in dealing with hot weather. About <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/extreme-heat-can-be-deadly-for-people-who-are-homeless">half of the people who die</a> during heat waves in a given year don’t have permanent housing. More than 650,000 people experience homelessness on a given night, with about <a href="https://nlihc.org/resource/hud-releases-2023-annual-homeless-assessment-report">40 percent</a> of them forced to stay in places not intended for habitation like cars or parks. With the recent Supreme Court ruling in the <a href="https://www.vox.com/homelessness/357861/homelessness-encampment-grants-pass-supreme-court-housing"><em>Grants Pass v. Johnson</em></a> case, houseless people have even fewer rights to public spaces while cities can enact more punitive measures against them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And with <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/03/economy/electric-bill-increase-air-conditioning-summer/index.html">electricity rates rising</a>, people on a tight budget may choose to go without air conditioning during some of the hottest months. Most states don’t have any rules that <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/23274788/heat-wave-ac-energy-bill-utilities">prevent a utility from cutting off power</a> during a heat wave, so an unpaid bill could leave someone without the means to cool down when they need it most. Here again, the lack of resources we provide to this population to deal with the heat suggests a cultural victim-blaming — if they get too hot, it’s their own problem and if they can’t afford the “luxury” of cooling, too bad.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The way we talk about climate change needs to become more immediate</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When we talk about advancing heat, small decisions can have ripple effects. Take a tiny but common tendency on the part of media outlets: To illustrate <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/23800261/tips-extreme-heat-heatwave">stories about heat waves</a> and other climate crisis effects with photos of people relaxing at a beach or playing under a fountain — photos associated with leisure and relaxation <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/07/maybe-dont-illustrate-your-stories-about-lethally-hot-weather-with-fun-beach-pics/">rather than risk and caution</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Not everybody has access to a pool, to an air conditioner, or even to a water hose,” Barak points out. “If your presentation of the heat wave is people at the pool or people who can take a break from work and go to the beach &#8230; you need to have the leisure, you need to have the career, the livelihood that allows you to cool off.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Barak argues that far from being trivial, changing the way we think and talk about climate crisis “begins with these representations, visual and also lexical.” He argues that because our awareness of the climate crisis has been driven primarily by scientists, we’ve derived language from scientists, who tend to speak in terms of “humanity” as a species. Thus, we talk about climate change as a problem created by humanity.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-1541220953.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.654918655606,100,78.690162688789" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Protesters advocating for air conditioning in prisons gather outside the Texas State Capitol building in Austin, Texas, on July 18, 2023. | Sergio Flores/AFP via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Sergio Flores/AFP via Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The problem? The solution to the climate crisis is inherently political, but “humanity is not a political category,” Barak said. “Capitalists are more responsible than their employees, than the proletariat is for the climate crisis. The global north is more responsible than the global south. Men are more responsible than women. Different religions are more responsible than others.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If we do not allocate responsibility and blame and demand climate justice, then we remain in a nonpolitical language,” he said. He suggests, for example, naming heat waves the way we name hurricanes, in order to communicate their urgency — but proposes naming them after specific people whose business and political decisions have contributed directly to worsening the climate crisis. “Naming names,” he says, can be a huge step forward in creating political change.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Simultaneously, however, he stresses the need to internalize responsibility for change. He argues that we tend to think of the climate crisis “as something that comes from outside, as something that comes from out of space. And this is exactly the opposite of how we should really think of the problem — in which we are the meteorite, we are the aliens, we are the problem.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On a hot summer day in New York City, I have a singular need: shade.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is one reason I appreciate trees, especially the big leafy ones. But there are in fact many others: Trees suck up carbon dioxide and other pollutants, helping clean the air and offset planet-warming emissions. They not only block the sun, creating shade, but also pump water vapor out through their leaves, which cools the air. Their roots, meanwhile, help rainwater seep into the soil that might otherwise flood the streets.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Plus, trees literally <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/apa-blogs/evidence-of-the-benefits-of-trees-in-urban-areas">make us less anxious</a>. People who live in urban neighborhoods with more trees <a href="https://www.florencewilliams.com/the-nature-fix">tend to be less stressed</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">My point: Trees are good.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is not exactly a revelation, but it’s a point worth underscoring, as many neighborhoods — in New York, Phoenix, and elsewhere — don’t have enough of them. And these treeless city stretches are often disproportionately nonwhite and home to residents with less money. Planting more trees in these neighborhoods is about far more than aesthetics. It can literally help keep people alive.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How, though, does a place like NYC go about planting trees and filling these life-threatening gaps in tree cover? The trash-laden, concrete-covered blocks aren’t exactly ideal for growing. Then there’s climate change, which is raising temperatures and pushing more saltwater onto land, thus altering growing conditions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To understand how big cities think about the role of trees and where to put them, I spoke with Jessica Einhorn, the chief of forestry programs at the New York City Department of Parks &amp; Recreation. Einhorn, a trained forester, oversees tree preservation and planting in the city. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-2156991200.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,18.28433346758,100,63.431333064841" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A tree planted by NYC Parks. | Deb Cohn-Orbach/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Deb Cohn-Orbach/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images" />
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Shade is super important, but it’s not equitably distributed</h2>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Benji Jones</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trees provide an obvious benefit as the city warms —&nbsp;shade —&nbsp;but can you explain just how big that benefit is?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Jessica Einhorn</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On a hot summer day, surface temperatures in shaded areas may be anywhere between <a href="https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/heat-islands/using-trees-and-vegetation-reduce-heat-islands_.html#:~:text=Trees%20and%20Vegetation%20Resources&amp;text=Trees%20and%20vegetation%20lower%20surface,peak%20temperatures%20of%20unshaded%20materials.">20 to 45 degrees cooler</a> than unshaded areas. It’s wild.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Benji Jones</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How do you choose what species of tree to plant?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Jessica Einhorn</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We have a list of more than 130 different species. We’ve made an effort to diversify our planting palette. When you diversify the urban forest, you&#8217;re proactively planning for the spread of various diseases. If we had just five different trees across the city, a pest like emerald ash borer could come through and decimate a high percentage of them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We consider the land use of the site — whether it’s a commercial or residential strip, industrial land, or a park area —&nbsp;and whether there are overhead wires. We don’t want a tree to grow into wires and cause outages. In those cases, we might plant smaller species, such as a plum tree or a lilac tree. Shorter trees tend to be flowering species, but they often don’t have the same longevity as taller trees.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a heavily trafficked commercial strip of land, we might want to choose a particularly hardy species, such as honey locusts. They can take a lot of compacted soil and withstand a decent amount of drought.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The surrounding environment is another big thing we consider. We have changed our approach to planting significantly since Superstorm Sandy, when we saw significant saltwater inundation and a major decline in tree health. Lots of trees died throughout the city —&nbsp;namely London plane trees, which are not salt tolerant. We are definitely paying attention to tree species that are salt tolerant, such as hawthorns and hackberry, in <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Sandy-Inundation-Zone/uyj8-7rv5">saltwater inundation zones</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Benji Jones</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Is the amount of shade the tree provides a consideration?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Jessica Einhorn</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s our mission to maximize tree canopy, so we want to plant the biggest tree that’s appropriate. If we have a site along the street with a big open space to grow, we want to plant our larger canopy trees, such as species of oaks. Other trees, like linden trees, have very broad leaves and can provide really dense shade.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Benji Jones</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How do you determine where to plant them?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Jessica Einhorn</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Right now, we prioritize areas for tree planting based on the <a href="https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/data-features/hvi/">Heat Vulnerability Index</a> [HVI]. It’s pulled together by the city department of health and based on a number of factors including the surface temperature, green space, access to home air conditioning, percentage of residents who are low-income, and the percentage of residents who are non-Latinx Black. We’re focusing on these historically disadvantaged communities in order to increase tree canopy in the spaces where, historically, we haven’t had as many trees.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We’ve made a commitment to fully stock HVI 4 and HVI 5 — <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html?layers=468c71b07272431f8a46881fe10dc3b4&amp;layerId=2">regions with the highest heat risks</a> —&nbsp;by 2027. That means you have a forester walking down the block, looking for any available planting spaces, and marking them.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Benji Jones</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Only a small percent of the city’s trees are in areas populated largely by people of color. Will these planting efforts help close this gap?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Jessica Einhorn</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It will help, but we have a long way to go. Historically, affluent communities were designed with trees in mind whereas the disadvantaged communities were not. Even if we fully stock the areas that have historically been underserved, we won’t be able to match the canopy coverage in the historically served areas. The blocks cannot accommodate as many trees because there’s other infrastructure that creates conflict.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Bringing heat-loving trees north</h3>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Benji Jones</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Are all of the trees native species?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Jessica Einhorn</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">About half of the 130-plus trees are not from the US. The landscape and streetscape of New York City does not mimic anything native to this area. Many native trees are not hardy enough; they can’t withstand a lot of the typical environments in such a dense urban area.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can define native in different ways:&nbsp;native to the US or native to this specific region? We’re introducing trees from warmer climates as our climate trends in that direction, like crape myrtles or southern magnolias. Historically, those trees were not found in NYC, but we’re considering them for planting because of the change in climate and impacts of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/22557563/how-to-redesign-cities-for-heat-waves-climate-change">urban heat island effect</a>. Some might consider them native, whereas others wouldn’t.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Benji Jones</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How much do you consider allergies? Do you think about planting trees that are less pollen-y?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Jessica Einhorn</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No. Shade and hardiness take priority over pollen dispersal.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Benji Jones</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Why do cities have so many ginkgo trees?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Jessica Einhorn</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s another tree to add to the “very hardy” list. They can really withstand a lot. And they’re beautiful; their leaves shimmer in the wind.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Benji Jones</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How are you preparing for an even warmer future?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Jessica Einhorn</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We are introducing tree species from more southern climates. We’re not going full tropical here, but we are looking south. We can now very successfully plant crape myrtle here, whereas 15-20 years ago we wouldn’t have considered it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then we also have to phase out other tree species that are no longer appropriate here. One of my favorite tree species, the sugar maple, is really just not one that we plant anymore because the city is not an appropriate climate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Female pop stars have been throwing new personas at the wall: Eight years after her <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2016/11/4/13521928/beyonce-cma-awards-controversy-deleted-performance">iconic CMAs performance</a>, Beyoncé made a hard, <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24122351/beyonce-cowboy-carter-album-visuals-decoded-easter-eggs-references">star-spangled</a> turn to <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24115959/beyonce-cowboy-carter-country-music-explained">country</a>. Ariana Grande traded in her usual R&amp;B bangers for an Imogen Heap-inspired album. Dua Lipa left the dance floor for some chill, vacation bops. And Camila Cabello is determined to be the next princess of hyperpop, taking an <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/charli-xcx-responds-to-camila-cabellos-charli-esque-new-era.html">uncomfortable amount of inspiration</a> from Charli XCX.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Recently, the pop landscape has been unusually crowded. In addition to the aforementioned artists, Taylor Swift, Kacey Musgraves, Charli XCX, Billie Eilish, and Normani have all released new albums in the span of just four months. However, you wouldn’t necessarily know it looking at the most steady songs on the Billboard Hot 100 this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is not to ignore the accomplishments of Sabrina Carpenter, whose latest single “Please Please Please” sat at No. 1 last week. (More on that later.) However, it’s hard not to notice what kind of music seems to be making the biggest impression right now — rap and country — and who’s experiencing success in these genres: men.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The demand for these beloved genres isn’t surprising, especially after Billboard’s country takeover last year, and given that Kendrick Lamar has been embroiled in a <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24132396/drake-beef-explained-kendrick-lamar-the-heart-part-6-euphoria-meet-the-grahams-taylor">compelling feud with Drake</a>. Still, this male-dominated moment feels glaring as so many established female singers compete for attention in the pop space.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Are listeners exhausted by the current state of female pop, with all its rigorous demands and obsession with “eras”? Is the predictability of someone like country singer Morgan Wallen what it takes to chart?&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Rap and (male) country artists have seized the charts</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a post-streaming world, it’s never been harder to tell what music is actually popular versus what’s just being consumed in our own algorithmic bubbles. The disparity between what’s talked about in pop music-interested sectors of the internet (i.e., queer people and straight women) and what the “masses” are consuming feels especially pronounced looking at the Billboard Hot 100 chart this year. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">being gay is so interesting cuz i’m like “the entire world is listening to brat rn it’s crazy” meanwhile all top 100 spots on billboard are occupied by people i’ve never heard of with names like “Blickford Crawfish” and “Zuff”</p>&mdash; P.E.

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For instance, a list of Billboard’s top 10 songs for <a href="https://twitter.com/billboardcharts/status/1800215110398468219">the week of June 15</a> earned surprised reactions from users on X for how starkly male it was. Alongside songs by Morgan Wallen and Post Malone, Shaboozey, Teddy Swims, Kendrick Lamar, Hozier, and Zach Bryan, Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso” was the only female entry. Despite being <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/357907/spotify-sabrina-carpenter-espresso-chappell-roan-algorithm">truly unavoidable and seemingly overplayed</a>, it had only occupied No. 6 on the chart.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I’m definitely not hearing something like Post Malone and Morgan Wallen’s “I Had Some Help” on a daily basis,” says music blogger Molly Mary O’Brien, who also co-hosts the <em>And Introducing</em> podcast. “But I do feel like streaming and our perceived lack of musical monoculture mean a No. 1 does not hit the way it used to hit, where it comes at you from every angle.”&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“Streaming and our perceived lack of musical monoculture mean a No. 1 does not hit the way it used to hit”</p><cite>—Molly mary o’brien</cite></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the rare monocultural moments of the year, however, involved Kendrick Lamar, who elevated a years-long feud with Drake on the Future and Metro Boomin song “Like That” back in March. After weeks of sparring and interference from other rappers, Lamar was declared the winner by fans who supported his diss tracks. Even for folks who weren’t hip-hop heads, the scale of the beef made it hard not to tune in. It was equally hard to avoid <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024/2/1/24058108/megan-thee-stallion-nicki-minaj-fight-big-foot-hiss">Megan Thee Stallion’s “Hiss,”</a> which went to No. 1 and incited a feud with Nicki Minaj, as well as Tommy Richman’s viral hit “Million Dollar Baby,” which continues to rise in the top 10. And after <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/kanye-west-vultures-1-removed-streaming.html">plenty of controversy</a> surrounding Ye and Ty Dolla Sign’s joint album, the eponymous song “Vultures” debuted at No. 1 this year. Although, at this point in Ye’s career, it seems like more people are paying more attention to his antics than his musical output.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re not tuned into the world of country, however, the rise of Morgan Wallen or Post Malone’s pivot to the genre might catch you off guard. However, the popularity of Wallen, Malone, Zach Bryan, and Jelly Roll over the past two years have signaled country going, once again, in a mainstream direction.“We’re in a moment where country music is incredibly popular,” says <a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/music/faculty/profile.html?id=phughes">Phoebe Hughes</a>, a musicology lecturer at Binghamton University. “It’s, dare I say, cool for younger folks to like country music. Or at least, it seems that way in comparison to 10 years ago.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, this moment has raised more complicated questions about who’s allowed to represent the genre to a wide audience. Malone’s transformation from rapper to eagerly embraced country star <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/355306/post-malone-beyonce-taylor-swift-morgan-wallen">has generated criticism</a> about his ability to shuffle between racialized genres as a white man. Meanwhile, Wallen’s heightened popularity, following a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2023-12-07/morgan-wallen-apology-racist-slur-2021-theres-no-excuse">racism scandal</a>, has been uncomfortable to observe. The rise of Shaboozey, a rare prominent Black country artist, adds a level of excitement to this lineup. Still, a broader question looming over all of their successes, particularly in the year of <em>Cowboy Carter,</em> is, where are the women?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hughes says that country, like rap, has “always been male-dominated,” despite the indelible contributions of women. In regards to chart performance, a big factor is that women have historically (and presently) struggled to receive the same amount of radio play as men. It’s an issue that’s been discussed by female country singers, from <a href="https://www.recordingacademy.com/advocacy/news/why-carrie-underwoods-calling-out-country-radio">Carrie Underwood</a> to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/kacey-musgraves-kelsea-ballerini-call-sexism-country-radio/story?id=68354934">Kacey Musgraves</a>, ad nauseam. At this point, though, it doesn’t show signs of changing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“From the early 2000s onward, we can see a dramatic decrease in female artists present on country radio,” Hughes says. “The ratio of male-to-female airplay between 2010 and 2019 was <a href="https://songdata.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SongData-Watson-Inequality-Country-Airplay-2019-in-Review.pdf">8.7 to 1</a>. And that stat has only gotten worse around the last 5 years.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Male artists have a level of predictability, for better or worse&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In many ways, this current moment feels like the extension of another controversial period in the genre labeled <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2013/08/rise-of-bro-country-florida-georgia-line.html">“bro country.”</a> The name described a type of country pop in the early 2010s, represented by Nashville-bred artists like Luke Bryan, Florida Georgia Line, Jason Aldean, and Blake Shelton. These men sang — and continue to sing, in many cases — about partaking in stereotypically masculine hobbies like drinking beer and driving pickup trucks. Often, these songs objectified women. At the time, <a href="https://time.com/3502546/florida-georgia-line-bro-country/">critics</a> and even <a href="https://people.com/country/brad-paisley-on-nashville-country-music-legacy/">other</a> male <a href="https://tasteofcountry.com/kenny-chesney-billboard-bro-country/">musicians</a> slammed these artists and their songs for the <a href="https://ew.com/article/2013/10/18/bro-country-beer-trucks-lyrics/">banality of their lyrics</a> and sonic repetitiveness.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“To me, ‘I Had Some Help’ doesn&#8217;t sound super different from 2010s mainstream country music,” O’Brien said. “This type of music is very popular in America, partially <em>because</em> it doesn&#8217;t change much in sound and is a more consistent and conservative genre of music.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hughes notes that the pop and hip-hop influences in many “bro-country” songs, like the popular Nelly-assisted remix of the Florida Georgia Line song “Cruise” in 2013 made the sort of genre-fusing we’re currently hearing from Wallen and Jelly Roll explode.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-1771552155.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Singers Post Malone and Morgan Wallen performing at the 57th Annual CMA Awards on November 8, 2023." title="Singers Post Malone and Morgan Wallen performing at the 57th Annual CMA Awards on November 8, 2023." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Singers Post Malone and Morgan Wallen performing at the 2023 CMA Awards. | Frank Micelotta/Disney via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Frank Micelotta/Disney via Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Rap has a similar consistency, with beef being a classic form people are always ready and excited to engage with. In the case of Lamar and Drake, the explosion of a long-standing feud between two of the biggest rappers on the planet, who also make ideal enemies, was hard to resist. But it also offered Lamar, a fairly conservative rapper, a platform to step into new territory. With “Not Like Us,” he made the sort of danceable party music Drake is known for — and failed to do in this beef — and showed a more humorous, petty side of himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the broader music landscape seems to allow men to thrive in a way that doesn’t involve the sort of evolution and constant transforming consumers have learned to expect from women. In response to Billie Eilish’s hyper-feminine transformation of her sophomore album <em>Happier Than Ever</em>, journalist Cheyenne Roundtree <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/billie-eilish-lorde-and-the-push-for-women-pop-stars-to-constantly-reinvent-themselves">wrote</a>, “it seems that more frequently, female pop artists are not only being pushed to challenge themselves artistically, but to transform everything about themselves with each new release.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">O’Brien agrees, saying, “Men, as a whole, do not seem to need to put nearly as much effort into the packaging of their aesthetics to accompany their music.” Ed Sheeran is maybe the most notable (and criticized) example of an A-list act, whose visual presentation, in terms of both himself and his albums, has been completely irrelevant to his success.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2018, a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/beyonce-ed-sheerans-contrasting-outfits-prompt-gender-standards-debate-2018-12">viral photo</a> of the British singer dressed casually next to a glammed-up Beyoncé wearing a gown seemed to represent the effort female and male artists are expected to put into their looks. When Sheeran did attempt a visual transformation, parading as a glam-rock vampire in the “Bad Habits” video, he was <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/ed-sheerans-bizarre-history-of-musical-thievery">immediately accused</a> of copying The Weeknd, notably one of the few male pop singers who seems interested in “eras” and visual transformations in the tradition of modern pop divas.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, someone like Post Malone has proven that these grand, artistic statements are hardly ever demanded from men, even when they make drastic changes to their sound.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Post Malone’s musical approach has shifted quite a bit from when he first started, from hip-hop to more rock and country,” says O’Brien. “He gets to basically show-not-tell, letting the music speak for itself and not worrying so much about what ‘era’ he’s in.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Fans are yearning for a more fun, simpler time in pop&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One has to wonder if music fans are partly exhausted by the big artistic gestures we frequently demand from female pop musicians. Given the lack of excitement around the actual music recently, are these extracurricular requirements creating good songs?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Long before Swift had embarked on her enormous Eras tour last year, female artists have been tasked with not just reinventing themselves visually and sonically, but offering compelling personal narratives to go along with their albums. Madonna is <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/material-girl-campy-cowboy-madonnas-iconic-eras-2482550">often credited</a> with this phenomenon, as someone who constantly evolved her sound while telegraphing where she was in her personal life. However, Beyoncé and Swift, through their expansive rollouts and confessional albums, have expertly modeled this for their peers and a generation of online fans.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyoncé has also come to exemplify the merging of personal and political narratives, creating pop music that speaks to moments related to and outside of herself. In the case of <em>Cowboy Carter</em>, though, it does feel like her aims to educate listeners on the Black origins of country music got in the way of a fun, easy-listening summer album.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By contrast, an extremely non-intellectual ditty, Sabrina Carpenter&#8217;s “Espresso,” has emerged as the song of the summer. And Charli XCX’s album of pure club bangers, <em>Brat</em>, has seen a longer-lasting cultural footprint on the internet with the “Brat summer” memes and tracks like “Apple” and “360” becoming TikTok faves.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-2157936899.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.693677971165,100,78.61264405767" alt="Musical artist Chappell Roan performing on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Thursday, June 20, 2024. " title="Musical artist Chappell Roan performing on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Thursday, June 20, 2024.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Chappell Roan is another already beloved, up-and-coming pop singer, whose drag-queen aesthetic and big, infectious melodies feel reminiscent of the 2010s, the Katy Perry era of pop. Her ravenous fanbase has already earned her the title of <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/06/entertainment/meet-gen-zs-madonna-pops-new-superstar-chappell-roan-speaks-out-about-overtly-sexual-songs/">Gen Z’s Madonna</a>. Unironically, this year’s deluge of okay-ish pop albums has also made way for a highly anticipated <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/katy-perry-womans-world-song-reactions-criticism-2024-6">Perry comeback</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The 2010s were an extremely long decade of millennial pop dominance by women who are all daughters of Madonna in one way or another,” O’Brien says.“I think we’re all ready for some breaths of fresh air.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While Carpenter and Roan are different in sound and look, they’re filling an obvious void this year. With all the labor involved in creating a new “era,” you’d be forgiven for forgetting that, as a pop diva, you also have to deliver good songs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“What maybe gets forgotten in the quest for ‘moments’ is that you have to have good songs,” O’Brien says. “We’re human beings and we need melody and color and fun, we’re practically screaming out for it, and I think that’s what this new crop of pop stars has to offer most of all at this moment.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The American workforce is aging. According to data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median age of the American labor force was <a href="https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/median-age-labor-force.htm">nearly 42 years old</a> in 2022, up from 40 years old in 2002. Nineteen percent of adults ages 65 and older are <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/12/14/the-growth-of-the-older-workforce/">currently employed</a>, compared to 11 percent in 1987. Further, workers aged 75 and up are the fastest-growing labor demographic. Americans can begin <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/agereduction.html">receiving Social Security benefits</a> at age 62 and full benefits at 66, but workers are <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/394943/retiring-planning-retire-later.aspx">waiting longer to retire</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The country’s leaders are similarly <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/358863/old-politicians-gerontocracy-age-limits">delaying retirement</a>. Presidential candidates Joe Biden, 81, and Donald Trump, 78, are working well past what is considered retirement age. The <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/01/average-age-us-congress/74268869007/">average national legislator in the US is 61</a> and the <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States">average age on the Supreme Court is over 63</a>. Given the ages of these leaders, a majority of Americans now <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/10/04/most-americans-favor-maximum-age-limits-for-federal-elected-officials-supreme-court-justices/">favor maximum age limits</a> for elected officials and Supreme Court justices; the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/358877/biden-age-debate-media-coverage">Biden age story</a> has <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/359024/biden-age-leaks-lapses-polls">only accelerated</a> since his <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357876/biden-trump-debate-cnn-won-step-down-atlanta">disastrous debate performance</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are a multitude of reasons why someone may delay retirement. Maybe they have <a href="https://www.vox.com/videos/24107812/why-hard-for-americans-to-retire">inadequate savings</a>, they <a href="https://money.usnews.com/money/retirement/second-careers/articles/never-retire-why-people-are-still-working-in-their-70s-and-80s">find meaning and fulfillment in their jobs</a>, or their <a href="https://academic.oup.com/gerontologist/article/58/2/320/2632159">identities are entwined with their profession</a>. People may also choose to hang on to their work because they enjoy the power and prestige that comes with it, says <a href="https://warrington.ufl.edu/directory/profiles/5309/">Mo Wang</a>, a professor at the University of Florida who studies retirement and older worker employment.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Regardless of your role and influence, there are many factors to consider when weighing retirement. Wang shares what holds people back from passing the torch and how to make your retirement years as fulfilling as possible.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What holds people back from retiring?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A very important thing would be people’s work identity. Work is an important part of people’s life, and a lot of people define themselves with their work identity. To retire means they’re going to lose their work identity, and that is usually an important reason that people don’t want to retire. A lot of people work because they enjoy their status, they enjoy their influence, and to retire means they’re going to lose those things.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Why is it so hard to untangle our identities from work?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Our education told us that working is being useful. Working is very well valued in our life. People view working or being productive as a very good quality, a virtue for their life. We learn to use our work identity to communicate to people who we are.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Are there ways outside of work to feel that tie to identity and power?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We’ve seen for professional workers, after retirement, they can still engage in some similar work activities in terms of volunteering, or they may engage in some other activities similar to their pre-retired job. Those will be really good for them to substitute their worker identity. We also found that strong family support and family engagement would help substitute worker identity because sometimes, after people retire, they really enjoy being grandparents. They endorse their family identity more so that they can transition better as well.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We encourage workers to transition to a mentoring role, passing the knowledge and experience to the next generation. That often helps to make the retiree feel they are still engaged in their professional field and they’re still contributing to the organization. You allow them to keep a little bit of their worker identity so they don’t have to suddenly say goodbye to everything.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Are there certain types of jobs that make it difficult for people to retire?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s difficult to speak to different industries; what we found was actually pretty general. Basically across all different jobs people, if they have a strong worker identity, it is a little bit harder for them to detach themselves from such identity and move into retirement. It’s particularly difficult because in the United States, we don’t have mandatory retirement for most jobs. If people don’t want to retire, most of the time, they can stay in their jobs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Should there be mandatory retirement?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For very important jobs we do — for firefighters, air traffic controllers. A lot of the top executive jobs in Fortune 500 companies, they actually build in a mandatory retirement clause in their contracts as well. It really depends on the negotiation for [specific] positions whether a mandatory retirement clause will be written into the contract. Especially if cognitive function is very important for the job, I think having some mandatory time and age, or a well-thought-out evaluation process to ensure the ability to accomplish the job, is very important.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Are there ways we can adequately evaluate our own abilities? Basically, how can we know if we’re still doing a good job?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Scholars and researchers in Finland actually developed this <a href="https://www.tela.fi/en/pension-system/work-ability-and-its-significance/assessment-of-work-ability/">assessment for work ability</a> to assess whether the person is still qualified and still has the ability to carry out their work. It is a pretty comprehensive assessment. It involves a cognitive evaluation, a mental health-related evaluation. It’s from an occupational health perspective to make sure the person can accomplish the work without creating any danger to themselves, that the workplace will be healthy for them. Europeans have a little bit more experience than the United States on this. In the United States, this kind of assessment often is viewed as unnecessary. The United States oftentimes emphasizes people’s work experience over a 360-degree assessment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Do you see Americans’ relationship with work and the value of institutional knowledge as one of the reasons why we have this aging workforce?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Actually, the labor force shortage, that’s really the reason that we have to hold on to the aging workforce because we don’t have good labor supplies for teachers, for nurses. We’re short of those professional workers. We need people to work longer. The other side is we oftentimes rely on people’s experience. If people are willing to work and they have been doing a certain job in a successful way, we tend to feel comfortable letting them do the work without checking whether there’s any decline in work ability. I think it goes both ways. On the one hand, we need those people, the human capital. On the other hand, because we tend to believe people’s experience means a lot for them to accomplish the work, we don’t carry out unnecessary assessments to evaluate or to better position people in their job assignments.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What would an appropriate assessment look like?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I would say it probably should involve some cognitive assessments, making sure people are mentally equipped to conduct the mental operations for their job, like having a certain level of memory ability, a certain level of the attention [and] focus to do their job. Then the physical side: make sure people can handle day-to-day functioning of their job. For example, can they go to their work on time and not have a hard time doing the basic physical activities at work? Also, evaluating whether they are actually motivated to do their job. A lot of people are not very engaged at their job. They’re not getting a lot of satisfaction from their job. If they don’t enjoy doing their job, then maybe retirement is the right thing to do.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Speaking of that motivation, I can imagine it being difficult to retire if you still feel motivated, or you have something to contribute, or you&#8217;re good at it. Is that worth sticking around for?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is assuming they are the only decision-maker. Most of the time, we have to think about it from the employer standpoint as well, whether the employer is having any opportunity cost not replacing the worker, even if the worker is willing to stay on. Just because a worker is really motivated to work doesn’t mean we should always just keep the person on the same job. Maybe we can shift the job or reallocate them according to their work ability so that their human capital can be better utilized.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>For those who do have a difficult time retiring, what ultimately pushes them to pass the torch?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Oftentimes it’s the physical health component. Usually it’s because, physically, they couldn’t carry on anymore. Another main reason will be family demands: if they have to take care of their sick spouse, or their parents need to be taken care of. A lot of people will retire to take on those family care responsibilities. Those are usually viewed as involuntary retirements. They are not really choosing to retire, but the situation dictates that they should retire. Most people retire in a voluntary way. People don’t struggle that much to retire most of the time. They know when they want to retire, and then they will plan about it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>How can someone know when it’s time?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the person’s individual situation cannot allow them to continue the work and also if the organization has good succession planning and they already have a successor in place. If they don’t have a viable successor, then what they are hoping for is the person can stay on the job for as long as they can.</p>

<p>Since our founding in 2014, you’ve supported Vox in our mission: to help everyone understand our complicated world so that we can all help shape a better one. We think of you — our audience — as being at the heart of everything we do. With every story, podcast, and video we create, we ask ourselves: What does our audience need to know about this topic? What matters to them? What questions do they have? Our journalists strive to bring you clarity, context, and nuance on all the topics that affect your world and your daily life. Together, we’ve learned about everything from artificial intelligence, the Supreme Court, and meatless meat to personal finance, climate solutions, parenting, and more. This vital journalism wouldn’t have been possible without the continued support of our readers, listeners, and video audience.</p>

<p>That’s why we launched the <strong><a href="http://vox.com/pages/support-now?itm_campaign=Membership-Explainer&amp;itm_medium=site&amp;itm_source=in-article">Vox Membership program</a></strong>. It’s a celebration of our decade-long commitment to serve our audience and build our community. This program will allow us to offer you deeper access to Vox than ever before.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So what does it mean to be a Vox Member? What kind of cool perks do you get? And why is Vox doing this?&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why is Vox launching a membership program?</strong></h2>

<p>Quality journalism is expensive to produce. We rely partly on direct support from our audience to fund our work. For the past four years, people have been contributing to Vox because they believe in our mission of creating smart, approachable journalism.</p>

<p>With our new membership program, we plan to build on that foundation by creating a closer two-way relationship between our audience and Vox.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>So what exactly is the Vox Membership program? What do I get for joining?</strong></h2>

<p>Vox Membership is a new community with some exciting perks. Most importantly, your membership will help Vox continue to produce the journalism you rely on to understand the world around you. But we’ll also be rolling out special benefits to members to thank them for their support. Members will receive: </p>

<ul>
<li>Access to <strong>exclusive must-read stories</strong> on our website</li>



<li><strong>Monthly columns</strong> from writers Eric Levitz, Christian Paz, Rebecca Jennings, and Alex Abad-Santos</li>



<li>Bi-weekly editions of <strong>The Vox Explainer<em> </em>members-only<em> </em>newsletter</strong>, which goes behind the scenes on how we make our journalism</li>



<li>Access to <strong>The Highlight</strong>, our members-only digital magazine, which includes a selection of in-depth features, conversation-driving essays, definitive explainers, and more</li>



<li><em><strong>The Highlight Podcast, </strong></em>a monthly bonus podcast included with the digital magazine, featuring a rotating cast of Vox podcast hosts and journalists talking with an expert at the forefront of their field working on an idea or pursuit that feels important, novel, and exciting</li>



<li>Invitations to exclusive quarterly <strong>Q&amp;As with our journalists</strong> and subject-matter experts on topics like artificial intelligence, family policy, and climate solutions</li>



<li><strong>Interactive video interviews</strong> with voices from our video team </li>



<li><strong>More members-only newsletters</strong>, including the monthly Ask a Book Critic, a book recommendations roundup by Vox’s Constance Grady</li>
</ul>

<p>And that’s just the start. We’ve got more planned and we want to hear from you about how we can build this community in the months ahead. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How do I become a Vox Member?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>If you have already committed to a recurring monthly or annual contribution to Vox, you don’t need to do anything else. You can now consider yourself a Vox Member and you can expect to hear from us on your new benefits! Thank you for your continuing support.</p>

<p>If you’re not already a recurring contributor, become a member by clicking <a href="http://vox.com/pages/support-now?itm_campaign=Membership-Explainer&amp;itm_medium=site&amp;itm_source=in-article">right here</a>. Vox Members make recurring contributions of at least $5 per month or $50 per year. Reliable support from our audience allows us to invest in ambitious projects and continue to cover the most important issues and ideas shaping society.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Can I still make a one-time contribution?</strong></h2>

<p>Vox’s mission is to make reliable news coverage accessible to everyone, and that isn’t changing. We created Vox Membership to encourage recurring support and express our gratitude to those who are able to make that commitment. However, one-time contributions to our newsroom are as important as ever and we’re working on ways to keep one-time contributors informed on what’s new at Vox.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How do I access my member benefits?</strong></h2>

<p>Once you’ve signed up, you’ll create an account so that you’re able to read all of our member-exclusive articles. We’ll also make sure you’re getting the latest behind-the-scenes information from the Vox newsroom and access to all the perks that members receive. And if you ever experience issues or have a question for us, email us at <a href="mailto:membership@vox.com">membership@vox.com</a>. We’ll get back to you as soon as we can.</p>

<p>Thank you for supporting us for the last 10 years. We hope you’ll join us for the next decade and <a href="http://vox.com/pages/support-now?itm_campaign=Membership-Explainer&amp;itm_medium=site&amp;itm_source=in-article"><strong>join</strong> <strong>the Vox Membership program today</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Shortly after Vice President Kamala Harris announced Tim Walz as her running mate last month, a photograph of the Minnesota governor with an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1296987340474818&amp;id=1093525130821041&amp;set=a.1114138672093020">adorable piglet</a> nestled in his arms at the 2019 Minnesota State Fair went viral, to the delight of Democratic <a href="https://x.com/Komaniecki_R/status/1820831456421429732">voters</a>, <a href="https://x.com/AaronRegunberg/status/1820212815820677468">activists</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/opinion/walz-harris-goofball.html">pundits</a> alike.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Earlier this month, Walz made a campaign stop at a dairy farm where he bottle-fed a baby cow, <a href="https://x.com/Tim_Walz/status/1831686167130968324">tweeting</a>, “Made a new friend.”&nbsp;</p>

But Walz fits right in, seamlessly blending a <a href="https://x.com/hannah_flom/status/1820656515755216922">genuine affection</a> for farmed animals with a hearty enthusiasm for eating them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At this year’s Minnesota State Fair, he <a href="https://x.com/Tim_Walz/status/1830316164460716163">declared</a> pork on a stick to be the “breakfast of champions.” In another viral <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@briantylercohen/video/7400108092161117483?lang=en">video</a> from last year’s fair, Walz’s daughter tells him she won’t eat turkey because she’s vegetarian. Walz replies that in Minnesota — the nation’s top turkey-producing state — turkey isn’t meat. “Turkey’s special,” he quips.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These images have helped shore up Walz’s wholesome vibes and “<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/tim-walz-minnesota-state-fair-midwestern-dad">Big Dad Energy</a>,” exuding the “Minnesota nice” charm that Democrats hope can help them lock down votes in crucial Midwest and Rust Belt states.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I, too, have been swept up by the Harris-Walz fervor, so I feel like a killjoy poking a hole in Walz’s innocent sheen. But there’s a darker side to the story: Walz has a <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2009/10/07/porkindustry">long history</a> of providing <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2014/03/12/rep-tim-walzs-winning-hotdish-recipe-2/">free advertising</a><strong> </strong>and public funding to the <a href="https://mn.gov/governor/newsroom/press-releases/?id=1055-600942">meat</a> and <a href="https://mn.gov/governor/newsroom/press-releases/?id=1055-583830">dairy</a> sectors, industries that trash Minnesota’s treasured waterways, torture animals, and endanger public health and vulnerable workers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To be fair to Walz, he’s doing what every other politician, Republican or Democrat, does to survive in farm country. Minnesota is a top producer of <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/newsroom/trending-topics/turkey-sector-background-statistics/">turkey</a>, <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=108733">pork</a>, and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/194968/top-10-us-states-by-milk-production/">dairy</a>, as well as <a href="https://ipad.fas.usda.gov/cropexplorer/cropview/commodityView.aspx?cropid=0440000">corn</a> and <a href="https://ipad.fas.usda.gov/cropexplorer/cropview/commodityView.aspx?cropid=2222000">soybeans</a>, the main crops fed to livestock. Even though just around<strong> </strong>1 percent of Minnesota households make a living from farming, agribusiness has accrued enormous influence over federal and state agricultural policy by <a href="https://investigatemidwest.org/2024/07/24/graphic-political-party-gap-in-agribusiness-donations-continues-to-widen/">showering candidates</a> — including farm-state Democrats like <a href="https://www.followthemoney.org/show-me?c-t-eid=9202001#%5B%7B1%7Cgro=d-et,d-ccb">Walz</a> — with campaign contributions. It then uses them to sell a <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/31/23852325/farming-myths-agricultural-exceptionalism-pollution-labor-animal-welfare-laws">narrative</a> that Big Ag is beyond criticism because it is “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/GovTimWalz/posts/im-not-kidding-when-i-say-our-farmers-feed-the-world-were-a-top-five-state-for-a/1070172471129548/">feeding the world</a>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Democrats watch their share of the vote in farm country slip away, characters like Walz — a balance to Harris’s image as a San Francisco liberal — bring an obvious appeal to the party. But in what may ultimately be a <a href="https://theconversation.com/rural-voters-dont-necessarily-love-walz-despite-the-camo-hat-and-small-town-upbringing-236973">quixotic quest</a> to appeal to rural voters in Middle America, Democratic leaders are compromising their <a href="https://democrats.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FINAL-MASTER-PLATFORM.pdf">commitments elsewhere</a> to environmental protection, labor rights, and public health when they go heavy on promoting the meat industry and light on regulating its harms.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That the Democratic base appears to be celebrating Walz’s farm-friendly image with little scrutiny shows how far factory farming’s opponents have to go in educating the American public about the cruelties of our food system. Much like the <a href="https://www.vox.com/22838160/animal-welfare-labels-meat-dairy-eggs-humane-humanewashing">misleading</a> cartoons of happy, “humanely raised” pigs and cows on meat packaging — which often mean little on the farm itself — Walz’s photo-ops with baby farmed animals reinforce the false romanticized image that Big Ag has so successfully seared into the public’s consciousness.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The reality, however, is anything but wholesome.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Dissecting Walz’s viral farm moments — and his voting record&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Without context, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1296987340474818&amp;id=1093525130821041&amp;set=a.1114138672093020">photo</a> of Walz holding a piglet at the Minnesota State Fair appears innocent, even endearing. But the pork industry, and that piglet’s life? Not so much.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The photo was taken at a pavilion sponsored by Christensen Farms, the <a href="https://www.agriculture.com/pork-powerhouses-2023-sow-numbers-pig-profits-down-while-productivity-up-8641051">ninth largest</a> US pork company, and run by the Minnesota Pork Board. Practically all pigs raised for food in the US come from factory farms — including Christensen’s, as seen in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9UDHv0Juv4">disturbing 2015 investigation</a> by an animal rights group — which use a consistent set of practices. Female breeding pigs — those that give birth to piglets who are then raised for slaughter — are confined in <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/353393/farm-bill-republicans-prop-12-gestation-crates-pork">crates so small</a> they can hardly move for their entire lives, suffering through pregnancy after pregnancy to churn out piglets until their productivity wanes and they’re sent to slaughter. The Minnesota Pork Producers Association, a sister organization to the Minnesota Pork Board, <a href="https://awionline.org/press-releases/animal-protection-groups-call-usda-require-cameras-inside-co2-stunning-areas-pig#:~:text=An%20estimated%2090%25%20of%20the,and%20convulsing%20before%20collapsing%20in">lobbies</a> in favor of keeping pregnant pigs in tiny cages and against basic <a href="https://landstewardshipproject.org/lsp-media-statement-on-amicus-filing-by-ag-groups-in-daley-farm-court-case/">environmental</a> measures.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also common in the US pork industry to feed these breeding pigs <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23817808/pig-farm-investigation-feedback-immunity-feces-intestines">ground-up piglet intestines</a> to build immunity against disease.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Piglets have their <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23817808/pig-farm-investigation-feedback-immunity-feces-intestines">teeth clipped</a> and tails chopped off, and the males’ testicles are cut out, all without pain relief. They spend their short lives in dark, unsanitary warehouses before being shipped on a grueling journey to the slaughterhouse and <a href="https://awionline.org/press-releases/animal-protection-groups-call-usda-require-cameras-inside-co2-stunning-areas-pig#:~:text=An%20estimated%2090%25%20of%20the,and%20convulsing%20before%20collapsing%20in">stunned unconscious</a> in a carbon dioxide gas chamber, a practice that can be <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/dex-pig-slaughterhouse-gas-chambers-videos/">excruciatingly painful</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Minnesota’s mammoth turkey industry — <a href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/us-factory-farming-estimates">virtually all</a> of the birds are raised on factory farms — is similarly abusive. Last year, an animal rights group <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/11/22/23970874/thanksgiving-turkey-farming-jennie-o-hormel-white-house-pardon">found</a> stomach-churning conditions at the state’s top turkey producer, Jennie-O: birds too weak and sick to even walk, along with live birds pecking at dead and rotting ones and birds with visible wounds — signs of cannibalism, a <a href="https://www.merckvetmanual.com/poultry/miscellaneous-conditions-of-poultry/cannibalism-in-poultry">common problem</a> in poultry farming (at the time, Jennie-O told Vox that it “takes the welfare of the animals under our care seriously and has robust animal care standards throughout our supply chain”).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jennie-O’s parent company, Hormel Foods, is headquartered in the congressional district Walz held before he ran for governor; Walz has <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2014/03/12/rep-tim-walzs-winning-hotdish-recipe-2/">promoted</a> the <a href="https://mn.gov/governor/newsroom/press-releases/?id=1055-600942">company</a>’s products and <a href="https://mn.gov/governor/covid-19/news/?id=1055-497713">appointed</a> its former CEO to a state economic council.</p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And remember Walz’s <a href="https://x.com/Tim_Walz/status/1831686167130968324">photo op</a> with the dairy calf earlier this month? It masked the dismal reality behind dairy farming, where cows have been selectively bred to pump out more and more milk, leading to <a href="https://academic.oup.com/af/article/2/3/16/4638647">more frequent leg and metabolic issues</a>, as well as higher rates of painful udder inflammation. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The campaign stop took place at a relatively small dairy farm, the kind that makes up an <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census">increasingly tiny</a> share of the milk Americans buy at the grocery store. Most dairy cows today will <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7238891/">never set foot on open pasture</a>, and farms typically separate babies from mothers shortly after birth, housing them alone and feeding them through a bottle so that farmers can take their mothers’ milk.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Minnesota — the Land of 10,000 Lakes — livestock and the synthetic fertilizer used to <a href="https://www.mncorn.org/corn-facts/">grow the corn</a> they eat <a href="https://investigatemidwest.org/2023/11/13/us-regulators-order-minnesota-to-clean-up-nitrate-contaminated-water/">account for most</a> of the state’s water nitrate pollution; <a href="https://fmr.org/news/2017/11/20/state-confirms-40-percent-mn-lakes-and-rivers-polluted">4 in 10 bodies of water</a> are so polluted that they fail to meet basic health standards. Last year, the US Environmental Protection Agency <a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-11/ao-rmod-reponse-letter_20230510-508.pdf">directed</a> Minnesota state agencies to immediately address the high nitrate levels in drinking water, which can cause a <a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/communities/environment/water/contaminants/nitrate.html#HealthEffects">range</a> of serious health issues, that thousands of Minnesotans had been exposed to. The EPA also encouraged the state to better monitor pollution from livestock manure.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Minnesota state government is limited in its ability to crack down on these businesses because court decisions have largely exempted factory farms from Clean Water Act regulation. And Walz, of course, can’t bear the blame for a problem that began decades ago due to the unsavory realities of farm state politics. But <a href="https://www.ewg.org/interactive-maps/2020-in-minnesotas-farm-country-nitrate-pollution-of-drinking-water-getting-worse/#:~:text=More%20than%20half%20of%20all,systems%20are%20experiencing%20worsening%20contamination.">environmental groups</a> and even some <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2024/02/22/epa-directive-renews-debate-over-states-role-in-protecting-drinking-water-from-farm-pollution/">state lawmakers</a> argue Minnesota could be doing much more. Instead, Walz seems to have little to say about factory farming dirtying the state’s waterways.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Prior to serving as Minnesota’s governor, Walz represented Minnesota in the US House of Representatives for six terms, in which he <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/tim-walzs-balancing-act-on-agriculture/">voted against</a> two important agricultural pollution measures. As a member of the House Agriculture Committee, he played a large role in negotiating the Farm Bill — a multiyear legislative package that sets federal agricultural policy — and during his tenure, the legislation shoveled <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/farm-commodity-policy/farm-bill-spending/">more and more money</a> to farmers growing livestock feed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Walz has championed <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/tim-walzs-balancing-act-on-agriculture/">federal</a> <a href="https://www.mda.state.mn.us/soil-health-grant">and</a> <a href="https://www.brownfieldagnews.com/news/minnesota-water-quality-program-surpasses-1-million-voluntary-acres-enrolled/">state</a> “conservation” funding for farmers to implement more sustainable practices, but they’ve ultimately made <a href="https://apnews.com/article/rivers-streams-nitrogen-pollution-fertilizer-agriculture-farming-571eb54cb69cc06f43d5f1253e990337">little to no progress</a> in fixing the problem. And <a href="https://www.iatp.org/payments-pollution-how-federal-conservation-programs-can-better-benefit-farmers">some</a> of the federal conservation funding goes to large meat and dairy operations for environmentally dubious practices.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gov. Walz’s office declined to comment for this story and instead shared a comment from the Minnesota Department of Agriculture. “The Governor has consistently advocated for and implemented programs that ensure agriculture benefits the environment while remaining profitable,” the statement reads, and points to Walz’s support for conservation funding and a <a href="https://www.mda.state.mn.us/nfr">rule</a> that sets some limits on fertilizer application.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">What Walz in the White House might mean for the future of farming</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Harris wins the presidency, Walz could be influential in setting the administration’s agricultural agenda. That would likely mean more of the same bipartisan, pro-factory farming consensus.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the other hand, Harris has a surprisingly strong track record on <a href="https://time.com/7003790/kamala-harris-climate-record-trump-climate-change/">the environment</a> and <a href="https://www.animals24-7.org/2024/07/21/vp-kamala-harris-has-long-strong-record-on-animal-issues/">animal welfare</a>, having defended California’s bans on foie gras and confining egg-laying hens in tiny cages during her time as the state’s attorney general.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Walz’s rural bona fides could make him an effective messenger for reforms that a Harris administration might pursue&nbsp;— if he’s willing to buck Big Ag. But there’s little evidence so far that he would be ready to take that role.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To call out the meat industry for its misdeeds and advocate for meaningful regulations would require courage few farm state politicians have been willing to show. Doing so in the middle of a tightly contested presidential campaign, where several of the battleground states have major agricultural sectors, could be politically disastrous.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, instead, we get photos of candidates with cute piglets and baby calves caught up in the factory farm system — images that fortify the very mythologies that make it so difficult for elected officials to stand up to Big Ag. But that political calculation has gotten us to where we are today: poisoned waters, injured workers, and abused animals.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While a second Trump term would likely be even friendlier to Big Ag than a Harris-Walz administration, there’s <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/12/11/democrat-tom-vilsack-usda-secretary-farms/">less daylight</a> between <a href="https://cornbeltconfidential.substack.com/p/the-problem-with-local-cafo-bans">Republicans and Democrats</a> on agricultural policy than you might think.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We’re not going back” has become the de facto Harris-Walz campaign slogan. But in the fight against factory farming, their administration probably wouldn’t move us forward, either.</p>

<p>On September 26, 1983, the planet came terrifyingly close to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/6/29/8845913/russia-war">a nuclear holocaust</a>.</p>

<p>The Soviet Union’s missile attack early warning system displayed, in large red letters, the word “LAUNCH”; a computer screen stated to the officer on duty, Soviet Lt. Col. Stanislav Petrov, that it could say with “high reliability” that an American intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) had been launched and was headed toward the Soviet Union. First, it was just one missile, but then another, and another, until the system reported that a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/coldwar/shatter021099b.htm">total of five Minuteman ICBMs</a> had been launched.</p>

<p>“Petrov had to make a decision: Would he report an incoming American strike?” my then-colleague <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/6/29/8845913/russia-war">Max Fisher explained</a>. “If he did, Soviet nuclear doctrine called for a full nuclear retaliation; there would be no time to double-check the warning system, much less seek negotiations with the US.”</p>

<p>Reporting it would have made a certain degree of sense. The Reagan administration had a far more hardline stance against the Soviets than the Carter, Ford, or Nixon administrations before it. Months earlier President Reagan had announced the <a href="https://www.pbs.org/video/american-experience-reagan-announces-sdi/">Strategic Defense Initiative</a> (mockingly dubbed “Star Wars,” a plan to shoot down ballistic missiles before they reached the US), and his administration was in the process of <a href="https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/09/13/President-Reagans-plan-to-deploy-572-intermediate-range-missiles/8303230924762/">deploying Pershing II nuclear-armed missiles to West Germany and Great Britain</a>, which were capable of striking the Soviet Union. There were reasons for Petrov to think Reagan’s brinkmanship had escalated to an actual nuclear exchange.</p>

<p>But Petrov did not report the incoming strike. He and others on his staff concluded that what they were seeing was a false alarm. And it was; the system mistook the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/18/world/europe/stanislav-petrov-nuclear-war-dead.html">sun’s reflection off clouds for a missile</a>. Petrov prevented a nuclear war between the Soviets, who had <a href="http://sci-hub.tw/10.2968/066004008">35,804 nuclear warheads in 1983</a>, and the US, which had 23,305.</p>

<p>A 1979 report by <a href="http://ota.fas.org/reports/7906.pdf">Congress’s Office of Technology Assessment</a> estimated that a full-scale Soviet assault on the US would kill 35 to 77 percent of the US population — or between 82 million and 180 million people in 1983. The inevitable US counterstrike would kill 20 to 40 percent of the Soviet population, or between 54 million and 108 million people. The combined death toll there (between 136 million and 288 million) swamps the death toll of any war, genocide, or other violent catastrophe in human history. Proportional to world population, it would be rivaled only by the <a href="https://apholt.com/2016/10/19/ranking-historic-atrocities-pinkers-better-angels/">An Lushan rebellion in eighth-century China and the Mongol conquests of the 13th century</a>.</p>

<p>And it’s likely hundreds of millions more would have died once the conflict disrupted global temperatures and severely hampered agriculture. International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War put the potential death toll from starvation at about <a href="http://www.ippnw.org/nuclear-famine.html">2 billion</a>.</p>

<p>Petrov, almost single-handedly, prevented those deaths.</p>

<p>Preventing the deaths of hundreds of millions, if not billions, of people was a costly decision for Petrov. If he had been wrong, and he somehow survived the American nuclear strike, he likely would’ve been executed for treason. Even though he was right, he was, according to the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/coldwar/shatter021099b.htm">Washington Post’s David Hoffman</a>, “relentlessly interrogated afterward [and] never rewarded for his decision.”</p>

<p>After the Cold War, Petrov would receive a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Petrov#Awards_and_commendations">number of commendations</a> for saving the world. He was <a href="http://clubs.themoscowtimes.com/themanwhosavedtheworld">honored at the United Nations</a>, received the <a href="http://dresdner-friedenspreis.de/laureates/?lang=en">Dresden Peace Prize</a>, and was profiled in the documentary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Saved_the_World"><em>The Man Who Saved the World</em></a>. “I was just at the right place at the right time,” he told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/18/world/europe/stanislav-petrov-nuclear-war-dead.html">filmmakers</a>. He died in May 2017, at the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/09/18/551792129/stanislav-petrov-the-man-who-saved-the-world-dies-at-77">age of 77</a>. Two books about the Petrov incident and other nuclear close calls in 1983 (related to the NATO exercise Able Archer) came out in recent years: Taylor Downing’s <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/1983-Reagan-Andropov-World-Brink/dp/0306921723?sa-no-redirect=1"><em>1983</em></a> and Marc Ambinder’s <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Brink-President-Reagan-Nuclear-Scare/dp/1476760373/ref=pd_bxgy_14_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=1476760373&amp;pd_rd_r=d6a70bd6-c1a0-11e8-8df6-cb6b6b88cd71&amp;pd_rd_w=Kf6nx&amp;pd_rd_wg=KxuWz&amp;pf_rd_i=desktop-dp-sims&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_p=3f9889ac-6c45-46e8-b515-3af650557207&amp;pf_rd_r=8WD0WEN4MQQ5MD05B56D&amp;pf_rd_s=desktop-dp-sims&amp;pf_rd_t=40701&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=8WD0WEN4MQQ5MD05B56D"><em>The Brink</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Petrov isn’t the only man who’s prevented nuclear war</h2>

<p>Petrov was not the only Russian official who’s saved the world. On October 27, 1962, Vasili Arkhipov, a Soviet navy officer, was in a nuclear submarine near Cuba when US naval forces <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/27/vasili-arkhipov-soviet-submarine-captain-who-averted-nuclear-war-awarded-future-of-life-prize">started dropping depth charges</a> (a kind of explosive targeting submarines) on him. Two senior officers on the submarine thought that a nuclear war could’ve already begun and wanted to launch a nuclear torpedo at a US vessel. But all three senior officers had to agree for the missile to fire, and Arkhipov dissented, preventing a nuclear exchange and potentially preventing the end of the world.</p>

<p>Even more recently, on January 25, 1995, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/coldwar/shatter031598a.htm">Russian early warning radars suggested that an American first strike was incoming</a>. President Boris Yeltsin was alerted and given a suitcase with instructions for launching a nuclear strike at the US. Russian nuclear forces were given an alert to increase combat readiness. Yeltsin eventually declined to launch a counterstrike — which is good, because this was another false alarm. It turns out&nbsp;that Russian early warning systems had picked up a Norwegian-US joint research rocket, launched by scientists studying the northern lights.</p>

<p>Petrov’s story means all the more at a moment when nuclear tensions globally remain uncomfortably high. China on September 25 <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/25/asia/china-icbm-test-pacific-ocean-intl-hnk/index.html">tested an intercontinental ballistic missile</a> for the first time in decades. Vladimir Putin has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/26/putin-reveals-new-rules-on-nuclear-weapons-in-russias-latest-threat.html">ramped up Russia&#8217;s nuclear threats against Ukraine</a>, stating that even non-nuclear states, if they&#8217;re supported by a nuclear state, could be subject to strikes. At the same time, a key US-Russia nuclear treaty is <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/08/12/america-prepares-for-a-new-nuclear-arms-race">set to expire in less than two years</a>, and the Senate Armed Services Committee has endorsed <a href="https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2024-07/news/biden-arms-policy-stays-course-despite-buildup#:~:text=The%20Senate%20Armed,generation%20Sentinel%20ICBMs.">ramping up the US missile capacity</a> and <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/air/2024/06/18/congress-wants-to-restore-nukes-on-conventional-b-52-bombers/">putting nukes back on B-52 bombers</a> once it does. Meanwhile, China is seeking to substantially <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/06/16/china-nuclear-arsenal-weapons/">increase its own stockpile</a> of warheads.</p>

<p>The sheer threat of these weapons hanging over us creates psychological uncertainty that is inherent to nuclear brinkmanship, as Petrov himself demonstrated. Going by the book, he should have at least alerted his military superiors of the apparent US nuclear strike, even if the tiny number of missiles reported by the computer gave him reason to conclude it was a likely error. But while Petrov clearly showed admirable bravery — and everyone alive today should be thankful he did — his decision also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/24/opinion/ukraine-war-putin-russia.html">underscores an unknowable question</a>: When the moment seems to come, will a national leader or the officers below them actually push the button?</p>

<p>The fate of billions could depend on the answer.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hurricane Helene, now a Category 2 storm, is churning across the Gulf of Mexico, a little more than 300 miles southwest of Tampa, Florida. Forecasters predict the hurricane — which as of Thursday morning has maximum sustained winds of <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/261139.shtml?">near 100 miles per hour</a> — will rapidly intensify in the next 24 hours before ramming into western Florida late Thursday as a monstrous storm. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge from Tropical Storm Helene along the entire west coast of the Florida Peninsula,” the National Hurricane Center <a href="https://x.com/NHC_Surge/status/1838865478439317683">said</a> early Wednesday morning.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The National Hurricane Center predicts storm surge <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?start#contents">as high as 20 feet</a> in some parts of Florida’s Big Bend, a region between the panhandle and the peninsula. Caused largely by wind pushing water inland, storm surge is the most dangerous part of tropical storms; it killed <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/surge/">more than 40 people</a> during Hurricane Ian in 2022. The storm is also expected to inundate inland regions across much of the southeastern US with rain, dumping a foot or more in parts of southern Appalachia.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Helene could also disrupt part of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/22823993/monarch-butterflies-mexico-milkweed">epic monarch butterfly migration</a>, which typically passes through the Big Bend’s St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge in early October.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Helene is the eighth named storm in what has so far amounted to a <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/atlantic-hurricane-lull-puzzles-scientists/">somewhat puzzling</a> hurricane season. It started with a bang — June’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/358323/hurricane-beryl-rapid-intesification-caribbean-climate">Hurricane Beryl</a> became the earliest Category 5 storm on record —&nbsp;and then much of August and September was unexpectedly quiet.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many meteorologists, though, have been warning not to be fooled by this late-summer lull.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Having multi-week periods of quiet and then multi-week periods of activity is very normal throughout a hurricane season,” <a href="https://bmcnoldy.earth.miami.edu/">Brian McNoldy</a>, a climatologist at the University of Miami, told me earlier this month. “I definitely would not read too much into it.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Plus, McNoldy said, the ocean in the Gulf of Mexico has been —&nbsp;and still is —&nbsp;exceptionally hot, and hot water fuels hurricanes. Ocean heat content, a measure of how much heat energy the ocean stores, is at a record high for this time of year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Take a look at the chart below. The red line is 2024 and the blue line is the average over the last decade.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/ohc_gulf-1.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,12.589156124409,100,74.821687751182" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A chart of ocean heat content in the Gulf of Mexico. | &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnoldy.earth.miami.edu/&quot;&gt;Brian McNoldy&lt;/a&gt;" data-portal-copyright="&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnoldy.earth.miami.edu/&quot;&gt;Brian McNoldy&lt;/a&gt;" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">This is especially concerning right now, given the <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?start#contents">forecasted path of Helene</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All that ocean heat could supercharge the storm as it travels across the Gulf on its way to Florida, potentially causing it to “rapidly intensify.” That’s when wind speeds increase by roughly 35 mph or more in less than 24 hours. Forecasters predict that Hurricane Helene could hit Florida as a Category 3 or 4 system.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The <a href="https://kouya.has.arizona.edu/tropics/SSTmonitoring.html#regional">sea surface temperature</a> and the ocean heat content are both record high in the Gulf,” McNoldy, who produced the chart above, told me. “That heat at the surface and available through a depth will give Helene all the fuel it needs to rapidly intensify today and into tomorrow.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The record Gulf temperatures are just one signal of a more <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/2024/2/28/24085691/atlantic-ocean-warming-climate-change-hurricanes-coral-reefs-bleaching">widespread bout of warming</a> across the North Atlantic that <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/23762529/atlantic-ocean-record-heat-wave-el-nino-hurricane-climate-change">ramped up last year</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not entirely clear what’s causing this warming, though scientists suspect a combination of factors including climate change — which raises the baseline ocean temperature — as well as lingering effects of <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/23738846/el-nino-2023-weather-heat-wave-climate-change-disaster-flood-rain">El Niño</a>, natural climate variability, and perhaps even a <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/tonga-volcano-eruption-raises-imminent-risk-of-temporary-1-5c-breach/">volcanic eruption</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This is out of bounds from the kinds of variability that we’ve seen in [at least] the last 75 years or so,” <a href="https://people.miami.edu/profile/be7abbba52c947423b8133238c7e7b68">Ben Kirtman</a>, director of the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies, a joint initiative of the University of Miami and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), told Vox in August. “That can be scary stuff.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If, in the year 2010, someone asked you to conjure an image of the average libertarian, there’s a good chance you’d envision former Texas Rep. Ron Paul, who was, for decades, the ideology’s most famous representative.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You might also think of someone entirely fictional: Ron Swanson.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Grumpy, mustachioed, and obsessively fearful of government overreach, Swanson was <em>Parks &amp; Recreation</em>’s resident macho man, the lone-wolf amateur woodworker who believed society’s problems could be fixed by bootstraps, hard work, and rugged individualism.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Sure, these guys romanticize the idea of working with their hands, but it’s far more likely they spend their days typing on a laptop (or better yet, speaking into a podcast mic)</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sometime between 2010 and now, however, the libertarian of the American imagination changed. Our new avatar for laissez-faire economics and “leave me alone-ism” is more likely an aspiring entrepreneur who rails against wokeness in forums and group chats.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether or not this type of guy is actually even a libertarian at all is debatable. Some may espouse libertarian-ish economics, but most are far more fixated on culture; still others have a hard-to-classify medley of views. They are, however, united by their self-mythologizing as “free thinkers” and a sense of alienation from mainstream liberal discourse. This brand of tech bro is proud of his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/14/young-men-election-joe-rogan-donald-trump">heterodoxy</a>, despite the fact that the worldview he articulates seems to have been passed top-down from a cadre of influential Silicon Valley executives.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sure, these guys romanticize the idea of working with their hands, but it’s far more likely they spend their days typing on a laptop (or better yet, speaking into a podcast mic). Rather than a remote log cabin, they imagine escaping to their very own civilization on a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/03/silicon-valley-billionaires-building-cities/677173/">corporate-owned self-governing city-state</a> — er, “<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/network-school-balaji-srinivasan/">networked state</a>.” They’re not driving lifted trucks; they’re buying <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/2024_Tesla_Cybertruck_Foundation_Series%2C_front_left_%28Greenwich%29.jpg/1200px-2024_Tesla_Cybertruck_Foundation_Series%2C_front_left_%28Greenwich%29.jpg">bulletproof hunks of metal</a> that look like they came out of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. Like Ron Swanson, they still <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/08/the-peterson-family-meat-cleanse/567613/">love animal protein</a>, but now they may be eating it <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/raw-meat-diet-reddit">literally raw</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Less into Milton Friedman (the economist) than <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/02/14/business/lex-fridman-mit-science-ambassador-podcast/">Lex Fridman</a> (the computer scientist-turned-podcaster), they regurgitate the gospel of tech overlords like <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23872485/elon-musk-walter-isaacson-biography-review">Elon Musk</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/opinion/marc-andreessen-reactionary-futurism.html">Marc Andreessen</a> and the creators who interview them — Joe Rogan and his many imitators. They love tough-guy sports like<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/you-dont-know-this-nerd-is-a-silent-killer-a-raging-martial-arts-scene-finds-a-home-in-silicon-valley"> MMA and Brazilian jiu-jitsu</a> but are worried about <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/06/19/joe-rogan-hotez-rfk-vaccine-debate/">vaccines</a>, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/is-seed-oil-bad-for-you-wellness-influencers-right-wing-debunked-1234809499/">seed oils</a>, and the mainstreaming of <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/elon-musk-trans-daughter-19594744.php">trans rights</a>. Their worldview is often a paradox, full of irony and sometimes hypocrisy.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GettyImages-174032184.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Joe Rogan" title="Joe Rogan" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Joe Rogan, the most popular podcaster on Spotify. | NBC Universal/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="NBC Universal/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent years, there have been a few attempts at christening this cohort with a name. Germs of it are <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2023/1/10/23547393/andrew-tate-toxic-masculinity-qa">influenced by the manosphere</a>, or the parts of the internet where men complain about their lack of access to women and sex and blame society’s present ills on feminism. Though you don’t hear these guys talk about the alt-right or being “redpilled” much anymore (perhaps too closely associated with <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/4/16/18287446/incel-definition-reddit">incels</a>), they tend to frame their position as “anti-woke,” or a counterpoint to what they see as a world over-indexed on equality and diversity.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This sphere, broadly conceived, includes everyone from “canceled” figures associated with the <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2018/5/10/17338290/intellectual-dark-web-rogan-peterson-harris-times-weiss">“intellectual dark web,”</a> to controversy-hungry influencers like Sneako and the Paul brothers, to mega podcasters Dave Rubin and Tim Pool (most recently in the news for unwittingly <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/370323/tenet-media-russia-what-happened-tim-pool-dave-rubin-benny-johnson-lauren-southern">becoming paid Russian propaganda stooges</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the Obama administration, two things happened that changed the way these men (and they are overwhelmingly men) think, look, and behave online: the overhaul of acceptable political discourse caused by the election of Donald Trump and, of course, the pandemic.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A worldview centered around cultural grievances</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of this philosophy and aesthetic can be credited to the influence of billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel. Thiel, whose libertarian views have <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/11/donald-trump-steve-bannon-peter-thiel-214490/">curdled into the anti-democratic</a>, has for years <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/04/inside-the-new-right-where-peter-thiel-is-placing-his-biggest-bets">funded a right-wing culture movement</a> (if it can even be considered that) that includes film festivals, conferences, and media companies that tout <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/womens-magazine-gen-z-cosmo-far-right-evie-1234744617/">anti-feminism</a> and <a href="https://qz.com/1537150/peter-thiel-is-funding-a-science-publication-questioning-evolution-and-climate-change">climate change denialism</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/21/books/review/the-contrarian-peter-thiel-max-chafkin.html">recent Thiel biography traces</a> almost everything the billionaire has done to amass power back to the grudge he held as a nerdy schoolboy who loved Dungeons &amp; Dragons and <em>The Lord of the Rings </em>(several of Thiel’s companies are named for Tolkien people and places) against the liberals and elites who rejected him.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Trump years gave extreme views like Thiel’s and others in Silicon Valley legitimacy and publicity. One major moment,<strong> </strong>says Derek Robertson, who writes <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/digital-future-daily/2024/09/16/how-to-not-fund-the-future-00179381">Politico’s Digital Future Daily newsletter</a>, was the publication of <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/8/9/16112050/google-fired-engineer-james-damore-alt-right-free-speech">ex-Google employee James Damore’s letter</a> to the company’s leadership in 2017. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In it, Damore railed against the company’s diversity measures by stating that women simply weren’t biologically suited to work in tech, causing a major backlash from women in the industry. After Damore was fired, he hit the burgeoning alt-right media circuit, where he gave interviews to the leading commentators of the day: Rogan, Jordan Peterson, Ben Shapiro, as well as white nationalist podcaster <a href="https://gnet-research.org/2023/05/17/inside-the-cult-of-stefan-molyneux-a-historical-exploration-of-far-right-radicalisation-on-youtube/">Stefan Molyneux</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The letter was also a litmus test for what was acceptable to say publicly in a world where Donald Trump was president. The sudden open hostility to diversity grew to include a stew of related grievances. Anyone who prevented entrepreneurs and other “big thinkers” from doing exactly as they pleased became the enemy: <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2013/07/silicon-valleys-anti-unionism-and-class-warfare.html">unions</a>, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/28/opinion/marc-andreessen-manifesto-techno-optimism.html">media, academia, government institutions</a>, anyone with a <a href="https://www.inc.com/tim-askew/why-liberal-arts-are-necessary-for-long-term-success.html">liberal arts degree</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/elon-musk-andrew-tate-4chan-x-twitter-high-status-males-b2606622.html">women</a> and <a href="https://bridge.georgetown.edu/research/factsheet-ben-shapiro/">people of color</a> in positions of power (although this part usually goes unsaid).&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>If contemporary culture is the problem, with its wokeness and DEI, it’s no wonder they valorize “the classics”&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Robertson tells me he’s watched libertarianism, at least in its tech bro manifestation, go from this “really wonky” philosophy centered around less government interference in all aspects of life to a movement that’s almost entirely centralized around cultural grievances. “It’s just a reactionary movement against the increasing presence of women in culture, the increasing domination of women in academia and corporate fields,” he says. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These grievances have shaped the aesthetic of the online right: If contemporary culture is the problem, with its wokeness and DEI, it&#8217;s no wonder they valorize “the classics.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many of them, exemplified by the infamous internet personality <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/09/bronze-age-pervert-costin-alamariu/674762/">Bronze Age Pervert</a>, revere the type of art Westerners are exposed to in elementary school: ancient sculpture and their Renaissance counterparts, Romantic painting, and classical music and architecture. Echoes of this worldview are <a href="https://www.redpepper.org.uk/political-parties-and-ideologies/history/nowhere-to-retvrn-history-nostalgia-tradwives-far-right/">everywhere on social media</a>, romanticizing “trad” lifestyles with regressive gender roles juxtaposed next to images of rural landscapes and marble nudes, often posted by people hoping for a “RETVRN” (styled as such to emulate the Roman empire) to an imagined past society.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ironically, no object better synthesizes the hyper-online, libertarian-leaning dude than the Cybertruck, the bizarre Tesla offering that the Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/22/style/elon-musk-tesla-cybertruck.html">described as</a> “a culture war on wheels.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Inspired by <a href="https://x.com/walterisaacson/status/1681304525767086085?s=46&amp;t=NmTvzLp9qcZ7PG3SfRGXOA">dystopian science fiction</a>, the hulking hunk of unpainted metal barely squeezes into a lane of traffic and encases its driver in a (<a href="https://qz.com/tesla-cybertruck-bulletproof-1851325534">sort of</a>) bulletproof tank that’s easily mistaken for a weapon of war. It is one of the few cars in the world that no one would ever compare to a woman’s body — there are no curves, after all. The Cybertruck appeals to someone who imagines danger is all around them. If they can’t protect themselves against a culture that is moving on without them, perhaps they can do it with stainless steel.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How Covid supercharged male wellness culture</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The pandemic was a convergence of several grievances harbored by the free-thinker set: government overreach, America’s troubled health care system, and left-wing virtue signaling.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The CDC’s response to Covid-19, says Hussein Kesvani, a journalist and podcaster who covers internet culture and politics, clashed with the tech bros’ sensibilities: Public health required individuals to alter their behavior for the sake of the collective good and sacrifice certain personal freedoms.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not surprising, then, how this set began to view mask-wearing as a symbol identifying oneself with the political establishment and vaccines as dangerous. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/02/actual-joe-rogan-coronavirus-misinformation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">While promoting</a>&nbsp;vaccine skepticism and decrying lockdown measures, personalities like Rogan have entertained a bevy of other&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/08/opinion/joe-rogan-health-misinformation-solutions.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">junk ideas about health</a>, often peddling their <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/onnit-sued-supplements-joe-rogan-b2548166.html">own questionable&nbsp;products</a>. Energy drinks and longevity supplements in particular are a cash cow; listen to any podcast of this ilk and you’re likely to hear the guest plugging their own brand (Logan Paul has <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/logan-paul-and-ksi-prime-hydration-lawsuits-list-of-cases-2024-8">Prime Hydration</a>; both <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/24/979362593/alex-jones-still-sells-supplements-on-amazon-despite-bans-from-other-platforms">Alex Jones</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHTLxxeAhc4">The Daily Wire</a> have vitamin companies).&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GettyImages-2147577571.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Logan Paul " title="Logan Paul " data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Logan Paul at a boxing match, promoting his Prime energy drink. | Tim Nwachukwu/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Tim Nwachukwu/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">“So much of this conspiratorial stuff is rooted in this idea that these institutions — hospitals, governments — are keeping the secrets of the universe away from you,” says Kesvani.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s created an enormous industry for heterodoxy entrepreneurs on every level of scamminess to hawk ideas about “seed oils” <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/is-seed-oil-bad-for-you-wellness-influencers-right-wing-debunked-1234809499/">supposedly turning everyone ugly and sick</a>, why <a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/01/01/1198916105/mens-health-masturbation-abstinence">masturbation</a> is making men weak, and how <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/raw-meat-diet-reddit">raw beef liver is the one true alpha diet</a>: If the pandemic convinced you that everything you’ve been told about health is a lie, it’s far easier to sell you some random influencer’s vitamin.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“They’re sold in this ‘macho lifestyle’ way, where if you drink Prime you can crush your enemies beneath your chariot wheels, rather than what you’re actually doing, which is probably staying up all night to play PlayStation,” says Helen Lewis, an Atlantic staff writer who covers politics and digital culture. “You have anti-woke moisturizers, anti-woke plunge baths, all this self-care which feels very feminine, so you have to put a macho spin on it to make men feel okay about it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hence the interest in sports like MMA and Brazilian jiu-jitsu, which combine individual competition with combat. Mark Zuckerberg, Rogan, and Fridman, for instance, all have either blue or black belts in martial arts. Where wellness culture meets tech guy politics is full of its own paradoxes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s about the optimization of you as a person, the people you surround yourself with, the places you go, the people you’re seen with,” says Ed Zitron, a Substacker and tech critic. “It actually, if you really take a step back, is something that 20 years ago, guys like them would have described as deeply feminine.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Perhaps it’s all about the loneliness epidemic?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s possible you’ve seen videos or advertisements on social media promoting all-male retreats that romanticize escaping from society, either for hunting or networking or self-improvement (they’ve become so prevalent that there are now <a href="https://x.com/snotwurst420/status/1836061211189719171">parodies going viral</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While in itself not a bad thing, Zitron points out that most of these retreats are “men reaching out for community, but the community they find is one built on selfishness and exclusion.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think it’s really important to know how much of this comes down to the breakdown of male friendships,” he adds. “Women seem to have some degree of sisterhood, a gender-based solidarity. Guys don’t seem to have this unless it’s just being sexist.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That desire for community sometimes leads heterodox thinkers into creating narratives borrowed from fantasy or reductive retellings of history. It’s no accident that billionaires like Thiel, Musk, and Jeff Bezos frequently reference <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, a classic high fantasy about the fight between good and evil (you can guess which side they believe they’re on).&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I hosted a men-only dinner <a href="https://t.co/bnD1OexCtJ">pic.twitter.com/bnD1OexCtJ</a></p>&mdash; judd crud (@snotwurst420) <a href="https://twitter.com/snotwurst420/status/1836061211189719171?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 17, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/comment/2024/08/why-leaders-listen-elon-musk-donald-trump-interview">current favorite meme</a> places them within the stages of the Roman empire, (“Hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men, weak men create hard times”), positioning themselves as the few strong men who will rise from the ashes to save humanity&nbsp;— itself ironic, considering Musk is among the class of tech billionaires who forged the digital world as we know it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet to the fans who buy into this worldview, it all sounds both true and, crucially, cool: Not only will the free-thinkers rescue humanity, but they’re doing it <a href="https://x.com/josiahhughes/status/1835761052673352041">because it’s punk</a>. “The very macho styling feels countercultural to them. I think it feels punkish: ‘There is a polite society that is dominated by feminine codes of behavior, and we are the insurgent uprising to that.’ To outsiders maybe that doesn’t make a great deal of sense, but if you’re a 14-year-old boy, I think it does make a lot of sense,” says Lewis.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>After all, what else is a Cybertruck but an admission of fear?</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are ways in which their self-mythologizing is absolutely true: They are an alternative to mainstream news media, and they do<em> </em>say things that might land you in a meeting with HR or a suddenly very empty room at a party. By building their followings online, they’re tapping into an audience thirsty for someone to tell them that their grievances — against women, against culture, against the media — are valid.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In reality, the techno-libertarians, the heterodoxy, or whatever we’re calling them (Robertson poses “masculine futurism” while Zitron suggests “New nihilism”) seem to be driven by the deepest fears of these particular men. After all, what else is a Cybertruck but an admission of fear? Fear of other cars, of other people, of being broke and the failure to amass social status. “Because what do they actually care about other than ‘I want money bigger; woman sex me now’?” Robertson asks.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What, indeed?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s been more than a week since the <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24006759/puffy-diddy-sean-combs-video-cassie-rape-lawsuit">arrest of music mogul and rapper Sean “Diddy” Combs</a> on a litany of federal charges including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy, but the questions surrounding the allegations have only grown in recent days.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Which of Combs’s many celebrity friends heard about the alleged “freak-offs”? What, if anything, did his former romantic partners, including Jennifer Lopez, know? If there are tapes, what’s on them? Why do people keep talking about Justin Bieber? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not a stretch to draw parallels between Combs’s case and that of notorious sex offender <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/7/7/20685023/billionaire-jeffrey-epstein-arrested-minor-sex-trafficking-charges">Jeffrey Epstein</a>. Copious amounts of money, a long list of powerful friends, and a culture of celebrity silence make for a potent combination that, as <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/8/14/20803950/jeffrey-epstein-conspiracy-theories-clinton-trump-acosta">Anna has written</a>, is “tailor-made to produce conspiracy theories.” In the wake of the arrest, amateur internet sleuths have surfaced numerous videos and photos and pored over interviews with Diddy and his&nbsp;celebrity associates in search of answers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, the allegations against Combs continue to pile up. After several civil lawsuits were filed against Combs late last year, another woman came forward this week to allege <a href="https://apnews.com/article/sean-combs-diddy-lawsuit-1e2b124ba85ebf1b4f1e93c8692aab4b">in a 26-page civil suit</a> that Combs and his bodyguard took her to the recording studio for his record label, Bad Boy, in 2001, raped her repeatedly, and recorded the assault. &nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Through his lawyers, Diddy has repeatedly asserted that the civil claims against him are baseless, calling several of them “sickening allegations” made “by individuals looking for a quick payday.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He has pleaded not guilty in the criminal case, too, and is currently being held in a Brooklyn jail after twice being denied bail. His lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, has said the rapper is “going to fight this with all of his energy and all of his might,” and during a court hearing argued that the so-called freak-offs — marathon sexual productions that prosecutors say involved hired sex workers and women coerced to perform sexual acts for the gratification of Combs and others — were consensual, if unconventional. “Is it sex trafficking?” he asked in court last week. “No, not if everybody wants to be there.”   <br><br>With so many players, civil and criminal cases, and plenty of misinformation floating around, we’re pulling together some of the most frequently asked questions about Diddy and trying to answer them — as best we can, of course, given what we know. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For a more detailed history of all the allegations against Diddy, check out Anna’s full explainer <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24006759/puffy-diddy-sean-combs-video-cassie-rape-lawsuit">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Combs accused of?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Combs is facing two kinds of cases: one criminal case brought by the federal government and several civil cases brought by individuals, each involving different accusations.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Combs was arrested on criminal charges; the government alleges that he used his business enterprise to conduct criminal activity, including sex trafficking and kidnapping, and then used his power to intimidate victims and cover up the crimes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The case centers on the alleged performances with women and sex workers. The indictment alleges that Diddy often transported sex workers to perform in the sessions and taped the encounters to coerce silence from participants, using an array of employees and his business organization to facilitate the criminal activity. For all of this, they’ve charged Combs with racketeering conspiracy: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-r-kelly-keith-raniere-prosecutions.html">a powerful charge</a> that was originally used largely to prosecute organized crime leaders and can result in a hefty sentence.&nbsp;<br><br>It was the civil cases, however, that opened the floodgates that ultimately led to the indictment.<br><br>In November 2023, Combs’s ex-girlfriend, Casandra Ventura, also known as the singer Cassie, <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24006759/puffy-diddy-sean-combs-video-cassie-rape-lawsuit">filed the first explosive lawsuit</a> that exposed several allegations against Combs to the public, including that the rapper orchestrated the performances with sex workers and forced her to participate. Though she filed a civil case (which was settled by Combs within one day), Ventura’s allegations appear to be the central foundation of the federal criminal case against Combs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Four other cases were filed shortly thereafter, three by women who alleged that he raped them (in some cases drugging them), and one by a male music producer who accused Diddy of grooming him and coercing him to hire sex workers for sex.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>If so many people were involved, why did it take so long for the allegations to come out?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Combs was incredibly powerful in the music industry and in American culture more generally. ​​&nbsp; He was one of the first people to blend the worlds of hip-hop, business, and luxury. His fashion label, Sean John, founded in 1998, became <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/09/09/sean-combs-puff-daddy-p-diddy-i-am-fashion">known for high-end menswear</a>. He promoted brands of vodka and tequila and hosted exclusive <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/diddy-white-party-turns-20-pictures-hamptons-8342051/">white parties</a> in the Hamptons with guests like Martha Stewart, Sarah Jessica Parker, Matthew Broderick, and Jay Z.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s difficult for people to speak out about sexual assault under any circumstances, and doubly difficult when the alleged perpetrator is someone wealthy and well-connected who may have influence over their careers. Combs is also accused of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-indicted.html">running an enormous criminal “enterprise”</a> that threatened women with blackmail and violence — including using firearms to threaten victims — all of which would have made it even more difficult for anyone to come forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s on the tapes mentioned in the indictment? Will they ever come out?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Several of the accusers, and the criminal indictment, allege that Diddy videotaped sexual assaults and the performances with sex workers. The accuser this week alleges that a tape made of her sexual assault <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/sean-diddy-combs-accuser-drugged-bound-rape-lawsuit-1235109972/">was sold</a> and viewed by several other men.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Generally, accusers have said any tapes served as a way to ensure their silence. In court, the New York Times reported, prosecutors presented <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-freakoffs-sex-drugs.html">a statement from one</a> who said, “He just threatened me about my sex tapes that he has of me on two phones. He said he would expose me, mind you these sex tapes where I am heavily drugged.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why is everyone talking about baby oil? Is this real?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the odder details in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/8a5e00b3-6871-456f-b787-736298a5c2d7.pdf?itid=lk_inline_manual_6">the Combs indictment</a> is that authorities say they seized “more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant” in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/25/entertainment/sean-combs-home-search/index.html">searches of the mogul’s residences</a> in Miami and Los Angeles earlier this year. Prosecutors say the oil was meant for the performances, and Ventura also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-freakoffs-sex-drugs.html">said in her lawsuit</a> that she was told to pour “excessive” amounts of oil on herself at these events.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Possessing baby oil is not a crime, and the whole oil issue doesn’t matter very much in the context of the violent and disturbing conduct of which Combs has been accused. But a federal indictment of a public figure like Combs is meant to be read, and it’s not unusual for prosecutors to include details they know will shock people and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-freakoffs-sex-drugs.html">make headlines</a>. Baby oil did the trick.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Are other celebrities connected to the case?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s important to note that no other person, celebrity or not, has been indicted alongside Combs in the criminal case. The civil cases do not mention any other celebrities either, accusing only Combs and occasionally those employed by him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, this is an incredibly tough question, tending to spark more rumor and innuendo than uncover any truths, as onlookers try to determine who knew what when. Indeed, Combs had many friends in high places. But pursuing the question tends to spawn misinformation, like a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/viral-justin-bieber-song-about-diddy-party-likely-ai/">viral song about “a Diddy party”</a> attributed to Justin Bieber that experts now say was likely created by AI.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So far, a few bold-faced names who were on the guest lists at Combs’s celeb-packed “<a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/09/23/celebrity-news/inside-sean-diddy-combs-wild-parties-leonardo-dicaprio-sarah-jessica-parker-j-lo-more-spotted-in-resurfaced-pics/">white parties</a>” have <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/what-celebs-have-said-about-diddys-infamous-parties/">come forward to say they</a> were in no way connected to any of the crimes Combs is accused of. But it’s best if we all give the conspiracy theories a rest and let the case be handled in court. Wild speculation is only liable to exacerbate the victims’ pain.  </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What will happen to Combs’s businesses and brands now?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the weeks before Ventura’s lawsuit went public last November, Diddy made several media-grabbing moves, including donating $1 million to Howard University, performing and collecting a Global Icon Award at the VMAs, and throwing a high-profile birthday party for himself in London with Naomi Campbell and Idris Elba among the guests.<br><br>So much has since crumbled, not the least of which is his business empire. Diageo, the beverage brand with which Combs once partnered on vodka and tequila, quickly removed his image from its website, and the partnership broke ties after <a href="https://apnews.com/article/diddy-diageo-tequila-deleon-ciroc-3b554f9d03e007139484a6c7e0cf5bd4">settling a lawsuit</a> over another matter this January. Capital Preparatory Schools, a New York charter school network Combs helped expand, posted a statement on the school’s website last fall saying it was cutting ties with him (though the statement was later removed). Combs also stepped aside as chair of Revolt, a TV network he helped start in 2013, and then officially <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-sell-stake-revolt.html">sold his stake</a> this summer. And Sean John’s website, according to the Daily Beast, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/sean-combs-scandal-fallout-diddys-couture-website-sean-john-has-gone-totally-offline">was taken down</a>.<br><br>According to <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/sean-diddy-combs-dropped-steps-down-lawsuit.html">New York magazine</a>, he also no longer has a dedicated “Sean Diddy Combs Day” in Miami, returned his key to New York City, and had his planned Hulu show iced.<br><br>As for Howard, his alma mater? It returned the million-dollar gift.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">If<strong> Diddy is convicted, how long could he be in prison?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s no guarantee that Combs’s case will go to trial or that he’ll be convicted if he does, so at this point it’s impossible to guess the outcome. But the Department of Justice has issued a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/sean-combs-charged-manhattan-federal-court-sex-trafficking-and-other-federal-offenses">list of the charges</a> against Combs and what each could mean if he’s convicted. Unsurprisingly, the maximum sentences range, with a transportation for purposes of prostitution charge bringing a potential 10-year sentence, and that racketeering conspiracy charge meaning Combs could face life in prison.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most conservatives are as interested in voting for Kamala Harris as they are in eating a bowl of tofu marinated in motor oil.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After all, the Democratic nominee has vowed to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/5/28/18642558/kamala-harris-abortion-voting-rights-act">legalize abortion nationwide</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2024/08/01/kamala-harris-touts-freedom-to-live-safe-from-gun-violence-in-presidential-campaign/">ban assault weapons</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/housing/365063/kamala-harris-housing-rent-control-landlords">regulate prices</a>, and <a href="https://thehill.com/business/budget/4831977-harris-economic-pitch-cost-analysis/">increase federal spending</a>. As Donald Trump — in his own wildly exaggerated fashion — would put it, she <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/07/us-news/trump-says-harris-walz-ticket-will-turn-america-communist-immediately/">wants</a> “this country to go communist immediately, if not sooner.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet, some on the right <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2024/09/04/the-republicans-secretly-rooting-for-a-trump-loss-00177272">are quietly rooting</a> for Trump’s defeat. To this contingent, preventing Trump and JD Vance from remaking conservatism in their image takes precedence over keeping Harris out of the White House.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Their reasoning is simple: Trump has revised GOP orthodoxy, to the detriment of core conservative interest groups. His contempt for NATO and affinity for Vladimir Putin have incensed national security hawks. His enthusiasm for tariffs has dismayed economic libertarians. His gestures of moderation on abortion have dispirited the religious right. And his affection for mobs that threaten to kill Mike Pence has alienated Mike Pence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All this might not amount to a case for Harris were it not for Trump’s running mate. With the notable exception of abortion rights, JD Vance is even more ideologically hostile to traditional conservatism than the GOP nominee is. The Ohio senator <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361417/jd-vance-rnc-trump-vice-president-economy-business">has</a> advocated for (some) labor unions, expansions in social welfare benefits, industrial policy, steep tariffs, stricter antitrust enforcement, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/world/europe/ukraine-jd-vance.html">choking off aid to Ukraine</a>. A Trump victory would make Vance the GOP’s heir apparent, thereby rendering traditional conservatives politically homeless for a decade or more.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A Harris presidency, by contrast, might be a fleeting irritation. Even if the Democratic nominee wins, Republicans are <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/senate/montana-senate/montana-senate-moves-lean-republican-gop-increasingly-favored-win">likely to take the Senate</a>. In that scenario, conservatives could block all of her judicial nominees and partisan legislation, build large congressional majorities in the 2026 midterms, and claw back the presidency two years later.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Summarizing the perspective of unnamed anti-Trump conservatives in his orbit, the right-wing commentator Erick Erickson <a href="https://x.com/EWErickson/status/1829502701643665498">posted on X</a>, “We can hold off Harris for two years and get more reinforcements then fight in 2028 for the White House. If Trump gets in, we set back the pro-life cause and free markets by a generation at least.” Various anonymous Republicans have expressed <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2024/09/04/the-republicans-secretly-rooting-for-a-trump-loss-00177272">similar sentiments to Politico</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such conservatives, though, are at once too optimistic about their ideology’s outlook should Trump lose and too pessimistic about its prospects should he win.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the first count, right-wing purists rooting for Trump’s defeat overrate the contingency of his heresies. Many of Trump’s deviations from conservative orthodoxy derive not from personal whims but rather from political realities that any future GOP nominee would also confront.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the second count, Trump’s hostility to traditional conservative policy goals is often exaggerated. For better or worse, the differences between Trumpism and traditional conservatism are largely ones of degree rather than kind.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A Trump defeat could change the ideological trajectory of American conservatism, but any shift would happen at the margins of Republican thinking. The GOP is all but certain to remain a party of, by, and for reactionary business interests and social conservatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Many of Trump’s deviations from conservative orthodoxy are politically motivated&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Much of what conservative purists disdain about Trump’s ideological positioning has less to do with his personal impulses than the electorate’s preferences. For this reason, it’s plausible that some distinctive aspects of Trumpism will outlive his political career.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This dynamic is clearest on the issues of reproductive rights and entitlement spending. Trump has insisted that questions of abortion policy <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-says-republicans-always-wanted-leave-abortion-law-states-false-rcna147844">should be left to the states</a>, while in-vitro fertilization (IVF) should be <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/12/trump-ivf-gop-roe-abortion-00178760">accessible and publicly subsidized</a> nationwide. The religious right opposes both these stances, as it considers fertilized eggs to be persons entitled to full constitutional rights, and IVF sometimes involves discarding such eggs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump is therefore less aligned with the anti-abortion movement than any Republican nominee in recent memory. In theory, his willingness to defy the Christian right might stem from his personal irreligiosity and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/list-of-donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations">less-than-traditional</a> sexual morality. But then, Trump has run for president twice before and in neither instance did he put so much distance between himself and abortion prohibitionists.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The more likely explanation for Trump’s current posture is that the right’s position on abortion has become much more politically toxic since he last ran for president. The overturning of <em>Roe v. Wade</em> dramatically <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dobbs-abortion-opinion-liability-republicans/">increased the salience </a>of abortion policy while triggering a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/06/24/supreme-court-public-opinion-abortion-00103493">leftward lurch</a> in public opinion on the issue. Following the Supreme Court’s decision, both <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/506759/broader-support-abortion-rights-continues-post-dobbs.aspx">Gallup</a> and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/05/13/broad-public-support-for-legal-abortion-persists-2-years-after-dobbs/">Pew</a> polling found support for abortion rights jumping to its highest point on record. Meanwhile, voters in red states like <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/8/2/23278845/kansas-abortion-vote-constitutional-amendment">Kansas</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ohio-abortion-amendment-election-2023-fe3e06747b616507d8ca21ea26485270">Ohio</a> have backed referendums ensuring abortion’s legality. Many political operatives have argued that the GOP’s vulnerability on reproductive rights <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/11/election-results-who-won-the-midterms-david-shor.html">drove its mediocre</a> showing in the 2022 midterms.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In this context, any Republican nominee would recognize a tension between honoring the Christian right’s demands and maximizing their own odds of victory.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is possible that future GOP nominees may champion federal abortion bans anyway. Some Republican politicians are true believers in fetal personhood and others may see indulging the religious right as indispensable to their primary campaigns. Liam Donovan, a former Republican consultant, told Vox that he believes future GOP candidates would have a harder time defying anti-abortion activists, as Trump’s cult of personality renders him uniquely capable of defying core Republican interest groups. “He singularly has the ability to basically tell the base to pound sand and do whatever he wants,” Donovan said. “Yeah, there might be a marginal penalty, but he has the standing to do that in a way no one else does.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, it is far from certain that Republican triangulation on abortion would end with Trump’s defeat. The incentives for moderation on the issue are only liable to grow stronger, as the less-religious millennial and zoomer generations continue displacing their more socially conservative forebears.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s position on entitlement spending is also dictated by political expediency. An overwhelming majority of Americans oppose reducing Medicare or Social Security benefits. Trump is scarcely the first Republican nominee to bend to the popular will on this subject. In 2012, Mitt Romney <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2012/oct/04/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-cut-716-billion-medicare/">(misleadingly) criticized</a> Barack Obama for cutting Medicare.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Forthrightly championing entitlement cuts isn’t going to get politically easier. As the nation ages, those with a direct stake in sustaining Medicare and Social Security benefits will increase. In the past, Republicans have sought to mitigate blowback to entitlement cuts by maintaining existing benefit levels for current recipients. Yet the modern Republican coalition is disproportionately composed of Americans <a href="https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/1806083570227699784">between the ages of 45 and 64</a> – a group that tends to be highly conscious of entitlement policy and would stand to lose out from any Medicare or Social Security cut that began with the next generation of seniors. Trump losing in November would do nothing to eliminate these political realities. It is therefore unlikely that the GOP’s next nominee would be an unabashed proponent of entitlement reform.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s old-school conservative skeptics have raised few complaints with his militantly nativist positions on immigration. That aspect of Trumpism, though, is likely to endure due to popular demand. Republican <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/immigration-bill-2013-tea-party-093581">primary voters</a> were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/11/us/politics/eric-cantor-loses-gop-primary.html">mobilizing for a more restrictionist party</a> long before Trump launched his first campaign. They are all but certain to reject any future Republican candidate who attempts to revive comprehensive immigration reform.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">It’s unclear whether the GOP’s protectionism, hostility to NATO, and authoritarianism will end with Trump’s political career&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other aspects of Trumpism owe less to political expediency than personal instinct. For this reason, a second Trump loss would give conservative purists a fighting chance to restore their movement’s orthodoxy on certain fronts. Even in such areas, their victory would be far from assured.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump did not become a nationalist skeptic of free trade merely because he wanted to win an election and saw protectionism as politically expedient in 2016. Rather, he has argued <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/trumps-tariff-strategy-can-be-traced-back-to-the-1980s/">since the late 1980s</a> that America’s trade partners were taking advantage of the United States. Likewise, Trump did not embrace <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-proposal-10-percent-1700-cost-per-us-household/">a 10 percent tariff </a>on all foreign imports this year because doing so was necessary to win the Republican primary or general election. The GOP nominee could have appealed to protectionist sentiment in the Midwest through myriad less-extreme policies. The extremity of his avowed hostility to trade is more ideological than pragmatic.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For this reason, a Trump loss in 2024 could clear the way for a less protectionist Republican Party. In any scenario, the GOP is liable to remain more trade-skeptical than it was under Ronald Reagan or George W. Bush. So long as Rust Belt states crown the Electoral College’s winner — and Democrats continue their <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/5/9/23712675/inflation-reduction-act-climate-change-trade-policy-joe-biden-nationalism-china">Biden-era turn toward economic nationalism</a> — Republicans will find it difficult to fully repudiate Trumpian sentiments on trade.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The prospects for a full reset on foreign policy are more favorable. The American public remains too intolerant of US casualties to countenance a return to the imperial misadventures of the Bush era (at least, barring another foreign attack on US soil). But no mass constituency has ever demanded Trump’s idiosyncratic skepticism of NATO or sympathy for various authoritarian strongmen. “Find me a voter that is voting specifically on Trump&#8217;s foreign policy,” Patrick Ruffini, a pollster with the Republican firm Echelon Insights, told Vox. “The fact is that voters like Trump&#8217;s style, his demeanor, his aggression toward what they perceived as encroaching liberal elites,” as opposed to his perspective on US-Russia relations, Ruffini argues</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thus, were voters to repudiate a Trump-Vance ticket, Republicans could plausibly return to conventionally conservative positioning on foreign affairs. This is not guaranteed. If GOP primary voters aren’t passionately opposed to aiding Ukraine, they also aren’t passionately supportive of Ukrainian democracy, either. After a second Trump loss, the Republican nominee in 2028 would likely have leeway to chart their own course on foreign affairs, though of course, that <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/04/12/2023/dont-assume-this-is-donald-trumps-last-run">nominee might well be Donald Trump</a>.&nbsp;(Officially, Trump has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/23/nx-s1-5123345/trump-wont-run-again-2028-election" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no intention</a>&nbsp;of running in 2028 should he lose in 2024, but the Republican nominee is not exactly a man of his word.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps Trumpism’s most alarming innovation is the extremity of its contempt for liberal democratic norms. The GOP standard-bearer has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/05/24/us/politics/trump-election-results-doubt.html">cultivated distrust</a> in the democratic process, attempted to <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23513019/january-6-committee-report-trump-2020-election-insurrection">obstruct the peaceful transfer of power</a> by fomenting an insurrection, declared that the Justice Department’s <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/07/donald-trump-ltat-cest-moi.html">first loyalty</a> should be to the president, encouraged his <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/3/11/11202540/trump-violent">supporters to beat up protesters,</a> and committed myriad other affronts to (small-l) liberal values. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Republican primary voters in some areas eventually came to demand complicity in Trump’s election denialism. Trump, though, did not dispute the legitimacy of the 2020 election because Republican voters agitated for such authoritarian conspiracy theorizing; rather,&nbsp;Republican voters agitated for authoritarian conspiracy theorizing because Trump denied the legitimacy of the 2020 election.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some partisans have always responded to electoral defeat by grumbling about alleged cheating by the other side, but it took presidential leadership to put such paranoia at the very heart of Republican politics.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, Trump has further fueled right-wing contempt for democratic institutions by <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/10/trump-migrant-caravan-robert-bowers-anti-semitism-nazis-tree-of-life-shooting.html">amplifying</a> the <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2024/03/04/donald-trump-rallies-in-richmond-super-tuesday">“great replacement”</a> conspiracy theory: the idea that Democrats are in the process of permanently disenfranchising “real” Americans by creating an artificial majority through unfettered immigration.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Promoting the idea that Republicans’ votes might not count — as the election could be stolen — is not a political imperative for the GOP. If anything, it is counterproductive to the project of winning elections. Thus, should Trump lose in November and retire from politics thereafter, Republicans may nominate someone with an iota of civic responsibility. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is worth noting that Trump’s authoritarianism is not a chief concern for the conservative purists who are secretly rooting for his defeat. There is a small but substantial cohort of Republicans who’ve <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/09/12/alberto-gonzales-kamala-harris-endorsement-00178746">publicly endorsed Harris,</a> on small-d democratic grounds. Among conservative purists who remain actively involved in Republican politics — and are thus only willing to root for Harris in secret — Trump’s appetite for autocracy is not especially disconcerting; neither Erickson nor Politico mentioned Trump’s authoritarianism as a source of concern for this contingent.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That reality, combined with the pre-Trump Republican Party’s forays into <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2012/06/yes-bush-v-gore-did-steal-the-election.html">blocking vote counting</a> and <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/the-gop-war-on-voting-242182/">targeted disenfranchisement</a> — and the fact that much of the conservative media is now invested in election denialist narratives — should temper optimism about its post-Trump posture toward the republic’s bedrock norms.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Trumpism is largely American conservatism with an inhuman face</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is no question that Trump’s ideological positioning is distinct from that of previous GOP standard-bearers. He is more demagogically anti-immigrant, protectionist, putatively moderate on abortion, supportive of entitlement spending, anti-democratic, and hostile toward America’s European allies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet even on many of these fronts, the practical distinctions between Trumpism and conventional conservatism are often exaggerated.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During his first term in office, Trump did impose a <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/29/18117792/trump-china-tariffs-xi-g20-trade-war">variety of tariffs</a> on America’s geopolitical allies and adversaries alike. He also made marginal changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), renamed it, and then gave largely open trade with Canada and Mexico <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/12/10/21004584/usmca-democrats-trump-nafta-trade-deal">his stamp of approval</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a second term, Trump would surely pursue more restrictive trade policies than free-market economists would recommend. Whether he’d actually follow through on imposing a de facto 10 percent sales tax on all imported goods, however, is far from clear. After all, Trump failed to act on <a href="https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-election-2020-global-trade-ap-top-news-iran-nuclear-c9dc524c21c14957abb8d0ac4963a42b">a great many</a> of his more radical campaign pledges during his first stint in the White House.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On reproductive rights, meanwhile, there is little doubt that Trump will continue to appoint anti-abortion judges, perhaps even forging a Supreme Court majority that deems the procedure unconstitutional. During his debate with Harris, Trump pointedly <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-commit-vetoing-national-abortion-ban/story?id=113571781">refused to say</a> that he would veto a national abortion ban were one to reach his desk.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Trump’s noncommittal remarks on that subject indicate, the real obstacle to national abortion restrictions is not Trumpism so much as Congress. To get a ban ready for a Republican president’s signature, the GOP would need to find either 60 votes in the Senate or 51 votes for abolishing the legislative filibuster and restricting abortion nationwide. The party is unlikely to find either in the near term. As Ohio’s and Kansas’s recent abortion referendums made clear, the religious right’s views are unpopular even in solidly red states. Plenty of Republican senators would prefer to dodge a vote on an issue that cleaves their base from the median voter; the filibuster gives them cover to avoid such a vote. Abortion prohibitionists who believe Trump is the one thing standing between them and total victory have fallen prey to wishful thinking.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Likewise, the obstacle to entitlement cuts is that idea’s political toxicity, not Donald Trump’s unshakeable commitment to seniors’ welfare. What Republicans need to cut Medicare and Social Security is not a more conventionally conservative standard-bearer but a forcing mechanism. Trump’s fiscal priorities would help provide them with precisely this. The Republican nominee is committed to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/370753/taxes-debate-trump-harris-irs-tariffs-child-tax-credit">slashing federal revenue</a> across the board and has repeatedly flirted with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump-mulls-middle-class-tax-cut-he-eyes-return-office-2024-04-17/">payroll tax cuts</a> that would gut funding for Social Security and Medicare. These measures would expedite the programs’ insolvency.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Republicans control Congress when the conflict between avoiding all tax increases and sustaining entitlement benefits becomes irreconcilable, they will be liable to cut the latter, no matter how “Trumpist” the party remains.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, during his first term, Trump’s rhetoric about foreign affairs was decidedly more heterodox than his policies. This gap was especially pronounced on matters concerning Russia. For all Trump’s expressions of affection for Putin, during his tenure, the United States <a href="https://www.cato.org/commentary/myth-trumps-soft-russia-policy">assented</a> to NATO enlargement, armed the Ukrainian military, and bombed Syria, a Russian client state. His administration still made some <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/17/politics/trump-soft-on-russia/index.html">deferential gestures</a> toward Moscow, and it’s plausible that a second Trump administration would chart a more unconventional course on foreign affairs. But whether Trumpism constitutes a drastic break from traditional conservative foreign policy in practice (rather than rhetoric) remains unclear.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is true that JD Vance’s policy positions diverge from conservative orthodoxy <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361417/jd-vance-rnc-trump-vice-president-economy-business">much more significantly</a> than Trump’s. Were Vance to inherit leadership of the party following a second Trump administration, that could plausibly change the Republican Party’s economic and foreign policy positioning, at least marginally. And yet, given how radically (and, arguably, opportunistically) Vance has revised his views since 2017, it’s far from clear that he would stick by more heretical populist ideas if they became an impediment to his political ambitions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, American conservatism’s precise trajectory in the event of a Trump defeat or victory cannot be known. In any event, its core commitments are likely to remain the same. It is, and (almost certainly) will be, an ideology dedicated to maximizing the after-tax income of the wealthy, restricting immigration, and advancing as much social conservatism as an increasingly secular electorate will allow (in part, by outsourcing social policy to a democratically unaccountable judiciary). Whatever else Trumpism does and does not entail, these objectives give doctrinaire conservatives cause for supporting the Republican nominee — and everyone else reason to hope for his defeat.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Donald Trump is <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-female-women-voters-poll-presidential-election-2024-1892087">struggling</a> with female voters and occasionally acts like he knows it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With the November election fast approaching, Republican political consultants have been bemoaning the fact that their presidential candidate continues to publicly boast about overturning <em>Roe v.</em> <em>Wade </em>— something a majority of Americans oppose. Trump’s <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jd-vance-advocated-abortion-illegal-nationally_n_66984d11e4b076f190eb37a1">openly anti-abortion</a> pick for vice president, JD Vance, also continues to attract attention for his <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/j-d-vance-childless-cat-lady-comments-explained.html">deeply unpopular insults</a> of women who don’t have biological children.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These dynamics are exacerbated by the fact that the economy — typically Republicans’ strongest issue — continues to improve; the Fed recently <a href="https://www.vox.com/economy/372384/interest-rate-home-price-real-estate-mortgage-fed-decision">cut interest rates</a> and inflation has fallen to its <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/11/nx-s1-5108607/inflation-consumer-prices-economy-interest-rates">lowest point in three and a half years</a>, with <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/economy/gas-prices-are-plunging-and-its-bigger-news-than-you-think">gas</a> and <a href="https://www.wptv.com/money/online-grocery-prices-plunge-3-7-in-august" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.wptv.com/money/online-grocery-prices-plunge-3-7-in-august">grocery prices</a> plunging.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To help improve his chances, Trump has been trying to dispel fears. At the September presidential debate, when asked if he would veto a national abortion ban, Trump repeatedly dodged the question, insisting it wouldn’t be necessary since abortion rights are now under state control. This is only half-true: Trump is right that he’s unlikely to face a national abortion ban from Congress in the next four years.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But most anti-abortion leaders weren’t counting on that, anyway. The anti-abortion movement has been banking on more appointments of friendly federal judges and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tz2BUuzTmE">taking control of key federal agencies</a> that could use executive power to heavily restrict reproductive freedom.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We don’t need a federal abortion ban when we have Comstock on the books,” Jonathan Mitchell, the legal architect <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/8/31/22650303/supreme-court-abortion-texas-sb8-jackson-roe-wade-greg-abbott">behind a 2021 law in Texas</a> that effectively banned abortion, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/17/us/politics/trump-allies-abortion-restrictions.html">told the New York Times</a> earlier this year. Mitchell was referring to <a href="https://www.vox.com/abortion/351678/the-comstock-act-the-long-dead-law-trump-could-use-to-ban-abortion-explained">the Comstock Act</a>, an 1873 federal law that could prohibit anything associated with abortion from being sent in the mail. Such a ban could mean not only restricting abortion medication, the most common method used to end a pregnancy in the US, but also any medical equipment used during surgical abortion, like speculums, suction catheters, and dilators.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Comstock Act was rendered moot by <em>Roe v. Wade </em>in the 1970s but never formally repealed, and now, with <em>Roe </em>gone, some conservatives, including Mitchell <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/07/17/jd-vance-abortion-comstock-vice-presidential-nominee/">and JD Vance</a>, are pushing for its revival. “I hope [Trump] doesn’t know about the existence of Comstock, because I just don’t want him to shoot off his mouth,” Mitchell added, urging anti-abortion groups to also “keep their mouths shut as much as possible until the election.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Things seemed to be mostly going according to Mitchell’s plan, with Trump avoiding <a href="https://x.com/rmc031/status/1803766942395728067">answering reporters’ Comstock Act questions</a> and publicly insisting abortion was now a state duty. That is, until August, when Trump — seemingly more nervous about his election chances — <a href="https://x.com/TrumpDailyPosts/status/1827007862830452738">announced on Truth Social</a> that his administration would be “great for women and their reproductive rights.” He also <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/20/trump-comstock-enforcement-00175068">finally told the media</a> he would not use the Comstock Act to ban mailing abortion drugs, and on top of that, announced his administration would mandate health insurance companies <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/29/politics/trump-ivf-treatment-proposal/index.html">cover the hefty cost of in vitro fertilization (IVF</a>).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s new stances have not been clarifying or convincing enough for most voters — indeed, on the heels of him promising free IVF, he said he thought Florida’s six-week ban was too strict, and then announced he’d be voting against Florida’s <a href="https://floridiansprotectingfreedom.com/">proposed abortion rights ballot measure</a> in November. That measure would legalize abortion up to viability to protect the patient’s health, as decided by their provider, and polls show <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4864846-florida-abortion-ballot-measure-poll/">most Floridians</a> back it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, Trump’s new rhetoric of (somewhat, sometimes) embracing reproductive rights has antagonized parts of his conservative base, who feel he’s taking the anti-abortion movement for granted and that he’s having his “<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/biden-clinton-sister-soulja-moment.html">Sister Souljah moment</a>” with the segment of the electorate that helped deliver his victory in 2016. The immediate question is whether these conservatives will sit out in protest in November, and if they do, whether Trump can make up for it by drawing in more voters elsewhere. The larger, more enduring question is whether this portends an emerging split in the Republican coalition on the question of abortion, just a couple of years removed from the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/6/24/23181720/supreme-court-dobbs-jackson-womens-health-samuel-alito-roe-wade-abortion-marriage-contraception" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vox.com/2022/6/24/23181720/supreme-court-dobbs-jackson-womens-health-samuel-alito-roe-wade-abortion-marriage-contraception">anti-abortion faction’s greatest victory.</a></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Trump’s IVF announcement is causing problems with parts of his religious base</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While opposition to abortion has been a fragile part of the GOP coalition for years, IVF emerged this year as a new point of tension among conservatives.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After Trump announced in late August that he’d back free IVF, anti-abortion groups immediately urged him to retract his stance. At first glance, it may seem puzzling that a faction of voters who identify as “pro-life” would oppose technology that helps people with infertility become parents. About <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/21/health/ivf-egg-freezing-explainer-wellness/index.html">2 percent</a> of births in the US are done through IVF, which involves fertilizing eggs outside of the body and then transferring embryos to a womb.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the opposition makes more sense when IVF is understood as conflicting with “<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/24090347/alabama-ivf-ruling-fetal-personhood-abortion-embryos">fetal personhood</a>” — a core goal of a faction within the anti-abortion movement that seeks to grant fetuses (and embryos) full human rights and legal protections.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Human embryos are created and discarded or frozen by dozens in most IVF procedures,” Matthew Yonke, a spokesperson for the Pro-Life Action League, told me. “It’s no way to treat human beings, and the federal government should not subsidize it.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">(Louisiana remains the only state to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/03/03/louisiana-ivf-embryos-law-alabama/">outright prohibit</a> the destruction of embryos, requiring patients to either pay forever to store their unused embryos, or donate them to a married couple. Most states allow patients to decide what to do with any excess genetic material.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some social conservatives also lament that contemporary IVF treats parenthood <a href="https://www.compactmag.com/article/trump-should-make-birth-not-ivf-free/">like an individual right</a> instead of a responsibility or privilege for committed couples, and others object to the ethical implications of <a href="https://www.deseret.com/opinion/2024/08/21/ivf-sex-selection-girls-boys/">sex selection</a> and optimizing for certain characteristics, such as eye color or intelligence.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ever since February, when Alabama’s Supreme Court issued its <a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2024/02/19/alabama-supreme-court-ruling-could-end-ivf-treatments-in-state/">unprecedented legal decision</a> that invoked God to claim frozen embryos count as “children” under state law, policymakers and prospective parents have been realizing how vulnerable IVF is in the United States, even as politicians scramble to assure voters it’s not actually at risk.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For religious conservatives who oppose IVF, the last seven months have provided a fresh opportunity <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/03/in-vitro-fertilization-alabama-abortion/677695/">to make their case against</a> the assisted reproductive technology. In some states they’ve made political gains: the North Carolina Republican Party adopted a platform in June that <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/06/north-carolinas-gop-opposes-embryo-destruction-that-could-threaten-ivf/">opposes the destruction</a> of human embryos. Also in June, the Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant denomination in the US, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/southern-baptist-convention-opposition-ivf-faithful-women-options-rcna156994">approved a resolution</a> against IVF.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Anti-abortion leaders are prepared to fight for their long-term goal of fetal personhood, just as they did for decades to overturn <em>Roe v.</em> <em>Wade. </em>In many ways, these new IVF battles are just beginning: This past spring, a supermajority of justices on Florida’s Supreme Court <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/4578252-florida-supreme-court-signals-readiness-to-rule-for-pre-born-personhood/">signaled openness</a> to a future fetal personhood challenge, suggesting that “pre-born children” are “persons” entitled to the right to life under the Florida Constitution. Regardless of whether Trump wins in November, these fights over reproductive technology will continue to embroil conservatives and the Republican Party.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fiscal conservatives are getting ticked off, too</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not just the ethics of IVF that are causing fissures — Trump’s promise that the government would foot the bill has also sparked concern among conservative budget hawks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The average out-of-pocket cost per IVF cycle stands at $24,000, according to a <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/03/13/fact-sheet-in-vitro-fertilization-ivf-use-across-united-states.html">federal fact sheet,</a> or $61,000 in total per successful live birth, since people often need multiple IVF cycles. While Trump’s team has refused to provide any financing details for his plan, some experts believe it would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/health/trump-free-ivf-treatment.html">require significant new Congressional spending</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ira Stoll, a prominent conservative columnist, tried to make t<a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/the-conservative-case-for-trumps-ivf-policy-73a24427" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/the-conservative-case-for-trumps-ivf-policy-73a24427">he fiscally conservative case</a> for Trump’s IVF policy in the Wall Street Journal.<em> </em>He argued the proposal would be less expensive than it seems <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/363543/pronatalism-vance-birth-rates-population-decline-fertility">since the costs of low birth rates</a> “far outweigh the costs” of adding IVF to insurance companies. “The roughly $15,000 price of an IVF procedure is nothing compared with the priceless potential of an individual human being,” Stoll added, though existing research suggests IVF would not <a href="https://ifstudies.org/blog/mandating-insurance-coverage-for-ivf-will-not-boost-fertility">significantly increase the birth rate</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, for most conservatives concerned with federal spending and rising deficits, the government mandating taxpayer-funded IVF treatment feels like a bad joke. National Review editor Philip Klein argued that the expensive Trump proposal would amount to a <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/trumps-ivf-proposal-would-expand-obamacare/">significant expansion of Obamacare</a> and drive up health insurance premiums for all.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance Ginn, the chief economist at the Office of Management and Budget during the Trump administration, came out to blast the IVF proposal. “I’m for IVF, as we’ve used it for two of our beautiful kids, but nothing is ‘free,’” <a href="https://x.com/VanceGinn/status/1829262107873083697">he wrote on X</a>. “Can we stop handing out things to win votes like it’s candy when we’re running $2T[rillion] deficits and not abiding by the limited roles outlined in the US Constitution?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fiscal conservatives in Congress have also been concerned. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/02/us-news/sen-lindsey-graham-rejects-trumps-free-ivf-plan-theres-no-end-to-that/">rejected the free IVF proposal on ABC News</a>, saying there would be “no end” to its cost. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/donald-trump-plan-mandate-free-ivf-republicans-congress-opposition-rcna170327">was more restrained with NBC News</a>. “I’m a little bit hesitant on an insurance mandate. Is there some other way that we could incent[ivize] these sort of coverages through the private sector?” he asked. “We got a lot of things we’ve got to pay for next year by extending the tax provisions.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) opted to be less diplomatic, calling the idea “ridiculous.” The “government has no money,” he said. “We’re $2 trillion in the hole, so I’m not for asking the taxpayer to pay for it.”<br><br>Even before his promises for free IVF, fiscal conservatives were growing increasingly frustrated with Trump, as he’s been <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/federal-debt-deficit-trump-harris-5a0d30d2">virtually silent</a> on the mounting federal debt, and issuing new campaign pledges like ending <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-unveils-new-no-tax-on-overtime-pay-policy-in-arizona-remarks/">taxes on overtime pay</a> and<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/14/trumps-plan-to-end-taxes-on-social-security-a-fatal-mistake-lawmaker.html"> Social Security benefits</a>, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/366680/no-tax-on-tips-trump-harris-subminimum-wage">exempting tips from taxes</a>. Trump’s disregard for deficit spending could turn off some of these budget hawks in November, too.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Will social conservatives stick with Republicans in the future? And will that even matter?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Evangelical voters were a critical part of Trump’s path to victory in 2016, and his campaign in 2020, and most political strategists say he’ll need to earn at least 80 percent of white evangelicals nationally to win in November.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A recent Fox News poll showed him at <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/08/Fox_August-9-12-2024_National_Cross-Tabs_August-14-Release.pdf">75 percent</a> with this group, a number that could sink lower given his recent flip-flops. Al Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, has been warning — in recent op-eds, speeches, and podcast interviews — that the Republican Party is making a huge mistake by potentially motivating religious voters to stay home. Mohler has been urging Trump <a href="https://wng.org/opinions/trump-and-abortion-1725360004">to clarify how he’ll restrict abortion</a> in the Oval Office, just as Trump promised evangelicals before that he would work to overturn <em>Roe v.</em> <em>Wade </em>if elected.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tony Perkins, president of the right-wing Family Research Council, has been making a similar argument that Trump needs to give religious voters something to be genuinely excited about. “It’s just on the margins, but it’s the difference in many elections,” <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/05/white-evangelicals-trump-abortion-00177595">Perkins argued</a> in Politico.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For now there’s no clear survey evidence on whether Evangelicals really are planning to stay home in November, though Lila Rose, a prominent anti-abortion activist, has been <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/08/29/lila-rose-abortion-trump-interview-00176619">urging her followers</a> to withhold their votes unless Trump changes his tune. But Mohler, for his part, said he’s likely to stick with Trump in November because he trusts that Trump will ultimately stack his administration with anti-abortion leaders, regardless of what he says on the campaign trail.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I have a high degree of confidence that a lot of people in crucial roles in a Trump administration would reflect that pro-life sentiment,” he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/podcasts/trump-evangelicals-abortion.html?showTranscript=1">told the New York Times</a>. “I believe the opposite about a Kamala Harris administration … I have to look at a longer-term strategy. And I think the most responsible pro-life figures in the United States think similarly.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">IVF in particular is popular in the US, with <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/05/13/americans-overwhelmingly-say-access-to-ivf-is-a-good-thing/">70 percent of adults</a> supporting access to the treatment. Even among Christian and Republican voters, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/05/13/americans-overwhelmingly-say-access-to-ivf-is-a-good-thing/">clear majorities believe</a> IVF access is a good thing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s why, even as Republican lawmakers <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-democrats-dare-republicans-vote-ivf-bill/story?id=113759214">continue to vote against</a> federal bills to protect access to IVF, they have been publicly stressing their support for the technology. Pennsylvania’s Republican Senate candidate Dave McCormick is running <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/dave-mccormick-pa-senate-race-family-policies-20240626.html">on a $15,000 tax credit</a> for fertility treatment, and in September, a conservative super PAC started <a href="https://winningforwomen.com/winning-for-women-launches-pro-ivf-ad-campaign-in-two-critical-house-districts/">funding a major ad campaign</a> in support of IVF.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Public backing for abortion rights also continues to loom over Trump and the Republican Party; polls show voters <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/May-2-Release-FINAL.pdf">have grown</a> <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NPR_PBS-News-Hour_Marist-Poll_USA-NOS-and-Tables_0426_202304211458.pdf">even more supportive</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/support-for-legalized-abortion-grows-since-dobbs-ruling-wsj-poll-shows-11662210020">of abortion rights</a> than they were before the Supreme Court overturned <em>Roe</em>. Among women in particular, many say abortion rights are their top issue this November. A recent New York Times poll found that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/31/us/elections/abortion-polls-women-trump-harris.html">for women under 45</a>, abortion is even more important to them than the economy. Another poll by Galvanize Action showed <a href="https://playbook.galvanizeaction.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/August-2024-Reproductive-Freedom-Survey.pdf">that 82 percent of white moderate women</a> specifically plan to factor in a candidate’s stance on abortion when voting.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether this late-stage gamble by Trump to send mixed messages on reproductive rights pays off is anyone’s guess, but even if it does, the internal fights within the GOP coalition will likely remain — unresolved, festering, and ready to resurface after November. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mark Robinson, the embattled Republican nominee for governor in North Carolina, wrote many troubling things during his days as a poster on <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/19/politics/kfile-mark-robinson-black-nazi-pro-slavery-porn-forum">the porn forum Nude Africa</a>. But one Robinson comment sticks out as especially confusing: “I’m a black NAZI!”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The notion of a Black man expressing fealty to a movement premised on his inferiority feels absurd, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HcQ87RFN5k"><em>Chappelle’s Show</em> sketch</a> come to life. Yet the absurdity points to something real. As strange as it seems, there’s a disturbing number of Black and Latino Americans who hold extreme right beliefs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Two of the most prominent antisemitic voices in the country today, <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23519717/antisemitism-hatred-jews-violence">Kanye West</a> and <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/candace-owens">Candace Owens</a>, are Black Trump supporters. <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23484314/trump-fuentes-ye-dinner-white-nationalism-supremacy">Nick Fuentes</a>, the white supremacist who dined with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in 2022, is of Mexican descent. Enrique Tarrio, the Proud Boys leader <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/proud-boys-leader-sentenced-22-years-prison-seditious-conspiracy-and-other-charges">sentenced to 22 years in prison</a> for his role in the January 6 riot, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/19/opinion/enrique-tarrio-proud-boys-latinos-racism.html">is Afro-Cuban</a>. Mauricio Garcia, a Hispanic mass shooter who <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/05/07/1174631515/a-mass-shooting-at-an-outlet-mall-in-dallas-left-at-least-9-dead-7-injured">killed eight people</a> at a Dallas-area shopping center in 2023, had <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2023/6/2/why-white-supremacists-are-not-always-white">posted neo-Nazi rhetoric on his social media pages</a> before his attack.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Academic research suggests these are not merely a handful of cherry-picked examples. There are non-trivial numbers of right-wing Black and Latino people who express extreme right-wing ideas — up to and including outright bigotry.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2022, two academics —&nbsp;Eitan Hirsh and Laura Royden — <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/10659129221111081">published the results</a> of a massive national survey on the prevalence of antisemitic beliefs in the United States. Their study found that antisemitic attitudes were significantly more common on the right than on the left. But it also found notable racial divides between right-wingers, with <a href="https://www.eitanhersh.com/uploads/7/9/7/5/7975685/minority_antisem_v3.1.pdf">Black and Latino conservatives being about 20 percentage points more likely</a> to express antisemitic ideas than their white conservative peers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Recent studies have also found that, among Latinos, political conservatism predicts <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/8B9730B52C23226D306A6096E0BCB4A8/S0003055422000545a.pdf/div-class-title-prejudiced-when-climbing-up-or-when-falling-down-why-some-people-of-color-express-anti-black-racism-div.pdf">higher levels of racial resentment toward Black</a> people and <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/du-bois-review-social-science-research-on-race/article/abs/hispanics-para-trump/BF09A48E9470FDFEDBF0C7EA0DBA2696">greater skepticism about the role of racism</a> in the ongoing social marginalization of Black people. Another <a href="https://academic.oup.com/poq/article-abstract/84/4/860/6205964">recent study</a> found that Latino conservatives express higher rates of hostility toward undocumented immigrants than their liberal or moderate peers, as well as higher support for lowering legal immigration rates.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A separate study of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0739986315604424">white and Black Americans found</a> that, in both groups, “prejudicial attitudes toward Latinos … are the most consistently significant factors in shaping opinions about the number of immigrants to admit and the consequences of immigration.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of this is to say that most nonwhite conservatives are bigoted, or that racial minorities are more likely to hold bigoted attitudes in general than white Americans. All of the available research confirms common sense: that white people are by far more likely to be white supremacists. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But this evidence also suggests that certain things that seem like common sense —&nbsp;that Black people like Mark Robinson can’t be Nazis by definition — simply don’t match reality. Bizarre as it seems, given traditional extreme-right attitudes toward racial minorities, there are high-profile Black and Latino Americans who hold bigoted and extreme beliefs — and a small but notable percentage of the general population in both groups who agree with them. (Though Robinson denies writing the Nazi post, an overwhelming amount of evidence points to him as the author.)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Understanding nonwhite extremism</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So how do we make sense of this phenomenon?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One theory is that a lot of this is rooted in ideas about Americanness. Hostility toward other minority groups is, for some Black and Latino people, a way of solidifying their own place in the country — of distinguishing themselves as good Americans from the bad Other.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Journalist Paola Ramos suggests such an explanation in her just-released book <em><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/741645/defectors-by-paola-ramos/">Defectors: The Rise of the Latino Far Right and What It Means for America</a></em>. After spending a day with Pedro Antonio Aguero, a far-right activist who obsessively patrols the Southern border looking for undocumented migrants, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/09/latino-border-vigilante-pedro-antonio-aguero/679969/">Ramos writes</a>, “I got the feeling that by hunting them, he was distancing himself from them, and from his own foreignness.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some academic research points to similar conclusions. <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/8B9730B52C23226D306A6096E0BCB4A8/S0003055422000545a.pdf/div-class-title-prejudiced-when-climbing-up-or-when-falling-down-why-some-people-of-color-express-anti-black-racism-div.pdf">One experiment</a> presented Latino respondents with written materials downplaying Latino status in America. Some respondents saw a news story suggesting Latino people were doing poorly in the United States on metrics like educational attainment; others saw the same story with an additional line comparing Latino and Black outcomes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Individuals who saw the comparison story expressed notably higher negative attitudes toward Black people afterward —&nbsp;with the spike interestingly concentrated among <em>liberal</em> Latinos (who were less biased than conservatives before exposure but equally biased afterward). This, the academics theorized, is because conservative Latinos already cared a great deal about their Americanness, and so had already factored that sense of status threat into their overall worldview.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In her book <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/american-while-black-9780190053550"><em>American While Black</em></a><em>,</em> the University of Maryland’s Niambi Carter argues Black skepticism about immigration is rooted in fear that “whites may favor immigrants over black people in hiring decisions, housing, and other social interactions.” It is, she writes, a “conflicted nativism” born out of Black insecurity in their own standing and social status as Americans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But this is just one theory, and one that doesn’t explain all the facts. Some things, like the unusually high rates of antisemitism among Black and Latino conservatives, are a bit harder to fit into the script.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In their paper on race and antisemitism, Hersh and Royden conclude that “the roots of antisemitic attitudes among minority groups are broad rather than narrow and are not well-explained by commonly proposed theories.” Basically, they say, no one really knows why it seems that antisemitism is disturbingly popular in those groups.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In general, this is a subject that calls for caution. The phenomenon of extreme-right politics is fairly new, or at least is only newly documented. As something we’re just beginning to grapple with, we can’t really say for sure <em>why</em> it’s happening. Social science and journalism are hard work, and we don’t have enough of either on this topic.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The one thing we can say for sure is that Mark Robinson calling himself a “black NAZI” is outlandish — but not as outlandish as it might seem. There are more people like him, and they will play a role in defining the American right’s future.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A 55-year-old Missouri man — who maintained he was innocent — was executed Tuesday evening, and became the latest of several <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/1/25/24050932/alabama-nitrogen-gas-execution-death-penalty">recent people put to death</a> who have renewed scrutiny of the death penalty. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2001, Marcellus Williams was convicted of the 1998 killing of social worker and former St. Louis Post-Dispatch reporter Felicia “Lisha” Gayle, and sentenced to death. Since his sentencing, questions have been raised about how evidence in the case was handled and whether jury selection for his trial was fair.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given these concerns, and Williams’s continued claims that he did not kill Gayle, he and St. Louis prosecuting attorney Wesley Bell called for the state to <a href="https://innocenceproject.org/court-denies-prosecutors-motion-to-vacate-marcellus-williams-conviction-and-death-sentence/" data-type="link" data-id="https://innocenceproject.org/court-denies-prosecutors-motion-to-vacate-marcellus-williams-conviction-and-death-sentence/">vacate his conviction</a>. While his execution was previously delayed twice before, the Missouri governor and state Supreme Court have declined to do so again this past week, and he was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/24/us/marcellus-williams-scheduled-execution-date/index.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/24/us/marcellus-williams-scheduled-execution-date/index.html">killed by lethal injection</a> Tuesday. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The outstanding uncertainty in Williams’s case — and the fact that he was put to death anyway<strong> —</strong> have put a new spotlight on capital punishment<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.aclu.org/documents/case-against-death-penalty">and many problems that have been cited with it</a>. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the new developments in Williams’s case?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Williams was convicted for Gayle’s murder based on the testimony of two witnesses, including his girlfriend at the time, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/missouri-execution-marcellus-williams-supreme-court-de47c99e00bb620db9db702f5f7e2ee8">who said she saw</a> the victim’s purse and laptop in his car. Williams was incarcerated at the time of his conviction in the Gayle case, and his then-cellmate Henry Cole also claimed that Williams had admitted to the killing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Williams’s counsel argues that both witnesses had other motives for singling him out, including “reward money and a bargain for shorter sentences in their own criminal cases,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/24/marcellus-williams-execution-missouri-faq/">according to the Washington Post.</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/09/23/missouri-execution-marcellus-williams-death-row/75194051007/">As USA Today notes</a>, there wasn’t forensic evidence linking Williams to the crime, and <a href="https://capitalbnews.org/missouri-marcellus-williams-death-row-dna-evidence/">his DNA was not found on the murder weapon</a> — a knife.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since his conviction, Williams’s counsel has called for greater investigation of the DNA that was on the knife, as well as a review of racial bias in the jury selection process. <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/missouri-set-to-execute-marcellus-williams-despite-pleas-from-victims-fam-and-prosecutors">Gayle’s family has also backed clemency</a> and the possibility of a life sentence without parole.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Previously, Williams’s counsel convinced former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens that new testing of the DNA evidence, which included DNA from another man, had the potential to exonerate him. That led Greitens to grant a stay of execution in 2017 and to convene a panel to investigate this evidence.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Attorneys have since learned, though, that the knife had fingerprints and DNA from a prosecutor who had touched the murder weapon without wearing gloves, contaminating the evidence.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Williams’s allies have also argued he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/missouri-execution-marcellus-williams-supreme-court-de47c99e00bb620db9db702f5f7e2ee8">faced racial bias in his trial</a> after a former prosecutor said he removed a Black juror because of his resemblance to Williams. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Williams’s attorneys called on the US Supreme Court to grant a stay of the execution due to this evidence of bias. The Court did not do so. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Missouri Supreme Court also declined to grant a stay, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/lawyers-seek-supreme-court-intervention-hours-missouri-inmates-113961065#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDespite%20nearly%20a%20quarter%20century,Court%20Judge%20Zel%20Fischer%20wrote." data-type="link" data-id="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/lawyers-seek-supreme-court-intervention-hours-missouri-inmates-113961065#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDespite%20nearly%20a%20quarter%20century,Court%20Judge%20Zel%20Fischer%20wrote.">with Judge Zel Fischer citing</a> “no credible evidence of actual innocence or any showing of a constitutional error undermining confidence in the original judgment.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What concerns does this raise about capital punishment?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The use of capital punishment has waned in recent years as concerns about how <a href="https://www.aclu.org/documents/death-penalty-questions-and-answers#:~:text=Q%3A%20Doesn%E2%80%99t%20the%20Death,than%20states%20without%20such%20laws.">well it works as a deterrent</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/1/25/24050932/alabama-nitrogen-gas-execution-death-penalty">how humane it is, and racial disparities in death sentences</a> have grown. <a href="https://www.nacdl.org/Content/Race-and-the-Death-Penalty">According to one 2016 study</a> in Washington State, Black defendants are four times more likely to be sentenced to death than non-Black defendants in similar circumstances.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although 27 states still allow the death penalty, 14 of those have not conducted any executions in the past 10 years, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/06/us/us-executions-death-penalty-dg/index.html">according to CNN</a>. Executions have also dwindled since 1999, which marked a recent high when nearly 100 people were killed. In 2023, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/06/us/us-executions-death-penalty-dg/index.html">24 people were executed across five states</a>; currently, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/09/23/missouri-execution-marcellus-williams-death-row/75194051007/">24 people are expected to be executed this year</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Among the concerns raised by executions is the fear that innocent people could face these sentences. Williams’s team has been adamant that his case is an example of this issue. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Missouri is poised to execute an innocent man, an outcome that calls into question the legitimacy of the entire criminal justice system,” Tricia Bushnell, a Midwest Innocence Project attorney representing Williams, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bEqZFYntcV03ld6Lf_Rjf9v2q8tJzqLB/edit">said in a statement</a> before the execution. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/policy-issues/innocence">According to the Death Penalty Information Center,</a> at least 200 people who were wrongly convicted and sentenced to death have been exonerated since 1973. <a href="https://innocenceproject.org/innocence-and-the-death-penalty/">And per a 2014 study estimate</a>, roughly 4 percent of the people sentenced to death are innocent.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Update, September 25, 10 am: </em></strong><em>This piece, originally published on September 24, has been updated to reflect Williams’s execution.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the world of neuroscience research, the mouse reigns supreme: <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/how-many-mice-and-rats-are-used-us-labs-controversial-study-says-more-100-million">in the US alone, tens of millions of mice</a> are <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/370457/animal-testing-science-medicine-vaccines-cruelty-free">studied</a> as a proxy for the human brain in labs. They’re small, they breed quickly, and they’re relatively easy to genetically manipulate, making mice ubiquitous in biomedical science. When studying something fundamental to biology, like how individual cells work, the leap from mouse to human doesn’t feel egregious. But when mice are used to study distinctly human conditions like autism, the parallels start to break down.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fifteen years ago, researchers <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/mouse-models-for-autism-debut/">introduced the first two mouse models of autism</a>, each carrying a genetic mutation linked to autism in humans. They claimed that these mice behaved like autistic humans, unusually preferring solitude over meeting new mice, and squeaking only around half as often as their non-autistic littermates.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Their results made major waves, inspiring researchers to experiment with other autism-related genes. Since the late 2000s, neuroscientists <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9189007/">have bred over 20 types of mouse models</a> with motor problems, sensory sensitivities, and repetitive behaviors. These each capture some hallmark of human autism — provided you buy that a mouse burying marbles is the same as, for example, an autistic child insisting on eating the same food every day.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a freshly minted PhD working at the National Institute of Mental Health in the late 2000s, Jill Silverman <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/why-studying-autism-in-mice-may-be-doomed-to-fail/">ran experiments</a> on mice missing part of their <a href="https://gene.sfari.org/database/human-gene/SHANK3">SHANK3<em> </em>gene</a>, a mutation found in about 1 in 100 autistic people. These SHANK3 mice seemed to show “autistic-like behaviors” like social discomfort and compulsive grooming, similar to the repetitive body movements, or <a href="https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/what-you-need-to-know-about-stimming-and-autism">stimming</a>, seen in some humans with autism.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Silverman, now a principal investigator at the <a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/mind-institute/">UC Davis Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders (MIND) Institute</a>, still gets compliments on these mice — even though many of her original findings couldn’t be reproduced in future experiments. While she still works with laboratory mice and stressed their importance in understanding co-morbidities and rare genetic disorders tied to the condition, she noted that how “disrupted brain development manifests in a mouse is never going to be autism, because autism is uniquely human.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But when people praise her earlier research on autism-like behavior in mice, “I’m like, that is the biggest mistake this field has ever made,” she said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Billions of dollars have been poured into autism research over the last decade, funding a staggering number of experiments — including over 1,500 studies in the US <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED647174.pdf">in 2020 alone</a>. Many of these studies use animal models, especially mice.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether you believe that animal testing <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/7/14/23794186/animal-testing-experiments-vivisection-academic-fraud-dishonesty-research">is ethical (many don’t)</a>, scientists in numerous research fields — especially neuroscience, genetics, and other areas of biology — <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/370457/animal-testing-science-medicine-vaccines-cruelty-free">run experiments on animals</a>. To understand how cells in the brain communicate to form thoughts and guide behavior, you need a living brain connected to a living body. Millions of rodents are used — and nearly all killed — for science experiments every year, many of which are preclinical tests of new drugs and other treatments with potential public health benefits, including for autism.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While mouse models have helped us understand how neural connections develop over time, and how they may be affected by autism, they haven’t led to the pharmaceutical treatments many researchers are looking for. So far, all attempts to make drugs that help people manage some of the more challenging effects of autism, like sensory sensitivity or self-harm, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10062405/">have failed</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When I asked senior scientist <a href="https://www.sfari.org/people/brigitta-gundersen/">Brigitta Gundersen</a>, who manages Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (<a href="https://www.sfari.org/">SFARI</a>) funding for autism studies <a href="https://www.sfari.org/resource/autism-rat-consortium/">involving rodents</a>, for an example of a tangible quality of life improvement that this line of research has given us, she paused. “I struggle to think of examples across all of psychiatry, frankly.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In theory, figuring out how autism manifests in the brain and body should help scientists develop better treatments for some of its more debilitating symptoms, like seizures, mobility challenges, and self-harm. Given how much we still have to learn about how the brain works, autistic or otherwise, this kind of research is “a really long game,” Gundersen said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There’s this overall idea that understanding biology and understanding mechanisms will lead to better interventions,” she said. Studying biological systems for the sake of understanding them led to advances in medicine we often take for granted today, like chemotherapy. But the brain the most complicated tissue in the body — so far, at least, the search for medications that effectively treat psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders “hasn’t totally panned out.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mouse models of autism-related gene mutations may help uncover the underlying biology of autism in the long run. But autistic people understandably want tangible support now, and research serving that need is hugely underfunded. “It barely matters to us what a mouse model says,” said Sam Crane, an advocate for people with disabilities and a public member of the federal <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/">Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee</a> (IACC), a group that helps policymakers decide what types of autism research to pay for.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Others, including the parents of autistic children with very high support needs, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/11/18/profound-autism-labels-neurodiversity/">fear that deprioritizing biological research will leave their loved ones behind</a>, turning attention away from developing potentially lifesaving treatments. Massive funding agencies like the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) are also wary of those trying to shift autism research away from genetics and neuroscience, arguing that <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102368">scientific breakthroughs often come from long-term studies of fundamental biology</a> — even when those studies don’t seem to offer real-world benefits in the short term.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Looking at the numbers, though, research exploring how to help autistic people navigate everyday life — the research many autistic people <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/about-asan/what-we-believe/">say they’d like to see</a> — is still only getting about a quarter of the money allocated for autism research in the US. At a moment when <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/03/23/autism-epidemic-cdc-numbers/">autism diagnoses are on the rise</a> — for reasons scientists still don’t fully understand — why are we spending so much on mice that might help humans eventually, and so little on services that could help humans now?&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The history of autism research, briefly explained</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM-5-Autism-Spectrum-Disorder.pdf">as defined by</a> the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), is usually characterized by communication challenges, trouble navigating social interactions, and a high sensitivity to change.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also defined by how different the roughly 5.4 million people diagnosed with autism in the US are from each other. The wide umbrella of ASD includes people who live independently, have fulfilling careers and relationships, and can advocate for their own needs. It also includes people who don’t speak much (or at all), use a wheelchair, and may require full-time support from a caregiver for the entirety of their lives.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biologically speaking, autism — like the brain in general — is still poorly understood. In the 1950s and 1960s, medical professionals embraced the <a href="https://www.autism-help.org/points-refrigerator-mothers.htm">now-discredited “refrigerator mother” theory</a> linking autism to cold, distant parenting, <a href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/mothers-and-autism-evolution-discourse-blame/2015-04">blaming mothers</a> for their children’s condition. Later, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/28/obituaries/28rimland.html">psychologist Bernie Rimland</a> presented evidence that autism is rooted in biology. Then, former physician Andrew Wakefield <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/2/27/17057990/andrew-wakefield-vaccines-autism-study">published a paper</a> in 1998 incorrectly linking the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine to autism, fueling the modern <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22958419/covid-vaccine-mandate-pandemic-history">anti-vaccination movement</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, most researchers believe that autism is strongly influenced by genetics. However, when <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/autism/signs-symptoms/index.html">symptoms can include everything</a> from difficulty reading social cues to seizures to constipation, it’s hard to figure out what genes might be causing what — after all, over several decades of work, scientists have compiled a <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/analysis-sequences-pegs-102-top-autism-genes/?fspec=1">list of 100 or so genes</a> that might be linked to autism.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To leaders at private funding agencies like SFARI, <a href="https://www.autismspeaks.org/?utm_medium=paidsearch&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=IS-branded-conv&amp;utm_content=IS-evergreen&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwooq3BhB3EiwAYqYoEh4tmncVlXtGeW90hFwQGBeNbeY40R_1WxoBEujiGBrP1kGE4wm5ihoCKP4QAvD_BwE">Autism Speaks</a>, and the <a href="https://autismsciencefoundation.org/">Autism Science Foundation</a> (ASF), that complexity is precisely why we need basic research to explore the underlying biology and genetics of autism.<strong> </strong>The ultimate goal of these funders, several of whom have autistic children, is to find treatments for autism. Historically, some of these institutions <a href="https://the-art-of-autism.com/autism-speaks-revamps-its-mission-statement/">even wanted to find &#8220;cures.&#8221;</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But digging into the genetics of autism in the early aughts raised more questions than answers, forcing researchers to <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/dsm-5-redefines-autism/">reconsider what autism even is</a>. Meanwhile, in the absence of meaningful medical progress, some desperate parents turned to extreme DIY “cures” like <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/6/19/18684109/autism-vaccines-treatment-cure-bleach">making their autistic kids drink bleach</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Despite the fact that they’re pointing in diametrically opposed directions, there’s a common theme with the refrigerator mother approach and the anti-vaccine approach,” said <a href="https://healthpolicy.fas.harvard.edu/people/ari-neeman">Ari Ne’eman</a>, assistant professor at the Harvard School of Public Health and co-founder of the <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/">Autistic Self Advocacy Network</a> (ASAN). “Namely, they both really emphasize the idea of causation as central to the business of autism advocacy.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Framing autism as a disease that “happens” to otherwise healthy children as a consequence of their parenting, genetics, or environment makes it feel like something that science can fix, or even prevent in the first place. For many diseases — think deadly cancers — this wouldn’t be controversial.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But many autistic adults <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/8/31/9233295/autism-rights-kanner-asperger">believe the “causation” framing is hugely misguided</a>. Efforts to pinpoint genetic markers of autism have <a href="https://proto.life/2023/04/prenatal-screening-for-autism-is-an-ethical-dilemma/">raised serious concerns</a> about eugenics — namely, that if parents could get a prenatal test for autism, many of them would choose not to have those children.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Prenatal tests for many diseases, like cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease, <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/common-tests-during-pregnancy">already exist</a>, and the fears of autism advocates are not unfounded. In Iceland, for example, nearly 100 percent of parents who get prenatal tests for Down syndrome — a chromosomal condition affecting as many as <a href="https://www.globaldownsyndrome.org/about-down-syndrome/facts-about-down-syndrome/">6 million people</a> worldwide,<strong> </strong>many of whom live long, healthy, fulfilling lives — <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/iceland-eliminated-syndrome-abortion/">choose to abort their pregnancy</a> if the results are positive, causing the population of Down syndrome children to almost completely disappear there. Even in the US, where <a href="https://www.vox.com/videos/370668/how-trump-could-ban-abortion-medication-president">abortion is politically fraught</a>, over <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pd.2910/full%22">two-thirds of parents</a> choose not to give birth after finding out their child will have Down syndrome. Should it also be acceptable for parents to abort a pregnancy if they learn that their child will be autistic?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Autism research was really built with the assumption that the goal is a world without autism,” Ne’eman said. But a growing number of people embrace the neurodiversity movement, proposing that autism is simply <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NeuroTribes-Legacy-Autism-Future-Neurodiversity/dp/158333467X">another way to move through the world</a>. To them, the condition is not something to cure with medication or prevent with prenatal testing. This shift has led to significant controversy in the world of autism research. Autism Speaks <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/autism-speaks-but-should-everyone-listen">came under fire</a> in the mid-2010s for portraying autism as a devastating disease that ought to be stamped out, before <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/02/14/biggest-autism-advocacy-group-is-still-failing-too-many-autistic-people/">denouncing</a> that rhetoric in 2016.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For now, an effective prenatal test is not widely available — while autism does seem to be strongly influenced by genetics, <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/the-problems-with-prenatal-testing-for-autism/">there isn’t a single gene that flags autism</a>. Prenatal tests and emerging <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/24105096/crispr-gene-editing-theory-dna-diversity">gene-editing</a> tools like CRISPR seem to work best for conditions caused by a single genetic mutation, like <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/sickle-cell-disease">sickle cell disease</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, scientists have listed about 100 genes that all seem related to someone’s likelihood of being diagnosed with autism, making a target for potential screenings, drugs, or other therapies much harder to pin down. Mutations in any one gene don’t necessarily mean that a person will be autistic, or shape what autism will look like for them. While some single-gene mutations cause specific neurodevelopmental disorders that fall under the umbrella of autism spectrum disorder, like <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/understanding-fragile-x-syndrome/">fragile X syndrome</a>, they are <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/autism-genetics-explained/">relatively rare</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All considered, autism isn’t currently something that can be addressed by traditional drug development pipelines. Yet, funding for projects studying the biology of autism <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/publications/strategic-plan/2023/strategic_plan_2023.pdf?ver=8">more than quadrupled</a> since 2008, while funding for projects finding better ways to help autistic people in day-to-day life <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/4/21/11464144/autism-funding-services-biology">fell or remained stagnant</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Under the <a href="https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/12/20061219-3.html">Combating Autism Act</a>, which George W. Bush signed into law in 2006, Congress established the <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/">Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee</a> (IACC). As the name suggests, the Combating Autism Act was focused on finding treatments to prevent or “cure” autism.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the time, the vast majority of IACC members were not autistic — and their funding priorities were oriented accordingly. Their <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/publications/strategic-plan/2009/strategic_plan_2009.pdf">first set of recommendations</a>, published in 2009, <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/2009/02/comments-at-february-4-2009-iacc-meeting/">heavily skewed</a> toward funding the search for causes and cures of autism. For example, they proposed spending $75 million on developing animal models of autism — nearly 50 times more than they suggested spending on studying everyday support services for autistic people.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Can biologists breed autistic mice? (Not really.)</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the world of biomedical research, where there are genetic risk factors, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK231336/">there are genetically altered mouse models</a>. But by continuing to fall back on the rodents that they are so accustomed to studying, researchers are holding themselves back from fully understanding how autism manifests in humans.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mice are small, reproduce quickly, and share about <a href="https://www.genome.gov/10001345/importance-of-mouse-genome">85 percent of their functional genes</a> with humans, making them desirable to geneticists hoping to study diseases outside of the human body. While non-animal models are <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/370457/animal-testing-science-medicine-vaccines-cruelty-free">slowly replacing animal testing</a> in many areas of science, “you need a live animal to study a disorder that’s solely behavioral,” Silverman said. “Cells don’t behave.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mice behave, but their behavior is very different from ours. So, neuroscientists have had to stretch <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/why-studying-autism-in-mice-may-be-doomed-to-fail/">to draw parallels</a> between the behavior of mice and autistic humans. If a mouse buries marbles with unusual fervor or over-grooms themselves, a study <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4108161/">may qualify it as</a> “repetitive behavior.” If a mouse prefers being alone to hanging out with a stranger mouse in its cage, it’s displaying “social deficits.” Studies have even measured changes in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149763420304383">ultrasonic vocalizations in mice</a> to try to understand speech problems in autistic humans, and recorded electrical activity from the brains of <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202402493">dogs with autism-related gene mutations</a> to see whether LSD could improve their social interactions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Animal behavior is finicky, though, especially when those animals are <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23795087/animal-experiments-primates-mental-health-effective">living in tiny laboratory cages</a>, far from their natural habitat. The same mouse in the same marble-burying setup, for example, may bury fewer marbles than usual one day because it got distracted by the smell of whatever shampoo the experimenter used that morning.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Human error can play a role, too. An exhausted grad student may miscount the number of times two mice bump noses. Researchers in different labs may not even agree what that nose-bumping behavior means, <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/how-artificial-intelligence-is-shaking-up-animal-behavior-studies-in-autism/">or how to classify</a> it in their papers. It “just lends itself to a lack of reproducibility,” Gundersen said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It also makes preclinical trials for new treatments, which are often conducted in animals, challenging to translate to humans. Many symptoms, especially those related to social interactions and communication, are distinctly human — so much so that they’re nearly impossible to reproduce in mice. “You know,” Gundersen said, “no mice talk.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, more scientists are rejecting the idea that mice can actually exhibit autistic-like behaviors. “Nobody thinks that mice are people,” Gundersen said. “Nobody thinks that mice are modeling autism.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the number of publications featuring “mouse model(s) of autism” in the title <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTQa9l1rWjZRVtuBzBywJUiajxZ-aqDCcq834jrr3YpRgK92L5I3MR0taYvJhpOX0w9OWFgD9YTmErU/pubchart?oid=1977171245&amp;format=image">has steadily increased</a> since they were first introduced in the mid-2000s. A cynic might wonder why scientists are continuing to pursue this line of research, when both autistic self-advocates and a growing number of leaders in biomedicine are saying that it doesn’t make any sense.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ne’eman said that some people in the autistic community jokingly refer to autism research as a “geneticist’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelbernick/2020/08/25/the-rebuilding-and-the-autism-full-employment-act-of-2021/">Full Employment Act</a>” — a parallel to the proposed <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/agenda/2021/10/04/americans-autism-employment-support-514667">Autism Full Employment Act</a>, which would create incentives for workplaces to hire autistic people.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The grant application system is really competitive. To boost their chances of getting research funding, applicants increasingly have to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1745691616687745">twist their research proposals</a> to align with whoever will give them money. A lab interested in studying how gene expression guides brain cells to form connections with each other, for example, could pitch it as an autism study to open up additional funding opportunities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, Ne’eman suspects that some scientists are “looking at the autism research agenda as exclusively or primarily a vehicle for a relatively small number of abstract questions of basic science,” which aims to expand knowledge without necessarily translating to new drugs or other practical applications. Just look at the mice: it’s been clear for years that they’re a bad proxy for autistic people, but many biomedical researchers have built their careers around using them. Moving away from dysfunctional models requires time, money, and critically evaluating old, imperfect findings — something scientists aren’t really incentivized to do.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">People like <a href="https://autismsciencefoundation.org/teams/dr-alycia-halladay/">Alycia Halladay</a>, chief science officer at the Autism Science Foundation, worry that self-advocates like Ne’eman are too dismissive of basic science. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“At ASF, we strongly believe that the use of model systems is essential to&nbsp;understanding the biology of autism and to developing targeted, personalized interventions that will improve lives,” Halladay wrote in an email statement to Vox. “Use of animal models has been critical to our understanding of dozens of psychiatric disorders, and has helped to improve the lives of those who suffer from those disorders. Autism research must continue to include these important model systems. ASF remains absolutely committed to funding basic biology, genetic discovery, animal models, and pharmaceutical innovation.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it isn’t that autistic people don’t value science. Rather, many of them think the somewhat futile search for a “cure” to autism shouldn’t receive as much funding as it does, relative to other areas of research.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A more promising path for biomedical researchers could be studying rare neurodevelopmental disorders, like <a href="https://www.angelman.org/">Angelman syndrome</a> and <a href="https://www.rettsyndrome.org/about-rett-syndrome/what-is-rett-syndrome/">Rett syndrome</a>, caused by mutations in a single gene that exists in both mice and humans. People with disorders like these often have symptoms experienced by others with autism, like <a href="https://autism.org/autism-and-seizures/">seizures</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/autism-spectrum-disorder/expert-answers/autism-and-digestive-symptoms/faq-20322778">gastrointestinal issues</a>, and <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/sleep-problems-autism-explained/">insomnia</a> — which are more easily quantifiable in mice than, say, language.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Silverman moved her lab in this direction entirely, after <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gbb.12803">losing faith in models</a> of other “autism-like behaviors.” She hopes that a clearer understanding of these specific genetic mutations will lay the foundation for things like better epilepsy medications down the line — not only for those with Angelman syndrome, but for anyone who experiences seizures alongside autism. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I asked Halladay what research she wanted to see, as a <a href="https://sparkforautism.org/discover_article/meet-alycia-halladay/">mother of an autistic daughter</a>. She agreed that more investigations of conditions related to autism, like sensory sensitivity, would be incredibly helpful to families like her own. Halladay, like many other parents, doesn’t want her daughter’s autism to go away; she just <a href="https://sparkforautism.org/discover_article/meet-alycia-halladay/">wants more support</a> — and possibly medicine — to help her child live the best life possible.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Autism research is torn between different visions</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In general, Ne’eman thinks that “the average autistic person, as well as the average family member, doesn’t wake up in the morning thinking, ‘Have they found a better mouse model?’” They do think about whether they’ll be able to find a full-time caretaker who is covered by insurance, or what the newest adaptive communication devices will be capable of.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When autistic self-advocates were largely excluded from the decision-making process, funding for things that would help them immediately, like communication assistance or housing support, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8035332/">fell by the wayside</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s since changed — today, the IACC includes 23 non-autistic government employees and 22 public members, <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/federal-autism-committee-names-new-members/">seven of whom are autistic</a> themselves. Their budget priorities <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/publications/strategic-plan/2023/strategic_plan_2023.pdf?ver=8">have shifted accordingly</a>, centering research questions like “What services and supports are needed to maximize health and well-being?” in addition to basic biology studies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, the gap between the committee’s proposed budget and how much funders actually spend <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/publications/portfolio-analysis/2020/portfolio_analysis_2020.pdf?ver=5">has also grown</a>. And while funding for services and support doubled between 2019 and 2020, it still only accounted for 8.4 percent of the money spent that year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One big thing standing in the way of the IACC’s recommendations and reality: The biggest sources of science funding, public and private, weren’t really built to fund things other than biology research. Of the 28 organizations listed as funding autism-related projects between 2019 and 2020, the National Institutes of Health and SFARI — which only award grants for basic science and clinical research — <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/publications/portfolio-analysis/2020/portfolio_analysis_2020.pdf?ver=5">together paid for over 80 percent of research</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Agencies like the <a href="https://ies.ed.gov/ncser/research/">Department of Education</a> and the <a href="https://acl.gov/">Administration for Community Living</a> pay for projects studying interventions like how to help autistic adults avoid institutionalization and live as independently as possible — <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/about-asan/what-we-believe/">major priorities for autistic self-advocates</a>. However, they only fund a tiny portion of autism research.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Solving this problem will likely require a major redistribution of funding, or a big overall increase in the pool of money available to everyone. “I’m not sure that you can totally fix it by just yelling at the NIH,” Crane said. In fact, she suspects that the <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/organization/od/office-of-national-autism-coordination-onac">Office of National Autism Coordination</a>,<strong> </strong>housed within the NIH, knows that they’re supposed to be funding more studies about how to support autistic people — they’re just not receiving grant applications for them. The NIH did not respond to Vox’s requests for comment by the time of publication.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One solution the IACC recommended involves <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/publications/strategic-plan/2023/strategic_plan_2023.pdf?ver=8">growing the overall pool of money</a> set aside for autism research to $685 million by next year. They specifically highlighted three research areas that need the most additional resources: lifespan issues, evidence-based interventions and services, and the development of culturally responsive services.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By “lifespan issues,” the IACC means anything related to big life transitions: access to higher education and employment, opportunities to live as independently as possible alongside non-autistic community members, and health care. Figuring out how to help autistic adults — including those with the most severe disabilities — <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/2012/08/career-options/">find fulfilling jobs</a> that they’re good at, <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/2024/05/beyond-coercion-and-institutionalization/">stay out</a> of harmful psychiatric institutions, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/11/1098150733/dating-coaches-who-specialize-in-working-with-people-with-autism-are-in-demand">form healthy relationships</a> doesn’t require mouse models. It requires piloting initiatives like new <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/resources/housing/websites/">housing programs</a>, building better <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/2017/10/everybody-communicates-our-new-toolkit-on-communication-supports/">assistive communication devices</a>, and other community-oriented research.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Studying existing interventions to make sure they’re helping autistic people — not just making them appear non-autistic in public — is also crucial, Crane said. For example, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sweetpoochers/video/7405244574127361311?lang=en">applied behavioral analysis (ABA) therapy</a>, which rewards “goal behaviors” like making eye contact or saying hello to people, is <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@joannareese7/video/7356684281642634539?lang=en">controversial in the autistic community</a> because it can be experienced as <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@burritos_and_adhd/video/7039802682588040453?lang=en">abusive and coercive</a>. Most existing studies on the effectiveness of ABA measured things like whether recipients <a href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/when-disability-defined-behavior-outcome-measures-should-not-promote-passing/2021-07">behaved better in the classroom</a>, rather than long-term outcomes like overall academic achievement or quality of life. With more money, Crane hopes this can change. “We need to be funding research that actually tracks the outcomes that matter to people.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The bottom line is that we don’t need more mouse models of autism or of autism-like behaviors. Biomedical science has a role to play, especially in helping people manage symptoms of other autism-related health issues like epilepsy and sleep disorders — but it has claimed a disproportionately large chunk of autism research funding for too long.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some people, especially the parents of children with intellectual and physical disabilities related to autism, argue that autistic self-advocates who push back against the biomedical research agenda are acting out of self-interest, leaving those with the most severe disabilities behind. People with different experiences of autism, Autism Science Foundation president Alison Singer <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/its-time-to-embrace-profound-autism/">argues</a>, need different things. Specifically, she believes that people with the most severe disabilities need the kinds of pharmaceutical interventions that biomedical research aims to find — and that many autistic self-advocates want to deprioritize.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ne’eman believes the opposite is true. “Those with the most severe impairments are especially poorly served by research that does not relate back to their needs,” he said. In its <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/genetic-statement-concerns.pdf">statement on genetic research</a>, the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network emphasizes, “Autistic people with the highest support needs are some of the most vulnerable members of our community. They deserve good lives with the right to make their own decisions, not yet another round of ‘cures’ that will not work.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Neuroscience still has a lot to offer the autism community, but neuroscientists need to listen to the people they’re claiming to serve. Ditching outdated behavioral tests on mouse models of “autism-like behavior” might be a great place to start.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>The </em>Today, Explained<em> podcast is taking a deep dive into the major themes of the 2024 election through the lens of seven battleground states. We’ve heard so far from voters in <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0a8ahdph7BGpx9d0ZjzU3q?si=b5fcd333949f4909">Georgia</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4qTFkzBeRxCT5sPluaxd7n?si=13da5fec1295486e">Pennsylvania</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0d33827slG3WnJObyCr2C1?si=376ff7132c7f4f52">Arizona</a>, and this week we turn to Wisconsin, where rural voters could make the difference.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With less than a month until Election Day, Wisconsin Democrats are pouring time and energy into parts of the state they routinely lose by double digits in the hope of reaching the rural voters who went solidly for Donald Trump in the last two presidential elections. <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/elections/articles/the-2024-swing-states-wisconsin-could-sway-the-presidential-election">All signs indicate</a> that these voters will do so again, but that hasn’t stopped Democrats from <a href="https://pbswisconsin.org/news-item/wisconsin-democrats-continue-fundraising-dominance-over-state-republicans-in-2024/">campaigning</a> fiercely in rural districts to claw back as many voters as they can.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to <a href="https://www.wpr.org/person/rob-mentzer">Rob Mentzer</a>, the rural communities reporter for Wisconsin Public Radio, Democrats are clear-eyed about the fact that they almost certainly won’t win in rural parts of Wisconsin. By narrowing the margins, though, they hope to “lose by less” — and thus win statewide.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If that tactic succeeds, it would be a big deal. Though Wisconsin was long a progressive stronghold, a wave of Republican support in the early 2000s transformed it from part of Democrats’ Midwestern “blue wall” into a <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/4929521-kamala-harris-trump-polls-race/">battleground state</a> often decided by razor-thin margins.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2020, Biden won the state by just over half a percentage point, thanks in large part to high turnout in Madison, Milwaukee, and other cities. If Harris and incumbent Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who is up for reelection, can make gains with rural voters this time, it would expand their path to victory in the state.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Today, Explained</em> host Sean Rameswaram<em> </em>spoke with Mentzer about what he’s hearing from rural voters in north-central Wisconsin as Democrats make a play for their support.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Can we just talk really quickly about what Wisconsin looked like, I don’t know, before Donald Trump? It used to be a progressive place, right?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Rob Mentzer</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wisconsin has a <a href="https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Article/CS3588">very long history</a> of progressive politics. From the turn of the 20th century, it was actually one of the birthplaces of the progressive movement. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-M-La-Follette">Robert La Follette</a> was a populist governor, later US senator. He was beloved by the state&#8217;s farmers, by rural areas. And you can <a href="https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Article/CS417">draw a straight line</a> from that progressive movement in Wisconsin to a lot of the New Deal legislation and into modern progressivism, for sure.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And what changed? Is it as simple as Donald Trump or is there more to that story?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Rob Mentzer</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think that it goes back a little bit further than that. So in 2010, there was a massive wave election for Republicans. And one of the Republicans elected that year was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-the-democrats-finally-defeated-wisconsin-gov-scott-walker/2018/11/07/3377ed17-9cbe-4537-8b2a-acd0c37a8d35_story.html">Scott Walker</a>, who became Wisconsin&#8217;s governor. Some people will recall the first thing he did in office was to introduce a bill that essentially removed collective bargaining rights from most public unions —&nbsp;teachers, government workers. And there was a huge backlash to this. There were weeks of protests in the state capital. But Republicans won that battle. And then, because 2010 was a <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Redistricting_in_Wisconsin_after_the_2010_census">redistricting year</a>, they used their trifecta power to <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2011/08/08/walker-signs-redistricting-bill-angering-democrats-on-day-of-recall-elections/">entrench those majorities</a> in the legislature. Walker survived a <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2012/06/05/154384654/live-blog-wisconsin-decides-governors-fate-in-recall-vote">recall election</a> in 2012. He won reelection in 2014. And that gets us to the Trump era in 2016.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hillary Clinton famously <a href="https://ecommons.udayton.edu/pol_fac_pub/116/">did not visit Wisconsin</a> during the 2016 campaign. And she did not win Wisconsin on election night in 2016.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, the reasons for that are complicated. But I think that <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/wisconsin-manufacturing-workers-divided-trump-despite-broken-promises-n1245458">manufacturing</a> really is a big part of it. It&#8217;s one of the absolute pillars of Wisconsin&#8217;s economy. There are a lot of rural communities where a paper mill or a window and door manufacturer, a Harley Davidson plant, are the biggest employers. They provide the most jobs. And there was a real and a <a href="https://economicdevelopment.extension.wisc.edu/files/2019/05/Manufacturing_Full-report.pdf">long-term decline</a> in that share of manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin that you can trace as far back as the 1970s all the way into the 2010s.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some people absolutely blamed NAFTA for that or other free-trade agreements. Those were things that President Bill Clinton had signed into law, was an advocate for, and Hillary Clinton was associated with, while Trump was vocally against.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Also, in the 2010s, we saw a lot of <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/98901/err-274.pdf">consolidation of dairy farms</a>, a lot of closures of smaller farms. And I think that those things were part of the change in rural areas that voters reacted to.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Is that how Biden flips it back in 2020? Because he&#8217;s got that Obama affiliation and he doesn&#8217;t have that NAFTA affiliation?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Rob Mentzer</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a word, no.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Okay!&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Rob Mentzer</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The election in 2020 looked a lot like the election in 2016 in Wisconsin. The rural vote came out for Trump in <a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2020/12/23/republicans-won-rural-wisconsin-governing/">huge numbers</a>. Bigger than 2016. The only thing is that the vote in Madison and in other Democratic strongholds was a little bigger. Democrats gained ground in the suburbs in Wisconsin in 2020, and it put Biden over the top by about 20,000 votes in Wisconsin, which was enough, but which was less than 1 percent. But the sort of rural base of Trump voters, they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/05/us/wisconsin-election-results-biden-trump.html">absolutely turned out</a>.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Okay. So let&#8217;s talk about where that leaves us this year, in 2024, in just a few weeks now. It sounded like you were saying you&#8217;d expect Wisconsin to go for Trump again from your vista, is that right?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Rob Mentzer</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, I&#8217;d certainly expect that the part of the state that I live in to go for Trump again. There&#8217;s no question about that, I don&#8217;t think. It is worth saying that Democrats this year have put a lot of money and resources and volunteer time into rural Wisconsin.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And what are Democrats doing to sort of shift the narrative in rural communities in Wisconsin, Rob? What are they doing to mobilize Democrats and to make new Democrats in these communities where you&#8217;ve been hanging out?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Rob Mentzer</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democrats have opened something like 50 field offices around the state, including more than 30 in counties that Trump won in 2020. They are out knocking on doors and doing direct mail and all the other sort of campaign outreach tactics, including a lot more in-person work than was the case four years ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We&#8217;ve also seen how Kamala Harris is trying to reach out to Republican voters directly. This month, she campaigned with Liz Cheney, a former member of House Republican leadership. They did <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/nx-s1-5137349/kamala-harris-liz-cheney-wisconsin-little-white-schoolhouse">that event in Ripon, Wisconsin</a>, which is where the Republican Party was born in the 19th century. And it was explicitly understood as a way to reach out to voters who consider themselves Republican but may be open to voting for Harris.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And then there&#8217;s Harris&#8217;s vice presidential choice. Tim Walz talks about having rural roots, <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2024/08/06/minnesota-gov-tim-walz-has-rural-nebraska-roots/">growing up on a farm in Nebraska</a>. And he just sort of comes off as a rural guy. I passed on a highway in central Wisconsin one of those giant yard signs that said “Harris 2024,” and someone had spray-painted “Tim Walz for VP” underneath it, I guess as a way to emphasize he&#8217;s also part of the ticket. And I do hear from people in rural areas in Wisconsin who feel like they connect with Tim Walz, a hunter. He wears a camo cap and [he’s a] small-town football coach. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And then one other factor this year is that for the first time in more than a decade, Wisconsin has <a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2024/02/26/new-voting-maps-propel-a-surge-of-optimism-for-wisconsin-democrats/">new voting maps</a> that actually do give Democrats a chance of taking back a majority in at least one house of the state legislature. I think that for sure has brought some new attention and additional energy to Democratic organizing on the local level.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So do you think it could work? Do you think Democrats could win back rural voters in Wisconsin?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Rob Mentzer</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, they could win back <em>some</em> of the rural voters, maybe. The Democrats I talked to, their goal is to lose by less in these rural areas. So one of those, Jim Davis, said that they&#8217;re not even remotely thinking that they&#8217;re going to get over 50 percent in Taylor County. And so if they can get to 35 percent in areas where maybe they&#8217;re lucky to scrape 25 percent, that can really make a difference in a state as close as Wisconsin.</p>

If you want advice on spending, saving, or investing — or any of the complicated emotions that may come up as you prepare to make big financial decisions — you can&nbsp;</em><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScXuTsmpi2VQ6ZoRVEeHrgBSpkPkWSRWDH4zeY_TMBtPAhc4w/viewform"><em><strong>submit your question on this form</strong></em></a><em>. Here, we answer two questions asked by Vox readers, which have been edited and condensed.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Where do I begin with investing? How does the stock market work and how do I get into investing in stocks? How do I budget without it being too strict? How do I go about smartly saving?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dear Future Investor,</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These questions are best answered in reverse order, so let’s begin.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Smartly saving money — which is something you’ll need to do before you can start investing — comes down to the difference between your income and your expenses. Many people are unable to save because their expenses exceed their income, and spend much of their financial energy <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/24009317/how-to-get-out-of-credit-card-debt-mental-health-money-personal-finance">digging out of credit card debt</a>. Other people are able to save small amounts of money, but not enough to get them out of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/life/366935/on-the-money-august-etfs-middle-class-retirement-investing">paycheck-to-paycheck lifestyle</a>. (One or two missed paychecks, or the equivalent in unexpected expenses, would empty them out of everything they’ve saved.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Budgeting is one of the more effective ways to lower your expenses and save more money, particularly if you really are overspending in certain areas of your life. (Overspending, in this case, would involve making purchases that bring neither utility nor pleasure. Clothing you don’t wear, games you don’t play, food you throw out, and so on.) However, many people aren’t actually overspending, which is why their budgets feel overly strict.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, there are plenty of good reasons to take a look at how much you’re earning and how much you’re spending. You might as well draft up a budget just to see how you’re doing. Any of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/365747/best-budgeting-app-mint-replacement-ynab">popular budgeting apps</a> will help you get the job done. I use <a href="https://www.ynab.com/">YNAB</a>, which lets you forecast how many of your future expenses you can pay with your current income. If you’re interested in tracking both your budget and your investment portfolio, you might want to try <a href="https://www.monarchmoney.com/">Monarch Money</a>. <a href="https://web.meetcleo.com/budget">Cleo</a> is a budgeting app that uses AI to help you decide what you can afford to buy, although I haven’t used it myself so I can’t specifically recommend it. If you want to go the DIY route, you can open a spreadsheet and start tracking earnings in one column and expenses in another — I’ve budgeted that way for years, and it works.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Once you’ve done a top-level assessment of your finances, one of two things may happen. Either you’ll say, “Wow! I could save hundreds of dollars every month if I simply stopped buying all of this stuff I never use!” or you’ll say — and this is the more likely scenario — “Um, it kind of looks like I need everything I buy.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This brings me to the most effective way to save more money, which is by earning more money.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some people earn more money by increasing their skills. Others turn an existing skillset into a side hustle. You may even be able to leverage your current skills into a raise, a promotion, or a better-paying job.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You may also be able to earn more money by investing. A lot of people turn to the stock market because they believe it’s the best way to earn enough money to achieve their biggest financial goals, whether they’re using a Roth IRA to save for retirement or a 529 Plan to save for college. Other people successfully use the market as a way to achieve smaller financial goals, such as saving up enough money for a down payment on a home. (A few people try to use the market as a get-rich-quick tool, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22277998/robinhood-investing-app-alternatives-betterment-stash-acorns-wealthfront">most of them fail</a>.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When you purchase stock in a company, you are predicting that the company issuing that stock will be more valuable in the future than it is right now. When you purchase a share in a total-market index fund — which essentially allows you to purchase a representative portion of everything the market has to offer — you are predicting that the entire market will be more valuable in the future than it is right now.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You are also, in a sense, helping to fund the growth of the companies and entities in which you are investing — which is one of the reasons why many people choose to invest in companies that are meeting <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22714761/esg-investing-divestment-fossil-fuels-climate-401k">social or environmental benchmarks</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Once you invest your money, it’s gone. Literally. You’ve exchanged your money for the stock or ETF or index fund, and you cannot count any of the numbers in your <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22277998/robinhood-investing-app-alternatives-betterment-stash-acorns-wealthfront">investment app</a> as part of your net worth — no matter how high they get — until you exchange your stock for money, which is called “realizing” your investment.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In other words, and I cannot emphasize this enough —&nbsp;you have to sell your stock for its value to become reality.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are two reasons to sell an investment:</p>

<ol>
<li>The value of your investment is enough for you to meet a specific financial goal, such as homeownership or retirement.</li>



<li>You believe the investment will be worth less in the future than it is worth right now.</li>
</ol>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Do you have questions related to personal finance? Submit them <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScXuTsmpi2VQ6ZoRVEeHrgBSpkPkWSRWDH4zeY_TMBtPAhc4w/viewform" data-type="link" data-id="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScXuTsmpi2VQ6ZoRVEeHrgBSpkPkWSRWDH4zeY_TMBtPAhc4w/viewform">here</a>.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In either case, you are at an advantage if you sell early. The first person to realize the value of their investments makes more money than the second person (who makes more money than the third person and so on). Every sale reduces the total value of the investment, and the value won’t start to go back up again until there are more buyers than sellers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This can get complicated really fast, which is why a lot of people navigate the bulls and bears of the stock market by following a strategy called “buy and hold.” Simply put, they believe that the long-term future of the market will be better than the present even if there are ups and downs in between.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The trouble is that every once in a while the market crashes — and although it has historically always rebounded, it takes a while to get those numbers back to where they were. During the Great Recession, for example, it took about four years for the market to recover. If you needed to sell your investments during those four years, perhaps to cover an income gap due to unemployment, you might have found yourself at a loss.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is one of the reasons why financial advisers recommend saving a three-to-six-month emergency fund before getting started with investing. Since we all know how difficult it can be to save up six months of expenses, some people choose to invest small amounts of cash specifically to build up their emergency fund, then sell the investments and transfer the money into a high-yield savings account or CD ladder. At that point, they can begin an investing strategy that could help them achieve longer-term financial goals.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After all of that, investing is the simple part, all things considered. It’s a matter of picking a brokerage and installing an app. From there, you can open an account, follow a series of prompts that are designed to help you build an investment portfolio, and decide how much money you can afford to invest. Some people choose to get a financial adviser involved, but you don’t have to — there have been <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/business/insights/blog/funds/active-vs-passive-investing">plenty</a> <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/articles/active-vs-passive-investing">of</a> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/18/passive-investing-rules-wall-street-now-topping-actively-managed-assets-in-stock-bond-and-other-funds.html">studies</a> on whether the average investor benefits from an actively managed portfolio, and it turns out that passive management may be just as effective. (In other words, picking an index fund and sticking with it could be just as good as buying and selling a bunch of different stocks and/or hiring someone to buy and sell your stocks for you.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You might want to do some research before you <a href="https://www.vox.com/ad/23932320/so-you-want-to-start-investing">choose your brokerage and your portfolio</a>, but you could also pick one of the more popular options and set yourself up with whatever they recommend. The amount of work you put into your investment decisions is entirely up to you. Some people read everything Warren Buffett ever wrote. Other people spend part of every day having conversations on investment forums. Most people simply let their investing app guide them toward a balanced portfolio, which is perfectly fine! You don’t have to master the art of investing to earn a modest return on your investment.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the other hand, if you find the market fascinating and want to invest both time and money into understanding it, go ahead. Buy low and sell high, don’t invest anything you can’t afford to lose, and remember that past performance does not guarantee future results.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Starting this week, thousands of people will descend on the Colombian city of Cali for an important meeting you may have never heard of: COP16.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This event is a big deal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Commonly known as the UN biodiversity summit, COP16 is a meeting of government official from around the world — likely including some heads of state —&nbsp;to figure out how to stop ecological collapse. COP, which stands for “conference of the parties,” brings together environmental leaders and officials from countries that are part of the Convention on Biological Diversity, a global treaty under the UN to conserve nature. They meet every other year to push forward a conservation agenda.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The last summit, known as COP15, was arguably much more important. During the event, held in 2022, nearly all countries of the world agreed on a <a href="https://www.cbd.int/doc/decisions/cop-15/cop-15-dec-04-en.pdf">groundbreaking new deal</a> to halt biodiversity loss by 2030. The deal has 23 targets, including conserving at least 30 percent of land and oceans and reducing annual subsidies that harm ecosystems by at least $500 billion. Experts hailed it as the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/12/12/9981020/paris-climate-deal">Paris agreement</a> for nature, the <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement">global treaty</a> to combat climate change.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">COP16, which runs from October 21 through November 1, won’t have the same sort of flashy outcome. Yet it’s a critical moment as countries assess their progress toward the 23 targets and hold each other accountable.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Spoiler: They’re way off track. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A <a href="https://assets.bbhub.io/dotorg/sites/64/2024/10/On-track-or-off-course.pdf">new report</a>, for example, found that less than 3 percent of the ocean is effectively protected from harmful activities, like overfishing. Subsidies that harm nature have only <a href="https://www.earthtrack.net/sites/default/files/documents/ehs_report_september-2024-update_final.pdf">ballooned in recent years</a>, reaching into the trillions of dollars. What’s more is that many countries have <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/cop16-countries-miss-un-deadline-to-submit-nature-pledges/">failed</a> to meet a deadline to submit plans for how they aim to achieve the objectives of the nature deal, known as the global biodiversity framework, within their own borders. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyond serving as a formal check-in, COP16 will center a few major issues. To understand the biggest stakes of these negotiations, we’ve compiled our reporting below.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/372277/digital-sequence-information-dsi-cop16-explained">Inside the extremely messy, profoundly confusing fight over who should profit from DNA</a></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the major issues to take center stage at this month’s negotiations is how best to manage DNA from plants and animals that’s found in online databases. This genetic data, referred to as digital sequence information, or DSI, is used by a range of companies to create products such as vaccines and drought-tolerant crops.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Cali, global leaders will be discussing how to address a major funding gap and how to raise funds needed for critical conservation. Negotiations will focus on what role governments and the private sector —&nbsp;companies and investors —&nbsp;will need to play.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another major part of this year’s summit will be a discussion about how to monitor progress toward achieving the 23 targets in the global monitoring framework. This includes figuring out what data to use to check if the world has, say, actually conserved 30 percent of all land.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Read Vox’s story about one of the indicators, the Living Planet Index, <a href="https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/376706/wwf-living-planet-decline-extinction-conservation">here</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One important piece of context to keep in mind is that although the US helped negotiate the Convention on Biological Diversity —&nbsp;the treaty under which COP16 takes place —&nbsp;it’s not a formal member of the agreement. In fact, the US is the only country, other than the Vatican, that’s not party to the Convention. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I wrote about what that means <a href="https://www.vox.com/22434172/us-cbd-treaty-biological-diversity-nature-conservation">here</a>. Keep in mind this story was published in 2021. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The left’s hopes for sweeping change from the 2010s have crashed into the reality of the 2020s.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The energy of the Bernie Sanders presidential campaigns and the George Floyd protests is a distant memory. Some members of <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/aoc-squad-congress-cori-bush-jamaal-bowman-b1781857.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/aoc-squad-congress-cori-bush-jamaal-bowman-b1781857.html">the Squad</a><strong> </strong>have <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/02/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-interview-progressive-democrats-00088792">moved toward</a> the Democratic mainstream, while others <a href="https://apnews.com/article/squad-aipac-progressives-congress-cori-bush-0de0a96929368db72145b033261415ca">lost primaries</a>. Several of the progressive prosecutors elected in recent years have been ousted from office (by <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chesa-boudin-san-francisco-da-recalled/">voters</a> or <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/05/marilyn-mosby-what-really-happened.html">due to</a> <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2023/05/19/rachael-rollins-resigns-us-attorney">scandals</a>) or appear <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-10-08/hochmans-lead-over-gascon-grows-to-30-in-new-la-da-race-poll">headed that way</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Democrat-dominated spaces — like cities and mainstream media outlets — there’s been growing pushback against the left. Ambitious progressive rallying cries of just a few years ago, such as defunding the police and Medicare-for-all, are now absent from the discourse. Politicians who assiduously cultivated left activists are now increasingly tacking to the center — most notably Vice President Kamala Harris, who has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/30/politics/harris-shifts-policy-stances/index.html">abandoned</a> many of the positions she took while running in the Democrats’ 2020 presidential primary.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Altogether, it’s seemed that progressives have moved from being on the offensive to being on the defensive — in both politics and the <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/373990/heterodoxy-anti-woke-libertarian-tech-bro">nation’s culture</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, it’s not as if progressives’ gains over the past 20 years or so have been entirely wiped away. The Democratic Party remains significantly further to the left than it was a decade ago and certainly two decades ago (see, for instance, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/377170/kamala-harris-economic-policy-new-progressive-economics">my recent article</a> about the rise of the New Progressive Economics).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet, as bloggers <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/what-remains-of-the-progressive-project">Noah Smith</a> and <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/07/the-changes-in-vibes-why-did-they-happen.html">Tyler Cowen</a> have argued, there are growing indications that the leftward drift of the party and of the country’s culture broadly have stopped. On some fronts, there has indeed been a reversal. “No matter who wins, the US is moving to the right,” Semafor’s David Weigel <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/10/15/2024/no-matter-who-wins-the-country-is-moving-to-the-right">argued last week</a>, citing “immigrant rights, LGBTQ rights, climate change policies, and criminal justice reform” as issues where progressives are on the defensive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Being on the defensive is not new for the left — it’s the historical norm. Bursts of activist energy and successful reform are typically followed by long stretches where either the new status quo persists or a backlash reverses at least some recent change.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, it’s certainly a shift from how politics has looked for most of the 21st century. So how and why did this change happen? Why did the progressive advance happen in the first place, and why did it stop?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The era of rising progressive ambitions lasted from about 2005 to 2020</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Historical periodization is a tricky thing, but here’s a rough attempt at it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From about 1980 to 2005, the left was mostly irrelevant to national politics. The Cold War was over, and capitalism reigned ascendant. The Republican Party <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/7/18/12210500/diagnosed-dysfunction-republican-party">moved right</a>, while the Democratic Party moved <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/7/18/15992226/neoliberalism-chait-austerity-democratic-party-sanders-clinton">to the center</a>. The country cracked down on <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/1994-crime-bill-and-beyond-how-federal-funding-shapes-criminal-justice">criminals</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/4/28/11515132/iirira-clinton-immigration">unauthorized immigrants</a>, and non-working <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/6/20/11789988/clintons-welfare-reform">welfare recipients</a>. 9/11 made patriotism mandatory. Same-sex marriage was viewed as politically toxic.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But 2005 to 2020 was, broadly, a period where progressives and the left became increasingly influential inside the Democratic Party, in Democrat-dominated spaces, and in the larger culture. Call it the era of rising progressive ambitions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The disasters of George W. Bush’s second term kicked off the shift, discrediting Republican governance. This enabled the election of the nation’s first Black president, Barack Obama, whose agenda was strikingly ambitious and progressive when compared to the Clinton years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democrats’ leftward shift accelerated in the 2010s, which saw:</p>

<ul>
<li>The increased cultural influence of the social justice left, which transformed how much of the country thought and spoke about racial and gender issues (“the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/3/22/18259865/great-awokening-white-liberals-race-polling-trump-2020">Great Awokening</a>”)</li>



<li>The launch of viral protest movements like Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, and Me Too</li>



<li>The nationwide spread and Supreme Court’s protection of same-sex marriage rights, followed by increased advocacy for trans rights</li>



<li>The rise of more economically progressive and even democratic socialist politicians, as seen in the support for Sanders’s campaigns, the Squad’s arrival in Congress, and party leaders’ embrace of some of <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/377170/kamala-harris-economic-policy-new-progressive-economics">Elizabeth Warren’s ideas</a></li>



<li>A leftward move of mainstream Democrats on issues like immigration and criminal justice, where activists had made the case that status quo policies were cruel and harmful</li>



<li>Increased public discussion about causes like Medicare-for-All, the Green New Deal, and student loan forgiveness</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Basically, on a host of issues, the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/us/politics/overton-window-democrats.html">Overton window</a>” — the boundaries of which political and policy ideas are deemed fit for mainstream discussion, rather than fringe or self-evidently absurd — opened far further left. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s election didn’t stop the left’s rising influence. Indeed, it intensified it, raising the stakes of politics and heightening passions. (Trump’s rise simultaneously opened the Overton window further right on some issues, as leading Republicans increasingly embraced <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/371894/trump-vance-haitian-immigrants-pets-springfield-ohio-polls-aidan-clark">bigotry</a> and flouted democratic norms.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The assumption spread among Democrats that the <a href="https://democracyjournal.org/arguments/the-new-old-democrats/">establishment’s approach had failed</a> and that bold new progressive ideas were necessary. During the party’s 2020 presidential primary, most candidates — including Harris — scrambled to the left, wooing activist groups. Joe Biden, the most old-school major contender, won, but rather than a full-on pivot to the center for the general election, he embraced much of the progressive agenda. It was a political necessity for helming the Democratic Party of 2020.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That year then brought further chaos as the country battled over the pandemic and the election, while the George Floyd protests led to a racial reckoning that played out in communities, companies, and institutions in intense and often controversial fashion.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The backlash and disillusionment of the 2020s</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Things feel different in the Biden years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In part that’s due to the constraints and disappointments that always exist when a party tries to turn a bold campaign agenda into governing reality. Narrow congressional majorities limited Democrats’ legislative possibilities (and then they lost the House). The conservative Supreme Court, meanwhile, blocked some Biden actions like student loan forgiveness and rolled back abortion rights protections.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the trend was broader. Democrats in cities <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cities-reverse-defunding-the-police-amid-rising-crime-11622066307">disavowed police cuts</a> as they struggled with rising crime and complained they <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/mayor-lightfoot-gov-pritzker-migrant-crisis/">couldn’t</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/07/nyregion/eric-adams-migrant-crisis-response.html">handle</a> a migrant influx. Corporations have <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/corporate-america-slashing-dei-workers-amid-backlash-diversity/story?id=100477952">laid off DEI workers</a>. Mainstream media companies, increasingly influenced by progressive causes (and sensitive to left criticism) in the 2010s, are now more forthrightly <a href="https://www.cjr.org/special_report/ag-sulzberger-new-york-times-journalisms-essential-value-objectivity-independence.php">asserting their journalistic independence</a> and challenging progressive ideas. Activism in protest of Israel <a href="https://www.vox.com/24140769/free-speech-israel-palestine-protests-columbia-university-college">was met with</a> fierce pushback at universities. Commentators started declaring that “wokeness” <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/09/19/after-peak-woke-what-next">had</a> <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/02/wokeism-has-peaked.html">peaked</a> as social justice controversies <a href="https://musaalgharbi.com/2023/02/08/great-awokening-ending/">grew less intense and frequent</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The common thread is that the Democratic Party, corporations, and the media have all become less deferential to the progressives who’d been trying to push them left.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And the main reason for that, I’d argue, is a spreading sense among many who are in the center, center-left, or politically neutral that the left has overreached or screwed up.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, one reason for the left’s 21st-century resurgence was that, at that point, they’d been irrelevant for so long that it was difficult to blame any of the country’s current problems on them. The flaws of centrism, neoliberalism, and conservatism seemed glaring and obvious, while left and progressive ideas simply hadn’t really been tried for some time.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But by 2020 the left’s influence on our politics and culture had become quite significant. And though Trump’s critics had been united around the common cause of ousting him when he was in power, once he left office, those with misgivings about recent trends felt freed up to focus more on them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The right got more effective at stoking these misgivings. Conservative boycotts of Bud Light and Target helped <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/23851108/bud-light-target-boycott-success-trans-issues-woke-capitalism">send a message</a> that it was risky for corporations to get too political. Elon Musk bought Twitter — which had been so central to the social justice trends of the 2010s — and turned it into the right-wing-friendly X. Christopher Rufo <a href="https://www.vox.com/23811277/christopher-rufo-culture-wars-ron-desantis-florida-critical-race-theory-anti-wokeness">helped stoke</a> a nationwide war on DEI.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet Democrats and progressives also simply had a hard time dealing with various challenging governance problems. The post-pandemic years have been a tough time to be in power: Incumbent parties <a href="https://time.com/6999625/us-france-japan-india-elections/">have been struggling</a> around the world. But in the US, progressive ideas were blamed, fairly or unfairly,<em> </em>for causing or worsening problems like inflation, border chaos, and crime.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some commentators who’d previously been aligned with progressives now had second thoughts. “I have to say that I now doubt the practical effectiveness of some of the policies I embraced in previous years,” Smith wrote <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/what-remains-of-the-progressive-project">in his Substack newsletter</a> last week. He said he now believed some of those policies were bad ideas, others suffered from “botched implementation,” and yet others simply had no path to broader political popularity.&nbsp; (<a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/palestine-is-the-end-of-the-line">Smith</a> is just one of <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/372217/nate-silver-2024-polls-trump-harris">many</a> <a href="https://slowboring.com/">commentators</a> who have become increasingly critical of the left in recent years.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To what extent has the broader public turned against the left? I’m hesitant to generalize about public opinion, which contains many conflicting strains. Immigration is the issue where <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/351535/3-theories-for-americas-anti-immigrant-shift">the clearest backlash</a> to progressive ideas is seen in polling; on other issues (like the economy), dissatisfaction is harder to disentangle from Biden’s record. Though some stalwart progressives have <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/06/cori-bush-primary-election-loss-00173000">lost</a> primaries, others have held on without difficulty. In the 2022 midterms, Democrats did quite well in swing states. But the GOP gained ground in blue states like New York, which could suggest a frustration with governance in deep blue areas.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Overall, though, Harris’s positioning clearly reflects a belief that many of her left positions of four years ago would be electorally detrimental in 2024.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">All of this has happened before</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, there’s also been a conspicuous decline of energy and intensity among progressive activists. While many certainly remain committed to their longtime causes, others have disengaged or shifted their focus to opposing Israel’s war in Gaza (an issue that bitterly divides the Democratic Party and where Democratic leaders are disinclined to embrace the left).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps if Trump wins, progressive energy would surge again in opposing him — but perhaps too many people are now burned out and apathetic, and the mobilization won’t match the bygone days of Trump’s first term. And a backlash against Trump’s governance would not necessarily spur the Democrats to resume their leftward march.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Activists naturally get disappointed and disengaged when major change proves elusive.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Every major social movement of the past 20 years has undergone a significant collapse,” the activist Bill Moyer <a href="https://www.wellbeingintlstudiesrepository.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=strsmov">wrote</a> in 1987, “in which activists believed that their movements had failed, the power institutions were too powerful, and their own efforts were futile.” Fatigue, burnout, and organizational crisis then ensue; some move on to new causes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Moyer argued that that is not, necessarily, the end of the story for such movements. The next step, he wrote, was for activists to pivot and to focus on the long, slow slog of changing public opinion in their favor.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So one possibility is that we’re headed for a political situation resembling the late 20th century, where the left is weakened and politically irrelevant for years if not decades.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s no sure thing, though. The challenge for the progressives now is regrouping around ideas and causes that can both energize activists and win popular support — while addressing doubts that have arisen about their competence.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If they can pull that off, this period of left decline may prove to be just a blip. If not, their stay in the political wilderness could be a long one.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Your Mileage May Vary is an advice column o</em><em>ffering you a new framework for thinking through your ethical dilemmas and philosophical questions. This unconventional&nbsp;</em><em>column is based on value pluralism — the idea that each of us has multiple values that are equally valid but that often conflict with each other.</em>&nbsp;<em>Here is a Vox reader’s question, condensed and edited for clarity.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I was raised evangelical Christian and was very devout until my 20s, when I moved away from religion. Now I don’t believe in the Christian dogmas I was raised with. But I think being raised that way did give me something very valuable —&nbsp;a scaffolding for spirituality and morality. It allowed me to develop values like kindness and charity, to help others even when it’s not convenient.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Now, I’m pregnant with my first child, and I’m worried that I don’t know how to instill morality in a kid if they don’t have a scaffolding for it. Should I raise my child as a Christian even though I don’t actually believe in Christianity anymore, and just let the kid figure it out over time? Or can you get the positive effects of being raised in a religion without actually being raised in a religion?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dear Spiritually Scaffolded,</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, can I just say: I feel you! This dilemma hits very close to home for me, as someone who was raised in Orthodox Judaism, no longer identifies as Orthodox, but still finds lots to value in the religious tradition. So the answer I’m going to give you is supported by research —&nbsp;we’ll talk history, psychology, and philosophy —&nbsp;but also personal experience.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To put my cards on the table: I do not believe you need religion to live a moral life. I’m sure you know this, too, because if you think about all your friends and colleagues, you’ll probably find that a bunch of them are very good, kind people who were raised secular. They are all <a href="https://sites.millersville.edu/bikenaga/math-proof/existence-proofs/existence-proofs.html">existence proofs</a> that a person can be good without God.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And that’s the basic premise of a movement known as humanism. Its roots stretch all the way back to the ancient Greeks, who emphasized the role of human rationality in figuring out how to lead a good and flourishing life. But by the Middle Ages, Greek philosophical texts had become largely unavailable to European Christians, who believed that humans were too wretched to find the good without a supernatural deity.</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Have a question you want me to answer in the next Your Mileage May Vary column?</strong> </h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:sigal.samuel@vox.com">sigal.samuel@vox.com</a> or <a href="https://forms.gle/wTU5egBukdhyKeL56">fill out this anonymous form</a>!

</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When translations of Greek texts flooded into Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries, the effects were transformative: The Renaissance was born. From scholars to popes, people gained an appreciation for the human body and mind, a pride that’s reflected in the art of the period (think Michelangelo’s “David”). They didn’t toss away Christian faith, but they started valuing both faith and reason, and developed more confidence in the ability of humans to figure out the truth and improve the world through science.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Modern humanism includes both “religious humanists” and “secular humanists.” The former are generally nontheistic —&nbsp;they reject the idea of a God who intervenes in human affairs — but they still draw inspiration from the wisdom of religious rituals and texts and from the structure of congregational life. Many <a href="https://www.uua.org/beliefs">Unitarian Universalists</a> fit in this category, for example. They wouldn’t say you need Jesus to save you, but they’ll happily meet in a church for a morally uplifting sermon and songs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then there are the secular humanists, who are staunchly religiously unaffiliated; think of people like Salman Rushdie or Steven Pinker, and the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2024/01/24/religious-nones-in-america-who-they-are-and-what-they-believe/">28 percent of Americans today</a> who describe themselves as atheist, agnostic, or “nothing in particular.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These two broad paths are both valid options for you to consider. What unites them is a belief that you can be “<a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/good-without-god-greg-epstein?variant=32205367345186">good without God</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although there is <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2024-54904-001.html">some data</a> to suggest that religion helps promote prosocial behavior, like <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09567976231158576">generosity</a> toward strangers, we also know that religious ideas and institutions have sometimes facilitated violence against certain groups. And the evidence on prosocial behavior is <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/2153599X.2022.2131892#abstract">actually pretty mixed</a> when you take a closer look.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The association between religiosity and prosociality seems to depend a lot on how those things are being measured. If you measure religiosity by simple belief in God or self-identification as religious, you won’t find it a strong predictor of moral action. But examine people’s behavior right after they’ve engaged in concrete religious practices (like prayer) and you find that they do tend to show more prosociality, likely because the practices evoke moral emotions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So religious <em>practice</em> might be an effective technology for cultivating morality. But it’s not the only one! Psychologists have found that we can still be moral without religion —&nbsp;<em>if</em> we set up the conditions to regularly and effectively trigger moral emotions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of those emotions is what they call <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797609359882?casa_token=uTUcrx1FWRMAAAAA%3AF1Gosc6czHd-BjZRxQAbuxQ_6XvG3ij6YomULh4IYOzx1UkUeb7R_cKSvBLGrOWhaRmbHP-RQK7Vsw&amp;journalCode=pssa">elevation</a>. It’s that <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2689844/">uplifting feeling of inspiration</a> you get upon hearing about someone who did something you consider really noble, whether it’s Mahatma Gandhi leading nonviolent civil disobedience or Susan B. Anthony campaigning for women’s rights. Feeling elevation moves us to want to act nobly, too —&nbsp;it nudges us to moral action.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another such emotion is <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-pspi0000018.pdf">awe</a>. It’s a feeling people often get in nature, when faced with towering mountains or a starry night sky. By reminding you that you’re a tiny speck in the universe, it shifts you away from focusing on yourself and your own problems. You move into what psychologists call the “small self” mindset —&nbsp;and that, it turns out, facilitates feeling more connected to others and acting more virtuously.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A third emotion is <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52853b8ae4b0a6c35d3f8e9d/t/5d8e22ea0d763c56f0a692c7/1569596139048/the-grateful-dont-cheat+%281%29.pdf">gratitude</a>. When you feel grateful for all that you’ve been gifted, your attention naturally turns to the source of those gifts. Very often, that source is other people. Research shows that eliciting gratitude doesn’t only make you want to return the favor to those who’ve directly contributed to your well-being —&nbsp;it also makes you <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52853b8ae4b0a6c35d3f8e9d/t/528d266ee4b0ce6fb73c1c83/1384982126317/gratitude-as-moral-sentiment-emotion-guided-cooperation-in-economic-exchange.pdf">want to be generous to people in general</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So here’s what I’d suggest for you: As your kid grows up, find regular ways to use elevation, awe, and gratitude to build their moral character. Of course, you’re not limited to just these three, but I think they’ll offer a great starter scaffold.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What does this look like in practice? For triggering elevation, make use of all the awesome children’s books about admirable people, both real and imagined. One of my friends who was raised secular credits <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/miss-rumphius-story-and-pictures-barbara-cooney/10132119">Miss Rumphius</a></em>, in which the protagonist travels the world and plants flowers everywhere she goes, with teaching her to be both fiercely independent and fiercely committed to doing good. I’m partial to what I call “the first woman to” books —&nbsp;whether they’re about the first woman to <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/listening-to-the-stars-jocelyn-bell-burnell-discovers-pulsars-jodie-parachini/14904125?ean=9780807545638">discover a pulsar</a> or the first woman to <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/osnat-and-her-dove-the-true-story-of-the-world-s-first-female-rabbi-sigal-samuel/16187143?ean=9781646140374">become a rabbi</a>! I also recommend checking out <a href="https://crcc.usc.edu/spiritual-exemplars-around-the-world/">this cool collection</a> of spiritual exemplars from around the globe.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For awe, you can engage in dedicated activities, like going on camping trips that include lots of hiking and stargazing. But let’s be real: You’re going to be busy. So, think about ways to fold awe into the small spaces of daily living, like the walk home from school. According to <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Femo0000876&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Future%20Perfect%20TEMPLATE%20TO%20CLONE%20copy&amp;utm_content=Future%20Perfect%20TEMPLATE%20TO%20CLONE%20copy+CID_40a38ae95895f99e3df47019fe894d71&amp;utm_source=cm_email&amp;utm_term=study%20published%20this%20week%20in%20the%20journal%20Emotion">a study</a> published in the journal <em>Emotion</em>, “awe walks” —&nbsp;weekly 15-minute walks outdoors where you’re encouraged to notice a gorgeous sunset, a giant spider web, or anything that makes you go “whoa!” —&nbsp;can effectively foster the “small self” mindset.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As for triggering gratitude, you can make a practice of regularly writing thank you cards with your kid. You can also express thanks for your food before starting a meal — like the prayers many religious people say before eating, but without any mention of God. Research shows that prayer successfully <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;doi=e19a74c6ed11472cf7d44ff897a9bf9dfb57f25c">elicits gratitude</a> in kids, whether they’re mentally thanking a higher power, teacher, or friend.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Practices like that will feel familiar from your religious upbringing; your project now is to retrofit them in ways that ring true to you. Yes, that’ll require some effort, but it’s worth it in your case because sticking to prefabricated, off-the-shelf religion would come with a serious downside.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">C. Thi Nguyen, a philosopher at the University of Utah, has a term I absolutely love for that downside: “<a href="https://philpapers.org/go.pl?aid=NGUVCH">value capture</a>.” That’s what happens when a technology presents you with a certain method for doing things, and you adopt that method as a stand-in for your actual values. Think: obsessively racking up a high step count on Fitbit instead of figuring out how you can enhance your health holistically. Using a prefab method like that has the advantage of convenience, but Nguyen reminds us that outsourcing our decision-making to it will yield an oversimplified or warped version of our values.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In this case, the technology is religion, to which many people outsource all their moral thinking. But you can create a more bespoke scaffold that supports the virtues and ideas you actually believe in. In doing that, you’ll be honoring the value of intellectual honesty while also honoring the value of effectively building moral character in your kiddo.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I want to offer a caveat, though. Prefab religion comes with a major pro: Unlike a Fitbit, it’s a technology that’s been debugged over millennia. Its rituals have been fine-tuned and time-tested to respond to human needs. As the psychologist David DeSteno documents in his book <em><a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/How-God-Works/David-DeSteno/9781982142339">How God Works</a></em>, these rituals contain deep insights into those needs and how to meet them effectively. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Often that’s by pushing us to do something that we don’t feel like doing but that’d probably be good for us. When grieving the death of my father, for example, I didn’t feel like having tons of people over and talking about him, but the Jewish ritual of shiva would have forced me to do just that. It surrounds you with community at a time when you might want aloneness but need togetherness. I wish I’d reaped its benefits.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When we go bespoke on our spirituality, we can inadvertently end up with something that feels thin, partly because it strips out lineage. And this is where I think the religious humanists have a leg up on secular humanists: While they do retrofit their faith so it’s aligned with their current beliefs, they also maintain whatever lineage they can.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That allows them to benefit from a tradition that demands things of them that they might not do if left to their own devices — like spending a lot of time in community (something religion is great at but modern society often fails at) and periodically disconnecting from technology (the Sabbath being the original digital detox). It also allows them to maintain a felt connection with their ancestors and the aesthetic beauty of the songs and customs unique to their background.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So even as you build your own scaffolding, try to keep an eye out for old materials that may be worth incorporating. You don’t have to entirely reinvent the wheel. And you don’t have to cede the realm of spirituality or even of religion to the dogmas you encountered in your childhood community. It’s as much yours as it is theirs. I wish you the confidence to take ownership of it, to be creative with it, and yes, to subvert it in community with people who make your vision of moral life come alive for you and your kid.&nbsp;</p>

<li>Sarah Bakewell, who wrote the delightful book <em><a href="https://otherpress.com/product/at-the-existentialist-cafe-9781590518892/">At the Existentialist Café</a></em>, has a newer book out on humanism.

<p class="has-text-align-none">For years, Black men have been an integral part of the Democratic coalition.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2012, 87 percent of Black men backed former President Barack Obama; in 2016, 82 percent backed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; and in 2020, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-elections/exit-polls/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-elections/exit-polls/">79 percent backed President Joe Biden</a>, according to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/black-men-drifted-democrats-toward-trump-record-numbers-polls-show-n1246447">NBC exit polls</a>.<strong> </strong>This year, 70 percent have said they’re backing Vice President Kamala Harris, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/12/us/politics/poll-black-voters-harris-trump.html">per a recent New York Times/Siena poll</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As those numbers make clear, the group overwhelmingly supports Democrats, but their loyalty has begun to wane, a shift that stretches across the last several campaigns. That attrition has something to do with the candidates themselves, but also with voters’ longstanding disillusionment with the party. Despite being one of Democrats’ most loyal voting blocs, some <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/politics/black-men-election-georgia-trump-harris.html">Black voters have felt ignored</a> and taken for granted as campaign promises and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/10/17/black-men-harris-immigration-obama/">change</a> have been slow to materialize.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“People are disappointed with the Democrats,” says David Childs, a history professor and director of the Black Studies Program at Northern Kentucky University. “A lot of people feel disenfranchised. They don&#8217;t feel like they have a voice.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">An added twist is some evidence that the Democrats’ leftward shift on social issues may also be a factor. Reviewing polling on respondents’ views on LGBTQ issues, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/opinion/biden-trump-black-hispanic-voters.html">Thomas Edsall of the New York Times</a> noted that views expressed by Black voters in one survey suggested that “some aspects of Democratic liberal orthodoxy contribute to the exodus of conservative minorities from the party.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The erosion Democrats have seen could be attributed to any number of reasons. But broadly, here are three theories that can explain why some Black men are feeling cool toward the party this cycle:&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1) <strong>A sense of economic stagnation</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the last four years, Black Americans have faced the same economic challenges as everyone else, while also navigating <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/black-wealth-is-increasing-but-so-is-the-racial-wealth-gap/#:~:text=However%2C%20between%202019%20and%202022,Black%20households%20held%20only%20%2415.">racial wealth</a> and <a href="https://www.epi.org/unequalpower/publications/understanding-black-white-disparities-in-labor-market-outcomes/">wage gaps</a> that mean many Black families feel the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/10/17/black-men-harris-immigration-obama/">effects of rising costs and inflation</a> more keenly than their white counterparts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While Black unemployment reached an all-time low during the Biden administration, it’s still <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/black-unemployment-rate-consistently-white-workers/story?id=106910140#:~:text=Since%20the%20U.S.%20first%20collected,level%20of%20two%20to%20one.">twice as high as white unemployment</a>. Similarly, while the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/16/politics/fact-check-trump-biden-black-unemployment-poverty/index.html">Black poverty rate reached a record low in 2022</a>, that all-time low still meant <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2023/09/black-poverty-rate.html">nearly one in five Black Americans</a> was living in poverty, nearly double the <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2023/09/black-poverty-rate.html">poverty rate of white Americans</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“In focus groups and conversations with party leaders, Black men have stated repeatedly that their material conditions have remained unchanged under Democratic and Republican presidential administrations,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/politics/black-men-election-georgia-trump-harris.html?login=email&amp;auth=login-email" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/politics/black-men-election-georgia-trump-harris.html?login=email&amp;auth=login-email">the New York Times’s Maya King reports</a>. And as costs have risen during the Biden administration — mostly due to inflation — that feeling of stagnation has only grown more pronounced. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such sentiments have prompted some voters to weigh whether voting for an alternative option — like Trump — could help produce a different outcome. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Nothing has come to fruition. Look at the schools, the playgrounds, the parks. Downtown is struggling. In our community, typically, we vote for Democrats. How has that panned out for us?” Ahmad Taylor, an undecided Michigan voter who previously voted for Biden, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/15/kamala-harris-black-men-pontiac-michigan/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/15/kamala-harris-black-men-pontiac-michigan/">told the Washington Post’s Michael Brice-Saddler.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Multiple Covid-19 aid packages also helped stem the economic pain some voters experienced because of the pandemic during the Trump administration and the beginning of the Biden administration. These included stimulus checks, small business funding, and expansions to unemployment payments.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A number of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/25/politics/covid-19-relief-programs-ending/index.html">these payments, however,</a> expired during the Biden administration because Republicans in Congress balked at passing a continuation of programs like an expanded child tax. That’s left voters dealing with both higher costs on consumer goods and a drop-off in aid that could help soften the blow.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because the first wave of stimulus checks was sent out during the Trump administration <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/inside-donald-trumps-stimulus-checks/story?id=77534116">and also bore his name</a>, some voters have been under the mistaken impression that he’s solely to credit for them. That idea has taken hold even though the aid was passed by a Democratic House and a Republican Senate, and even though stimulus payments were distributed during the Biden administration as well.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2) <strong>Resistance to the growing social liberalism of the Democratic Party</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another dynamic at play is more conservative attitudes among some Black voters on social issues. In particular, as Democrats have shifted leftward on LGBTQ rights — just over a decade ago, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2012/05/10/politics/obama-same-sex-marriage/index.html">Obama was hesitant to back same-sex marriage</a> —&nbsp; some of these voters have chafed at the party’s current stance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This cycle, Republicans have ramped up attacks on LGBTQ rights, particularly those <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/us/politics/trump-republican-transgender-ads.html">targeting trans people</a>, and that may be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/opinion/black-men-harris-trump.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/opinion/black-men-harris-trump.html">resonating with certain voters</a>, including <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-goes-harris-anti-trans-ads-football-games-rcna174354">Black men</a>. In one attack ad on Harris that played during football games, the Trump campaign has gone after her support for funding gender-affirming surgeries for trans inmates — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/us/politics/trump-prisons-transgender-care-harris.html">something, it should be noted, that prisons also offered under Trump</a>. “Kamala is for they/them; President Trump is for you,” the ad states.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Charlamagne Tha God, an influential media personality and one of the hosts of the syndicated radio show <em>The Breakfast Club</em>, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-goes-harris-anti-trans-ads-football-games-rcna174354">has described the ad as “effective.”</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other voters have spoken of Democrats’ support for gay rights as a problem. “That&#8217;s when I left Democrats alone,” one voter, identified as J, told <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/10/nx-s1-5133172/polls-suggest-republicans-are-making-gains-among-black-voters-especially-black-men">NPR</a>, noting that the legalization of same-sex marriage, a milestone made possible by the Supreme Court but celebrated by Democrats, was his tipping point away from the party. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those socially conservative viewpoints can extend to gender as well. When it comes to Harris’s candidacy, specifically, sexism might well be a real issue for some voters, including Black men.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There are traditional values that come out of a lot of the Black homes that are still around,” Childs says. “Even though many Black males were raised by a mother, by a matriarch, there&#8217;s still this notion that women have a certain place in our society.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cliff Albright, executive director of the Black Voters Matter Fund, notes that he’s heard the sentiment from a small percentage of voters he’s spoken to. “You got some percentage that will come out and tell you, like in your face: ‘I don&#8217;t think a woman should be president,’” he says. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3) <strong>An election cycle rife with disinformation&nbsp;</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A problem that only amplifies Democrats’ struggles is the rise of disinformation, multiple experts posited.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Childs notes that influencers on the right have seized on real concerns Black men may have — like economic frustration — to advance false messages about how Harris and Biden haven’t accomplished anything to help members of this group.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In one example that Charlamagne Tha God cited during a town hall with Harris this week, he referenced a viral clip from <a href="https://thegrio.com/2024/10/16/five-years-ago-we-asked-kamala-harris-about-reparations-now-her-opponents-are-distorting-her-answer/">a Harris interview with the Grio</a> that was taken out of context and has been cut so <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L4sts7I3xI">it looks like she’s saying she won’t do anything specifically for Black people.</a> </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These claims often begin with pundits on the right, or even Trump himself, and get amplified over social media by celebrities, podcasters, and other prominent personalities. The <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/janet-jackson-questions-kamala-harris-race-1236008815/">singer Janet Jackson</a>, for instance, recently elevated lies that Trump had told questioning Harris’s ethnicity.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Multiple surveys, including an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/one-four-us-black-men-under-50-support-trump-president-naacp-poll-finds-2024-09-13/">August NAACP poll</a>, have found a stark generational divide among Black men, with voters under 50 far less likely to support Harris than those over 50. Albright believes this points to the effect disinformation on social media has had, as younger voters are more likely to get news from these sources.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It&#8217;s like a living organism, this disinformation. It grows from a cell, and then it reaches the point where it takes on a life of its own, and it just grows all kinds of tentacles,” Albright tells Vox. “And … it&#8217;s touching millions of Black voters.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the year following Hamas’s October 7 attacks on Israel, there has only been one successful pause in hostilities: a week in November during which Hamas traded 110 Israeli captives for 240 Palestinian prisoners.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since then, the Biden administration has repeatedly touted ceasefire deals that have gone nowhere — both between Israel and Hamas and, more recently, between Israel and Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia militia that is fighting an <a href="https://www.vox.com/israel/375125/lebanon-hezbollah-israel-iran-invasion-gaza">Israeli invasion in southern Lebanon</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other parties have tried as well. The United Nations has attempted multiple times to secure a ceasefire resolution, though the US either vetoed or abstained on each. In September, France and the US tried to advance <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/26/us-france-lead-call-for-temporary-ceasefire-along-israel-lebanon-border">a 21-day pause in hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon</a>. Both Hezbollah and the Israeli government refused that proposal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The cost of those failures has been high. At this point, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/gaza-death-toll-hamas-war-israel-40000-32a79e03c8eb62669412dab23d03219e">more than 40,000 Palestinians</a> have been killed in Gaza. Israel has expanded its war to Lebanon, killing nearly 2,000 people there, and violence has increased in the West Bank. Israel is also weighing its response to an Iranian attack earlier this month, in which around 180 missiles landed in Israeli territory.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unlike previous Israeli conflicts, there doesn’t appear to be any end to the war in sight, at least not through diplomatic means. The recent <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/378433/israel-killed-hamass-leader-what-happens-next">death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar</a> could provide an opening for renewed talks, but the same core issues remain.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Israel, Hamas, and Hezbollah can’t agree to a ceasefire because they’re at cross purposes</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The short answer for why ceasefire talks have failed is that each of the three parties directly involved in the regional conflict — Hamas, Israel, and Hezbollah — have demands that their would-be negotiating partner is unwilling, or unable, to meet.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When it comes to Israel’s conflict with Hamas, the country’s demands have been both evolving and abstract. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly torched a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/middleeast/netanyahu-derailed-hostage-deal-in-july-intl/index.html">potential July ceasefire agreement</a> with Hamas by insisting that Israeli troops maintain a permanent presence in Gaza, and that Israel would continue to have control of the Gaza/Egypt border.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those are much bigger —&nbsp;and more unrealistic —&nbsp;asks than previous demands for the return of Israeli hostages in Gaza, which is what the initial ceasefire conversations revolved around. And more broadly, Israel’s goals in Gaza are somewhat subjective: Israeli leaders have repeatedly said they want to completely eliminate Hamas’s military and governing capacities, a goal Hamas has obviously rejected, and which US officials <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/05/16/biden-rafah-intelligence-netanyahu-strategy/">have said is unlikely</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s very difficult to eradicate a political ideology, which is what Hamas is at its essence, and Israel has not made clear under what conditions it will feel satisfied its goals are met —&nbsp;whether that means the death or capture of major leaders, the dismantling of outside support, total Israeli occupation of Gaza, or some other scenario.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It seems clearer to me what the Israeli government considers unacceptable than what it considers acceptable,” <a href="https://www.csis.org/people/jon-b-alterman">Jon Alterman</a>, director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Vox. “The challenge it will have is keeping an eye on what is achievable and sustainable. Both are surely less than what the government wants.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similarly, Israel’s stated goal in its conflict with Hezbollah — to ensure the group is unable to attack Israel like Hamas did on October 7 — is opaque. That could mean anything from pushing the group a certain distance from Israel’s northern border to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly3x1w0595o">pushing regime change in Lebanon</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel is unlikely to be able to dismantle Hezbollah totally, but its goal may be to shift the balance of power in its decades-long conflict with the organization.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This time around, with the damage they&#8217;ve done to Hezbollah and with the direct fighting between Israel and Iran, Israel was hoping to fundamentally change the threat that the Iranian proxies [like Hamas and Hezbollah] pose to Israel,” <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/people/natan-sachs/">Natan Sachs</a>, director of the Middle East program at the Brookings Institution, told Vox. “They feel like they&#8217;ve been successful, and they&#8217;re hoping to push their success, so that makes them less keen on a ceasefire than they have been in the past.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That is to say, the abstract and shifting nature of Israel’s demands may be the point; it’s impossible to find a workable solution when it’s not clear what one side wants or when its demands will be satisfied. And with US support still strong, there’s no real reason for Israel to compromise.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hamas’s aims have been more concrete throughout the negotiating process, although as fighting persisted beyond just a few months, the presence of Israeli troops in Gaza added a new valence to the group’s demands.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, “you&#8217;ve got Hamas that&#8217;s insisting on a complete and total cessation of hostilities, on full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, it&#8217;s demanding the return of people from the south back to the north. And obviously, the release of prisoners [from Israeli prisons]. And that just doesn&#8217;t gel well with what Israel is demanding, which is the complete and total destruction of Hamas,” Tahani Mustafa, Palestine analyst at the International Crisis Group,<strong> </strong>told Vox in May.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Five months later, those remain Hamas’s goals.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to Mustafa, Hamas also has a larger goal with any ceasefire negotiation: cementing a permanent status for a Palestinian state in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/5/2/hamas-accepts-palestinian-state-with-1967-borders">Gaza and the West Bank,</a> as well as the right of Palestinians to return to their ancestral homes in what is now Israel, both goals laid out in the group’s <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/5/2/hamas-accepts-palestinian-state-with-1967-borders">2017 charter</a>.&nbsp;But Netanyahu has repeatedly made clear that he will not accept a Palestinian state of any sort. And <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/05/30/assessing-the-future-in-light-of-the-war/">public opinion polling from May</a> indicates many Jewish Israelis don’t believe it’s possible to live peacefully alongside Palestinians.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Hamas&#8217;s vision is a two-state solution,” Mustafa said. However, she added, “They won&#8217;t ever openly give up the notion of a full, free Palestine” —&nbsp;that is, establishing a state that encompasses all of historic Palestine, an area that includes Israeli territory.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hamas does understand “that reality will not allow for that, which is why they also accept a two-state solution,” Mustafa said. “So for Hamas, the objective is to jump-start those negotiations.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, meanwhile, presents a circular problem. Hezbollah initially ramped up its attacks on Israel in support of Hamas; it has fired rockets at Israel since October 8, 2023, maintaining that attacks will only stop when a Gaza ceasefire is reached. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/08/middleeast/hezbollah-endorses-lebanon-ceasefire-first-time-israel-war-intl/index.html">Hezbollah leadership recently signaled they’d support a truce not tied to Gaza</a>, but it’s unclear whether that’s now official policy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That ceasefire doesn’t appear to be forthcoming, which means — unless Hezbollah has indeed changed its stance— Israel will continue its invasion of Lebanon and potentially push further into the country.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The US isn’t pulling its weight, and the UN is toothless</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The ceasefire talks are complex, multi-party affairs; Egypt and Qatar are important mediators, since they both have relationships with both Israel and Hamas. Though the US and the international community have been able to mediate Israeli conflicts with its neighbors in the past, they just don’t have as much sway now, for a number of reasons.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“US influence, and US ability to dictate events, or at least control them and control the narrative, has been diminished in many respects,” <a href="https://www.stimson.org/ppl/andrew-hyde/">Andrew Hyde</a>, director and senior fellow at the Stimson Center, said. That’s partly because the US is no longer the same kind of dominant regional power it was in the late 20th century; Iran has been able to grow its influence in recent decades, as has Russia.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the past, the US and the international community have succeeded in pausing hostilities, both when Israel has invaded Lebanon and in operations against Hamas. Sometimes this happened through the United Nations, like in 1978 when the UN Security Council <a href="https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/71622?ln=en&amp;v=pdf">implemented a resolution calling for Israel to leave Lebanon</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other times, US&nbsp; presidential administrations have <a href="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2021/05/24/ronald-reagan-wasnt-afraid-to-use-leverage-to-hold-israel-to-task/">directly intervened</a>, like when President Ronald Reagan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/10/us/politics/biden-reagan-israel.html">withheld shipments of artillery and fighter jets over Israel’s bombings of Beirut in 1982 and 1983</a>, or when the first <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/george-hw-bush-israel-palestinians-progressives_n_60a6d388e4b0a25683107530">Bush administration used access to funding</a> to pressure Israel over illegal settlements in the Palestinian territories.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="http://Annelle Sheline, a research fellow in the Middle East Program at the Quincy Institute">Annelle Sheline</a>, a research fellow in the Middle East program at the Quincy Institute, argues that today, the US could take similar actions to rein in Israel — in Gaza and in Lebanon — but it has little interest in doing so.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>“</strong>The US government has said that <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/30/us-israel-military-hezbollah-00181797">they aren&#8217;t actually seeking a ceasefire in Lebanon</a>, which is fairly astonishing, given that Israel is engaged in this blatant violation of the UN Charter by invading Lebanon,” Shilene said. “About the failure of the administration to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza … for me, the short answer is just that the United States is not using any leverage to actually get to that outcome. So it seems clear to me that this is not actually the desired outcome of the administration.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-humanitarian-aid-blinken-austin-887ae388a022215f71309ab6def12103">recently warned Netanyahu</a> that they would consider halting weapons shipments unless the humanitarian situation in Gaza improves, the US has largely failed to use the fact that it has supplied nearly <a href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2023/2024/Costs%20of%20War_US%20Support%20Since%20Oct%207%20FINAL%20v2.pdf">$18 billion in materiel and related assistance</a> over the past year to push Israel to deescalate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Iran is not an actor in ceasefire negotiations, although there are increased outright attacks between itself and Israel. But it does play a role in these conversations because both Hamas, and to a much greater extent Hezbollah, are part of a network of groups called the Axis of Resistance fighting Israel under Iran’s aegis. Broadly, these groups are fighting on behalf of Palestinians, and it’s unlikely Iran or any of its affiliated groups will give up until there is a ceasefire in Gaza.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And the Iranian government itself faces <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/war-drums-beat-crisis-hit-iranians-cheer-fear-or-simply-shrug-2024-10-02/">an internal crisis of legitimacy</a>, and it needs a win. A Hamas or Hezbollah victory would provide good public relations for Iranian leaders, and that can’t come if there’s a ceasefire.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Part of the Axis of Resistance strategy since October 7 has been to show that the unity of arena strategy that has brought the Axis groups together — they want to show that it&#8217;s working,” <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/our-people/sanam-vakil">Sanam Vakil</a>, director of the MIddle East and North Africa program at Chatham House, said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though many nations —&nbsp;particularly in the Global South —&nbsp;and global institutions like the International Court of Justice and the United Nations have demanded a ceasefire and pushed for Israel to end its occupation of Gaza, the West Bank, and Jerusalem, the role of these institutions will remain minimal for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s because the US’s goals in the conflict don’t comport with those of international institutions, Hyde said. With veto power on the UN Security Council, the US has a great degree of power over the very mechanism through which international law is supposed to be carried out.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Institutions get rolled over pretty easily. In the case of the Israeli situation right now, where a lot of the things that the UN should be standing for, and has tried to stand for both in its leadership and in its charter, doesn&#8217;t fit with this Israeli government in any way, shape, or form,” Hyde said. “[Israel] has made a point of not only not respecting it, but openly defying it. And then, the US isn&#8217;t necessarily weighing in on behalf of the institutions, to the Israelis, to say, ‘Well, you know, you really have to respect this.’”</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">On Thursday night, the Texas Supreme Court handed down an <a href="https://www.txcourts.gov/supreme/orders-opinions/2024/october/october-17-2024/">extraordinary order</a> saving Robert Roberson from execution — but potentially not for very long.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Roberson was convicted in 2003 of murdering his daughter on the theory that she died of “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/dmcn.15676">shaken baby syndrome</a>.” However, in an extraordinary turn of events, it now appears likely that Roberson is innocent. Not only that, but it is far from clear that his daughter <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a349_8m58.pdf">was even a victim of murder in the first place</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One reason to doubt the conviction is that modern science looks at shaken baby syndrome with increasing skepticism. More importantly, however, the evidence in Roberson’s case suggests that his poor girl actually died from a combination of pneumonia and medications that should never have been prescribed to such a young patient, and that the injuries that a 2003 jury attributed to child abuse <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a349_8m58.pdf">may have resulted from a surgery</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another reason why the order in <em>In re Texas House of Representatives</em> is so extraordinary is that it involves what may be an unprecedented conflict between the state’s legislature and its governor. Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott (R) has the power to issue a 30-day pause on Roberson’s execution (although not to grant him permanent clemency) but has thus far refused to do so, and the state intended to execute Roberson Thursday night.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The day before, however, a bipartisan group of state lawmakers <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/16/us/robert-roberson-texas-execution-advocates/index.html">issued a subpoena</a> seeking Roberson’s testimony before a committee of the state’s House of Representatives. This hearing isn’t scheduled until Monday, and Roberson obviously could not comply with this subpoena if he had been killed Thursday night.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So Roberson’s case raises what may be a unique separation of powers issue under the Texas Constitution: Can Texas’s executive branch of government carry out an otherwise lawful execution if doing so would prevent its legislative branch from hearing testimony from a witness it has already subpoenaed?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Roberson’s case has proved to be divisive within Texas’s Republican-controlled government</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Texas Supreme Court’s order in <em>Texas House</em> has nothing to say about whether or not Roberson is innocent. Indeed, the state Supreme Court isn’t ordinarily allowed to weigh in on criminal appeals at all — those are handled by an entirely separate court known as the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which has repeatedly denied relief to Roberson. Nor did the state Supreme Court definitively rule on whether the House’s subpoena can halt an execution.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead, in a concurring opinion joined by two other justices, Justice Evan Young explains that he voted to temporarily halt Roberson’s execution in order to give the courts time to figure out what is supposed to happen in the unusual circumstance when the legislature seeks testimony from a death row inmate on the eve of his execution.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We do not have clear precedent on this question,” Young writes, which is unsurprising given the highly unlikely situation that led to this case coming before his court.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Two other aspects of the case are worth noting. One is that this case has pitted many of the states’ Republicans against each other. While Abbott, who has yet to intervene on Roberson’s behalf, is a Republican, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/16/us/robert-roberson-texas-execution-advocates/index.html">so too are the two Texas lawmakers</a> who introduced the resolution to subpoena Roberson. Every justice on the Texas Supreme Court is a Republican, as is every judge on the Court of Criminal Appeals, which most recently voted 5-4 to deny relief to Roberson.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The other aspect is that Roberson’s fate likely rests with Texas’s Board of Pardons and Paroles, which already <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/texas-board-rejects-clemency-robert-roberson-set-executed-shaken-baby-rcna175481">voted once on Wednesday not to recommend clemency for him</a>. If this board recommends clemency, Abbott may commute Roberson’s death sentence altogether. Without a clemency recommendation, however, Abbott can only delay the execution by 30 days.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For now, Roberson’s attorneys are trying to buy him time. At most, the legislative subpoena may prevent Texas from rescheduling his execution until after Monday, when his testimony is supposed to occur. Then it’s likely up to Abbott to grant him another 30 days to convince the pardon board to reverse its decision.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The striking thing about this case, however, is that virtually everyone who has touched it wants Roberson to live except for the few people in Texas’s government (the Court of Criminal Appeals, the pardon board, and Abbott) who actually have the power to save him. One of Roberson’s advocates is Brian Wharton, the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a349_8m58.pdf">lead detective in his case who now believes he is innocent</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another is US Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who penned a 10-page statement explaining that the US Supreme Court is unable to intervene because Roberson does not claim that any of his rights under federal law are being violated. Yet, while Sotomayor agreed that she is powerless because Roberson “presents no cognizable federal claim,” her statement <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a349_8m58.pdf">practically begs the state officials who can actually save Roberson’s life to do so</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“An executive reprieve of thirty days would provide the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles with an opportunity to reconsider the evidence of Roberson’s actual innocence,” Sotomayor writes at the end of that statement. “That could prevent a miscarriage of justice from occurring: executing a man who has raised credible evidence of actual innocence.”</p>

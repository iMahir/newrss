<p class="has-text-align-none">There is good news in Friday’s Supreme Court decision in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-915_8o6b.pdf"><em>United States v. Rahimi</em></a>: The Court concluded that at least some people subject to domestic violence restraining orders do not have a categorical right to own a firearm, and upheld a law preventing them from doing so. While <em>Rahimi</em> produced a maze of concurring and dissenting opinions, eight justices ultimately agreed that a man who literally threatened to shoot the mother of his child should not be armed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there’s also bad news: Chief Justice John Roberts’s majority opinion is utterly incoherent.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It does nothing to clear up the mass confusion created by the Court’s 2022 decision in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-843_7j80.pdf"><em>New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association v. Bruen</em></a>, which held that all gun laws are unconstitutional unless the government can “demonstrate that the regulation is <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-843_7j80.pdf">consistent with this Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation</a>.” That decision threw gun regulation throughout the United States into chaos and prompted an unusually long list of complaints from sitting judges.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In <em>Rahimi, </em>the far-right US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2023/2/2/23583377/supreme-court-guns-domestic-abuse-fifth-circuit-second-amendment-rahimi-united-states">struck down a federal law</a> banning people subject to domestic violence restraining orders from owning guns. Yet, while the Fifth Circuit has a <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/12/27/23496264/supreme-court-fifth-circuit-trump-court-immigration-housing-sexual-harrassment">history of taking liberties</a> with the law to achieve conservative results, its decision in the <em>Rahimi </em>case was correctly decided under <em>Bruen</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Justice Clarence Thomas persuasively argues in dissent, <em>Bruen</em> <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/10/24/23914235/supreme-court-domestic-violence-abusers-gun-policy-us-rahimi">compelled the Fifth Circuit to rule that domestic abusers do</a>, indeed, have a Second Amendment right to own a gun. Friday’s decision in <em>Rahimi</em> essentially carves out an exception to <em>Bruen</em> that is just large enough to allow Zackey Rahimi, the cartoonishly violent individual at the center of this case, to be disarmed. But Roberts’s opinion does little else. And it provides absolutely no meaningful guidance to lower court judges who are struggling to apply the vague “historical tradition” test announced in <em>Bruen</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, in a concurring opinion, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson quotes a dozen different lower court opinions begging the Supreme Court to tell them how, exactly, <em>Bruen </em>is supposed to work. As one of those opinions warns the justices, “courts, operating in good faith, are <a href="https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/22/22-60596-CR0.pdf">struggling at every stage of the <em>Bruen</em> inquiry</a>. Those struggles encompass numerous, often dispositive, difficult questions.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jackson urges her Court to abandon <em>Bruen</em> entirely, and suggests that the justices should instead <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/27/20879906/second-amendment-guns-supreme-court-new-york-moot-brett-kavanaugh-nra">reinstate a two-step framework</a> that “every court of appeals evaluating whether a firearm regulation was consistent with the Second Amendment” used in the period following a <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/554/570/">landmark 2008 guns decision</a>, at least before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger</a> justices decided that they knew better in the <em>Bruen</em> case.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But, alas, that will not happen — most likely for as long as this Court’s 6-3 Republican supermajority gets to decide how the law works. Instead, the Court handed down an incomprehensible decision that also does little more than hold that one of the most dangerous people in the United States cannot own a gun.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While Roberts’s opinion upholds <em>part</em> of the federal law disarming domestic abusers, it doesn’t even declare the entire law constitutional, leaving open the possibility that future courts could allow at least some very dangerous individuals to own guns.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Roberts’s majority opinion is pure gobbledygook</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <em>Bruen </em>decision placed an enormously high burden on any government lawyer trying to convince a court that any gun law is constitutional. To show that a gun law is consistent with “this Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation,” the government had to point to “analogous regulations” that existed when the Constitution was framed. And the government carried a particularly high burden when it hoped to enforce a law that addresses “a general societal problem that has persisted since the 18th century.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Bruen, </em>in other words, was a bold experiment in “<a href="https://www.vox.com/21497317/originalism-amy-coney-barrett-constitution-supreme-court">originalism</a>,” the idea that the only valid way to interpret the Constitution is to ask how it was understood when it was crafted.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Under an honest application of <em>Bruen</em>’s test, domestic abusers absolutely have a right to own a gun. Certainly, violence between romantic partners existed in the 18th century, but there were <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/10/24/23914235/supreme-court-domestic-violence-abusers-gun-policy-us-rahimi">hardly any laws targeting this societal problem</a>, and no laws that disarmed domestic abusers. Until 1871, when the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that a husband and wife “<a href="https://flaglerlive.com/wp-content/uploads/Fulghamv.State_.pdf">may be indicted for assault and battery upon each other</a>,” all 50 states did not make it a crime for married partners to beat their spouses.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, every justice but Thomas appeared to realize that allowing Rahimi to own a gun would be untenable. Roberts’s majority opinion opens with a startling litany of Rahimi’s history of shooting guns in public when he gets angry. Among other things, Rahimi threatened to shoot two different women. He fired into a man’s home. And he fired his gun in the air at a burger restaurant after the restaurant declined his friend’s credit card.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In total, Rahimi appears to have committed six different shooting crimes — that is, crimes where he actually discharged his firearm — in addition to the threats to shoot other people.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet, rather than admit that the <em>Bruen</em> framework must be fundamentally flawed if it led a federal appeals court to conclude that this uniquely dangerous criminal has a constitutional right to own a gun, Roberts instead tries to shift the blame, claiming that “some courts have misunderstood the methodology of our recent Second Amendment cases.” He then drops two incomprehensible paragraphs seeking to clarify how <em>Bruen </em>is supposed to work.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When evaluating if a gun law is constitutional, Roberts writes, “a court must ascertain whether the new law is ‘relevantly similar’ to laws that our tradition is understood to permit.” He adds that “if laws at the founding regulated firearm use to address particular problems, that will be a strong indicator that contemporary laws imposing similar restrictions for similar reasons fall within a permissible category of regulations.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet Roberts also caveats this statement, insisting that “even when a law regulates arms-bearing for a permissible reason, though, it may not be compatible with the right if it does so to an extent beyond what was done at the founding.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So judges must ask if a modern-day law is “relevantly similar” to a founding-era gun law, whatever the hell that means. The modern law will probably be constitutional if it addresses a problem that the founders also tried to address, but not if the modern law “does so to an extent beyond what was done at the founding.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s hard not to pity the poor lower court judges who will have to apply this word salad in future cases.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In any event, Roberts claims that a modern law prohibiting Zackey Rahimi from owning a gun is constitutional because something called “surety” laws existed two or three centuries ago. These laws required “individuals suspected of future misbehavior to post a bond” — that is, to pay a sum of money that would be forfeited if they engaged in such misbehavior. As Roberts writes, these laws “could be invoked to prevent all forms of violence, including spousal abuse.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, apparently, these surety laws are “relevantly similar” enough to a modern law prohibiting domestic abusers from owning guns that Zackey Rahimi can be disarmed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s actually a pretty significant retreat from <em>Bruen</em>. As Thomas writes in his <em>Rahimi</em> dissent, <em>Bruen</em> doesn’t just create a very high presumption that any modern gun law addressing a social problem that existed in the 1700s is unconstitutional, it also states that “if earlier generations addressed the societal problem, but did so through materially different means, that also could be evidence that a modern regulation is unconstitutional.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While surety laws may have allowed some legal consequences to be imposed on early American domestic abusers, Thomas writes, they “imposed a materially different burden.” Surety laws “did not alter an individual’s right to keep and bear arms,” they merely required some individuals to pay a sum of money.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So the Court has taken some steps to weaken <em>Bruen</em>. While both <em>Bruen</em> and <em>Rahimi</em> hold that the government must show that any modern gun law is sufficiently similar to a centuries-old gun law in order to be upheld, <em>Rahimi</em> does suggest that the two laws need not be too precisely similar. As Roberts writes, <em>Bruen</em> was “not meant to suggest a law trapped in amber.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But <em>Rahimi</em>’s test is no less incoherent than <em>Bruen</em>’s, and it does nothing to allay the many complaints from lower court judges that Jackson enumerates in her concurrence. <em>Rahimi</em> simply states in vague terms that more gun laws should be upheld than were upheld in the first two years after <em>Bruen</em>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">It’s unclear if <em>Rahimi</em> even allows all domestic abusers to be disarmed</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Notably, Roberts’s majority opinion also places a great deal of weight on the fact that Rahimi brought what is known as a “facial” challenge to the federal law disarming domestic abusers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Facial challenges allege that a particular law is unconstitutional in all of its applications, meaning that a court must effectively strike it from the books. They stand in contrast to weaker “as-applied” challenges, which allege that a law is unconstitutional only when enforced against a particular party. As Roberts explains, facial challenges are notoriously difficult to win — the party challenging the law must “establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Rahimi’s case also involved the most extreme facts imaginable — most criminal defendants, even defendants charged with serious gun crimes, aren’t implicated in six different shootings. And so Roberts concludes that the federal law disarming domestic abusers “is constitutional as applied to the facts of Rahimi’s own case.” Rahimi’s facial challenge fails.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the <em>Rahimi</em> decision doesn’t even uphold the entire federal law preventing domestic abusers from owning guns. That law contains two separate provisions laying out when someone subject to a restraining order must be disarmed. The Court upholds one of these provisions, but defers the question of whether the other one is constitutional until another day.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The federal disarmament law at issue in this case applies in two different sets of circumstances. One provision prohibits anyone from having a gun if a court finds that they pose “a credible threat to the physical safety” of certain other people. The second provision applies if someone is subject to a restraining order that “prohibits the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Roberts’s opinion upholds the first of these provisions, but it leaves open for another day whether someone can be disarmed after a court orders them not to use physical force against another person. And, because the legal framework announced by the <em>Rahimi </em>majority is so vague, it is anyone’s guess how lower courts will approach this still-open legal question.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Rahimi</em>, in other words, is a monument to this Court’s arrogance, and its inability to admit its own mistakes. <em>Bruen</em> is an unworkable disaster that has caused mass confusion within the lower courts. It should be overruled in its entirety.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead, all the Court did on Friday is carve out an exception to <em>Bruen</em> for some — and not even all — people who commit domestic violence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From the outside, the policies of Israel’s government seem <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/351968/the-slaughter-in-rafah-and-israels-moral-nadir">both brutal and inexplicably self-destructive</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Its war in Gaza has claimed tens of thousands of Palestinian lives and demolished much of the physical infrastructure, like schools and hospitals, required for a society to function. Despite the massive casualties, Israeli forces have yet to <a href="https://www.vox.com/24055522/israel-hamas-gaza-war-strategy-netanyahu-strategy-morality">bring Hamas close to “total defeat.”</a> And there is still <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/354572/israel-benny-gantz-resigns-netanyahu-war-cabinet">no credible plan</a> for preventing Hamas from simply returning to power after the war, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly ruled out handing control over Gaza to the moderate Palestinian Authority (PA).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These policies have some real public support. Recent polls of Israeli Jews have found that majorities of Israeli Jews <a href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-783849">endorse the Israeli military’s conduct in Gaza</a>, believe <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/poll-half-of-jewish-israelis-say-israel-should-run-gaza-after-the-war-0-say-hamas/">Israel should maintain control over Gaza</a> after the war, and <a href="https://jweekly.com/2024/05/30/after-oct-7-just-19-of-israeli-jews-believe-a-palestinian-state-can-peacefully-coexist-with-israel/">express deep skepticism</a> about a negotiated two-state solution with the Palestinians (<a href="https://theconversation.com/as-international-support-for-an-independent-palestine-grows-heres-what-israelis-and-palestinians-now-think-of-the-two-state-solution-230575">at least for now</a>).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To understand how Israel got here, you need to understand how most Israelis think about security.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel’s ruling security ideology centers on the country’s collective “trauma,” an omnipresent word when you speak to Israelis about the conflict. Its core premise is the idea that the country has gone above and beyond to try and make peace with its neighbors&nbsp;and has been met with violence at every turn. Peace in the near term is seen as a pipedream; the need to stop terrorism and defang enemies is paramount. On this view, securing Israel requires unilateral military action — as aggressively as necessary.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This isn’t the only worldview held by large numbers of Israeli Jews; there are <a href="https://www.vox.com/23954323/return-of-liberal-zionism-israel">glimmers of an alternative on the horizon</a>. But if you want to understand why Israel is acting the way it is, you need to start by grappling with the ideology of trauma at the center of its politics.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A voice from the inside</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the best windows into this worldview I’ve encountered recently is a podcast conversation between <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-amit-segal.html">Ezra Klein and Israeli journalist Amit Segal</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To call Segal prominent is an understatement: One ranking placed him as <a href="https://thejewishindependent.com.au/whos-who-on-israels-tv-news">Israel’s single most influential journalist</a>. He is also an unabashed right-winger; <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23271726/cpac-goes-to-israel">when I attended CPAC Israel in 2022</a>, Segal’s interview with American conservative pundit Ben Shapiro was the headlining event.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That discussion was on Segal’s home turf, both literally and figuratively. The interview with Klein, by contrast, put Segal in a position to try and explain his country’s politics to the New York Times audience. The result was an unusually clear window into an Israeli mindset that outsiders often have a hard time grasping.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In broad terms, Segal tells the story of Israeli politics as <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/04/the-israeli-elections-can-the-left-be-saved.html">one of the left’s decline</a> —&nbsp;a collapse fueled in large part by the failure of its security agenda. “Israelis ceased to believe in the two-state solution, which would be achieved through a bilateral negotiation, because they saw what happened last time,” Segal says.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Understanding Israel’s war in Gaza</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel has been at war in Gaza since Hamas’s horrific attack on October 7. The war’s stated goal is to eradicate Hamas. But eight months and tens of thousands of Palestinian civilian deaths later, Hamas is still around — and top Israeli officials are questioning whether its destruction is even possible. Now, Gaza is in the midst of a humanitarian crisis, and the Israeli government has yet to lay out a plan for what happens after the war is over. Check out these stories for more:</p>

</ul>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In this story, Israel made a generous peace offer to the Palestinians during the 2000 summit at Camp David —&nbsp;only to be immediately rebuffed and met with four-and-a-half years of the Second Intifada, the most violent period of Israeli-Palestinian conflict until the current Gaza war. Shortly after the intifada ended in 2005, Israel attempted a different route to peace: unilaterally withdrawing troops and settlements from the Gaza Strip. The end result of that decision was Hamas taking over the Gaza Strip, using it as a launching pad for rocket fire and (ultimately) the October 7 attack.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This recounting is at best selective, telling only the facts flattering to Israel and leaving out its own mistakes. Jeremy Pressman, a political scientist who <a href="https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-22tq8-160f957?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&amp;utm_medium=dlink&amp;utm_source=w_share">studies</a> the Camp David negotiations, <a href="https://x.com/djpressman/status/1802729100177506618">accused Segal</a> of “peddling a completely discredited version” of events — one that makes Israel’s offer out to be more generous than his research suggests it actually was.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But setting aside truth for a moment, there is no doubt that Segal’s story is the dominant one among Israeli Jews. They don’t just believe it intellectually, but feel it in a visceral way. The past 25 years of suicide bombings and rocket fire left an open psychological wound, pushing politics to the right even in the relatively low-casualty decade before October 7.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, Segal argues, Israelis believe they have no choice but to protect themselves through force —&nbsp;and a lot of it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We will probably have to see more soldiers fighting in the north [in Lebanon] and in the south [in Gaza] for the coming years, maybe decades. And there will be a death toll. It’s not going to be a permanent war but maybe a permanent state of ongoing operations,” he says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In response, Klein suggests that this is “a theory of occupation”: that Israel can only be safe if its military is physically present and in control of Palestine and even parts of Lebanon. And indeed, Segal all but openly admits as much.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Gaza, the West Bank, and Lebanon are three very different situations. But there is one principle that most Israelis accept, in my opinion, which is that the only guarantee for the lives of Israelis is the fact that there would be an Israeli soldier in each and every place,” he says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Looming over all of this is the threat from Iran, the principal patron of both Hamas and Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For many outside Israel, it’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/353134/israel-gaza-rafah-argument">hard to imagine</a> how a terrorist group like Hamas could feel like an existential threat to a well-armed state like Israel. But from the Israeli point of view, Hamas is but one arrow in Tehran’s quiver, and it aims to eventually fire them all.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“They will spend the time in order to prepare for the last mission of destroying Israel,” Segal says. “There is a square in Tehran in which there is <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/iranians-parade-missiles-shout-death-to-israel-in-annual-rally/">a clock counting down to the year 2040</a>, in which Israel would be eliminated. And the intelligence in Israel says that they no longer see 2040 as the date but way earlier.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From the outside, Iran’s rhetoric might appear like saber-rattling — threats that are not matched by its capabilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel possesses one of the world’s strongest conventional militaries, one equipped with cutting-edge American technology. Iran’s armed forces are far weaker; it projects power primarily through asymmetric terrorist groups that couldn’t hope to defeat the IDF in open combat. Iran’s recent attack on Israel via drone armada <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024/4/15/24130346/israel-iran-attack-regional-war-april-drone-missile">proved to be a massive flop</a>. Israel’s nuclear arsenal provides an ultimate deterrent: It ensures that any serious attempt to destroy Israel would be national suicide, securing Israel even in the event that Iran <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/06/19/iran-nuclear-enrichment-fordow/">acquires its own nuclear weapon</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet none of this is reassuring enough for many Jewish Israelis. Living in a country that rose from the Holocaust’s ashes, and one that fought three wars for its survival in its first three decades, Israelis have long had good reason to worry. The events of the last 25 years demolished much of their remaining sense of security, convincing them that calm can be deceptive,&nbsp;and the risk always remains. They will tell you, over and over again, that you simply can’t understand this reality unless you have lived through the past few decades of disappointment and death.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This, more than a particular strand of Zionist theory, is Israel’s reigning national philosophy: an ideology of trauma and a vow never to let it happen again.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Can Israel change?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When you really try to think about the world through this lens, Israel’s response to October 7 becomes entirely comprehensible.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you believe (as I do) that Israel’s long-term security can only be achieved through peaceful negotiations, then there is no way to rationalize the horror in Gaza. But if you believe that peace is a mirage, as many Israelis do, then it starts to look like Israel has no choice but to pulverize Hamas. From their point of view, the thousands of civilian casualties in Gaza are a terrible necessity —&nbsp;as the only alternative is to abandon their own hope to live without fear of another October 7.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But while this outlook has fueled support for the IDF’s operation Gaza, it does not describe the entirety of Israeli Jews’ approach to politics. And this, I think, is where Segal’s narrative starts to break down.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While it’s true that trauma shapes everything the Israeli polity does, it does not unilaterally point toward more and greater aggression. Even a few months into the war, when the horror of October 7 was fresher, there were clear signs that Israel’s national political ideology <a href="https://www.vox.com/23954323/return-of-liberal-zionism-israel">did not necessitate an ever-rightward shift in its politics</a>. Those signs are still evident today.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trauma doesn’t just lead to anger: It can also produce solidarity and sympathy. During the war, this has manifested in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/06/18/israel-gaza-hamas-war-protests/">a kind of peace movement</a> centered around the demand to bring home the hostages in Gaza via a ceasefire deal. A recent poll found that a majority of Jewish Israelis care more about bringing home the hostages in Gaza than <a href="https://en.idi.org.il/articles/54052">continuing the ongoing military operation in Rafah</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Relatedly, there is immense public frustration with the current far-right government —&nbsp;and support for a swing back to the center.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/gettyimages-2157598193.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Protesters gather during an anti-government rally calling for early elections, outside the Knesset (Israel&#039;s Parliament) in Jerusalem on June 18, 2024. | Menahem Kahana/AFP via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Menahem Kahana/AFP via Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Even before the war, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was unpopular. His extreme right-wing government had been pushing a <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/2024/1/3/24022467/israel-supreme-court-judicial-overhaul-reasonableness-basic-law-overturn">law seizing power over the judiciary</a> — an overreach that galvanized the largest protest movement in Israeli history. The fact that October 7 happened on Netanyahu’s watch, and he still has not taken an iota of responsibility for the massive failure of Israeli defenses,&nbsp;led his popularity to decline even further.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, a majority of Israelis want Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to step down and <a href="https://en.idi.org.il/articles/53666">hold new elections before the end of this year</a>; polls consistently show his coalition partners losing big. The chief beneficiaries are <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-06-02/ty-article/elections-poll-gantz-favored-as-pm-opposition-bloc-win-69-seats-over-netanyahus-51/0000018f-da36-d673-ab8f-fffe578a0000">a centrist coalition waiting in the wings</a> to replace him.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Moreover, the Israeli military has grown <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2024/05/israel-defense-netanyahu-gaza-gallant/678391/">openly skeptical</a> of the country’s current direction. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-amit-segal.html">a recent interview</a>, the IDF’s chief spokesperson — Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari —&nbsp;labeled Netanyahu’s promise of “total victory” in Gaza without a political settlement a fantasy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The idea that it is possible to destroy Hamas, to make Hamas vanish — that is throwing sand in the eyes of the public,” he said. “If we do not bring something else to Gaza, at the end of the day, we will get Hamas.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So it’s important to distinguish between Segal’s explanation of consensus Israeli Jewish politics, on the one hand, and a tendency to portray his particular brand of right-wing politics as the true center. When Segal suggests that Israelis “are angry at Netanyahu because he failed to be as hawkish as they wanted,” he is engaging in precisely such projection.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But occasional overstatements aside, Segal mostly does a valuable service by explaining the beliefs that define Israeli politics today. While the future of Israeli politics is in flux, understanding its present requires grappling with the reality he presents.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Across the whole world, <a href="https://genus.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41118-024-00211-6">family sizes are falling</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In some rich countries they are now low enough that the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/01/asia/japan-demographic-crisis-population-intl-hnk-dst/index.html#:~:text=The%20demographic%20crisis%20has%20become,welfare%20systems%20and%20social%20fabric.">populations are shrinking</a>, and in at least some countries it’s become clear that this is a trend which does not necessarily level out anywhere. In South Korea, for instance, the average number of children per woman is now <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/09/asia/south-korea-government-population-birth-rate-intl-hnk/index.html">0.72, and projected to keep falling</a>. (2.1 live births per woman is the number that will maintain a stable population.) There’s almost no coming back from that.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But is that a bad thing? And does it merit a policy solution?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A lot of people are understandably shy of treating family sizes as a policy matter. On an individual level, people should have children if they want children, and people who don’t want to have children absolutely shouldn’t be parents.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s something that feels ugly around proclamations about what the population or the birth rate “should” be — especially given the <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/book-incited-worldwide-fear-overpopulation-180967499/">horrific history of mass sterilizations</a> conducted in the name of “fixing” high birth rates for the sake of the world. (It turned out that the pronouncements that birth rates would lead to global collapse <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23436211/overpopulation-population-8-billion-people">were wildly wrong,</a> and atrocities were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/22/opinion/chinas-brutal-one-child-policy.html">carried out at enormous scale</a> against the poorest people in the world for &#8230; no benefit whatsoever.)<br><br>And there’s also something distasteful about viewing children instrumentally, about creating entire new human beings for the sake of some national political project. I have three kids and am planning to have three more, and I still find something deeply upsetting about seeing people online declare that they’ll “<a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/outbreed-the-left/">outbreed the left</a>” so that their political views dominate the next generation. Don’t they realize that children are people and often don’t see eye to eye with their parents? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The people who talk the most about their duty to have as many children as possible often don’t seem to like their kids, or their lives. It’s a vision of parenthood that’s about as unappealing as it gets. And it’s an exclusionary one — those on the right who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/26/opinion/brad-wilcox-marriage-conservatives.html">champion the cause of parenthood</a> are often the very same people who <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2013/08/02/controversy-continues-over-gay-parenting-study">spent decades trying to keep it illegal for people like me to marry and have children</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Having children can be good, actually</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But with all of that said &#8230; I do, actually, think that declining population is a bad thing and merits a policy solution. Many of the goods of modern society are easier to provide at scale, so a shrinking society becomes a poorer society. Growing productivity would go toward making up for our losses instead of improving quality of life. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When individual towns and counties see their populations <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/almost-half-of-american-counties">fall by half</a>, it has deeply harmful effects on those who remain, and I don’t think that countries seeing their population fall by half will play out any differently.&nbsp;And when birth rates dip to extreme lows, countries often take extreme (and fairly silly and usually ineffective) measures to combat it, from <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/japan-launches-dating-app-boost-birth-rate-1908872">state-run dating apps</a> to <a href="https://www.agenzianova.com/en/news/South-Korea%27s-Yoon-proclaims-national-emergency-over-birthrate/">declaring a national emergency</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It seems to me like the healthiest approach to policy here is to make family-centric policy mainstream <em>before </em>there’s a national state of emergency, and to make it <em>normal. </em>And the basic <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/164618/desire-children-norm.aspx">desire for kids</a> — not for fulfilling some national goal, but simply for basic human reasons — is something that’s common, healthy, and absolutely possible to embrace without crossing any ethical lines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While there are extremists on the internet <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/01/anthropocene-anti-humanism-transhumanism-apocalypse-predictions/672230/">calling for voluntary human extinction</a> to surrender the planet to worthier animals, and extremists on the internet calling for an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/06/05/birth-control-access-abortion-ban/">end to feminism and a ban on birth control</a>, the majority of people in the United States <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2023/05/family-households-still-the-majority.html">have kids</a>. They love their kids and prioritize their kids. Many of them <a href="https://ifstudies.org/blog/the-global-fertility-gap">would have chosen</a> to have more kids if structural factors like housing and education permitted it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The factors that often stand in the way of people having the families they want in the US chiefly aren’t ideological, but depressingly mundane. High housing prices <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4685765/">discourage or delay people from having kids</a>, or having as many kids as they’d like. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s also a cultural shift at work here: I talk to a lot of young adults who never spend time with babies and children thanks to the decline in church attendance and third places where they could intermingle with people in different life stages. It’s hard to figure out if you want children if it’s a decision you have to go into blindly.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also hard to want children if you’re being told that they’re a net burden on the world. Some people <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/2/13/21132013/climate-change-children-kids-anti-natalism">worry that they shouldn’t have kids because of climate change</a>, and many more think of having children as an indulgence you have to justify instead of a prosocial act that’s part of building a good world.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The natalism conversation we should be having</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What I want is a cultural and policy conversation about how to support families that starts by addressing these problems, beginning with simple premises I think most people agree on: that having children can be awesome and a source of great joy and meaning in life, though it’s far from the only source of joy and meaning in life; that we could do a lot more to build communities in which children are supported, welcomed, and have meaningful independence; that people who don’t want kids shouldn’t have them but that people who<em> do </em>want kids should be supported in making that a priority. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think a healthy culture is one that affirms that the world we live in is good and a good place to raise the next generation, that it’s getting better and our children are among those who will join in on the great project of continuing to make it even better.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Right now, there’s a profound disconnect between the kind of person who talks on the internet about having children and the actual experience of parenthood. I think closing that gap, even a little bit, will put us in a better position for a conversation that may be one of the most important ones a society can have.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Middle-age escapist fantasies involving a sexy older woman catching the attention and affection of a younger beau seem to be having something of a moment this summer. Anne Hathaway, playing 39-year-old Solène, runs off with her boy-band paramour for a tour across Europe in <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24145269/idea-of-you-age-gaps-power-dynamics"><em>The Idea of You</em></a>, adapted from the book of the same name by Robinne Lee. Nicole Kidman falls for her daughter&#8217;s celebrity boss in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ytc2eifpiuQ">Netflix&#8217;s <em>A Family Affair</em></a><em>, </em>set to be released later this month. Even in real life (or online, anyway), fans went gaga over photos of <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/natalie-portman-paul-mescal-may-december-summer">Natalie Portman taking a smoke break with Paul Mescal</a>, and <a href="https://www.laineygossip.com/no-one-could-have-seen-potential-demi-moore-joe-jonas-situationship-coming/78335">Demi Moore having a chic lunch in the South of France with Joe Jonas</a>. It all prompted Vogue to wonder whether we’re heading into a “<a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/natalie-portman-paul-mescal-may-december-summer">May-December summer</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The fantasy of a hot older woman and a handsome young man finding love together is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/kw5rum/recommendations_maydecember_romances/">a favorite trope of romance novels</a>, where it’s considered a sexy subversion of the more common older man/younger woman love story. Yet for all that, it remains shockingly uncommon to find any of this pop culture paying sustained attention to the actual process of what it&#8217;s like to live in a woman&#8217;s body as you enter middle age. It sometimes feels as though age-gap romances are trying to will the problem of menopause away, catching their heroines right on the precipice of hormone changes, hot flashes, and fuzzy minds to say, “No, no, it’s still not too late” —&nbsp;for one last great romance, for sex, for being evaluated as a capable player on the sexual marketplace.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The heroine of <em>The Idea of You</em>, 39-year-old Solène, is caught just before perimenopause might be a concern. She can begin her affair with a younger man (20 in the book, 24 in the film) without fear of noticeable wrinkles or gray hairs. She’s more of an adult than her boyfriend, but the world has not yet begun to perceive her as middle-aged or as sexually irrelevant. Moreover, in the film, Hathaway doesn’t look all that much older now than she did in <em>The Princess Diaries</em> 23 years ago. Significantly, the action of the plot has to stop well before middle age becomes undeniable. Solène dumps her young boyfriend before she turns 41, leaving menopause to lurk in the shadows, the unspoken horror the whole book and movie are talking circles around.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“Women in our culture are taught to measure our self-worth in terms of how desirable men find us”</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the literary landscape, at least, we’ve begun to see authors attempting various strategies to turn the lens of fiction onto menopause over the last few years. In 2019, Sarah Manguso, sent into early menopause by a hysterectomy, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/06/24/where-are-all-the-books-about-menopause">chronicled her search for menopause literature in the New Yorker</a>. She found memoirs and essays and hoped for “a wave of work by and about women undergoing what is, quite literally, a once-in-a-lifetime experience.” In 2023, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/03/all-the-rage-the-rise-of-the-menopause-novel">the Guardian hailed the rise of “hot-flush lit,”</a> citing a new run of magical realist novels that aim to do for menopause what Stephen King did for menarche with <em>Carrie</em>, using horror and superpowers as a metaphor for the hormonal roller coaster.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, Miranda July has entered the chat with her new novel <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/all-fours-miranda-july/20578438?ean=9780593190265"><em>All Fours</em></a>, already rejoicing in the title of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/05/style/miranda-july-all-fours-profile.html">the first great perimenopause novel</a>. July, who is also a filmmaker and performance artist, is the kind of writer critics call “kooky” in a way that reads as part admiring, part condescending. She’s long been preoccupied with what sex is like for women, and now, at age 50, she’s taking on menopause.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In <em>All Fours</em>, an unnamed 44-year-old narrator tries to set off on a road trip from LA to New York City, only to decide instead to stop in a motel in a crummy suburb 20 minutes from her house, blow $20,000 on redecorating the room, and embark on a sexless affair with a younger man. Struggling to explain herself to her husband, the narrator comes up with the brilliant idea to tell him that she’s started menopause so he’ll stop asking questions. When she finds out that she wasn’t actually lying and that she has, in fact, begun perimenopause, she does not take the news well.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What makes <em>All Fours</em> feel so fresh and exciting is how brashly and confidently it handles the dilemma that <em>The Idea of You</em> and its ilk can only talk around: Women in our culture are taught to measure our self-worth in terms of how desirable men find us. We’re also taught that once we reach menopause, we’re no longer desirable. So what happens to us then?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Maybe, <em>All Fours</em> dares to suggest, we can have our escapist fantasy and also make it not so escapist.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">“I would never get what I wanted anymore, man-wise”</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the outset of the novel, the narrator of <em>All Fours</em> considers older women to have forfeited their desirability. As such, she finds them beneath contempt, disgusting and hateable. When she sees an older woman at the gynecologist, she imagines “gray labia, long and loose, ball sacks emptied of her balls.” She marvels that the woman is “seemingly unbothered or unaware that she had nothing to look forward to, cunt-wise.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the narrator, the prospect of the loss of sexual currency feels like the loss of life itself. She’s got family history backing her up. Her grandmother and aunt both died by suicide at the age of 55, finding it unbearable to see their looks go.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So when the narrator realizes she is attracted to 31-year-old Davey, the second person she talked to in the LA suburb where she’s holed up, she is immediately struck by a horrible thought: she is too old for him. “This was my first experience of being too old,” she muses. “Suddenly my lust was uncouth, inappropriate.” She is old enough, at 44, that the idea of her desires become a joke rather than something she can expect to have reciprocated. What makes it worse is that she knows this won’t be the case only with younger men like Davey, but with men her own age, too. “I would never get what I wanted anymore, man-wise,” she realizes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet instead of rejection, she learns that Davey is infatuated with her, too. For her, this could be interpreted in two ways: a sign that she is secretly still young, or a sign of something wrong with Davey. He seems inappropriately close to his mother; he lost his virginity to his mother’s best friend when she was in her 40s; perhaps that’s why he’s after the narrator?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Regardless, she is clinging to what feels like the last shreds of her youth, a last reprieve before she has to become grateful for the winks of 80-year-old men. She lives in fear that if she says the wrong thing to Davey, he will suddenly realize how much older she is, “like in a horror movie where the beautiful girl’s face crinkles into that of a wrinkled hag, then a skeleton, and finally a pile of dust.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet when her relationship with Davey is functioning at its best, the narrator finds herself flourishing. In her crummy motel room, now lavishly decorated into a beautiful pink space scented with tonka beans, the narrator turns off all the lights and dances with Davey. They don’t have sex, but she feels a sexual power in herself, fully present and embodied, that’s vastly different from the “mind-rooted” dissociative sex she has with her husband. She becomes someone of no particular gender and no particular age, free as a baby in the lovely pink womb she has built for herself.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Eventually, inevitably, the narrator’s relationship with Davey ends. Shortly afterward, her doctor tells her that she has entered perimenopause. For the narrator, this is a double tragedy. She isn’t only losing her erotic capital, she fears, but also the sexual power she’s only recently found in herself, her access to “body-rooted fucking.” She becomes obsessed with a graphic she finds on the internet showing a “hormonal cliff,” with estrogen production dropping off abruptly in the early 40s.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“That’s it. It’s over,” she tells her best friend. She has officially entered the part of her life where age-gap romance heroines fear to tread.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The book is only halfway through at this point. It’s as though July is saying, “You don’t know over.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">“Practicing oneness”</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In traditional age gap stories, the older woman’s redemption comes from the love of a younger man. In <em>All Fours</em>, the narrator’s redemption comes in two ways. The first is by having sex with Audra, the older woman to whom Davey lost his virginity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Throughout the first half of the novel, the narrator pitied and detested Audra as someone who used to be a great beauty but is now clearly over the hill. Once in bed with her, however, the narrator comes to find Audra sexy, not in spite of her age, but because of it. “Her skin was beginning to thin with age, like a banana’s, but instead of being gross it felt incredible, velvety warm water,” the narrator muses.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By the end of their night together, the narrator has begun to let go of her horror at the idea of age. It has begun to seem possible, she realizes, to “not outpace oldness exactly, but match its weirdness, its flagrant specificity, with one’s own.” The idea is not to stop time before menopause has a chance to arrive, but to find what is strange and sexy and exciting in the experience of age: to neither deny age nor allow it to make one sexless, but to find sex and power in age itself.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The narrator’s second redemption comes from her decision to hold onto her motel room. Negotiating new boundaries for marriage with her husband, the narrator meets her friends and different lovers there every Wednesday night and interrogates them about how they feel about marriages, aging, and sex. The pink beauty of the room breaks down all barriers: her friends bathe and eat butter cookies and give her massages while they talk. The motel room is, the narrator comes to realize, a place where she can become a version of herself unburdened by age or gender, with or without lust running the show.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As the narrator “practices oneness,” her fears seem to vanish or reorganize themselves. She remakes her marriage, her motherhood, and her work so that she no longer feels trapped within them. The graphic of the hormonal cliff vanishes from the internet. She learns that the hormonal science of menopause isn’t really nailed down yet, but that what is clear is that women tend to experience the best mental health of their lives after menopause. Having been forced to face the passage of time in the face, she’s been able to build a life for herself where her power does not depend on the currency of youth.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For a long time, serious literary novels have held off on the question of how to handle menopause with the prudish disgust of a teenager. Meanwhile, pop culture has devoted its energies to pretending that menopause can simply be ignored or stopped in its tracks, as though with the right amount of plastic surgery, filler, or just blessed genetics, a woman can eternally stay 29 and therefore eternally win over a man young enough to validate her sexual power.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s part of the glee animating our current moment of celebrating older woman/younger man romances. When we get excited over these stories, we start talking about how Natalie Portman, Demi Moore, Anne Hathaway, Nicole Kidman, and all the rest have not aged. Of course they have, because all of us have. What we mean is that they retain the power our culture considers a woman’s most valuable power, which is the ability to pass as a youthful sexual object, one still capable of carrying a child.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The narrator of <em>All Fours</em> is in the process of losing her ability to carry a child. She fears she is losing her ability to attract men. She looks those problems straight in the face. Then she explodes them open with effervescent joy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The United States just experienced the busiest stretch of tornado activity in more than a decade. Scientists are now trying out new forecasting methods powered by artificial intelligence that could yield precious lead time ahead of these capricious and deadly storms.   </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Between April 25 and May 27, there were only two days when <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/05/29/tornado-season-activity-deaths/">tornadoes <em>didn’t</em> touch down</a>. According to a preliminary tally from the <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/tornadoes/ytd/5?fatalities=false">National Centers for Environmental Information</a>, 1,117 tornadoes were detected between January and May of this year, the highest count over this time frame since 2011.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These menacing funnels of spinning air are deadly. Twisters over Memorial Day weekend <a href="https://www.siouxlandproud.com/weather/weather-news/at-least-21-dead-in-memorial-day-weekend-storms-that-devastated-several-us-states/">killed at least 21 people</a> across states including Kentucky, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. They’ve racked up <a href="https://wgme.com/news/nation-world/us-faces-11-major-weather-disasters-causing-over-25-billion-in-damage-in-early-2024">billions of dollars</a> in damages. They’ve also dropped down from the sky in places that rarely see them, like <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-03-02/central-california-sees-back-to-back-tornados">central California</a> and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/baltimore/news/tornado-confirmed-in-montgomery-county-during-maryland-storms/">outside of Washington, DC</a>, forcing people who may have never experienced these storms before to seek shelter that may not exist.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tornadoes remain one of the most dangerous weather events. And they buck an otherwise promising trend: While many types of <a href="https://www.vox.com/23150467/natural-disaster-climate-change-early-warning-hurricane-wildfire">natural disasters are killing fewer people</a> over time thanks to better forecasting and stronger infrastructure, tornadoes can catch people off guard.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/22465340/tornado-science-how-do-they-form-mystery">lead time for tornado warnings</a> is often less than 10 minutes, and progress has been frustratingly slow, especially when compared to other types of severe weather. (Forecasters can, for instance, predict the path of a hurricane far more accurately than they used to — three days in advance compared to just one day ahead in the 1990s.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/0etMstMiGXhrKEmQQ1dax4?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And troublingly, tornado patterns are shifting. Over the past 40 years, the number of tornadoes occurring in states like <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44304-024-00019-6">Arkansas, Mississippi, and Tennessee</a> — places more densely populated than tornado hotspots over Texas and Oklahoma — are on the rise. Tornadoes also appear to be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/climate/tornadoes-cluster-climate-change.html">clustering together more often</a>, with single thunderstorms spawning multiple twisters.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the last few years, scientists have made progress in anticipating when the next twisters will touch down. In particular, forecasters are now testing a new set of tools built on <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/machine-learning-explained">machine learning</a>, an artificial intelligence technique that trains computers to detect patterns without explicitly programming them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such forecasts won’t be able to tell a specific resident that their home is in the path of danger, but they are capable of a lot: These AI-driven programs can advise airlines to reroute traffic ahead of disruptions, allow farmers decide whether to hold off on watering their crops, and help disaster responders figure out where they should have additional emergency crews on standby.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These algorithms depend on good data to teach them, and that poses a major challenge for getting ahead of this particularly confounding phenomenon: As global average temperatures rise and as land use changes, past tornado activity might not reflect how these storms will whip through cities in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why tornadoes are so tricky to predict</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the biggest obstacles to forecasting tornadoes is their size. “In the grand scheme of the atmosphere, they&#8217;re very small-scale,” said <a href="https://www.atmos.colostate.edu/people/faculty/schumacher/">Russ Schumacher</a>, a professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University. “The biggest ones might be a mile wide. Most of them are smaller than that.” Tornadoes can rip entire homes off their foundations while houses a few blocks away are left unscathed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tornadoes are also short-lived, often just a few minutes. Detecting tornadoes with instruments like Doppler radars requires looking for subtle cues and still needs verification from <a href="https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/tornadoes/detection/">storm spotters</a> on the ground. Weather monitoring stations are often spaced too far apart to pick up smaller tornadoes before they form.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The complex physics powering these whirling towers of wind requires the <a href="https://tacc.utexas.edu/news/latest-news/2020/08/11/supercomputers-create-worlds-most-detailed-simulations-tornadoes/">processing power of supercomputers</a> to simulate. Once they form, tornadoes can touch down, lift up, and change direction with little notice. That makes it hard to issue tornado warnings more than a few minutes in advance.&nbsp;</p>

<iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/7HSTDaCxCwD9WSekidZsey?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hurricanes, in contrast, gather strength over days, can span hundreds of miles, and are visible to satellites, yielding ample time and information to generate useful forecasts, issue alerts, and get people out of the way. “I don’t think we’re ever going to have the level of specificity of forecasts for tornadoes that we do for hurricanes,” Schumacher said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most tornadoes erupt from a particular type of thunderstorm known as a <a href="https://www.weather.gov/ama/supercell">supercell</a>, which contains a rotating column of air that moves upward. According to Schumacher, they need four basic ingredients to form: a lifting mechanism that pushes air upward, instability in the atmosphere that allows that air to climb higher, a large quantity of moisture to fuel the thunderstorm, and wind shear that changes direction with altitude, thus causing the storm to rotate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But not every supercell leads to tornadoes, and not every tornado hatches from a supercell. The specific strengths and quantities of the ingredients have to be just right. A little more wind here, or a bit more moisture there, can make the difference between an ordinary thunderstorm and a rampaging swarm of twisters.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Forecasters now are really good at identifying the days when the ingredients are in place, when the potential is there for a lot of tornadoes to happen,” Schumacher said. “But it’s still really difficult to identify which of those storms is going to make a tornado.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Could AI eventually hack the twister problem?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While it’s been difficult, there have been improvements in tornado forecasting over the past decade, and artificial intelligence has sped up progress more recently. Scientists have already developed AI weather forecasting systems that can <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/12/ai-weather-forecasting-climate-crisis/">outperform conventional techniques</a> in some respects, but tornadoes remain a challenging test case. “That has the potential to make big advances but it&#8217;s still kind of in its very early stages in terms of evaluation,” Schumacher said. “This part of the field has evolved just in the last two years, so it’ll be really interesting to see in two or five years from now where it is.”&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div><div><iframe title="Can AI help us predict extreme weather?" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hU4viZzTaRc?rel=0" allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></div></div>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the conventional ways to predict weather is using <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/weather-climate-models/numerical-weather-prediction">numerical models</a>, where scientists plug their observations into complicated physics equations that generate a prediction of how weather will play out. They require good measurements, a robust understanding of the mechanisms at work, and a lot of time-consuming computational horsepower.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Researchers refined these models and enhanced their resolution in the past decade, creating a sharper picture of how severe weather forms, particularly the kinds of storms that allow the convection needed to create supercells.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Scientists have also developed a better understanding of how tornadoes are influenced by broader global factors. The recent burst of tornado activity was influenced by the shift away from the Pacific Ocean’s warm phase of its temperature cycle, known as <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/23738846/el-nino-2023-weather-heat-wave-climate-change-disaster-flood-rain">El Niño</a>. Right now, the world is coming out of one of the strongest El Niños on record, and the Pacific Ocean is shifting into <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24145756/la-nina-2024-el-nino-heat-hurricane-record-temperature-pacific">La Niña</a>, its cool phase. As this shift happens, water temperature in the equatorial Pacific tends to introduce disruptions in the atmosphere above the continental US, creating a fertile breeding ground for tornadoes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“When El Niño decays, the atmospheric waves change and can become wavier, so they have a greater amplitude,” wrote meteorology researcher Jana Lesak Houser in <a href="https://theconversation.com/midwest-tornadoes-what-a-decaying-el-nino-has-to-do-with-violent-storms-in-the-central-us-228872">The Conversation</a>. “The US often sees more frequent tornadoes when the climate is transitioning out of El Niño.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the Pacific Ocean begins to telegraph when it’s likely to shift gears months in advance, this swing between El Niño and La Niña can be a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2385">warning sign that more tornadoes are brewing</a>. Similarly, changes in the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/5/29/18643166/tornado-2019-ohio-kansas-missouri">Indian Ocean’s temperature cycles</a> can create ripples that lead to more spinning storms over North America. Known as the <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso/what-mjo-and-why-do-we-care">Madden-Julian Oscillation</a> (MJO), these cycles create atmospheric disturbances over shorter time scales that move eastward across the world and over the continental US.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“El Niño sets the stage and then the MJO is the conductor of the orchestra,” explained <a href="https://www.niu.edu/earth-atmosphere-environment/about/faculty-staff/gensini.shtml">Victor Gensini</a>, a meteorology professor at Northern Illinois University who studies tornadoes. “We had several MJO cycles this year.” The intense <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/climate-change-mexico-southern-us-heat-wave-1.7240293">heat wave over Central America and Mexico</a> last month then evaporated plenty of water into the atmosphere that served as fuel for convective storms.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now scientists are taking these historical records, present weather measurments, and computer simulations and feeding them into machine learning models to better predict tornadoes. One such <a href="https://schumacher.atmos.colostate.edu/hilla/csu_mlp/">forecasting model</a> that’s currently undergoing testing at the National Weather Service’s <a href="https://wpo.noaa.gov/csu-machine-learning-model-helps-forecasters-improve-confidence-in-storm-prediction/">Storm Prediction Center</a> could anticipate heightened tornado activity over a region several days in advance of a strike.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The idea is to use past predictions from numerical models and line them up with historical observations of tornadoes. The machine learning algorithm then connects the dots between the meteorological starting conditions and where severe weather later emerges.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Schumacher said the machine learning system has proven especially useful roughly three to seven days ahead of a storm — a period when forecasters don’t have a lot of other tools that can make useful predictions in that time frame.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/GettyImages-2156331522.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211" alt="In this aerial view, a home is crushed by a fallen tree knocked down by a tornado in the Olde Towne neighborhood in Gaithersburg, Maryland. " title="In this aerial view, a home is crushed by a fallen tree knocked down by a tornado in the Olde Towne neighborhood in Gaithersburg, Maryland. " data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A tree crushed a home after a tornado touched down in Gaithersburg, Maryland, on June 6, 2024. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Forecasters don’t want to overpromise and underdeliver when it comes to chalking out where the threats may emerge, but the machine learning model doesn’t have any compunction about drawing specific contour lines on a map of where it thinks tornadoes will crop up days from now. “I think the human forecasters tend to be a bit conservative,” Schumacher said. “[The machine learning tool] tends to be a little bit more bullish even at those longer lead times, but it’s turned out that a lot of the time it’s right.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But scientists don’t want to take their hands off the radars and leave everything up to the AI just yet either. Gensini dubbed the current strategy “human-in-the-loop AI,” where a meteorologist evaluates predictions from the machine learning model to ensure they line up with the laws of physics. At the same time, researchers also want to keep an open mind and an eye out for any new, previously unrecognized relationships in weather that can cause tornadoes that might show up in the AI forecast.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“As an expert, you look at some of these and you’re like, ‘That doesn’t make any sense. Why is the model weighting that?” Gensini said. “Maybe it’s picking up on something.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The big challenge for machine-learning forecasts, however, is that they’re learning from history.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Robust tornado records don’t go back that far and there are lots of gaps in sensor networks. And as humans alter the flows of rivers, cut down forests, and change the climate, future tornadoes will arise in a regime that looks less like the past. “If you’re seeing something or trying to forecast something that&#8217;s never happened before, then the model gets into some trouble,” Gensini said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s why a key part of developing better tornado forecasts is gaining better observations.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That requires more Doppler radars, more monitoring stations, more weather balloons, more computer networks to collect, synthesize, and share this information. To catch the tornado of the future, we need more eyes on the weather of the present.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Misinformation on the internet has never been worse. Or at least that’s my analysis of it, based on vibes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">People on TikTok are eating up videos saying a bunch of inaccurate things about the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/06/17/nx-s1-5002030/sunscreen-tiktok-misinformation-melanoma">dangers of sunscreen</a>, while the platform’s on-app Shop propels <a href="https://www.vox.com/24152358/tiktok-shop-ads-lost-book-of-herbal-remedies-bestseller">obscure books</a> containing bogus cures for cancer onto the Amazon bestseller list. Meanwhile, the presumed Republican nominee for president is fresh off what <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/17/us/politics/trump-disinformation-2024-social-media.html">appears to be a successful push</a> to neuter efforts to address disinformation campaigns about the election. Also, <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/351189/google-ai-overview-section-230">Google’s AI Overview search</a> results told people to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24162896/google-ai-overview-hallucinations-glue-in-pizza">put glue on pizza</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But this is all anecdotal. Can I prove my hunch with data? Sadly, no. The data I — or more accurately, researchers with actual expertise on this — would need to do that is locked behind the opaque doors of the companies that run the platforms and services on which the internet’s worst nonsense is hosted. Evaluating the reach of misinformation, in the present day, is a grueling and indirect process with imperfect results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For my final newsletter contribution, I wanted to find a way to assess the state of misinformation online. As I’ve been covering this topic over and over for the past while, there’s one question that keeps popping into my head: Do companies like Google, Meta, and TikTok even <em>care</em> about meaningfully tackling this problem? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The answer to this question, too, is imperfect. But there are some things that might lead to an educated guess.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Ways to measure misinformation are disappearing</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the most important things a journalist can do while writing about the spread of bad information online is to find a way to measure its reach. There’s a huge difference between a YouTube video with 1,000 views, and one with 16 million, for instance. But lately, some of the key metrics used to put supposedly “viral” misinformation into context have been disappearing from public view.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">TikTok <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/02/08/tiktok-remove-data-criticism-gaza/">disabled view counts for popular hashtags</a> earlier this year, shifting instead to simply showing the number of <em>posts </em>made on TikTok using the hashtag. <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91067850/crowdtangles-former-ceo-has-questions-about-metas-decision-to-close-the-research-tool-in-an-election-year">Meta is shutting down</a> CrowdTangle, a once-great tool for researchers and journalists looking to closely examine how information spreads across social media platforms, in August. That’s just a couple months before the 2024 election. And Elon Musk <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/11/24176247/x-likes-hidden-private-rollout">decided to make “likes” private </a>on the platform, a decision that, to be fair, is bad for accountability but could have some benefits for normal users of X. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Between all this and <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91040397/under-elon-musk-x-is-denying-api-access-to-academics-who-study-misinformation">declining access to platform APIs</a>, researchers are limited in how much they can really track or speak to what’s going on.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“How do we track things over time? Apart from relying on the platform&#8217;s word,” said <a href="https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/faculty-research/profiles/sen-ananya/">Ananya Sen</a>, an assistant professor of information technology and management at Carnegie Mellon University, whose recent research looks at how companies inadvertently fund misinformation-laden sites when they use large ad tech platforms. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Disappearing metrics is basically the opposite of what a lot of experts on manipulated information recommend. Transparency and disclosure are “key” components of reform efforts like the Digital Services Act in the EU, said <a href="https://yjernite.github.io/">Yacine Jernite</a>, machine learning and society lead for Hugging Face, an open-source data science and machine learning platform. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We&#8217;ve seen that people who use [generative AI] services for information about elections may get misleading outputs,” Jernite added, “so it&#8217;s particularly important to accurately represent and avoid over-hyping the reliability of those services.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s generally better for an information ecosystem when people know more about what they’re using and how it works. And while some aspects of this fall under media literacy and information hygiene efforts, a portion of this has to come from the platforms and their boosters. Hyping up an AI chatbot as a next-generation search tool sets expectations that aren’t fulfilled by the service itself. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Platforms don’t have much incentive to care&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Platforms aren’t just amplifying bad information, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/11/20/1039076/facebook-google-disinformation-clickbait/">they’re making money off it</a>. From TikTok Shop purchases to ad sales, if these companies take meaningful, systemic steps to change how disinformation circulates on their platforms, they might work against their business interests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Social media platforms are designed to show you things you want to engage with and share. AI chatbots are designed to give the illusion of knowledge and research. But neither of these models are great for evaluating veracity, and doing so often requires limiting the scope of a platform working as intended. Slowing or narrowing how a platform like this works means less engagement, which means no growth, which means less money.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I personally can&#8217;t imagine that they would ever be as aggressively interested in addressing this as the rest of us are,” said Evan Thornburg, a bioethicist who posts on TikTok as <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@gaygtownbae?lang=en">@gaygtownbae</a>. “The thing that they&#8217;re able to monetize is our attention, our interest, and our buying power. And why would they whittle that down to a narrow scope?“ </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many platforms begrudgingly began efforts to take on misinformation after the 2016 US elections, and again at the beginning of the Covid pandemic. But since then, there’s been kind of a pullback. Meta <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/05/23/meta-layoffs-misinformation-facebook-instagram/">laid off</a> employees from teams involved with content moderation in 2023, and rolled <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/06/16/meta-rolls-back-covid-misinformation-rules/">back its Covid-era rules</a>. Maybe they’re sick of being held responsible for this stuff at this point. Or, as technology changes, they see an opportunity to move on from it.   </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>So do they care?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Again, it’s hard to quantify the efforts by major platforms to curb misinformation, which leaves me leaning once again on informed vibes. For me, it feels like major platforms are backing away from prioritizing the fight against misinformation and disinformation, and that there’s a general kind of fatigue out there on the topic more broadly. That doesn’t mean that nobody is doing anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/28/1132021770/false-information-is-everywhere-pre-bunking-tries-to-head-it-off-early">Prebunking</a>, which involves preemptively fact-checking rumors and lies before they gain traction, is super promising, especially when applied to election misinformation. Crowdsourced fact-checking is also an interesting approach. And to the credit of platforms themselves, they do continue to update their rules as new problems emerge.   </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s a way in which I have some sympathy for the platforms here. This is an exhausting topic, and it’s tough to be told, over and over, that you’re not doing enough. But pulling back and moving on doesn’t stop bad information from finding audiences over and over. While these companies assess how much they care about moderating and addressing their platform’s capacity to spread lies, the people targeted by those lies are getting hurt.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Next month will see the release of <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>, the third Deadpool movie and first since Marvel Studios acquired the character, and insiders are predicting that the film will be a financial success. According to <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/disneys-nyse-dis-deadpool-wolverine-track-200m-opening-weekend">The Quorum</a>, a firm that tracks and predicts <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/06/deadpool-wolverine-box-office-projection-1235973545/">box office numbers</a>, Marvel should expect a $200 million opening weekend, an absolutely huge number — it would be the biggest opening for an R-rated movie in history. As such, the multifaceted marketing campaign has already kicked off, with trailers, posters, media appearances, an outing to a Taylor Swift concert, and accompanying movie merch.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The previous <em>Deadpool</em> movies were huge hits, <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt1431045/">both</a> <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2488436225/">made</a> over $700 million worldwide; and Deadpool himself (played by Ryan Reynolds) has become a fan favorite — an anti-hero with a superhuman ability to turn everything into a farce.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet, the promotion and marketing for this movie has centered on one tired joke in particular: Wolverine and Deadpool are gay.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The IMAX poster, a riff on one of the 2017 <em>Logan</em> (a dystopian western about Wolverine) poster, shows Deadpool holding Wolvie’s hand, and caressing one of his adamantium claws with his gloved finger:</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/new-imax-poster-for-deadpool-and-wolverine-v0-a91oixm0fr5d1.webp?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,29.057591623037,100,41.884816753927" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Another, a play on Disney’s <em>Beauty and the Beast,</em> shows the pair slow dancing together with Deadpool taking the place of Belle:&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A brand-new poster for ‘DEADPOOL &amp; WOLVERINE’ inspired by ‘BEAUTY AND THE BEAST’ has been released. <a href="https://t.co/XV709l6vQb">pic.twitter.com/XV709l6vQb</a></p>&mdash; Deadpool Updates (@DeadpoolUpdate) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeadpoolUpdate/status/1800894736485822670?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 12, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And audiences will have the chance to commemorate the movie with a special popcorn bucket. The container is shaped like Wolverine’s head with his oversized mouth functioning as the opening. The vessel was teased with butter goo drizzled over Wolverine’s face and Deadpool lovingly caressing it:</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The idea of Deadpool and Wolverine sharing feelings for each other could be interpreted as funny in that they’re playing against type. Although there’s a little more at work here.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Both characters are sexually fluid in their comic book source material. Obviously, the degree of that openness depends on the writers, but Wolverine, specifically in the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/9/24/20879975/marvels-house-of-x-5-review-xmen">most recent publishing era</a>, was interpreted to be <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/16/20916145/x-men-1-wolverine-cyclops-jean-grey-love-triangle-hickman">part of a polyamorous relationship</a> with fellow X-Men Jean Grey and Scott Summers. Deadpool, in the comic books, has expressed attraction to or flirted with characters like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/60xgna/deadpool_and_spiderman_having_a_moment/">Spider-Man</a> and <a href="https://www.marvel.com/comics/issue/2537/cable_deadpool_2004_20">Cable</a>, and <a href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Orksa_(Earth-616)">aliens</a>, and the embodiment of <a href="https://screenrant.com/marvel-deadpool-comics-strangest-romances/">Death</a> herself.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Movie superheroes are also usually <a href="https://bloodknife.com/everyone-beautiful-no-one-horny/">negative horny</a> (or if they are horny, it’s only <a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/why-avengers-endgame-sidelining-stucky-matters/">by accident</a>) and aromantic. Wolverine and Deadpool being gay and horny for each other goes against the grain of what superheroes generally are. But going against the grain is what Deadpool is known for as — despite being a box office blockbuster — the series has come to represent a type of <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/2/9/10949482/deadpool-review">sardonic counterculture</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Reynolds and Jackman have also supplemented the movie’s promotional tour by hanging out in real life and affirming their bromance. Reynolds and Jackman <a href="https://people.com/hugh-jackman-seen-out-for-walk-with-pal-ryan-reynolds-after-announcing-split-from-wife-7971295">were seen together</a> in September, right after news broke that Jackman and his wife Deborra-Lee Furness were getting divorced after 27 years. <a href="https://people.com/hugh-jackman-taylor-swift-ryan-reynolds-blake-lively-selfie-chiefs-jets-game-8304125">The next month</a>, the two attended a Chiefs game with Taylor Swift. This past May, the co-stars interviewed each other for People magazine, and spoke candidly about how they met (in the 2009 movie <em>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</em>) and how both cherish their relationship with each other.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The actors who play Deadpool and Wolverine are two men who aren’t afraid to be friends, go to concerts, and talk about the tenderness of their relationship. Both actors are working extremely hard to show us this movie is coming from a good place.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet the joke can’t help but feel a little listless if all it consists of is pointing and expecting someone to laugh — a kind of ironic allyship. The laugh is not meant to be mean or anti-gay but at the same time, these promotional materials and fellatio-themed popcorn vessels aren’t asserting that there’s some kind of important queer relationship here either.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s the punchline beyond: these two guys are gay for each other? I do not want to be the bearer of bad news, but this world we share is full of gay male couples as bearded and muscular as Wolverine and as snarky and annoying as Deadpool, and I can report firsthand that many of them are deeply unfunny.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The problem — and the real joke that’s missing in these promotional materials — is that Marvel and Disney, its parent company, have tried multiple times to woo LGBTQ fans and more importantly good press by continually asserting that their upcoming movies will feature a gay character.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Marvel and Disney have both been <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/disney-lgbtq-representation-parks-history-1234873940/">criticized for queerbaiting</a>, the practice of marketing a movie with supposedly <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/11/22/20975178/frozen-2-elsa-girlfriend-lesbian-queer-review">queer characters</a> or LGBTQ romantic plots but never actually depicting them on screen.&nbsp;An example: Disney spent a lot of time and money hyping its <a href="https://www.out.com/film/2022/3/22/disneys-first-out-lgbtq-gay-characters">first gay character</a>, a <a href="https://www.advocate.com/commentary/2020/3/07/lgbtq-character-disneys-onward-feast-cyclops-scraps">lesbian cyclops police officer</a> in 2020’s <em>Onward</em>. As if that combination of words isn’t comical in itself, the character’s big gay moment was a passing line about her girlfriend. As <a href="https://www.out.com/film/2022/3/22/disneys-first-out-lgbtq-gay-characters#rebelltitem3">Out highlighted</a>, a lot of these “gay” moments in Disney movies are nothing more than brief cameos or small wrinkles in animation. And Disney congratulating itself for these inconsequential crumbs can’t help but make one a little cynical.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Marvel isn’t much better.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/04/avengers-endgames-gay-moment-just-feels-exhausting.html#:~:text=Joe%2C%20one%20of%20the%20two,it%20appeared%20in%20their%20movie.">The first gay guy in the MCU</a> was a nameless character talking about his date in <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>. Since then, multiple actors and directors have talked about characters (Valkyrie and Captain Marvel in particular) as <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2022-07-05/valkyrie-thor-love-thunder-mcu-queer-romance">queer or gay in promotional interviews</a> but none of the material ever seems to <a href="https://www.out.com/film/captain-marvel-valkyrie-cut-scene">make the final cut</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Making fun of a one-eyed purple policewoman with a purple haircut created by the establishment as a gay token is the type of thing that Deadpool, a character who’s supposed to be irreverent and sarcastic, would spoof. That Disney, a massive entertainment giant that holds the purse strings of dominant culture, now owns Deadpool is sort of the rub too. What should feel edgy and raunchy can’t help but feel a bit sanded down or restrained.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How subversive can Deadpool be, if he’s owned by the wealthiest cultural force in the world? Was he ever subversive in the first place? Could he ever be? Surely Deadpool could be more shocking and revolutionary than two men holding hands.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To be clear, I do not care if Deadpool and Wolverine are or aren’t in a relationship. Representation in a Marvel movie is not going to move the needle in either direction. Someone made the <a href="https://x.com/bigmonkeong/status/1803085479228699010">brilliant observation</a> that getting queerbaited by Disney or Marvel would be like losing to a dog at chess. I just hope the movie is funnier than it’s being sold.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Honduran President Xiomara Castro recently announced plans to build a “mega prison” capable of housing 20,000 people to manage the country’s crime problem. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s part of an increasingly popular proposition in Latin American countries — fighting drug trafficking and gang violence with harsh carceral measures — but it’s also a subversion of the rule of law and a human rights debacle that may not be a sustainable solution to the region’s problems.</p>

And his policies are massively popular; he won reelection in a landslide earlier this year and now has a supermajority in the legislature. But his policies have also contravened the rule of law in the Central American country, ignoring individual civil rights and undermining democracy. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That hasn’t stopped a number of leaders across Latin America —&nbsp;from <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/06/24/ecuadors-risky-war-on-narcos">Ecuador’s banana-fortune-heir-turned-novice-politician Daniel Noboa</a> to <a href="https://www.geopoliticalmonitor.com/the-latin-american-left-can-have-its-own-mano-dura/">Chile’s progressive Gabriel Boric</a> —&nbsp;from celebrating his approach or adopting parts of it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hondurans are desperate for a similar fix to the system of extortion, narco-trafficking, and violence that impacts their lives, and Castro has promised her new facility on <a href="https://apnews.com/article/honduras-island-prison-xiomara-castro-environment-gangs-bukele-b4c0103fa4e420694535fb5e15b3a7c3">Great Swan Island</a> — coupled with <a href="https://apnews.com/article/honduras-prison-crackdown-megaprison-gang-violence-drugs-64ade5841d6ba79f397f00">additional measures to combat violence</a>, such as further militarizing the police response to organized crime, legally classifying drug traffickers terrorists, and<a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/06/17/2024/honduras-megaprison-plan-will-double-countrys-capacity"> holding mass trials</a> for suspects — will usher in a new era of safety.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Honduras is not El Salvador, however, and differences in the two countries’ political structure, legal systems, topography, and the criminal groups’ main source of revenue mean it’s not clear how successful Castro’s plans will ultimately be, either in minimizing crime or in sustaining her political popularity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s more, hardline approaches that countries like Colombia and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/12/02/end-mexicos-disastrous-war-drugs-once-and-all">Mexico</a> have implemented militarized approaches to gang and drug-related violence before — and not only have <a href="https://hir.harvard.edu/americas-failed-war-on-drugs-in-colombia/">previous iterations of those approaches</a> not worked, <a href="https://insightcrime.org/investigations/how-mano-dura-is-strengthening-gangs/">they’ve made the problem worse</a> in the long run, causing the drug trade and gang violence to shift and grow without addressing underlying social problems that contribute to illicit activity.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s behind the Latin American super prison trend?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/3/5/23621004/el-salvador-prison-bukele-ms13-barrio-18">El Salvador</a>,<a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/democracy-dies-under-mano-dura-anti-crime-strategies-northern-triangle"> Honduras, and Guatemala</a> have long struggled to contain the brutal gang violence that has dominated daily life for decades. In El Salvador, extortion, kidnapping, murder, smuggling, and other brutalities have persisted, to some degree, <a href="https://insightcrime.org/el-salvador-organized-crime-news/el-salvador/#History">since the late 1990s </a>due to the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/El-Salvador/The-postconflict-era">social, economic, and political instability</a> left by the civil war, which ended in 1992.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many successive presidential administrations have adopted the mano dura, or “iron hand” tack, instituting harsh crackdowns to mitigate the violence. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In fact many Latin American countries attempted to stem drug- and gang-related violence <a href="https://www.wola.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/765713-1.pdf">using this iron-fist approach in the early 2000s</a> — only to have it backfire and make the problem worse by causing criminal organizations to factionalize and then battle each other for dominance, as in Mexico under former Presidents Felipe Calderón and Enrique Peña Nieto. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Bukele is on an entirely different level; he built a <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/3/5/23621004/el-salvador-prison-bukele-ms13-barrio-18">super prison capable</a> of holding 40,000 people, and his administration has used it to imprison tens of thousands, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2022/12/07/we-can-arrest-anyone-we-want/widespread-human-rights-violations-under-el">many arbitrarily</a>; repeatedly extended a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/05/02/el-salvador-evidence-serious-abuse-state-emergency">state of emergency</a> severely curtailing the rights of ordinary citizens; and attacked and even detained his critics in the press.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s also different about <a href="https://www.reuters.com/pictures/more-than-2000-inmates-transferred-mega-prison-el-salvador-2024-06-14/">Bukele’s version of mano dura: It actually<em> </em>seems to be reducing gang violence</a> and boosting his popularity, which inspires other leaders hoping to <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-podcast/2024/2/11/24067962/el-salvador-vote-democracy-bukele-dictator-gangs-crypto">achieve his level of popularity</a> (he won more than <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/el-salvador-president-bukele-poised-another-landslide-voters-head-polls-2024-02-04/">80 percent of the vote</a> in his<a href="https://www.usip.org/publications/2024/02/el-salvadors-bukele-worlds-coolest-dictator-philosopher-king"> unconstitutional</a> 2024 reelection bid) — or at least hang on to power. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The Bukele phenomenon is spreading out across Latin America and for a president of a small Central American country, he has gained a huge stature across the subcontinent,” Juan Albarracín Dierolf, a political scientist at the University of Illinois, Chicago, told Vox. “And he&#8217;s recognized in public opinion, in ways that none of his predecessors were across different countries of the region.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bukele’s approach appears to have dramatically reduced homicides in his country and genuinely improved many people’s lives. “We are celebrating, thanking him, thanking God, for getting us out of this gang problem. We don&#8217;t want to go back to that horrible past,” voter Guadalupe Guillen <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/el-salvador-president-bukele-poised-another-landslide-voters-head-polls-2024-02-04/">told Reuters in February</a>. “Democracy is not at risk because all the people have voted for him.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/central-america/bukele-costs-salvadors-crime-crackdown#:~:text=Despite%20ranking%20among%20the%20most,Western%20Hemisphere%20other%20than%20Canada.">But they come with high costs</a>, ones that might ultimately undermine El Salvador’s security or stability in the long run. Press freedom in El Salvador is nonexistent, and the Bukele regime is not distributing statistics or any information about how the prisons are being managed or what efforts there are to actually bring criminals to justice and address some of the factors that contribute to organized crime, including a lack of education and economic opportunities, as well as the entrenchment organized crime within the power structure. The government has swept up about 76,000 people in its war on drugs, often without evidence. Many do not have access to attorneys and the government has denied them due process. Families have no idea when — or if — their loved ones will be released, and at least <a href="https://apnews.com/article/el-salvador-bukele-central-america-crime-gangs-60c3a34c571dfdbdf0a203deb85abf71">40,000 children have been left without a parent due to the sweeping arrests</a>. And multiple <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/01/27/el-salvador-leaked-database-points-large-scale-abuses">reports</a> about <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/02/el-salvador-human-rights-crisis-bukeles-second-term/">human rights abuses</a>, including <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/es/documents/amr29/7423/2023/es/">torture</a> and deaths in prison, have come out since Bukele instituted his anti-gang policies in 2022.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That hasn’t stopped other Latin American leaders, including Noboa in Ecuador, from following Bukele’s lead.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ecuador has become a major hub for narcotics and a battleground for the armed groups trafficking them —&nbsp;and with that, <a href="https://insightcrime.org/news/insight-crime-2023-homicide-round-up/">the homicide rate has skyrocketed</a>. The ongoing conflict recently culminated with massive armed battles in the prisons themselves, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2024/1/11/24034891/ecuador-drugs-cocaine-cartels-violence-murder-daniel-naboa-columbia-crime">perhaps most memorably armed gangs taking over a TV station and infiltrating and terrorizing other institutions</a>. In response, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ecuador-violence-prisons-television-studio-gangs-72a3df45debae4459663c462304bcf91">Noboa launched</a> an “internal armed conflict,” ordering the military to “neutralize” gangs, without worrying too much about human rights. He sent in the military to control the prisons, which had previously been run by the Los Lobos and Choneros gangs. Under Noboa, the gangs are now classified as terrorists, and the military, which has taken up a much more prominent role in policing, can consider them targets.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“While we don’t know yet how effective will Noboa be, he is following the steps that Colombia took 30 years ago to fight narcoterrorism [which had] a mixed record,” <a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/who-we-are/people/renata-segura">Renata Segura</a>, head of the Latin America and Caribbean program at the International Crisis Group, told Vox.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Reports of <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/05/22/ecuador-unchecked-abuses-armed-conflict-announcement">human rights violations, including at least one extrajudicial killing and multiple arbitrary arrests, are already emerging</a>. “It’s something which people are very aware of, very worried of, and particularly human rights organizations, civil society organizations are really scared of that, because they know what the war on drugs has meant elsewhere,” <a href="https://cepr.net/staff-member/guillaume-long/#:~:text=Nations%20in%20Geneva.-,Guillaume%20held%20several%20cabinet%20positions%20in%20the%20government%20of%20Ecuador,historian%20and%20holds%20a%20Ph.">Guillaume Long</a>, an analyst at the Center for Economic Policy and Research and former foreign minister of Ecuador, told Vox. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now Honduras is fully embracing Bukele’s mano dura<em> </em>style policies as well. But as with Ecuador, its success in Honduras is far from certain — and concerns about civil liberties are already surfacing.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Why mano dura super prisons may not quash Latin America’s gang problem</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Castro’s use of mano dura techniques isn’t new: She temporarily suspended parts of the constitution meant to protect against arbitrary detention as well as freedom of movement and assembly — implementing what’s known as <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2023/12/11/the-state-of-exception-in-honduras-is-endangering-innocent-lives#:~:text=Under%20the%20state%20of%20exception,search%20homes%20without%20a%20warrant.">a state of exception</a> — in 2022, arguing that doing so was necessary to stop crime. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her latest announcement is “another step away from the agenda that Xiomara first promised, which included focus on community policing, demilitarization, [and] prevention,” according to Andreas Daugaard, a research coordinator at Honduras’s <a href="http://institutodelajusticia.asjhonduras.com/nuestro-equipo/">Asociacion para una Sociedad mas Justa</a>, and it comes amid questions about the effectiveness of the policy. “The government started advancing that agenda in early 2022 by dismantling the anti-gang military police force (FNAMP) and removing military from prisons, yet less than one year in, extortion rates started rising.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While there is certainly drug trafficking in Honduras, extortion is also a major problem, with gang members draining victims of both hard cash and via digital means. There’s little reliable data about the economic effects of extortion, but it has infiltrated the transit sector and devastated thousands of small businesses in the past.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Corruption is deeply intertwined with the political class in the country; <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/honduras-prosecutors-accuse-two-ex-presidents-diverting-public-funds-campaigns-2023-10-11/">multiple former government officials</a> have been <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/juan-orlando-hernandez-former-president-honduras-convicted-manhattan-federal-court">implicated in corruption scandals</a>, and Castro herself has been accused of consolidating her power by <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/19/anti-corruption-advocate-flees-honduras-after-receiving-threats">putting family members and close associates in government positions</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Castro has already faced roadblocks with the mano dura policies she has put in place, unlike Bukele.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Bukele has been able to effectively reduce violence through authoritarian measures because he has full control of the main state institutions, including Congress and the courts,” Segura said. “In places with real checks and balances, it is unlikely that these types of operations would work. That has been the case, in fact, in Honduras. Castro declared [a] state of exception last year, and it did little to reduce the purported reason for it: extortions.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In fact, the Honduran government touts that 32,000 people have been arrested so far, but approximately 95 percent of them had to be released because of a lack of evidence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Partly because of these <a href="https://acleddata.com/2023/12/05/fighting-gangs-under-the-state-of-exception-in-honduras/">failures</a>, and partly because of Bukele’s massive popularity both in El Salvador and across the region, Daugaard surmises that — to show voters she’s taking action — Castro will build the prison, which is a one-day boat ride away from the mainland and communication is only possible via satellite.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though Bukele’s policies are popular, they are likely not sustainable, in El Salvador or elsewhere, Albarracín said. “In many places, it&#8217;s a very desperate security situation —  it’s hard to understand what it means to live under these circumstances. So in comes someone who says, ‘I&#8217;m going to do something,’ and does something quite immediate and visibly. So that’s kind of the charm of these policies. They’re very visible.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Castro has not outlined how this new prison will overcome systemic issues that have plagued the country’s existing carceral system. As Daugaard explained, “they already have several maximum security prisons, and the problem there was not the physical installations, but corruption of those in charge — how will they ensure that the new people in charge are not corrupt?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Also at issue is the fact that prisons and militarized police forces are expensive to maintain long-term, even if they appear to work in the short term: As it is in a remote location, Honduras’s super prison “will have a huge impact on wildlife and environment [and] it will be super expensive to move food, materials and people back and forth,” Daugaard said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are alternatives to mano dura<em> </em>— “Colombia’s Paz Total is the opposite model to Bukele (trying to negotiate with the armed and criminal groups to reduce violence and eventually demobilize the groups),” Segura said. But the strategies that could lead to a long-lasting, sustainable reduction in violence often take a long time and don’t produce exciting visuals like those Bukele and Castro have circulated in support of their policies. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Increasing the capacity of states to really prosecute — with the rule of law — criminals, the capacity to have better intelligence of how organized crime works, and how to dismantle it,” are likely more effective over time than merely imprisoning thousands of people without trial, Albarracín said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps even more important, Albarracín told Vox, is building “the capacity of the state to punish and sanction state officials [who] are engaging in these types of agreements with criminal groups,” as was <a href="https://www.wola.org/analysis/cicigs-legacy-fighting-corruption-guatemala/">successfully implemented in Guatemala </a>from 2007 to 2019, and the legacy of which arguably helped anti-corruption crusader Bernardo Arevalo to be elected president this year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These kinds of policies don’t offer immediate relief, and they often threaten powerful political interests. But they’re necessary to protect civil rights, build lasting security, and break the destructive and authoritarian mano dura cycle.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s difficult to concisely summarize the Supreme Court’s Thursday decision in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-800_jg6o.pdf"><em>Moore v. United States</em></a>, which rejects a challenge to a one-time federal tax targeting some investors in foreign corporations. But the bottom line is that <em>Moore</em> is bad news for anyone hoping that the Supreme Court would launch a comprehensive attack on the federal government’s ability to raise taxes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, the decision is still excellent news for billionaires.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Moore</em> was widely viewed as a <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/11/27/23970859/supreme-court-wealth-tax-moore-united-states">stalking horse for an attack on wealth taxes</a>. During her 2020 presidential campaign, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) proposed a 2 percent tax on all the accumulated wealth held by Americans worth more than $50 million. The idea was that, rather than merely taxing very wealthy individuals’ income and leaving their accumulated capital intact, a wealth tax would gradually chip away at the richest Americans’ fortunes and begin to bring wealth inequality under control.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The case produced a somewhat dizzying array of concurring and dissenting opinions. Seven justices agreed that the tax on investors in foreign corporations is constitutional, but Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote a separate opinion, joined by Justice Samuel Alito, which suggests that Congress may have less power to tax investors in a “domestic corporation.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s majority opinion in <em>Moore</em>, which was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and all three of the Court’s Democratic appointees, claims that it leaves the question of whether wealth taxes are constitutional unresolved. The opinion even includes a footnote stating that “our analysis today does not address … taxes on holdings, wealth, or net worth.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But that’s not true. Kavanaugh’s <em>Moore</em> opinion includes a bonanza of loaded language that any competent tax lawyer can seize upon to protect their richest clients from wealth taxes, should Congress ever actually enact such a federal tax in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, Kavanaugh’s opinion also contains some significant language that should require <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/12/27/23496264/supreme-court-fifth-circuit-trump-court-immigration-housing-sexual-harrassment">some of the most right-wing federal judges</a> to roll back ambitious plans to remake US law along MAGA lines. Kavanaugh writes that the federal government’s “long settled and established” practices carry “‘great weight in’ resolving constitutional questions.” So <em>Moore</em> warns judges who <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/9/23/23864355/supreme-court-cfpb-unconstitutional-consumer-financial-fifth-circuit-great-depression">rely on novel constitutional arguments to undermine long-existing government behavior</a> to chill out.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Moore</em> reads, in other words, like a political compromise, which may explain why the Court’s three Democrats join Kavanaugh’s opinion. Four of the Court’s Republicans — Justices Clarence Thomas, Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Barrett — all joined one of two opinions that would place stricter limits on Congress’s taxing power than Kavanaugh’s majority opinion. (Thomas and Gorsuch would have struck down the tax at issue in this case.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kavanaugh’s opinion is fundamentally a small-c conservative decision, preserving both Congress’s ability to tax Americans in familiar ways, while seeming to cut off its ability to enact novel new forms of taxation such as a wealth tax.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So what is this case actually about?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Moore</em> arises out of a provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the tax law signed in 2017 by former President Donald Trump, which <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/11/27/23970859/supreme-court-wealth-tax-moore-united-states">imposed a one-time tax on certain investors in foreign corporations</a>. This one-time tax was intended to offset lost revenue that would result from a broader package of corporate tax cuts contained in the TCJA.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Under this one-time tax, certain shareholders in foreign corporations must pay taxes on the corporation’s profits, even if those profits have not yet been distributed to the shareholders themselves. In <em>Moore</em>, for example, the plaintiffs owned stock in a foreign company that provides supplies to farmers in India. That company had earned significant income since these plaintiffs invested in it, and the TCJA required them to pay $14,729 in income taxes on the company’s income.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The question in <em>Moore</em> is whether it is permissible to tax a company’s owners on income that is earned by the company, but that has not actually been distributed to those owners.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Moore</em> says that the answer to this question is “yes.” As Kavanaugh notes, the tax code is full of provisions that require business owners to pay income taxes on the business’s income. Kavanaugh also cites a long line of Supreme Court precedents, including the Court’s decision in <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/304/282/"><em>Helvering v. National Grocery</em></a><em> </em>(1938), which establish that a corporate shareholder cannot “prevent Congress, if it chose to do so, from laying on him individually the tax on the year&#8217;s profits.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So <em>Moore</em> is fundamentally a victory for the status quo. The Court has long held that a company’s owners may be taxed on the company’s income, and <em>Moore </em>does nothing to change that.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why <em>Moore </em>is bad news for wealth taxes</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kavanaugh claims in a footnote that his opinion does not resolve the question of whether Congress could impose a wealth tax like the one Warren proposed in 2020. But the opinion is laden with language suggesting that such a wealth tax would be unconstitutional.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The most damaging section of the opinion, for proponents of wealth taxes, deals with an arcane distinction between “direct” and “indirect” taxes. The Constitution provides that “direct” taxes “<a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/article-1/">shall be apportioned among the several States</a>.” That means that if the state of New York makes up six percent of the US population, then exactly six percent of any direct tax imposed on the United States must be collected from New Yorkers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Kavanaugh notes, “that kind of complicated and politically unpalatable result has made direct taxes difficult to enact.” Neither wealth nor incomes are evenly distributed among the fifty states. So it is extremely difficult to design a direct tax that does not violate the Constitution. Indeed, Kavanaugh writes that “the parties have cited no apportioned direct taxes in the current Internal Revenue Code, and it appears that Congress has not enacted an apportioned tax since the Civil War.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But what, exactly, is a “direct” tax? Before <em>Moore</em>, the answer to this question was somewhat opaque. In <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/157/429/"><em>Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan &amp; Trust</em></a> (1895), the Court quotes a wide range of founding-era luminaries explaining what they thought a direct tax is, and their definitions are all over the map.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kavanaugh’s <em>Moore</em> opinion, however, does offer a fairly concise definition. “Generally speaking,” Kavanaugh writes, “direct taxes are those taxes imposed on persons or property.” He adds that “property taxes remain direct taxes that must be apportioned.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, “indirect taxes are the familiar federal taxes imposed on activities or transactions.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So Kavanaugh appears to be drawing a rigid line between taxing wealth (what he calls “property”), and taxing the income derived from that wealth or from labor. If an investor owns $50 million worth of stock, a tax that seeks to collect a percentage of that wealth would qualify as a direct tax, while a tax on, say, the dividends produced by that stock would be an indirect income tax.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a practical matter, that means that a Warren-style wealth tax would almost certainly be unconstitutional, because it would be nearly impossible to design such a tax in a way that complies with the apportionment requirement.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Realistically, this probably isn’t the worst blow progressives could have suffered. There were already profound practical obstacles to enacting a wealth tax, most of them arising out of the fact that it’s often <a href="http://foreignvox.com/scotus/2023/11/27/23970859/supreme-court-wealth-tax-moore-united-states">very difficult to determine the value of a wealthy investor’s assets</a>. Suppose that such an investor owns a valuable and unique work of art — a Picasso, perhaps. How is the government or the taxpayer supposed to determine the specific value of this artwork, without hiring a highly specialized art assessor to do so?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Or, for that matter, imagine a wealthy individual whose family owns a business that is not publicly traded, and whose stock has never been sold. How are tax assessors supposed to determine whether this individual’s stake in that business is worth more than $50 million, the threshold for taxation under Warren’s proposed wealth tax?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Congress has not yet enacted a wealth tax, and these practical problems probably explain at least part of the reason why. It’s relatively easy to determine how much income a particular taxpayer earned in a specific year, and to tax a percentage of that income. It’s much harder to determine many taxpayers’ precise net worth.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, <em>Moore</em> likely puts to rest any future possibility of a federal wealth tax. Given Kavanaugh’s declaration that “property” taxes cannot, as a practical matter, be enacted by Congress, Warren’s 2020 proposal is likely dead even if Democrats win enormous supermajorities in a future Congress.</p>

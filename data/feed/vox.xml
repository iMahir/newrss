<p class="has-text-align-none">Canada’s two main rail lines locked out rail workers early Thursday morning amid tense contract negotiations between the railways and the Canada Teamsters Rail Conference, which represents nearly 10,000 rail workers. Though Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has <a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/latest-lockout-railways-ongoing">said his government will take action to resolve the dispute,</a> the work stoppage could have a serious impact on the Canadian economy, as well as supply chains in both the US and Canada.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rail companies, Canadian National Railway (CN) and Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CPKC), and the union have been negotiating for months. So far, the Canadian government has not forced either party’s hand to avert a work stoppage. But if the situation drags on, the federal government may step in and force the 9,300 workers to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy76nnpyrnlo">return to their jobs through legislation, as it has done in past labor disputes</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The two rail lines facilitate the transit of people and about $740 million worth of goods across the country’s vast interior each day. The stoppage is the result of the rail companies barring their workers from work, rather than a strike. The companies argued a lockout was necessary to ensure a safe and controlled drawdown of operations and that if they waited for operators to walk off the job, the companies wouldn’t have had time to secure hazardous materials or work out supply arrangements with key customers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For now, the impact of the work stoppage is mainly on the Canadian economy, but because about 75 percent of Canadian exports —&nbsp;including coal and agricultural products —&nbsp;are sold to the US, there could be an impact on the US supply chain if the dispute isn’t resolved soon.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What went wrong with Canadian railways and what it means for Canada’s supply chain</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The two railway systems had contracts with the Teamsters union that expired in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/cn-rail-cpkc-shut-canada-rail-network-labor-talks-deadlocked-2024-08-22/">December 2023</a>. Since then, each side has accused the other of refusing to accept reasonable terms. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The union’s primary concerns, <a href="https://teamsters.ca/blog/2024/08/22/cn-and-cpkc-begin-work-stoppage/">according to its public communications</a>, have been over worker safety and rest periods, as well as predictable scheduling. They also claim that Canada National is issuing them unworkable relocation notices —&nbsp;forcing workers to move for months at a time in order to deal with staffing shortages.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rail workers voted to authorize a strike as early as May of this year, claiming that the rail companies weren’t bargaining in good faith and were attempting to undercut progress on working conditions, proposing a shift to an hourly wage rather than a salary for some positions, and removing <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cpkc-says-possible-canada-rail-strike-unlikely-before-mid-july-2024-05-23/">scheduling provisions for adequate rest</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Across Canada, we have trains [that] are carrying goods, they are carrying energy, they are carrying chemicals,” François Laporte, national president of Teamsters Canada, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy76nnpyrnlo">told the BBC</a> Thursday. “And we want to make sure that those [trains] are operated by people who get the proper rest, who are safe, who are not fatigued.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Canadian railways carry goods like coal and potash —&nbsp;<a href="https://natural-resources.canada.ca/our-natural-resources/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-and-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/potash-facts/20521">an important ingredient in fertilizer</a> —&nbsp;as well as cooking oil, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/08/21/canada-rail-strike-lockout-teamsters/">propane, and frozen food</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many shipments both within Canada and between Canada and the US were already paused; by Tuesday, CPKC had already stopped shipments that started in the US and were bound for Canada. Under the work stoppage, around 2,500 US train cars bound for Canada will be halted each day.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some organizations, like the US Chamber of Commerce, the American Farm Bureau Federation, and the National Cotton Council warned of devastating effects on the US supply chain and economy should the work stoppage persist.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Cotton Council, among others, claimed in a Monday letter to President Joe Biden that the work stoppage could cause “harmful consequences for Canadian and American agricultural producers, the agricultural industry, and both domestic and global food security” if it persisted, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/08/21/canada-rail-strike-lockout-teamsters/">the Washington Post reported</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though it’s difficult to say exactly what the impact will be on the US economy, some prices on agricultural products could go up should the work stoppage stretch on, affecting consumers already struggling with high food costs. Sanitation could be affected, as the chlorine that many sanitation departments rely on to treat wastewater is shipped from Canada. The automotive industry could be impacted, too; <a href="https://rollcall.com/2024/08/22/us-industries-prepare-for-hit-from-canadian-rail-strike/">according to June numbers from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics</a>, automobiles and auto parts made up the bulk of rail shipments from the US to Canada in June. Some US auto plants could be forced to shut down before the week is out if there’s no labor agreement.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Container ships unable to unload at Canadian ports will likely need to reroute to the US, potentially causing a backup at US ports, which could cause supply chain disruptions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Supply chain problems will become more pronounced the longer the lockout continues, although the Canadian federal government could pass return-to-work legislation in the coming days, Barry Prentice, director at the University of Manitoba Transport Institute, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy76nnpyrnlo">told the BBC</a>. The government also has the power to force the companies and the union into private arbitration; though the companies have signaled openness to that idea, the union — as well as Trudeau and his allies — are cool to it. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If it comes down to legislation, that would likely only paper over the real disputes without solving them, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-signs-bill-block-us-railroad-strike-2022-12-02/">as the US return-to-work legislation in December 2022 did</a>. Without a resolution and a new contract, forcing the workers to return to their trains only kicks the problem down the track.</p>

	<figcaption>Thursday’s Supreme Court decision could have been much worse for this woman. | Grant Baldwin/Getty Images</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/082224zr_n75p.pdf">handed the Republican Party a small victory</a> on Thursday, making it marginally harder for new voters to register to vote in Arizona.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The decision, however, could have been much worse for voting rights: Republicans asked the justices to strip thousands of already-registered voters <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/367701/supreme-court-arizona-rnc-republicans-mi-familia-vota">of their ability to vote for president</a>. Three justices voted to do just that, but six members of the Court rejected the request.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, five members of the Court — every member of the Court’s Republican majority except for Justice Amy Coney Barrett — voted to make it marginally more difficult to register to vote in Arizona.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So this is a victory for the GOP, but probably not a particularly significant one. If the three most MAGA-pilled justices, Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch, had prevailed, a meaningful chunk of Arizona’s voters could have been locked out of voting in the 2024 presidential election. But that didn’t happen.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Court’s decision to hand Republicans even a small victory here is almost certainly wrong, under a 2006 Supreme Court decision warning judges <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/06-375">not to change</a> a state’s election procedures too close to an election. But the impact of Thursday’s GOP victory is likely to be fairly modest.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Arizona’s ridiculously complicated voter registration system, explained</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The case, known as <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/082224zr_n75p.pdf"><em>Republican National Committee v. Mi Familia Vota</em></a>, involves a <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/367701/supreme-court-arizona-rnc-republicans-mi-familia-vota">ludicrously complicated system</a> that Arizona uses to register voters.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2004, Arizona enacted a law requiring voters to provide documentary proof of citizenship (such as a passport or a birth certificate) when registering to vote. This law, however, conflicts with a federal law, known as the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), which permits voters in every state to register using a standardized federal form. The federal form requires Arizona voters to swear, under penalty of perjury, that they are citizens, but it does not require the same documentary proof that Arizona’s state law requires.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8524729836774698956&amp;q=n+Arizona+v.+Inter+Tribal+Council+of+Arizona&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,47&amp;as_vis=1"><em>Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona</em></a> (2013), the Supreme Court ruled that Arizona must comply with the NVRA and allow voters who submit the federal form to register — but there was a twist. <em>Inter Tribal</em> also suggested that Congress’s power over voter registration is limited to “federal elections,” so Arizona responded to <em>Inter Tribal</em> by creating two tiers of voters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Voters who submit the state’s form (including the document proving citizenship) are registered to vote in all elections in Arizona. But voters who submit the federal form are deemed “federal-only” voters and may only vote in congressional and presidential elections — and not for state and local offices.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">An expert witness who testified in the <em>RNC </em>case estimated that “approximately one-third of a [percent] of non-Hispanic White voters [in Arizona] are Federal-Only Voters, while a little more than <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A164/322042/20240808153230794_Application%20Appendix.pdf">two-thirds of a percent of minority voters are Federal-Only Voters</a>.” So the universe of voters who registered using the federal form isn’t that large, but it is disproportionately non-white, which likely explains the GOP’s interest in this case — among other things, Republicans wanted to prevent these federal-only voters from casting a vote for president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2020, President Joe Biden lost white Arizona voters, but very narrowly won the state due to his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/exit-polls-arizona.html">strong performance among Latinos</a>. Biden’s margin of victory was only about three-tenths of a percent,&nbsp; so even a small shift in who was allowed to vote in Arizona might have changed the result.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So what was actually at stake in the <em>RNC v. Mi Familia Vota</em> case?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Republicans asked the Court to impose three restrictions contained in a 2022 Arizona state law, which has never taken effect, and which was blocked by a federal court in 2023.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That law sought to ban Arizona’s federal-only voters from voting for president, and it also would have barred them from voting by mail. Although Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch voted to allow these two restrictions to go into effect, a majority of the justices did not.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Additionally, the 2022 law sought to override a 2018 court order that allowed voters who submit the state form without a document proving citizenship to still register as a federal-only voter. Five justices voted to let this provision of the 2022 law take effect. So new voters who submit the state form without the required documentation will not be registered at all.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Voters who submit the federal form, however, will still be registered as federal-only voters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This decision to allow even a small part of the 2022 law to take effect is almost certainly wrong. The 2022 law was blocked by a 2023 federal court decision, and the Supreme Court ruled in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/06-375"><em>Purcell v. Gonzalez</em></a> (2006) that “federal courts ordinarily should not alter state election rules in the period close to an election.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thursday’s order alters Arizona’s state election rules just over two months before a presidential election. Before the Supreme Court ruled, the lower court’s order blocking all three provisions of the 2022 law was in effect. Now the rules have changed, if only slightly.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the past, the Court’s Republican majority has wielded <em>Purcell</em> very aggressively when lower court judges handed down voting rights decisions making changes that benefited Democrats. Justice Brett Kavanaugh has even suggested that the <em>Purcell</em> window opens up <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/2/8/22922774/supreme-court-merrill-milligan-alabama-brett-kavanaugh-racial-gerrymandering-voting-rights-act">more than nine months before a general election</a>. So the GOP’s request to change Arizona’s voting rules less than three months before an election should have been rejected if the justices were being consistent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, unless the 2024 election is historically close, the likelihood that Thursday’s decision will change the result of the upcoming election is small. Again, a majority of the justices voted to reject the GOP’s most aggressive attack on the franchise — the provision of the 2022 law barring federal-only voters from voting for president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are some mysteries that I fear I’ll never see resolved. Who was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._B._Cooper">DB Cooper</a> and what happened to him? Who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_Stewart_Gardner_Museum_theft">robbed the Gardner Museum</a> of its Vermeer and Rembrandts in 1990? And, most pressingly: where are the <a href="https://www.amjtransplant.org/article/S1600-6135(23)00462-8/abstract">thousands of pancreases</a> taken out of Americans’ dead bodies in 2021, 2022, and 2023 that were never transplanted into anybody?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Let me back up. Pancreata (the correct plural form of “pancreas”) are one of those organs that are difficult to live without. Without one, you don’t have insulin to regulate blood sugar or enzymes necessary to digest food. So all donated pancreata come from dead people who register as organ donors. In the US, we outsource the job of collecting organs from dead bodies to private groups called organ procurement organizations, or OPOs. Each OPO has a monopoly on organs in a particular geographic area; there are <a href="https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/about/search-membership/?memberType=Organ%20Procurement%20Organizations&amp;organType=%27AL%27&amp;state=0&amp;region=0">56 groups total</a>, some of which only cover part of a state and some of which cover multiple states.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For some time now, independent analysts and investigative reporters have argued that OPOs are underusing deceased donor organs by the tens of thousands. One report from 2019 estimated that every year <a href="https://www.bridgespan.org/bridgespan/Images/articles/reforming-organ-donation-in-america/reforming-organ-donation-in-america-12-2018.pdf">28,000 usable organs</a> (mostly kidneys but also pancreata, hearts, livers, etc.) from deceased donors are never used; another put <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/organ-transplant-shortages/?utm_term=.806b23dd755d">the number at 75,000</a>. This, when the national waitlist for organs is <a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics">more than 100,000 people long</a>.</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">

</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Historically, OPOs have faced perverse incentives. For instance, they were most often evaluated on the basis of how many organs are recovered per “eligible death,” but “eligible death” is a determination made by the OPOs themselves. That made it easy to juice the stats by, for instance, classifying some deaths as “ineligible” even when the organs were perfectly usable. That made “organs recovered per eligible deaths” go up without actually getting more people organs. OPO contracts with the federal government are <a href="https://archive.triblive.com/local/pittsburgh-allegheny/taxpayers-help-pay-for-organ-donor-groups-parties-rose-parade-expenses/">quite lucrative</a>, which means OPO executives have ample reason to <a href="https://www.pogo.org/investigations/heartless-organ-donation-contractors-lobby-against-a-popular-health-care-initiative-while-pocketing-pandemic-relief-loans">fight hard</a> to retain them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2019, President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/7/10/20687507/triump-kidney-disease-transplant">issued a quite good executive order</a> instructing the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees OPOs, to change the way they’re evaluated. The order led to two new metrics that were meant to be harder to game. The rule was finalized in December 2020, and — after also being reviewed and approved by the <a href="https://www.pogo.org/investigations/americas-transformative-new-organ-donation-rule-goes-into-effect-over-objections-from-monopolistic-contractors#:~:text=The%20Centers%20for%20Medicare%20and,effective%20on%20March%2030%2C%202021.">Biden administration</a> — <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/02/02/2021-02180/medicare-and-medicaid-programs-organ-procurement-organizations-conditions-for-coverage-revisions-to">took effect in March 2021</a>. It came with real teeth: OPOs that did particularly badly would face decertification, meaning another OPO with a better track record of serving patients would take over their territory.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rule had the potential to force OPOs to collect more organs and save thousands more lives every year. But the OPOs quickly figured out a new loophole.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The birth of the pancreas loophole</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rule’s new metrics were meant to be based on objective criteria. It asked OPOs to tally the total number of deceased people 75 and younger with causes of death compatible with donation, and then estimate the number of deceased donors each year as a share of that total population, and the number of organs actually used as a share of that total population. The denominator was now something that OPOs couldn’t tamper with. That meant, hopefully, that they’d be judged solely on how many organs they recovered and transplanted into people — on how many thousands of lives they saved.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But while OPOs couldn’t muck with the denominator anymore, they could still muck with the numerators. Being a donor generally means that your organs are used in a transplant, but there’s a carveout for one organ: the pancreas. A <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/PLAW-108publ362">narrow 2004 law</a> allows researchers running clinical trials to conduct transplants of islet cells (the parts of the pancreas that produce insulin) as a potential cure for diabetes. Because of that law, OPOs could “recover” pancreases for islet cell transplant research, and get credit for recovering more organs under the new rule. But the federal government never asked for any proof that these organs were part of any FDA-approved research.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sure enough, the total number of pancreata that OPOs labeled as for “research” grew from 513 in 2020 to a whopping 3,238 in 2023. The number of donors whose only recovered organ was a pancreas designated for research grew from 25 to 429, according to the <a href="https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/">Organ Procurement &amp; Transplantation Network</a>. That’s an over tenfold increase in three years.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last year, Lenny Bernstein, a reporter at the Washington Post who’s been watching this scandal closely, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/03/20/organ-transplant-groups-pancreas-collection/">talked to pancreatic researchers</a> who all reported there was no sudden surge in need for pancreases in research projects. Indeed, if you look at the <a href="https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/about/search-membership/?memberType=Transplant+Centers&amp;state=-1&amp;region=0">small handful of medical centers</a> that use research pancreata for islet cell transplants, you find that there were only 24 transplants conducted in all of 2023: 22 at the University of Chicago Medical Center, and one each at City of Hope Medical Center outside Los Angeles, and at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s 3,238 pancreata recovered for islet cell transplant research in 2023, and only 24 actual transplants conducted that year. Where did the other 3,214 pancreata go? Where did the nearly 7,000 pancreata taken from dead Americans’ bodies over the past three years and not used for transplants go?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The waiting list for people needing just pancreata is <a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics/detailed-description#fig1">barely 800 people</a>. That number could be zero if these organs were better allocated. Where are they?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I asked the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations (AOPO), a kind of trade group for the organ procurers, for an explanation. “CMS developed and implemented the current rule governing the use of pancreata for research in 2021. As is required, OPOs have been complying with the rule since that time,” AOPO’s president Dorrie Dils told Vox in a statement. “OPOs have always followed CMS guidance and will continue to do so.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s one interpretation. Another is that we could be seeing an attempt by OPOs to get around regulations, and avoid being decertified because they don’t facilitate enough donations. That’s certainly how the <a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/wyden-grassley-cardin-young-raise-alarm-over-dramatic-increase-in-pancreata-procurement-">Senate Finance Committee</a>, where a bipartisan group of senators has been investigating the matter, sees it. In a letter to OPOs sent last year, the committee quoted from a listserv of OPO employees. In a thread discussing the new rules, an OPO employee wrote, “If you have a donor with only a pancreas for research, that is an organ donor for the Donor Rate. Otherwise, a donor is any donor with at least 1 organ transplanted. Savvy (or cynical?) OPOs ought to start a pancreas for research program immediately.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Savvy (or cynical?) indeed! In a <a href="https://aopo.org/wp-content/uploads/AOPO-SFC-Pancreas-Research-Statement-03-21-2023.pdf">reply to the committee</a>, AOPO protested that “OPOs have been operating according to the rule” and that the research donations mean “the organ does not go to waste.” Have they not gone to waste? The committee asked OPOs to report back which specific research studies they gave the pancreata to; I know of no OPO that has put out data formally tying each pancreas to a specific study.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This past January, <a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/qso-24-04-opo.pdf">CMS sent a letter to OPOs</a> reminding them that they could only count pancreases that were actually used for research. But it should go a step further and do what the <a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/wyden-grassley-cardin-and-young-call-on-cms-to-strengthen-protections-against-excessive-and-unnecessary-recoveries-of-pancreata-from-organ-donors">Senate committee is urging</a>: clarify that only pancreata donated to research approved by the FDA counts under the rule. That is, OPOs cannot make themselves look better and avoid decertification just by recovering pancreata and then sticking them in a freezer. They have to actually get the pancreata into the hands of scientists.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a very simple change, but it could mean the difference between rules that lead to thousands more organs going to people who need them, and rules that let the current system of unaccountable OPOs continue unabated.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Correction, August 22, 1:20 pm: </em></strong><em>A previous version of this story, originally published August 21, misstated whether a person can live without a pancreas. It’s possible, but difficult.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By now, you’ve probably heard the message loud and clear from Democrats: This election is all about unity.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <em><a href="http://VOX.COM/TODAy-explained-podcast" data-type="link" data-id="VOX.COM/TODAy-explained-podcast">Today, Explained</a></em> podcast team has been at the Democratic National Convention in  Chicago this week, and inside and outside the perimeter of the United Center, Democrats are buzzing with exuberance and relief: They now believe they have a real shot at winning the White House in 2024, and the party’s toughest issues are not a welcome topic of conversation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tonight, after accepting the party’s nomination earlier in the week from the campaign trail, Kamala Harris will appear in Chicago to close out the convention, carrying the mantle of the “renewed sense of hope” that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/367899/michelle-obama-dnc-convention-speech-2024-hope">Michelle Obama</a> — and the rest of the Democratic Party — have bestowed upon her.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, though, <em><a href="http://VOX.COM/TODAy-explained-podcast" data-type="link" data-id="VOX.COM/TODAy-explained-podcast">Today, Explained</a> </em>sat down with three Black women delegates for Harris to ask about the thorniest challenges, from Gaza policy to identity politics, that Democrats will face in these next 11 weeks before Election Day.  </p>

<iframe frameborder="0" height="200" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP6416947937" width="100%"></iframe>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The delegates are:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Illinois Lt. Gov. <a href="https://ltgov.illinois.gov/">Juliana Stratton</a>, 58&nbsp;</li>



<li><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Hala_Ayala">Hala Ayala</a>, former Virginia State General Assembly member, 51&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li><a href="https://mojenkins.com/">Mo Jenkins</a>, precinct chair in Harris County, Texas, 25</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All three committed to cast their votes for Harris and consider it their role to support and defend Democratic Party policies. But we picked at the party’s scabs a little bit and found that even the most faithful Democrats were willing to acknowledge that Black voters and nonvoters are no longer the assured bloc of support they have been for decades and that the Israel-Palestine conflict has caused a worrisome fissure between the official party and young progressives. <br><br>Here&#8217;s what they had to say. You can hear more of the discussion <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/todayexplainedpod" data-type="link" data-id="https://link.chtbl.com/todayexplainedpod">here</a> on <em>Today, Explained.</em> </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/GettyImages-2166931587.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.75214828329,100,78.49570343342" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A delegate turns their back in protest during a ceremonial roll call vote during the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"> <strong>Gaza and the US policy on Israel remain an open sore for young progressives</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Americans’ disapproval of Israeli military actions in Gaza eased this summer, but 48 percent still disapprove, according to a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/646955/disapproval-israeli-action-gaza-eases-slightly.aspx">Gallup poll</a> conducted in June. This week, thousands of protesters, mostly <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/12/6/23990673/keffiyeh-symbolism-palestinian-history">keffiyeh</a>-clad and young, were waiting for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris — or “Genocide Joe and Killer Kamala,” to them — in Chicago. On Monday, they gathered at Union Park and marched along a circuitous route outside the convention center to demand that the US end aid to Israel. They will march the same route Thursday ahead of Harris’s acceptance speech.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s a live issue for many voters, but especially people like Hala Ayala, who is of Lebanese descent.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ayala points out that Harris called for an &#8220;immediate ceasefire&#8221; back in March, and told us she’d met Harris and felt seen on the issue of Gaza. “I took that authentically because that&#8217;s who she is, and I took that as there&#8217;s more work to be done,” she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The issue of Gaza is also fraught for Gen Z politician Mo Jenkins. Nearly 50 percent of Democrats or Democratic-leaning young adults under 30 say they <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/04/02/younger-americans-stand-out-in-their-views-of-the-israel-hamas-war/">sympathize more with Palestinians</a> than Israelis, according to Pew. That doesn’t always line up with the party’s loyalties: The Biden administration just approved the sale of <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-approves-20-billion-weapons-sales-israel-hamas-backs-out-cease-fire-talks/">$20 billion in arms to Israel</a> over the next five years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When her Black constituents complain to her about pro-Palestinian activists refusing to back a Black woman candidate for president or not paying enough attention to ignored wars in Sudan or Congo, Jenkins said she tells them that she needs to join the system in order to bring about change.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When they ask why she’s leaving them in the cold, her response is: “‘I&#8217;m not leaving you in the cold … We&#8217;re going to end up in the Arctic if I don&#8217;t do the work necessary to make sure that Donald Trump does not become president.’”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong>The Democratic Party no longer has the default support of Black Americans</strong></strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It won’t be clear until after the election whether Black voters will turn out for Harris as they have for Democratic candidates in the past, but much has been made in recent months about flagging party support among Black Americans.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://goodauthority.org/news/are-black-voters-really-leaving-democratic-party-election-2024/">Data supports</a> the idea that the once-reliable Dem bloc has splintered considerably since 2008, with more Black would-be voters saying they plan instead to cast a vote for former President Donald Trump. This was certainly true when Joe Biden was at the top of the ticket, and now, even with Harris as the Democrats’ candidate for president, a significant share of Black voters are still leaning toward Trump. &nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Seventy percent of Black voters polled in July picked Harris over Trump on a hypothetical ballot, up from 59 percent who backed Biden in May and June polls, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. But Trump&#8217;s share of the Black vote also rose slightly, to 12 percent in July from 9 percent in May and June.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/GettyImages-2166910710.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.694600113617,100,78.610799772766" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Charlamagne tha God was an outspoken critic of President Joe Biden’s candidacy and told Vox this spring that Black people “shouldn’t be beholden to any political party in this country.” | Bryan Bedder/Variety via Getty ImagesBryan Bedder/Variety via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Bryan Bedder/Variety via Getty ImagesBryan Bedder/Variety via Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Ayala, the Woodbridge, Virginia-based delegate, says the party is well aware of this shuffling of allegiances: “Yeah, there&#8217;s been a separation [between Black men and women on politics]. We&#8217;ve seen it. Like, we can&#8217;t deny that.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jenkins said her Black male constituents in Houston often tell her they are voting for Trump “because he put a stimulus check in my hand.” She said she’ll remind them that their checks “<a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/did-adding-trumps-name-slow-down-mailing-stimulus-checks-course-it-did">got delayed</a> because he wanted his name on it. … I think it&#8217;s a confusion about the policy process.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her concern is whether she and other Democrats can effectively set the record straight and make a case to enough of these Trump-interested Black voters ahead of Election Day.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong><strong>Identity politics could be a stumbling block</strong></strong></strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This has been a very identity- and social justice-forward DNC. That is a realm Kamala Harris is comfortable in, but it also raises the question for Democrats: Will a focus on identity help them win the White House in November?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many analysts have urged the Harris campaign to avoid talking outright about her race and gender. We asked our roundtable about the theoretical 49-year-old white man in Michigan, a toss-up vote who has voted Democrat in the past. Will Harris talking about her identity as a Black and South Asian woman undermine her chance of getting his vote?<br><br>Stratton, the Illinois lieutenant governor, said emphatically that the Democratic Party also needs to talk about economic issues that impact the whole middle class, to draw voters like him in with discussions of “workers’ rights and making sure that we stand with organized labor. There are a number of things that we&#8217;re going to have to lay out when we talk about reducing gas prices and food prices and all of those other things.<br><br>&#8220;Those are things that everyday Americans are going to want to know.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>August 22<strong> </strong>is not a day that is particularly known for feeling especially crisp or autumnal in most parts of North America. And yet it’s the day this year — the earliest release date ever — that Starbucks, contending with a slowdown in sales, will unleash <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/08/21/starbucks-pumpkin-spice-latte-2024-fall-menu-release">its annual run of pumpkin spice lattes</a> upon its customers.</p>

<p>You’d be forgiven for mistaking this tone for one of disdain. Since its inception in 2003, the pumpkin spice latte has become something of a straw man for discussions about capitalism, seasonal creep, and the meaning of “basic,” resulting in widespread hatred for an otherwise innocuous beverage.</p>

<p>For example, back in 2014, at the height of pumpkin spice mania, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/9/10/6126359/pumpkin-spice-latte-starbucks-season-trend">this very website described the PSL</a> as “an unctuous, pungent, saccharine brown liquid, equal parts dairy and diabetes, served in paper cups and guzzled down by the liter” — even though clearly the pumpkin spice latte is a highly delicious treat that pairs well with <a href="https://www.racked.com/2016/12/19/14010138/vest-couples">wearing vests</a> and making dorky comments about how crisp the air feels today. Yes, it contains 380 calories; yes, it will make your coffee a rather unappetizing orange color; no, you should not “guzzle it down by the liter.”</p>

<p>But contempt for the PSL and other items of the seasonal pumpkin spice variety is often not really about the flavor itself. After all, there are plenty of other flavors we should all be way more furious about. (There is a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp/2018/07/27/yes-hellmanns-has-frozen-over-mayonnaise-ice-cream-is-here/?utm_term=.a02fb363af32">shop in Scotland that serves <em>mayonnaise ice cream</em></a>, people!) Too frequently, it’s about sexism, class anxiety, and our collective skepticism of savvy marketing. After all, the PSL is doing something right: It’s Starbucks’ most popular seasonal beverage, with about <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/26/starbucks-is-introducing-its-first-new-pumpkin-beverage-since-the-pumpkin-spice-latte.html">424 million sold worldwide</a>. In 2019, the chain leaned in further with the introduction of the Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew, finally admitting to the world that late August is still iced coffee weather.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The history of the PSL</h2>

<p>The pumpkin spice latte almost didn’t exist. As former <a href="https://qz.com/136781/psl-untold-history-of-starbucks-pumpkin-spice-latte/">Starbucks veteran Tim Kern told Quartz</a>, “A number of us thought it was a beverage so dominated by a flavor other than coffee that it didn’t put Starbucks’ coffee in the best light.”</p>

<p>Fortunately for Starbucks, the Tim Kerns of the company were ultimately overruled, because within a decade of its launch in 2003, the PSL became its top-selling drink, with more than 200 million of them sold. In 2015, Forbes estimated the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2015/11/10/the-pumpkin-spice-economy-how-starbucks-lattes-fueled-a-500-million-craze/#49e4ddd4ded4">PSL brought in around $100 million in revenue</a> over a single season.</p>

<p>2015 was also the year that Starbucks changed its decade-old formula to <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/08/17/starbucks-pumpkin-spice-latte/">include actual pumpkin</a> for the first time, rather than simply caramel coloring and pumpkin pie spices (like cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, allspice, and cloves). By all accounts, it tasted pretty much the same, just, <a href="https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/we-just-tasted-the-new-starbucks-pumpkin-spice-latte-recipe#">according to its inventor, “cleaner.”</a></p>

<p>At that point, the PSL wasn’t just a cash cow; it was a cultural phenomenon. In part, that’s thanks to its marketing — there is nothing inherently seasonal about the spices that go in pumpkin pie, but Starbucks is able to convince us that the drink should only be consumed during the fall months, thereby increasing demand.</p>

<p>But there’s another reason the PSL exploded so much over the past decade. Culinary food trend analyst <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/9/10/6126359/pumpkin-spice-latte-starbucks-season-trend">Suzy Badaracco told Vox in 2014</a>, “Pumpkin became recognized as part of the comfort food trend during the recession in 2008,” due to its association with Thanksgiving and the holidays. In tough times, we’re <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-sat-trading-downjan24-story.html">more likely to crave foods that bring back happy memories</a>.</p>

<p>Surely, though, the reason we all began talking about PSLs to begin with was their prevalence on social media. It’s not that they’re inherently photogenic — a Starbucks cup is a Starbucks cup regardless of what’s inside it, and the PSL doesn’t get its own specially designed cup the way the holiday drinks do.</p>

<p>It’s because when you add a PSL to a photo of, say, your new fall boots standing atop crunchy-looking leaves or a selfie featuring a festive dark lip color, it adds to the autumnal aesthetic. It’s not a coincidence that Instagram — the epicenter of cutesy fall tableaus — happened to blow up in the early 2010s, which is the same time it became cool to claim you despised pumpkin spice.</p>

<p>But maybe that’s not the whole story.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The backlash is about our anxieties around capitalism</h2>

<p>The fact that the pumpkin spice latte — which, to many, conjures the scents and imagery of Thanksgiving — is released in increasingly hot weather year after year is often touted as an ominous harbinger of the evil forces of seasonal creep. <a href="http://theweek.com/articles/723439/still-summer-away-damn-pumpkins">“It’s agricultural revisionism!”</a> argue some, citing the fact that pumpkins aren’t actually in season until autumn proper.</p>

<p>A viral John Oliver clip from 2014 declares as much, noting that “that bottle of pumpkin-flavored science goo sits behind the counter of Starbucks, never aging, like Ryan Seacrest”:</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube alignnone"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div><div><iframe title="Pumpkin Spice (Web Exclusive): Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO)" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DeQqe0oj5Ls?rel=0" allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></div></div>
</div></figure>

<p>Perhaps in response to such criticism, in 2019 Starbucks released its second pumpkin spice beverage since the PSL’s introduction, but this time, it’s cold. The Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew is a vanilla cold brew with pumpkin cold foam and topped with pumpkin spice, which <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/26/starbucks-is-introducing-its-first-new-pumpkin-beverage-since-the-pumpkin-spice-latte.html">CNBC describes</a> as “less sweet and has a stronger coffee taste than a pumpkin spice latte.”</p>

<p>The success of the PSL is also largely responsible for the barrage of pumpkin spice-flavored everything else,&nbsp;including <a href="https://www.eater.com/2017/9/26/16330438/pumpkin-spice-food-pop-tarts-kit-kats-milanos-jello">cream cheese, dog treats, Kahlua, and an especially wacky seasonal crossover, Peeps</a>. There have also been <a href="https://express.google.com/product/8454718204561677777_10098084892655435749_10046?mall=WashingtonDC&amp;directCheckout=1&amp;utm_source=google_shopping&amp;utm_medium=product_ads&amp;utm_campaign=gsx">air fresheners</a>, <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/554836377/pumpkin-spice-deodorant-aluminum-free?gpla=1&amp;gao=1&amp;&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=shopping_us_hanukkah_Bath_and_Beauty&amp;utm_custom1=dd7afb09-db72-4cb4-86c2-4a37b8b95c43&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI9rTHpZuQ3QIVQVgNCh1rUgiuEAQYASABEgJb7PD_BwE">deodorant</a>, even Four Loko (okay, <a href="https://www.eater.com/2014/9/25/6847289/pumpkin-spice-flavored-four-loko-was-a-cruel-joke-many-people-fell-for">that one ended up being a joke</a>), resulting in the expected amount of hand-wringing about a food trend “gone too far.” (Indeed, back in 2010, the spice brand McCormick forecast that pumpkin spice would be a popular flavor for the holiday season, which in turn likely exacerbated the rush.)</p>

<p>When a food trend is as in-your-face as pumpkin spice is — ever been to a <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/2017/10/175148/trader-joes-pumpkin-food-products">Trader Joe’s in October</a>? — it forces us to think about how the free market is essentially designed to create this kind of phenomenon. If a product like the pumpkin spice latte sells, it’s natural under capitalism for other companies to attempt to replicate that success. But it’s uncomfortable when we see it happening on such an exaggerated scale.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Actually, the backlash is about our contempt for women</h2>

<p>Well, maybe, but maybe what pumpkin spice backlash is really about is our dismissal of trends that are coded as feminine. As Jaya Saxena wrote in Taste last fall, in a piece titled <a href="https://www.tastecooking.com/women-arent-ruining-food/">“Women Aren’t Ruining Food,”</a> “When men enjoy something, they elevate it. But when women enjoy something, they ruin it.”</p>

<p>She continues, on the topic of “girly” food crazes like açai bowls, rosé, and pumpkin spice versus “manly” ones like barbecue, Flamin’ Hot Cheetos, and IPAs:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>When those foods blow up, we judge women for falling for the marketing or trying to jump on the bandwagon, and we assume that because they like something other women like, they don’t have minds of their own. And on top of that, women are asked to reckon with, consciously or unconsciously, the perceived psycho-sexual symbolism attached to seemingly innocuous foods.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Plus, “masculine” foods are almost never chastised for being<strong> “</strong>basic,” the ever-nebulous term used to describe someone with average, predictable taste that’s usually reserved for women.</p>

<p>In the most stereotypical (and by now probably outdated) terms, a “basic bitch” wears North Face, leggings, and Uggs, and <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/laraparker/things-all-basic-white-girls-do-during-the-fall?utm_term=.ac5VeZPOo4#.apzXDeAGvW">absolutely adores hashtag-PSLs</a>, marking her as a woman with “a girlish interest in seasonal changes and an unsophisticated penchant for sweet,” as <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2014/10/what-do-you-really-mean-by-basic-bitch.html">the Cut noted back in 2014</a>.</p>

<p>There are often classist implications, too. In a BuzzFeed piece about “basic” and class anxiety, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/basic-class-anxiety">Anne Helen Peterson wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Unique taste — and the capacity to avoid the basic — is a privilege. A privilege of location (usually urban), of education (exposure to other cultures and locales), and of parentage (who would introduce and exalt other tastes). To summarize the groundbreaking work of theorist Pierre Bourdieu: We don’t choose our tastes so much as the micro-specifics of our class determine them. To consume and perform online in a basic way is thus to reflect a highly American, capitalist upbringing. Basic girls love the things they do because&nbsp;<em>nearly every part of American commercial media</em>&nbsp;has told them that they should.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Essentially, hating pumpkin spice lattes is our way of othering those who drink them, and in the process, marking ourselves as decidedly un-basic.</p>

<p>Of course, this notion of what “basic” means is not the same way black people have been using it for decades, which, as <a href="https://jezebel.com/overanalyzing-basic-is-the-most-basic-move-of-all-1648927319">Kara Brown explained in Jezebel</a>, pretty much just translates to “I think that the stuff you like is lame and I don’t really like you.”</p>

<p>“Rihanna could become the official spokesperson for Starbucks pumpkin spice lattes and nobody would think of her as basic,” she wrote. “You know why? Because Rihanna does what she wants and what she thinks is cool and doesn’t give a damn about anybody else.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Or maybe nobody cares anymore</h2>

<p>Even if Rihanna suddenly became the official spokesperson of PSLs, however, there is also the possibility that, quite frankly, nobody really cares that much anymore. We seemed to have hit peak “pumpkin spice hot take” in the year 2014, with searches for “pumpkin spice latte” peaking in 2015.</p>

  trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("TIMESERIES", {"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"pumpkin spice latte","geo":"US","time":"2004-01-01 2018-08-28"}],"category":0,"property":""}, {"exploreQuery":"date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=pumpkin%20spice%20latte","guestPath":"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/"}); 

<p>Maybe that’s because we’ve all been stricken with a case of seasonal beverage fatigue in general. Starbucks is constantly coming out with random gimmicky drinks, from the Unicorn Frappuccino to the so-called “secret menu.”</p>

<p>We also aren’t seeing the same kind of anger directed at what is arguably replacing pumpkin spice as autumn’s de facto flavor. In 2017, both Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts released maple pecan lattes. And <a href="https://www.eater.com/2017/9/25/16361288/maple-pecan-flavor-trend">according to restaurant menu data</a> from that year, “mentions of maple as a flavor in nonalcoholic beverages on menus are up 86 percent this year over last. &#8230; Pumpkin mentions, on the other hand, are down 20 percent.” Yet nobody’s complaining about how stupid maple syrup is.</p>

<p>And these days, tweets about PSLs are way more in the vein of “Screw you and let me enjoy my shitty drink in peace, because everything is terrible.”</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter alignnone"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pumpkin Spice Latte comes back tomorrow and I am 100% getting one in 91 degree weather because this world is a shitshow and I take joy where I can get it, like in delicious flavored coffee drinks.</p>&mdash; kelsey (@drunkhaught) <a href="https://twitter.com/drunkhaught/status/1034087709239926784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2018</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p>People have also expressed exhaustion about the “actually-ing” over what pumpkin spice even is, as if anyone <em>really</em> wants to talk about it.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter alignnone"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;pumpkin spice refers to the spices used in pumpkin pie and doesn&#039;t actually taste like pumpkins&quot; is the &quot;Frankenstein was the name of the doctor&quot; of this decade</p>&mdash; Kyle 🌱 (@KylePlantEmoji) <a href="https://twitter.com/KylePlantEmoji/status/1034125475700850689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2018</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p>There are even ironic tweets poking fun at the automation of feminist responses to the anti-pumpkin spice brigade:</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter alignnone"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Women&#039;s unabashed enjoyment of a thing has always led to wholesale dismissal of said thing as frivolous and/or bad. From early examples like needlework to more current cases like pumpkin spice and romance novels, we can track this trend throughout history. In this paper I will &#8211;</p>&mdash; The Ripped Bodice (@TheRippedBodice) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRippedBodice/status/1034181407319314432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2018</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p>Anyway, this is all to say that maybe by now pumpkin spice has finally returned to signifying the autumnal blend of cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves, and nothing more: not basic, not everything wrong with capitalism, and not gross. Because it’s not! It’s delicious.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A couple weeks ago, I got an unnerving message from my bank. My Social Security number had been compromised in an alleged data breach. I hung on to the word “alleged” as I tried to figure out if it was real. Now I know: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/08/15/social-security-hack-leak-ssn-freeze-credit-npd/">It’s real</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As many as 272 million Social Security numbers are floating around hacker forums after someone <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/19/24223858/national-public-data-breach-ssn-privacy">stole them</a> from a Florida-based background check company called <a href="https://www.nationalpublicdata.com/">National Public Data</a>, which is owned by an <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/08/nationalpublicdata-com-hack-exposes-a-nations-data/">actor and retired sheriff’s deputy named Salvatore “Sal” Verini</a>. This data breach is not as catastrophic as some headlines might make it seem. One news station ran a hyperbolic <a href="https://abc7.com/post/hackers-may-have-stolen-social-security-numbers-every-american-heres-what-know/15190266/">headline that claimed</a>, “Hackers may have stolen the Social Security numbers of every American.” They haven’t.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, now is a good time to freeze your credit files with the major bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion) if you haven’t already. That will protect you from the scammers that tend to follow big breaches like this. If more people freeze their files, there will be fewer victims of cybercrime. It just may be the one good thing that comes from this massive Social Security number breach.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Freezing your credit simply means <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/14/your-money/credit-freeze-free.html">preventing potential creditors from accessing your credit report</a>, which makes it harder for bad actors to open new accounts, like a new credit card or a loan, using your personal information. It also prevents credit bureaus from selling the data in your credit report, <a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-f0e11efe200e407ea33b0540975adc42">which they unfortunately do</a>. If you want to grant access to your credit report, you can simply ask the credit bureaus to thaw your files. None of this will hurt your credit score.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even if you don’t think you were impacted by the National Public Data breach, your data has almost certainly been involved in some kind of breach. That’s why you should freeze your credit files: It’s a free and easy way to protect yourself from identity theft and to keep hackers and scammers out of your bank account. And while this latest breach isn’t an urgent concern, big security scares like this tend to attract scammers who prey on the anxious. It’s also election season, which is already <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/email-and-cloud-threats/election-2024-mobile-political-spam-volume-jumps-3x-compared-2022">full of scammy spam</a>. So why not take an extra step or two to lock down your accounts?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I did just that a few days ago, and it took no more than 10 minutes. But to understand why you should freeze your credit files — and why you should also <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/child-identity-theft">freeze the credit files of your children</a>, even if they’re under 18 — it helps to understand what big data breaches mean for you now and in the inevitable future when there will be an even bigger one.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The very big but not very scary Social Security number hack</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Back in April, a cybercriminal known as USDoD <a href="https://x.com/H4ckManac/status/1777246310782902686">tried to sell</a> four terabytes of data on a hacker forum. The data was from the blandly named National Public Data and comprised 2.9 billion rows of records, including Social Security numbers, addresses, and phone numbers. Partial copies of the data leaked in the following months before another hacker <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-leak-27-billion-data-records-with-social-security-numbers/?utm_campaign=Illicit%20Edge%20Daily&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_qxXBz21fqqsrpHy4AgOniD8BKRxoNBFE4itU1-r3UfRd0QXDlcn1LAQR2-ZeVWmNNv_FEhlgXM2cyScAwoQBfReHuHw&amp;_hsmi=319653925&amp;utm_content=319653925&amp;utm_source=hs_email">posted a nearly complete version on August 6</a> for anyone to download for free. A few days later, National Public Data confirmed that it had suffered a data breach. That’s when security experts started to get worried.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The hacker forum play-by-play is important here because it illustrates just how freewheeling data thieves can be. Once your information is compromised in a breach, you can expect it will end up in the wrong hands.</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How data breaches make scams worse</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a presidential election year, and the fresh batch of free stolen data supplied by the National Public Data breach will supercharge the typical types of scams you see during an election. The National Association of Secretaries of State has a helpful <a href="https://www.nass.org/sites/default/files/2021-08/CSN%20Election%20Scams%20Infosheet_NASS.pdf">guide to the three most common types of election season scams</a>: political donation scams, fake surveys or polls, and voter registration scams. You should also just be very wary about any messages you get asking to donate to a campaign or to submit your private information.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">“If anyone is interested in contributing to a campaign …  they should look up the campaign&#8217;s official website and donate through that instead of clicking the link in their SMS inbox,” said Bill Budington, senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who clarified that he was not offering electioneering advice. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Honestly, <a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2020/04/dont-click-links-unsolicited-text-messages">don’t ever click a link from an unsolicited text message</a>. There&#8217;s no way that click will be a good thing.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the first security experts to analyze the data <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/inside-the-3-billion-people-national-public-data-breach/">was Troy Hunt</a>, founder of <a href="http://haveibeenpwned.com/">HaveIBeenPwned.com</a>, a website that lets you check to see if you’ve been implicated in a data breach. The sheer scale of the breach meant it was “very serious,” Hunt said in an interview. Researchers at the Atlas Data Privacy Corp. reported that the database <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/08/nationalpublicdata-com-hack-exposes-a-nations-data/">contained 272 million unique Social Security numbers</a>, which is not the 2.9 billion you might see in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/15/billions-people-social-security-numbers-and-data-stolen-allegedly.html">some headlines</a>. Many of the records appear to belong to deceased people. Atlas also set up a website where you can <a href="https://www.npdbreach.com/">check to see if you’ve been affected</a> by the National Public Data breach.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hunt actually found his own data in the breach, although most of the information was either outdated or incorrect.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I wouldn&#8217;t lose sleep over it because I don&#8217;t think this is particularly different to what&#8217;s been happening for many years,” Hunt told me.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">TJ Sayers, director of intelligence and incident response at the Center for Internet Security, had a similar response when I asked him about how worried we should be about this attack.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I don&#8217;t think necessarily that this is groundbreaking and game-changing,” Sayers said. “A lot of the information that&#8217;s in here is probably already out there in some form or fashion from other breaches that have taken place in the past.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, data breaches are exceedingly common. There’s a familiar cycle of breaches happening, companies admitting to it, <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/privacy-and-data-security/background-check-data-of-3-billion-stolen-in-breach-suit-says">lawyers filing class action lawsuits</a>, and individual consumers <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/28/payments-from-equifax-settlement-over-2017-data-breach-are-going-out.html">getting checks for $5 in the mail</a>. That’s typically it — no arrests, no jail time, no consequences for the hackers who stole the data or the companies who failed to protect it. There is little regulatory <a href="https://epic.org/issues/consumer-privacy/data-brokers/">oversight of the data broker industry</a>, where companies big and small mine information from consumers and sell it to other companies, often <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90310803/here-are-the-data-brokers-quietly-buying-and-selling-your-personal-information">without properly protecting that data</a> — hence the frequency of breaches. Data brokers don’t necessarily care, though, since <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/11/opinions/dont-complain-to-equifax-demand-government-act-opinion-schneier/index.html">consumers are the product</a> in this industry, not the customer.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The amount of stolen consumer data available online is also growing. In his coverage of this latest breach, Krebs, the security journalist, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/08/nationalpublicdata-com-hack-exposes-a-nations-data/">likens data brokers to oil tankers</a>; breaches are oil spills with negative long-term effects. Krebs says, “[T]he cleanup costs and effort from data spills — even just vast collections of technically ‘public’ documents like the [National Public Data] corpus — can be enormous, and most of the costs associated with that fall to consumers, directly or indirectly.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So even if this breach isn’t an immediate threat, the sum total of all data breaches is disastrous. And there isn’t much to protect consumers like you and me.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to freeze your credit files</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That brings us back to freezing credit files. Even in the absence of a major data breach, freezing your credit is a free and straightforward way to protect yourself from identity theft. It’s also surprisingly easy to do and just as easy to undo, in the event that you want to open a new account or apply for a loan.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The three major credit bureaus are Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. You might remember <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/refunds/equifax-data-breach-settlement">Equifax from its own massive data breach</a>, which compromised the private records of 148 million Americans in 2017. That hack, which was carried about by the Chinese military, <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/chinese-hackers-charged-in-equifax-breach-021020">according to the FBI</a>, led to <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/13/16292014/equifax-credit-breach-hack-report-security">calls for stricter data breach laws</a> — laws that still haven’t been passed. But thanks to <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2018/09/starting-today-new-federal-law-allows-consumers-place-free-credit-freezes-yearlong-fraud-alerts">a 2018 law</a> that loosened some banking regulations in the wake of the Great Recession, the credit bureaus can no longer charge fees to freeze and unfreeze your credit files. You can also <a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2023/10/you-now-have-permanent-access-free-weekly-credit-reports">request a free credit report</a> from each of the bureaus once a week now, rather than once a year. So things have gotten better in a way.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can put a freeze in place by setting up an account at each of the credit bureaus’ websites. (Here are direct links to the pages to freeze your accounts for <a href="https://www.equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services/">Equifax</a>, <a href="http://experian.com/freeze/center.html">Experian</a>, and <a href="https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze">TransUnion</a>.) Once your account is set up, it only takes a couple of clicks to freeze your files. You can also file a freeze by phone or by mail. Read more about how that works <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/09/credit-freezes-are-free-let-the-ice-age-begin/">here</a>. You might also consider freezing your files with secondary bureaus, of which there are many. You can opt out of LexisNexis, one of the biggest, <a href="https://optout.lexisnexis.com">here</a>. Other secondary bureaus include ChexSystems, Innovis, MicroBilt, and NCTUE — you can <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/credit-reports-and-scores/consumer-reporting-companies/companies-list/">read up</a> about them and see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IdentityTheft/comments/uvv3ij/psa_freezing_your_three_main_credit_reports_is/?share_id=NYVl-S3gkRLGCCMkNnazS&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=4">how to freeze</a> those files too. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By the way, don’t pay for anything while you’re doing this. The credit bureaus are required to let you freeze your files for free but they might try to sell you a paid service with the confusing name “credit lock.” Credit lock services, which cost <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/credit-lock-and-credit-freeze">as much as $30 a month</a>, also restrict access to your credit report and promise to let you unlock it immediately. Credit freezes might take a business day or three to unfreeze, but they come with <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/credit-protection-monitoring/why-a-free-credit-freeze-is-better-than-a-credit-lock/?srsltid=AfmBOoq_oAR6hgjEdagKJZ4s35tYEGa0IDvW48c127Ek1lBwpYVxrg1O">more legal protections</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you have kids, you can freeze their credit files, too — even if they don’t have one yet. Although freezing a child’s credit is not as quick as two clicks on a website, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/28/your-money/credit-freeze-children.html">it’s fairly straightforward</a> and could save your family a lot of grief.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Childhood identity theft is outpacing adult identity theft,” said Sayers, from the Center for Internet Security. “A lot of parents and children don&#8217;t realize their identity is stolen until they turn 18 years old and they need to get a college loan or they need to get their first credit card.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President Joe Biden bet his reelection bid on the idea that American voters in November would care about <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/03/11/joe-biden-profile">the fate of American democracy</a>. The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/20/kamala-harris-freedom-democracy-biden/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzI0MTI2NDAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzI1NTA4Nzk5LCJpYXQiOjE3MjQxMjY0MDAsImp0aSI6IjVlZjVmMGRhLTY4YzgtNDYzOS04YmZhLTBjODA4YzRlNzMwZCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDI0LzA4LzIwL2thbWFsYS1oYXJyaXMtZnJlZWRvbS1kZW1vY3JhY3ktYmlkZW4vIn0.ucGihfJrvFuXndu6uYVF252jsQJc1iJNEUKf0vH72sc">conventional wisdom now</a> is that Biden was wrong and that Vice President Kamala Harris is not only stepping away from his strategy but doing so for good reasons.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many Democratic political types today believe that “democracy” is a message that’s both tired and abstract, something that preoccupies elites but not the key voting demographics. They <a href="https://www.liberalpatriot.com/p/no-democracy-is-not-on-the-ballot">cite data</a> showing ”democracy” at the bottom of the list of voter concerns in the 2024 election, with issues like inflation, immigration, and abortion placing well ahead of what Joe Biden treated as issue number one.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It appears Harris has taken the conventional wisdom to heart. Reporting in <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/08/01/kamala-harris-joe-biden-president-strategy-election">Axios</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/20/kamala-harris-freedom-democracy-biden/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzI0MTI2NDAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzI1NTA4Nzk5LCJpYXQiOjE3MjQxMjY0MDAsImp0aSI6IjVlZjVmMGRhLTY4YzgtNDYzOS04YmZhLTBjODA4YzRlNzMwZCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDI0LzA4LzIwL2thbWFsYS1oYXJyaXMtZnJlZWRvbS1kZW1vY3JhY3ktYmlkZW4vIn0.ucGihfJrvFuXndu6uYVF252jsQJc1iJNEUKf0vH72sc">the Washington Post</a> shows that Harris uses the word “democracy” far less than Biden did in both advertising and stump speeches — mentioning it only 12 times in her first nine campaign rallies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rather than casting the Trump-Vance ticket as a threat to democracy, the Harris-Walz campaign prefers to describe them as “weird” men aiming to curtail Americans’ freedom. The language of freedom has suffused the Democratic National Convention so far, and will almost certainly be a centerpiece of Harris’s address on Thursday night.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet I think the conventional wisdom is wrong in nearly every respect. Harris should not abandon democracy as a campaign issue, but rather double down on it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democracy is a more powerful issue than polling might suggest: It likely swung the 2022 midterms Democrats’ way, and some research suggests it remains potent in 2024. Democracy messaging is especially persuasive with moderate Trump-skeptical Republicans, an important voting bloc in swing states around the country. Given its proven track record of success with a critical demographic, democracy ought to be a significant part of Harris’s message.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Integrating democracy doesn’t require ditching the clearly effective freedom messaging: Harris can quite easily spend more time highlighting attacks on democratic freedoms, talking about “the freedom to vote” as one of several essential liberties Trump and Project 2025 plan to attack. That’s what some of the Democratic pollsters who helped develop the party’s “freedom” message back in 2022 currently urge her to do.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Saying ‘we’re trying to protect your freedom to vote’ and ‘we’re trying to protect your freedom to have a family when you want to’&#8230; those two things together frame that story in a way that makes people care about democracy,” Jen Fernandez Ancona, vice president of the progressive strategy group Way To Win, told Vox.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Harris listens to the conventional wisdom instead, she’ll be leaving a powerful campaign issue&nbsp;—&nbsp;and potentially some crucial votes — on the table.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The case that democracy matters in American politics</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sarah Longwell is a longtime Republican strategist who, since 2016, has made it her life’s work to figure out how to get her fellow conservatives to ditch the Republican Party. As the head of a group called Republican Voters Against Trump, she has conducted “hundreds and hundreds” of focus groups with persuadable Republican moderates — a systematic attempt to figure out how they might be convinced to ditch the Trumpified GOP.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When she talks to former Trump voters, they say the same thing over and over again: that his assault on democracy pushed them out of the party.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I listen to why voters who voted for Trump now refuse to do so, and the No. 1 reason is that January 6 was a red line for them. They were out after that,” Longwell says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The 2022 midterms showed that these voters mattered — that these voters aren’t just important, but potentially decisive in critical states.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We remember 2022 as a Democratic victory because the party managed to make gains in the Senate while suffering minimal losses in the House&nbsp;— defying the historical rule that the party in charge of the White House loses in the midterms. But this wasn’t the result of a blue wave: Republicans got several million more votes in House races nationally than Democrats. What happened instead is that Democrats excelled in a handful of key races, making history as a result.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So what happened in those key races? The <em>Dobbs</em> ruling was a major part of the story. But so too was democracy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Multiple <a href="https://catalist.us/whathappened2022/">separate</a> data <a href="https://split-ticket.org/2023/05/24/the-electoral-impact-of-election-denial/">analyses</a>, conducted by sources ranging from Stanford political scientists to the Democratic data firm Catalist, attempted to estimate a “MAGA penalty”: how much Republicans who parroted Trump’s “big lie” about 2020 suffered at the ballot box relative to other Republicans. On the whole, these estimates converge somewhere in the neighborhood of a two- to three-point penalty for MAGA candidates, with some estimates going as high as five or six. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Without this effect, Democrats likely wouldn’t control the Senate: Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock beat his opponent, Trump darling Herschel Walker, by 2.8 percentage points. Moreover, extremists would almost certainly hold key statewide positions: Kari Lake, the Republican candidate for governor in Arizona who made the big lie central to her message, lost by less than a percentage point.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After the election, I interviewed several Democratic candidates and strategists who fought and won races against election deniers. They told me that putting democracy first was a major component of their victory.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Voters are just tired of the bullshit. They know it’s nonsense, that there’s no evidence behind the big lie or any of that stuff, and they rejected it,” Adrian Fontes, Arizona’s secretary of state who was first elected in 2022, told me at the time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democratic strategists are fully aware of what happened last election, but not all of them are convinced that it’ll work the same way in 2024.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“[Democracy messaging] worked extremely well with the folks we needed in the midterms, which was those suburban college-educated folks who voted every time and do not like the current direction of the Republican Party. [But] those folks are already with us,” says Lanae Erickson, a senior vice president at the center-left Third Way think tank.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That might not be true. Anat Shenker-Osorio, the head of the progressive messaging outfit ASO Communications, recently conducted a randomized experiment testing the effect of ads featuring January 6. She found that the ads “did a decent job” swinging voters away from Trump and toward Harris, specifically by making voters in the study connect Trump to political violence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This tactic is especially likely to work with moderate Republicans. Key races in 2022 were determined, in large part, by a small group of registered Republicans who crossed the aisle to vote against extremists. But these same voters were often perfectly happy to vote for a more normal Republican: In Georgia, for example, incumbent Republican Gov. Brian Kemp handily defeated Democrat Stacey Abrams with support from anti-Herschel Walker Republicans.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s far from obvious that these voters are stable Democrats, and Harris will need them if she wants to rebuild the coalition that powered Joe Biden to victory in 2020. As such, it would be<strong> </strong>unwise to abandon the most proven line of argument for reaching them: that democracy is at stake and therefore partisan grievances need to take a back seat to saving the republic.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s perhaps understandable why Harris and her campaign seemingly chose to step away from the message, given Biden’s campaign struggles even before the disastrous June debate, but that skepticism would be wrong. While democracy was indeed at the center of his doomed campaign, it’s hard to blame the message for its failure. Everything we’ve seen since June suggests that concerns about Biden’s age made it impossible for any message, no matter how good, to break through with persuadable voters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Recent evidence suggests that Harris can effectively make a democracy argument in a way Biden could not. A <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/osf/qacmr">just-released academic study</a> — the first to examine the effect of democracy rhetoric on support for Harris specifically — suggests that she could make inroads among persuadable Republicans by focusing on democracy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The study’s authors showed Republican voters “democracy is on the ballot”-type messaging and asked them how it affected their political views. On the whole, the authors found, the effects were minimal and at times even counterproductive — causing Republicans to dig in harder on their partisan identity. This kind of rhetoric, they conclude, “does not change the attitudes that allowed Trump to challenge the legitimacy of the 2020 election.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there was a notable exception to these dour findings: vote choice in the 2024 election.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After a Republican audience heard “democracy is on the ballot”-type rhetoric, Harris’s support in the group more than tripled — going from 2.3 percent to 7.3 percent. “The treatment induces a negative emotional response in Republicans and effectively shames them to report support for Harris,” the study’s authors write.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unsurprisingly, the effect faded as time passed; it’s hard to change someone’s mind permanently after a single experiment. But perhaps repeating anti-authoritarian messaging through an entire campaign might have more durable effects.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For all their concerns about the limits of this approach, the authors concede that democracy messaging “has desirable effects in the short-term (a single election).”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Harris can campaign on democracy —&nbsp;and win</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Registered Republicans aren’t the only kind of persuadable voters who matter. There’s a much larger group of independents who don’t normally pay very much attention to politics or especially like either major party. These voters are much more likely to turn out in presidential elections than in midterms, and, per polling, are mostly unmoved by pro-democracy rhetoric.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Our mantra has become ‘you defend democracy by practicing it.’ And you practice it by focusing on voters in the middle,” says Liam Kerr, co-founder of the Democratic WelcomePAC. “A lot of gettable voters —&nbsp;especially at this point, after eight years — don’t believe that stormtroopers are going to come into the streets the day after the election.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But whatever message you think this group wants — be it tough-on-the-border centrism, a liberal focus on abortion bans, or middle-class economic populism — it’s not obvious that it trades off with pro-democracy messaging.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Any good campaign develops different messages for different groups: There’s little opportunity cost in focusing more on democracy when reaching out to moderate suburban Republicans than disaffected downscale Democrats. Even a high-profile address like her DNC speech can include a reasonably sized section on such a critical issue without dragging.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Moreover, it’s possible to tie multiple messages together, especially through overarching themes like “freedom.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In my new book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reactionary-Spirit-Insidious-Political-Tradition-ebook/dp/B0CMQB8S94"><em>The Reactionary Spirit</em></a>, I study how pro-democracy candidates — in the United States and around the world — beat authoritarian rivals in elections. One of the most consistent findings is that it’s possible, and quite effective, to campaign on democracy in conjunction with other issues: showing how anti-democratic politics affects voters’ lives in concrete ways.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Brazil’s 2022 presidential election, the left-wing candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva connected democracy to his core message of advancing economic equality, describing it as a vehicle to build shared prosperity. In Budapest’s 2019 mayoral election, the opposition candidate Gergely Karácsony tied democracy to housing, arguing that the concentration of power in the hands of the ruling Fidesz party was responsible for the government’s failure to address high costs of living.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the book, I call this strategy “linkage” and argue that Democrats used a version of it effectively in the midterms. In linking abortion restrictions and January 6 as shared assaults on American freedoms, they made a strong case that Republicans were an extremist party attacking cherished American values.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris’ “freedom” campaign makes a linkage strategy exceptionally easy to execute. She doesn’t need to radically change her campaign rhetoric or strategy, but rather spend more time and effort explaining why the right to choose your own leaders is one of several important freedoms imperiled by the Trump-Vance ticket.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another effective avenue for making democracy feel real is by attacking Trump’s ideas, especially those contained in <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce">the Project 2025 planning document</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Just over a week before Joe Biden dropped out, I attended a strategy meeting at the Center for American Progress (CAP) — the Democratic establishment’s leading DC think tank — about the party’s Project 2025 messaging.&nbsp; The data showed that Democrats had done a remarkable job at both raising awareness of Project 2025 and convincing Americans that it was a bad thing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">CAP’s researchers wanted to understand why, and how Democrats could take advantage in November. So they conducted extensive interviews with voters, with a special focus on Black and Latino voters who some polls showed moving into the Trump column. As part of this research, they presented voters with a series of attack lines on Project 2025 and asked them to rate which were most and least concerning.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All four of the top-performing messages&nbsp;— the ones voters consistently ranked as most concerning — focused on the threat its proposals posed to democracy. The best was a so-called “strong man” message, arguing that “the restructuring of government that Project 2025 lays out is similar to the playbook dictators and authoritarian governments have used repeatedly over the last century.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When I spoke with the researchers again after Biden dropped out, they argued that Harris needed to keep up this theme. It worked, they said, because it picked up on something important to many voters —&nbsp;their freedom to choose who governs them — and connected it to something new.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There’s 800 pages of the same old conservative nonsense in here. But what’s so different is the method, the means to complete it —&nbsp;it’s the takeover. And people freak out about that,” says Joe Radosevich, CAP’s vice president for campaigns and outreach.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Campaigning on democracy, in other words, isn’t just about repeating the word “democracy” like a mantra. It’s about figuring out creative ways to make the defense of democracy feel vital and relevant. And there are plenty of ways for Harris to do just that.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Vice President Kamala Harris chose Tim Walz as her running mate, many pundits <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/kamala-harris-tim-walz-moderate-liberal-progressive-centrist.html">lamented her decision</a>. In their view, the Democratic nominee should have chosen a vice presidential candidate who could mitigate her liabilities, and balance out her party’s ticket — such as Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After all, Harris had been a liberal senator from one of America’s most left-wing states and then had run <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020-positions.html">an exceedingly progressive primary campaign</a> in 2020. To win over swing-state undecideds, she needed to demonstrate her independence from her party’s most radical elements. And selecting the popular governor of a purple state — who had defied the Democratic activist base <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/07/josh-shapiro-vice-president-school-choice-voucher/">on education policy</a> and <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/08/05/josh-shapiro-israel-gaza-vice-president-harris">Israel’s war in Gaza</a>— would do just that. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Walz, in this account, was just another liberal darling: As Minnesota governor, he had <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/06/why-are-minnesota-democrats-so-progressive.html">enacted a litany of progressive policies,</a> including restoring the <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/state-government/2023/02/minnesota-supreme-court-state-can-bar-felons-from-voting-until-probation-ends/">voting rights</a> of ex-felons and creating a <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2023/03/24/you-belong-here-minnesota-house-passes-trans-health-refuge-bill?gclid=CjwKCAjwm4ukBhAuEiwA0zQxk5RdtxtcOM0fkfu6rK75hb7lRLLdAum34DpJQvpg5GJQ4ZL6OiHtzRoC5lcQAvD_BwE">refuge program for trans people</a> denied gender-affirming care in other states. Picking Walz might thrill the subset of Americans who would vote for Harris even if she burned an American flag on live TV and lit a blunt with its flames. But it would do nothing to reassure those who heard two words they did not like in the phrase, “California liberal.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there is more than one way to balance a ticket. Or so Harris’s team believes, if the third night of the Democratic National Convention is any guide.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Wednesday night, Democrats used Walz’s nomination to associate their party with rural American culture and small-c conservative moral sentiments, while remaining true to a broadly progressive agenda.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Walz may not be especially distinct from Harris ideologically. But he is quite different demographically and symbolically. Harris is the half-Jamaican, half-Indian daughter of immigrant college professors who grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area. Walz was born into a family whose roots in the United States went back to the 1800s, and raised in a Nebraska town of 400, where ethnic diversity largely consisted of several different flavors of Midwestern white (Walz himself is of <a href="https://www.irishecho.com/2024/8/walz-roots-traced-to-wexford">German, Irish, Swedish</a>, and <a href="https://www.luxcitizenship.com/tim-walzs-luxembourgish-roots-a-unique-connection-to-the-grand-duchy/">Luxembourgish</a> descent). Harris is an effortlessly cool veteran of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=UbDK0z5V0UQ">red carpets</a>. Walz is a dad joke that has attained corporal form. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In her person and biography, Harris represents the America that has benefited unequivocally from the transformations of the past half-century — the cosmopolitan, multicultural nation that has greeted the advance of racial and gender equality with relief, and the knowledge economy that’s taken to globalization with relish. Walz, by contrast, was shaped by the America that feels more at home in the world of yesterday, at least as it is nostalgically misremembered — a world where moral intuitions felt more stable, rural economies seemed more healthy, and the American elite looked more familiar; the America that put Donald Trump in the Oval Office, in other words.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Or at least, the Harris campaign has chosen to associate Walz with all of that America’s iconography, attempting to make it feel as included in the Democratic coalition as possible — without actually ceding much ground to conservative policy preferences. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The introduction to Walz’s speech Wednesday night looked like it could have been scripted by a chatbot asked to generate the antithesis of a “San Francisco liberal.” A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yh6Ei1TU2Sg">video montage</a> celebrated Walz’s diligent work on his family farm growing up, his service in the US military, skills as a marksman, and — above all — success as a football coach. Democrats leaned especially hard on that last, most American item on Walz’s resume. Just before the party’s vice presidential nominee took the mic, a group of his former players decked out in their gridiron garments marched on stage to a fight song (not to be confused with “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo1VInw-SKc">Fight Song</a>”). </p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tim Walz&#039;s old football team is in the house! <a href="https://t.co/c1LqY5xL9P">pic.twitter.com/c1LqY5xL9P</a></p>&mdash; Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) <a href="https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1826458984351453485?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 22, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Walz’s current persona is surely a half-truth. Unmentioned Wednesday night was that fact that, his parochial roots notwithstanding, Walz is a cosmopolitan intellectual who wrote a <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/lauded-by-former-students-tim-walz-wrote-his-masters-thesis-on-holocaust-education/">graduate thesis on Holocaust education</a> and has been to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/19/nx-s1-5081407/tim-walz-china-study-abroad">China roughly 30 times</a>. Still, the basic picture that Democrats aimed to paint rang true: Walz’s former students and players appeared to genuinely revere him, and the love between him and his family was palpable. It is possible to be worldly, liberal, and a quintessentially normal Midwesterner. And if Walz is not the latter, he certainly plays a good one on TV.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Walz put that persona to fine use in his address to the DNC. As both he and Harris have been doing <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/367389/dnc-2024-kamala-harris-policies-trump-dangerously-liberal">throughout their young campaign</a>, Walz attempted to sell a liberal agenda in conservative terms. He framed social liberalism and safety net programs as logical extensions of rural American neighborliness, saying that growing up in a small town taught him that the “family down the road, they may not think like you do, they may not pray like you do. They may not love like you do. But they’re your neighbors. And you look out for them. And they look out for you. Everybody belongs. And everybody has a responsibility to contribute.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The antithesis of small-town, middle American values was not California progressives, in Walz’s telling, but Republican zealots. Speaking of <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce">Project 2025</a>, the conservative movement’s blueprint for a second Trump admiration, Walz said:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Here’s the thing. It’s an agenda nobody asked for. It’s an agenda that serves nobody, except the richest and the most extreme amongst us. And it’s an agenda that does nothing for our neighbors in need.</em><em> </em><em>Is it weird? Absolutely. Absolutely. But it’s also wrong, and dangerous.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is some basis for believing that Democrats might be able to win over a small but significant fraction of Republican-leaning independents by wrapping center-left policies in conservative packaging. Some political scientists <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2019/05/political-messages-values-matter-policy">have found</a> that when moderate and conservative voters are presented with a progressive, Democratic economic policy idea — that is justified on the grounds that it will help uphold “the values and traditions that were handed down to us: hard work, loyalty to our country and the freedom to forge your own path” — some do respond favorably (as do liberal voters, who take no offense at such abstract, traditionalist pieties).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether Walz tying himself to rural American symbology — or Harris tying herself to “Coach Walz” — will be enough to blunt Trump’s attacks on the Democratic nominee’s supposed “<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4834669-trump-fake-photo-harris-communist/">communism</a>” remains to be seen. But the Democratic ticket is at least trying to make right-leaning Midwesterners feel like they belong (even if they do not think like Democrats do).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the third night of the Democratic National Convention four years ago, immigration was front and center. Americans heard a series of personal stories about how Trump-era policies had scrambled immigrants’ and their families’ lives.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">An 11-year-old girl <a href="https://19thnews.org/2020/08/how-a-young-girl-talking-about-deportation-became-one-of-the-breakout-moments-at-the-dnc/">read a letter to then-President Donald Trump</a>; the Trump administration had deported her mother two years before. An undocumented mother <a href="https://twitter.com/DemConvention/status/1296260314665824257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1296260314665824257%7Ctwgr%5E6f84f4e0a8a3890fe86c37c03d66d8665e9b015d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fslate.com%2Fnews-and-politics%2F2020%2F08%2Fdnc-immigration-undocumented-trump.html">recounted</a> how she crossed the border illegally to seek better medical care for her baby daughter — “When we got to the river, I raised her above the water and we crossed,” she said on national TV. She wasn’t the first undocumented immigrant to address the DNC, but she was the first non-DREAMer — more controversially, someone who crossed the border as an adult.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Four years later, the DNC sounds a lot different, reflecting how public opinion toward immigration in general has soured as concerns over how secure the border is have risen. Gone are the heartfelt testimonies from undocumented immigrants, the repudiation of Trump-era policies, and the calls for better treatment of migrants and expansion of asylum protections. Instead, Wednesday evening’s speakers embraced tougher policies for asylum seekers, praised President Joe Biden’s attempts to negotiate a bipartisan border security bill, and conceded the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/351535/3-theories-for-americas-anti-immigrant-shift">changed reality of immigration politics</a> since the pandemic’s dawn.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In other words, Democrats’ speeches on immigration and the border were drastically different than the ones at the conventions of 2012, 2016, or 2020 — because reality and the public’s feelings have changed drastically too.</p>

<iframe frameborder="0" height="200" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP1266057807" width="100%"></iframe>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Migrant hardships don’t seem to be much of a concern this year</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unlike at the GOP’s convention in Milwaukee last month, no one in Chicago this week is waving “Mass Deportations Now” placards, nor talking about an “<a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/361155/rnc-2024-republican-immigration-border-biden-policy-invasion-legal-gop">invasion</a>” or a “bloodbath” at the southern border. But given that party’s often extreme rhetoric and its consistently anti-immigrant positions in the past two decades, it can be easy to miss the Democrats’ own right-ward shift in recent years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In past party conventions, Democrats made significant attempts to highlight the plight of young immigrants and immigrant families — be they families split apart because of immigration policy, young DREAMers struggling and succeeding in America despite not having documentation, or activists working toward immigration reform.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2012, for example, Benita Veliz, a DREAMer from San Antonio, Texas, became <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/06/benita-veliz">the first undocumented person to address a national party’s political convention</a> — telling millions of viewers how she graduated as a top student and earned a double major in college before nearly being deported over a traffic violation. A DREAMer, she praised the Obama plan to roll out deportation protections in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Four years later, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/news/astrid-silva-facts-wiki/">another DREAMer</a> would join first lady Michelle Obama and Sen. Bernie Sanders as keynote speakers during Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s convention. Astrid Silva <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyrSSBQClGQ">would tell</a> her story of coming to the US as a 4-year-old with her mother, climbing into a raft to cross the Rio Grande, with just “a little doll.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And 2020 was all about contrasts with Trump, and the human suffering he had caused during his presidency.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wednesday night, speakers balanced two messages: that Democrats are not the same flavor of anti-immigrant as Republicans — they value diversity and believe in the humane treatment of migrants — but they understand the need for reform and bolstered security. They’re starting to sound like the fictional vice president from HBO’s <em>Veep</em>, who <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/03/veep-season-7-review/585976/">once</a> described a need to “<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/tvlines-performer-week-fargos-allison-tolman-191154066.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGAnjk5MAYTYSJl60f5HYf6mN3R0PLr1wA0pU_1PmSW2Z1702_4QJntvwrnex0MGoyuZFXLECOxqnNIwq2bIT6EZXZ0I3egIcri5zFXRoUOGqNuG8gEz_VF5Kox7fhaDK-cMXO9AKdRQ_YKjyiMGn0vaYvzDli4fu5SOyVhIppid">reform, reaffirm, and repel</a>” immigration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Wednesday night, some DREAMers did get a <a href="https://x.com/DaishiMT/status/1826419975608775102">50-second chance</a> to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris and push for DACA protections. And in just about every biographical clip of Harris, or biographical mention of Harris’s upbringing, her parents’ immigrant life stories take center stage. But there was hardly any wholehearted embrace of immigration in general this week, rarely a welcoming of economic migrants seeking “a better life,” as in past conventions. And that’s because reality has changed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Public sentiment is <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/351535/3-theories-for-americas-anti-immigrant-shift">now turning sharply against all kinds of immigration</a>. As I’ve <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/361155/rnc-2024-republican-immigration-border-biden-policy-invasion-legal-gop">explained before</a>, the shift has been quick but sustained:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Since 2020, the share of Americans wanting the level of all immigration to decrease has shot up, from 28 percent in the middle of 2020 to 55 percent as of June 2024, according to </em><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/647123/sharply-americans-curb-immigration.aspx"><em>Gallup polling data</em></a><em>.</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Those analysts note that 2024 is the first time since 2005 that the majority of the American public has wanted less immigration and that this anti-immigration sentiment is at its highest point since 2001, when the country was going through another bout of anti-immigrant fervor after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Those shifts are also happening across all sectors of the electorate. It’s not just white voters. </em><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/647123/sharply-americans-curb-immigration.aspx"><em>Nonwhite</em></a><em> voters and especially </em><a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/04/18/latino-immigrants-election-policy-deportation-discrimination"><em>Latino</em></a><em> voters are </em><a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/16/trump-latino-voter-enthusiasm-gap"><em>more likely</em></a><em> than in the past to want less immigration, and anti-immigrant sentiment is rising across all partisan groups, including among Democrats.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That changed reality also explains the DNC’s immigration programming choices.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Latino Democrats tried to paint Republicans as being weak on the border</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though it didn’t fall exclusively to them, a handful of Latino Democrats got the task of pushing the Democrats’ new tough-on-the-border image. California Rep. Pete Aguilar, the highest-ranking Latino in Congress, described Harris as both pro-immigrant and pro-border security: “Under President Harris, we can and will do both. As a prosecutor, she took on transnational gangs and cartels. As president, she will fight for pathways to citizenship.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto leaned into this message too, extolling Harris’s past prosecuting drug smugglers and human traffickers. And it was Texas’s Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar who criticized Trump for sabotaging Biden’s border deal, saying Trump “just made our jobs harder.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These lines likely foreshadow how Harris will keep positioning herself as moderate voters, swing voters, and less tuned-in voters consider her. Immigration policy and border security are some of her biggest vulnerabilities, and Republicans have been quick to <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361635/kamala-harris-border-czar-immigration-mexico-guatemala-rnc">lean into misleading attacks</a> about her role in handling diplomatic relations with Latin American countries as a way to blame her for the surge in border crossings during the Biden administration’s first three years (though those surges have slowed down significantly in recent months.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, the direction the party is heading was evident throughout the night: Gone are the Obama- and Clinton-era days of casting the Democratic Party as the unequivocal pro-immigrant party. The differences in the convention platforms <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dnc-night-3-immigration-speakers/">make that clear as well</a>. The 2024 party platform supports quicker deportations of economic migrants and stricter asylum rules — including the ability to stop processing those asylum claims. It’s not clear that those policies would help deter or slow the rate of future immigration, either legal or not, but for the time being, Democrats can report some results. After historically high numbers of migrant encounters at the southern border, crossings have been declining every month for the past five months, according to US Customs and Border Protection statistics provided to USA Today <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/08/16/immigration-plunges-us-mexico-border/74786097007/">this week</a>. The Department of Homeland Security attributes part of this to the administration’s tougher asylum and deterrence efforts&nbsp;—&nbsp;but it’s unclear that the public is aware of these trends yet.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the meantime, 2024’s Democrats sound very different from 2020 — when none of these kinds of stricter proposals appeared in the party’s platform.</p>

This is the summer Chappell Roan became impossible to ignore.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Roan has been a working pop artist for years. Now 26, she signed her first record deal with Atlantic Records at 17 and has been putting out songs ever since — but for a long time, none of them seemed to quite hit. Last September, though, Roan released her first full album, <em>The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess</em>, and set off on tour as Olivia Rodrigo’s opener. In March, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4WiXKGCJhg">her appearance on NPR’s Tiny Desk Concert series</a> went surprisingly viral (3.4 million views and counting), sending her <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/sabrina-carpenter-chappell-roan-are-pop-stars-in-the-making-how-opening-tour-gigs-tiktok-and-coachella-are-keys-to-their-success-215444839.html">Spotify monthly listeners count</a> rocketing up by 500 percent. In April, she became one of the <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/music-features/coachella-2024-review-best-acts-3618348">biggest stories out of Coachella</a>. In June, she was the story of the <a href="https://people.com/chappell-roan-dresses-as-statue-of-liberty-governors-ball-statement-about-freedom-8660637">Governor’s Ball</a>. She’s been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L94zTNhLnXo">on Jimmy Fallon</a>. She’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOg93THAyE0">performed on <em>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</em></a>. She is currently in the process of crossing the border that separates “working pop artist” and “pop star” — and finding that being a pop star comes with baggage.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/chappell-roan-addresses-creepy-behavior-fans-videos/story?id=112980547">In a pair of TikToks on August 20</a>, Roan called out her fans for overstepping boundaries in their interactions with her. “I don’t care that abuse and harassment — stalking, whatever — is a normal thing to do to people who are famous or a little famous, whatever,” she said. “I don’t care that it’s normal. I don’t care that this crazy type of behavior comes along with the job, the career field I’ve chosen. That does not make it okay. That doesn’t make it normal. Doesn’t mean I want it. Doesn’t mean I like it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Roan has such a clear-eyed relationship to her fame in part perhaps because of<strong> </strong>how long it took her to get here and what a strikingly different artist and performer she was at the beginning of the journey. Today, a Chappell Roan show plays like a joyous drag ball. A few years ago, Roan was making broody Lorde-meets-Florence Welch power ballads about suffering deliciously for the love of a boy. She pitched her voice deep and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkyqkv/cursive-singing-tiktok-trend-explained">sang her lyrics in smooth, diphthonged cursive</a>. In her videos, she wore her hair dark and straight.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Roan’s trajectory from there to here reveals a lot about why, exactly, she’s taking off so precipitously right now. It’s the story of coming of age, both artistically and personally, at exactly the right time and place.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Kayleigh became Chappell</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Roan grew up with the name Kayleigh Amstutz. She lived in what she sometimes describes as a <a href="https://www.polyesterzine.com/features/chappell-roan-audience-participation-playing-a-character-and-being-horny">trailer park</a> in Willard, Missouri, <a href="https://data.census.gov/profile/Willard_city,_Missouri?g=160XX00US2979882">population 6,000</a>. Her childhood was deeply conservative. She went to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/dec/29/chappell-roan-pops-next-big-thing-i-grew-up-thinking-being-gay-was-a-sin">church three times a week</a>, she said in an interview with the Guardian, and was taught that “being gay was bad and a sin.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I wish it was better. I wish I had better things to say,” <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/chappell-roan-casual-release-1234618237/">she told Rolling Stone</a> in 2022. “But mentally, I had a really tough time.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her family and peers found out she could sing when they heard her in a middle school talent show, and she signed to Atlantic Records after she was scouted posting songs to YouTube. Flying back and forth between her parents’ home in Missouri and studios in LA and New York, she got to work. She released her first single, “Good Hurt,” in August 2017, and her first EP <em>School Nights</em> a month later.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Already, she had decided that she would not be performing as Kayleigh Amstutz. Instead, <a href="https://www.news-leader.com/story/entertainment/2017/08/17/chappell-roan-singer-willard-she-just-made-big-time/548315001/">she created a stage name</a> in honor of her grandfather, Dennis Chappell, and his favorite song, “The Strawberry Roan.”&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>A few years ago, Roan was making broody Lorde-meets-Florence Welch power ballads about suffering deliciously for the love of a boy</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&#8220;The picking of the name was the hardest part of this entire thing,&#8221; <a href="https://www.news-leader.com/story/entertainment/2017/08/17/chappell-roan-singer-willard-she-just-made-big-time/548315001/">Roan confided in her hometown newspaper</a>, The Springfield News-Leader, in the lead-up to releasing <em>School Nights</em> in 2017. &#8220;It was the most stressful part.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A few years later, Roan had a different perspective on this part of her life. All of it seemed strange to her, stressful in its own way. “I felt very unprepared,” <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/chappell-roan-casual-release-1234618237/">she told Rolling Stone</a>. “I didn’t know the consequences of how much I had to sacrifice. I didn’t do my senior year. I didn’t go to prom. I didn’t go to graduation. I missed a lot of what would have been the end of my childhood to do this job.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the time, the job was to sing dark, moody songs about the sadomasochistic thrill of being in love with a bad boy. “No one else compares to who I had first,” Roan sings in “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEWNgO0F9k">Good Hurt</a>” as she submerges herself somberly in a lake of black water in the accompanying video. “All I really want is a good hurt.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Roan of this era was a markedly different performer from the Roan we know now. There was no hint of queerness in her presentation yet, with her songs addressed mainly to an unnamed “<a href="https://genius.com/Chappell-roan-sugar-high-lyrics">beautiful boy</a>.” With her long hair worn dark and straight, she gave off a witchy aura, an impression she magnified by gliding around in long white gowns — a far cry from the gleefully tacky drag get-ups she wears now.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps most striking of all, the aesthetic Roan used in the 2010s doesn’t feel like one particular to her. She was doing a variation of the melancholy indie pop sound and look that was then in vogue.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.nme.com/features/the-cover/the-cover-chapell-roan-interview-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-midwest-princess-3582467">Roan now describes her sound of this era as</a> “really dark, angsty pop that was pretty boring.” Her magnetic presence and vocal chops were enough to garner her a small and fervent fanbase, but it wasn’t yet a group large enough to reach critical mass.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Everything changed, Roan has said in interviews, when she left Missouri to live full time in Los Angeles on her own in 2018. For the first time, she was able to separate herself from the conservative ideology of her childhood.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I was told this city is demonic and Satanists live here,” <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/the-cover/the-cover-chapell-roan-interview-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-midwest-princess-3582467">Roan told NME this February</a>. “But when I got to West Hollywood, it opened my eyes [to the fact] that everything I was afraid of wasn’t always true — especially [what I’d been told] about the queer community. Going to gay clubs for the first time, it felt spiritual.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It was also in LA that Roan met the man who would become her primary creative collaborator: Dan Nigro, a music producer and former indie frontman. He and Roan&nbsp; began collaborating just a few months before Nigro broke out in a huge way for his work on Olivia Rodrigo’s “Driver’s License.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first collaboration Nigro and Roan released together was “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR3Liudev18">Pink Pony Club</a>,” which dropped in April 2020. There, we start to see the beginning of what we now know as Chappell Roan: hair worn loose and curly, vulnerability pushed forward but shame exuberantly chased away.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Pink Pony Club” is a story song Roan has said was inspired by her first trip to the Abbey, an institution in LA’s gay nightlife scene. She was transfixed by the go-go dancers, and so she wrote a song about a woman from a small town who leaves her scandalized mother behind to become a stripper at the Pink Pony Club. Roan had sung all her previous songs in the deep indie girl slur that was popular at the time, but she does “Pink Pony Club” in a voice so precise it starts to feel like a burlesque.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“<em>God</em>, what have you <em>done</em>?” wails the narrator’s mother in the chorus, with Roan coming down hard on the d’s and the t’s, her falsetto bright and airy. “Oh mama, I&#8217;m just having fun,” the narrator responds, and although the song is in a minor key, Roan’s voice is joyous: “On the stage in my heels, it’s where I belong.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unfortunately for Roan, April 2020 was not a time that welcomed raucous odes to the dance club. When “Pink Pony Club” dropped into the traumatic early days of the pandemic, it sank like a stone.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The song was also <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/the-cover/the-cover-chapell-roan-interview-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-midwest-princess-3582467">unpopular at her label</a>, which disapproved of Roan turning her back so abruptly on the aesthetic she’d begun to craft in <em>School Nights</em>. Roan released only two more songs with Atlantic: the light love ballad “<a href="https://youtu.be/0SfI95-XIqU?si=xYK-CHWLXetEukRD">Love Me Anyway</a>” and the melancholy “<a href="https://youtu.be/GcXlN7meclE?si=7xSlEVN8IHIbaeCy">California</a>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“California” is a sort of response to and inverse of “Pink Pony Club.” Like its predecessor, it tells the story of a dreamer who left her small town for a love of delicious sin in LA. Unlike the main character in “Pink Pony Club,” the narrator of “California” feels increasingly like she’s failed by coming to the city and that everything she’s sacrificed has been for nothing. “Won’t make my mama proud,” Roan sings with mounting excitement in “Pink Pony Club.” “I let you down,” she sings on a down note in “California.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ten days after “California” was released, in August 2020, Atlantic officially dropped Roan from the label. Her music, they said, was underperforming. The same week, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/chappell-roan-casual-release-1234618237/">her relationship with the man she’d been seeing for four and a half years ended</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Midwest princess rises</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I felt like a failure, but I knew deep down I wasn’t,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/dec/29/chappell-roan-pops-next-big-thing-i-grew-up-thinking-being-gay-was-a-sin">Roan told the Guardian in 2023</a>. She moved back home to Willard, Missouri, got a job working the drive-thru window at a coffee kiosk, and plotted her next move. She wanted to give herself time to recalibrate and save money before going back to LA and trying music again. She would give herself a year there to make it before giving in and enrolling in college.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, little by little, Roan was beginning to develop a cult following, without any official backing from the music industry. “Pink Pony Club” was becoming a bona fide sleeper hit as it took off across TikTok and through word of mouth.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Here’s a totally reasonable proposal for song of summer 2021: a single that dropped more than a full year ago, in April 2020, to essentially no fanfare, by a 21-year-old singer-songwriter who hasn’t even cracked 4,000 followers on Twitter,” <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/song-recommendation-chappell-roan-pink-pony-club.html">announced Vulture in 2021</a>, describing “Pink Pony Club” as “a pop hit from an alternate timeline that somehow ended up in ours by accident.” The song wasn’t charting yet, not even close, but it was starting to get attention in all the right places.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, Nigro had been helping Olivia Rodrigo craft and release her hit debut studio album, <em>Sour.</em> In November 2021, with Rodrigo launched, Nigro and Roan reunited. Roan was feeling listless and ignored, she says, and Nigro gave her the impetus she needed to start working for herself. “[Dan] was just looking at me and goes ‘You are going to run your career into the fucking ground if you don’t start doing shit on your own,’” <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/chappell-roan-casual-release-1234618237/">Roan told Rolling Stone in 2023</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In March 2022, Roan released “<a href="https://youtu.be/nXZuv1T8bfg?si=Sfu9KPq3laClLfbS">Naked in Manhattan</a>,” her first song as an independent artist, without the backing of a music label. She shot the accompanying video with friends in thrifted wardrobe on the streets of New York City.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The song sees Roan crushing on a girl friend, hoping to finally cross the line and kiss her. “Boys suck, and girls I’ve never tried,” she sings. In real life, she says, the lyric was true when she wrote it. “I was dating a boy then,” <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/chappell-roan-casual-release-1234618237/">Roan told the LA Times last August</a>. “I had never even kissed a girl when these songs [“Naked in Manhattan” and “Red Wine Supernova”] were written. It was all what I wished my life could be.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Naked in Manhattan” continues the aesthetic project Roan found in “Pink Pony Club” and develops it. It’s Roan’s first explicitly queer song. (“Pony Club” covers its coming-out narrative in a thin veil of plausible deniability.) It’s also the first to feature the spoken word interlude that would become a go-to move for her. The accompanying video also debuts the “<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/chappell-roan-casual-release-1234618237/">thrift store pop star</a>” drag queen style that became her calling card: fire engine red hair, elaborate hyper-femme outfits cobbled together from thrift store pieces, a pinup girl burlesque cheekiness. It was a sign that Roan had at last found a new image that she loved.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In March 2022, Roan was announced as the opener for Olivia Rodrigo and Fletcher. She continued releasing independent singles: “<a href="https://youtu.be/ePsqyPMIg6I?si=d-PcUErh9GQdzuhw">Karma</a>” and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdaKBAuO8zg">Femininomenon</a>” in August 2022, and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfSjnsYiY_A">Casual</a>” in October. In February 2023, she launched her own national tour.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All the while, she was developing the character of “Chappell Roan” beyond just a stage name into a fully distinct persona like those used by the drag queens she had come to idolize. “Don’t call me baby, and don’t call me Kayleigh,” she would say at the opening of her shows. When she was performing, she stopped being Kayleigh and Chappell took over.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Chappell was all the things Kayleigh was ashamed of, made newly exuberant and joyful. She wore clownish white-face makeup because “that’s what the <a href="https://www.papermag.com/chappell-roan-trixie-mattel#rebelltitem2">country boys called gay people in my hometown. Clowns.</a>” She plays campily with the signifiers of her small-town background: <a href="https://5centsound.com/blog/house-of-chappell">yodeling vocal trills and camo-print merch</a>. Perhaps most significantly, she is unapologetically sexual in ways that her creator cannot quite bring herself to be.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I have such a difficult time — as Kayleigh — with sex,” she said in an <a href="https://www.polyesterzine.com/features/chappell-roan-audience-participation-playing-a-character-and-being-horny">interview with Polyester Zine in 2023</a>. “I have a hard time watching sex scenes or flirting with people! I get really uncomfortable with hyper sexual things. But as the drag queen that I play, Chappell, she&#8217;s not like that — she is very confident and comfortable singing about those things.”</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“Don’t call me baby, and don’t call me Kayleigh,” she would say at the opening of her shows</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In March&nbsp;2023, Roan announced that she had signed to Nigro’s new label, Amusement Records, in partnership with Island Records.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to Roan, by then, she had options. “I met with nine labels and I went in with the attitude [of], ‘This is what I need — the only thing I need right now is money,’” she told <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/music-interviews/chappell-roan-interview-red-wine-supernova-debut-album-radar-3458322">NME</a>. “So if you don’t give me this, this and this, I’m just not going to sign with you because I can keep going on my own. I was very picky and I had a fuck ton of leverage.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Roan wasn’t wrong. She had all that leverage because it was clear that her moment was arriving. Now, after years of trying on personas that didn’t quite fit, of working bad day jobs and living with roommates, of scrabbling studio time and music videos together without a label to back her, it’s finally here.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A drag queen pop star in a time of moral panic</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Looking back over the arc of Roan’s career, it becomes clear that her music got really good and her career started to take off once she had a strong sense of who she was as an individual. That sense of self is intertwined with Roan defining herself as a queer woman.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The energy of <em>The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess</em> comes from the palpable joy of finding oneself and rejecting old beliefs. “Touch me, baby, put your lips on mine,” Roan instructs her sapphic crush in “Naked in Manhattan,” adding with a verbal shrug, “Could go to hell but we’ll probably be fine.” The Chappell Roan of “Good Hurt” might have believed she would go to hell if she kissed a girl. The Chappell Roan of “Naked in Manhattan” doesn’t much care either way, even if the person who wrote the lyrics hasn’t quite gotten there herself yet.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If <em>Midwest Princess</em> is a celebration of finding oneself, Chappell Roan the character is the personification of that glee. Chappell, with her white-face makeup and princessy gowns that are just a little off, expresses what her creator longs for and cannot quite reach herself.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The whole project is to honor my 10-year-old self. My whole persona is just me trying to honor that version of myself that I was never allowed to be,” <a href="https://www.papermag.com/chappell-roan-trixie-mattel#rebelltitem2">she told Paper in June</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Part of the fame problem Roan is now facing is the downside of making a drag queen a pop star. In drag, it’s understood that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rupaulsdragrace/comments/7amnp5/how_do_you_guys_approach_queens_out_of_drag/">you don’t approach a queen for a picture when she’s out of costume</a>. Roan has made it clear that when she stops being Chappell and starts being Kayleigh again, she expects to be left alone — but not all of her fans think that’s an appropriate ask coming from a pop star who owes her fame to her fanbase.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/chappell-roan-addresses-creepy-behavior-fans-videos/story?id=112980547">In her videos</a>, Roan implies that some fans have stalked her family and bullied her virtually after she refused to take a picture “because she has her own time.”<strong> </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I’m a random bitch. You’re a random bitch. Just think about that for a second, okay?” Roan said. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even as Roan grapples with her fans, it is probably not a coincidence that America fell in love with Chappell Roan at the same time that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/9/7/23860447/supreme-court-drag-shows-ban-tennessee-montana-texas-florida-queens">drag shows are becoming criminalized</a>. While lawmakers position drag queens as monstrous threats to children, Roan stands for drag as the thing that saved an unhappy child, a joy, a marvelous act of creation. Her artistic project is about finding her self-identity, and as soon as she found that self, she made her a drag queen.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What makes Chappell Roan so compelling to watch is that as a character, she stands for a profound release, an unshaming. She is the artistic culmination of a long search for self-discovery, and you can hear the joy and celebration of that search in the music.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That is, she’s the culmination for now. Who knows what’s coming next?&nbsp;</p>

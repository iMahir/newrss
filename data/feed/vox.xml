<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/350915/icc-arrest-netanyahu-israel-sinwar-hamas-khan-prosecutor-gallant-idf-haniyeh">International Criminal Court (ICC)</a> has formally issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif for war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The arrest warrants do not guarantee that the men will be tried at The Hague, the Dutch city where the ICC is located. Nor do they guarantee any of them will even be arrested, though some countries <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/21/world-reacts-to-icc-arrest-warrants-for-israels-netanyahu-gallant">have announced they would comply with the warrants</a>.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But they do make life more complicated for Gallant and Netanyahu in particular. (It’s unclear whether Deif is currently alive.) Both Israelis will find it more difficult to travel abroad, as signatories to the treaty that created the ICC are obligated to arrest and turn over those accused of crimes. That means “there are now 124 countries” — all&nbsp;<a href="https://asp.icc-cpi.int/states-parties">signatories</a> —&nbsp;“where they would be unwise to travel,” Adil Haque, a law professor at Rutgers University, told Vox.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And the warrants will likely be a complicating factor for some of Israel’s allies. Some have domestic laws prohibiting the transfer of weapons to nations that might use them to commit atrocity crimes. Others may find the warrants put a strain on diplomatic relationships.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The warrants <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-state-palestine-icc-pre-trial-chamber-i-rejects-state-israels-challenges">accuse Gallant and Netanyahu</a> of violating the laws of international armed conflict by intentionally depriving civilians in Gaza of “food, water, and medicine and medical supplies, as well as fuel and electricity” by consistently blocking humanitarian aid into Gaza. They also accuse both men of intentionally directing attacks against civilians in Gaza in at least two instances. <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-state-palestine-icc-pre-trial-chamber-i-issues-warrant-arrest-mohammed-diab-ibrahim">Deif is also accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity</a> including murder, torture, and sexual violence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel has denounced the issuance of the warrants; Netanyahu’s office said Thursday, “There is nothing more just than the war that Israel has been waging in Gaza.” At least 44,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel began its assault on the territory last year in response to an October 7 attack by Hamas that killed <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/israel-hamas-war-death-toll-1-year/story?id=114458943">roughly 1,200 people</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Are Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant actually going to be arrested by the ICC?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Netanyahu and Gallant are in no danger of an immediate arrest. Israel is not a signatory to the ICC, meaning it doesn’t recognize the Court’s jurisdiction in its territory. The US — Israel’s closest and most powerful ally — isn’t a signatory either, and in the past <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/12/14/us-sanctions-international-criminal-court">has even sanctioned ICC officials</a> attempting to investigate war crimes committed by <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/03/05/icc-greenlights-afghanistan-investigation">the CIA and US military personnel in Afghanistan</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That means Israeli law enforcement isn’t obligated to arrest Netanyahu or Gallant, and the US is highly unlikely to pressure either man to turn himself in.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel has tried to argue that the ICC doesn’t have jurisdiction over Israelis at all, but the state of Palestine has been a signatory since 2015 —&nbsp;so crimes committed by anyone in occupied Palestinian territory like Gaza are, in fact, the ICC’s purview.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel has also tried to claim that the Court shouldn’t be involved in this case because Israel has a strong and competent court system; though that may be true, that court system is not investigating either man for the crimes the ICC prosecutor claims.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan recommended the arrest warrants in May. At the time, he also recommended warrants for former Hamas leaders who have since been killed by Israeli forces. The Court doesn’t try people in absentia, so the cases against the dead would be moot.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Court does not have its own police force and relies on signatory nations’ law enforcement for arrests. Nations generally don’t make arrests on behalf of the ICC outside of their borders, which means the most likely path for Netanyahu and Gallant to end up in ICC custody would be apprehension by a nation they’re visiting that has a record of taking international treaty obligations very seriously.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The warrants could have other consequences outside of arrests</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although Netanyahu and Gallant are reasonably safe from arrest, the warrants could have diplomatic and military consequences for Israel, especially in Europe.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think that even Israel&#8217;s allies who are ICC member states will face internal domestic pressure to cut off diplomatic contacts with Netanyahu,” Haque said. For example, “not only can he not travel to Germany, I also would be surprised if [German leaders] will fly to Israel and be photographed with him shaking hands and whatnot, or even to talk to him electronically, just because within their country, they&#8217;re going to get a lot of domestic pushback.” The warrants already seem to have diplomatic consequences: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/dutch-foreign-ministers-trip-israel-canceled-dutch-news-agency-anp-2024-11-21/">The Dutch foreign minister has postponed a planned visit to Israel</a> following the Netherlands’ announcement that it would comply with the arrest warrant. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Staunch allies that aren’t ICC member countries — namely the United States — aren’t as likely to change their relationship with Israel, however. “The ICC has no credibility and these allegations have been refuted by the U.S. government,” Rep. Mike Waltz (R-FL), President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for national security adviser, <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelgwaltz/status/1859589936967512244">wrote on X</a>. “You can expect a strong response to the antisemitic bias of the ICC &amp; UN come January.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant could also complicate weapons transfers from European states and <a href="https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2024-10/news/canada-and-uk-restrict-arms-sales-israel-over-gaza-war">nations with laws limiting transfers</a> in situations in which there’s credible reason to believe a country will use them to commit atrocities.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We&#8217;ve already seen a Dutch court saying that the Netherlands cannot send <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/dutch-supreme-court-hears-arguments-over-exporting-fighter-jet-parts-to-israel/">fighter jet [parts]</a>, for example, to Israel. We&#8217;ve seen the termination or expiration of various <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/03/nx-s1-5098300/uk-suspends-arms-israel">arms contracts that the UK had</a>,” said <a href="https://www.wm.edu/as/government/faculty-directory/zvobgo_k.php">Kelebogile Zvobgo</a>, professor of government at the College of William &amp; Mary. Those decisions came in the wake of proceedings at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), in which the court agreed to hear a case <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g9g63jl17o">accusing Israel of genocide</a>, and ordered Israel to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/01/26/1227078791/icj-israel-genocide-gaza-palestinians-south-africa">stop any actions</a> that could cause genocide. (The <a href="https://theconversation.com/what-are-the-icj-and-the-icc-and-how-do-their-power-and-jurisdiction-differ-230573">ICJ is the UN’s court</a>, which focuses on inter-country disputes.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are many steps between the issuance of a warrant in the ICC and a judgment at The Hague, including the arrest of Netanyahu and Gallant, as well as gathering evidence that connects the men to the specific alleged crimes —&nbsp;something that’s not simple in active war zones. But as Zvobgo pointed out, Khan, the ICC chief prosecutor, “only brought charges that he thought would realistically result in conviction.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And even if the men accused do not end up in The Hague, Zvobgo said, “even if Netanyahu never steps on Dutch soil, never stands trial at the ICC, he will forever be someone who has been charged with atrocities.” And the charges won’t go away once the war ends, Zvobgo added: “There is no statute of limitations on atrocity crimes.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whenever Democrats lose an election, a debate inevitably ensues over whether they were done in by an unenthused base or an alienated swing electorate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No matter how many times this drama <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/9/11/20856802/swing-voters-base-democrats-trump-2020-election">gets restaged</a>, the parts and scripts remain largely the same. Center-left Democrats <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/10/democratic-party-crisis-mode-00188547">insist</a> that their party must win over swing voters with moderation, while some progressives maintain <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/corporate-democrats-not-woke-activists-doomed-kamala-harris/">that it actually needs</a> to mobilize its disaffected core constituencies with a more radical agenda.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, voiced the latter perspective in <a href="https://x.com/PramilaJayapal/status/1858537431508644257">a pair</a> of <a href="https://x.com/PramilaJayapal/status/1858252522365849707">X posts</a> this week, saying, “the true swing voters don’t swing between Republicans and Democrats. They swing between the voting booth and back to the sidelines if they’re being ignored or taken for granted.” She further argued that the “true swing voter is our multiracial, multigenerational base that needs to see we’re fighting for them.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For some progressives, Jayapal’s argument is proven by one critical fact about the 2024 election: Kamala Harris received far fewer votes than Joe Biden — and this decline in support for the Democratic nominee was larger than the increase in support for Donald Trump. As of this writing, Trump’s vote total in 2024 is 2.6 million higher than in 2020, while Harris has fallen more than 7 million ballots short of Biden’s vote total four years ago. (The latter margin is likely to narrow a bit, since slow-counting areas are disproportionately Democratic.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s more, in the 47 states where the vote count is largely complete, the most Democratic counties in 2020 delivered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/democrats-trump-harris-turnout.html">1.9 million fewer votes for Harris</a> than they had for Biden, even as predominantly Republican counties generated 1.2 million more votes for Trump this year than in 2020.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, Jayapal is wrong to suggest that swing voters — which is to say, voters open to changing their partisan allegiance from election to election — are an extinct species. And the broader idea that Democrats only need to worry about mobilizing their base, and can best do this by putting forward a bold, progressive agenda, rests on multiple false assumptions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Democrats fall prey to such fallacies, they will have a harder time rebuilding a robust, majority coalition in the years to come.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are five basic problems with Jayapal’s outlook:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">1) Democratic turnout did not collapse where it mattered</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At this point, it is not actually possible to know with certainty whether turnout or persuasion drove this year’s changes in each party’s vote total. That’s because we don’t yet know 1) how Americans who turned out in 2024 voted last time nor 2) whom 2024 nonvoters would have supported, had they decided to cast a ballot.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For these reasons, even in counties where the Democratic nominee’s vote tally fell by much more than Trump’s rose, it is possible that a broad increase in support for the Republican nominee drove both changes: If voters and nonvoters alike became more pro-Trump in these areas, then falling turnout might not have mattered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, in such counties, it seems likely that a decline in Democratic turnout contributed to Harris’s disappointing showing. But the places where the Democratic nominee’s vote tally collapsed tend to have one thing in common: They’re <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/11/15/2024/democratic-turnout-plummeted-in-2024-but-only-in-safe-states">mostly located in safe blue or red states</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the places that actually mattered, Harris did not earn dramatically fewer raw votes than Biden. To the contrary, in four swing states — Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, and Wisconsin — she actually won more votes than Biden did in 2020.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, despite apparently mobilizing more Democratic voters in these states, Harris lost them all. Even if population growth partly explains Harris’s gains, especially in the Sun Belt, it is extremely unlikely that we’d see this pattern of results if swing voters did not exist.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">2) In the last four federal elections, millions of voters switched their partisan allegiances</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although we don’t yet know how much party-switching occurred in 2024, we have a clearer picture of previous elections. And in 2016, 2018, and 2020, millions of voters changed sides.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/just-how-many-obama-2012-trump-2016-voters-were-there/#_edn2">an analysis of high-quality survey data</a> from the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, between 6.7 and 9.2 million Americans voted for Barack Obama in 2012 and then Trump in 2016.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Two years later, Democrats dominated the 2018 midterms, winning the House popular vote by 8.6 points (in 2016, Republicans actually won more House votes than Democrats did). Although many assumed that this was the result of a Resistance-fueled surge in Democratic turnout, <a href="https://medium.com/@yghitza_48326/revisiting-what-happened-in-the-2018-election-c532feb51c0">89 percent of the party’s improvement</a> derived from voters switching their partisan allegiances, according to the Democratic data firm Catalist.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2020, 2.43 percent of voters reported voting for the major party they had opposed in 2016, according to a <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-science-research-and-methods/article/fall-of-trump-mobilization-and-vote-switching-in-the-2020-presidential-election/54A7D26C371AC3CE26AD78D866695A17">2023 study</a>. This was an unusually low level of vote switching but still suggests that 3.8 million voters backed the Democratic nominee after supporting the Republican one four years earlier, or vice versa.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, in the 2022 midterms, GOP gained ground with both <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/07/12/how-the-gop-won-the-turnout-battle-and-a-narrow-victory-in-last-years-midterms/">rural</a> and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/07/12/voting-patterns-in-the-2022-elections/">white working-class voters</a>, due in part to vote switching among those who had backed Democratic candidates in 2018, according to the <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/11/15/2024/democratic-turnout-plummeted-in-2024-but-only-in-safe-states">Pew Research Center</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All this indicates that swing voters, as conventionally defined, very much exist. And while small in number, in a closely divided country, their shifting whims can be decisive (especially since winning over a swing voter is twice as valuable as turning out a base voter, since the former not only adds to your tally but subtracts from your opponent’s).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">3) Pre-election polling indicated that a significant number of Biden 2020 voters were shifting toward Trump&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the New York Times/Siena College’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/03/us/elections/times-siena-battleground-poll-crosstabs.html">final polls</a> of the battleground states, 6 percent of Trump supporters said they’d backed Biden in 2020, while 4 percent of Harris voters said they had backed Trump. The pollster’s<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/13/us/elections/times-siena-poll-likely-electorate-crosstabs.html"> final national poll</a> showed more modest — but still significant — vote switching, with 4 percent of Biden 2020 voters favoring Trump, and 3 percent of Trump 2020 voters backing Harris.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This indicates that the same basic pattern witnessed in 2016, 2018, 2020, and 2022 — of a small but significant share of the electorate switching their partisan preference — continued in 2024.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">4) The realignment of working-class and college-educated voters since 2012 cannot be explained by changes in turnout</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2012, Democrats won 45 percent of white, college-educated voters, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/hzqbc0gambbp7fidn3wld/wh2020_public_release_crosstabs.xlsx?rlkey=8s3u9u0o64yczmt77kya2ckx1&amp;e=1&amp;dl=0">according to Catalist</a>. That figure rose to 46 percent to 2016 and 54 percent in 2020. Democrats also did far better with white college graduates than Obama had in the 2018 and 2022 midterms, winning 54 percent of the bloc’s vote in the first midterm, and 50 percent of it in the second.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To believe that this was entirely attributable to turnout — rather than voters switching sides — one would need to posit that white college-educated Republicans abruptly and durably became less likely to turnout for elections in 2016, while white college-educated Democrats happened to increase their turnout rate in a sudden and lasting fashion at the very same time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This does not seem plausible. And much the same can be said of the shift in white <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/09/is-america-too-rich-for-class-politics.html">non-college-educated Americans</a> voting behavior since 2016. These shifts are simply too large and persistent to purely reflect asymmetric changes in turnout rates within these populations.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">5) Democratic-leaning nonvoters are not especially progressive</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Turnout is still a key determinant of election outcomes. Democrats would almost certainly have done better in 2024 if every Biden 2020 voter had shown up at the polls.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there is little basis for the idea that Democratic-leaning nonvoters would turn out en masse, if only their party became more progressive.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In reality, swing voters and low-propensity partisans tend to move in the same direction. Which is to say: When a party does better with swing voters, it typically also mobilizes more of its base than the other party does. This is partly because the forces that lead a party’s voter to switch sides — and the forces that lead them to drop out of the electorate — are often largely the same.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261379418302907?via%3Dihub">a study</a> by the Ohio State University political scientist Jon Green, Obama voters who agreed with Trump on some major issues — such as immigration, climate change, or gun control — were more likely than other Obama voters to defect to the GOP in 2016, even after controlling for other variables. And the same was true of Obama voters who expressed sexist views in opinion surveys.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Neither of those findings are too surprising. More notable though, is that Obama voters who were either sexist or conservative on some major issues were also more likely than other Obama voters to sit out the 2016 election. Thus, Trump’s positioning on issues like immigration, guns, and climate not only persuaded a key chunk of Obama voters, but also seemingly demobilized other Obama voters, who no longer felt a strong preference for the Democratic nominee. (Notably, 2012 Mitt Romney voters who agreed with Hillary Clinton on some major issues were also more likely than other Romney voters to either support Clinton or sit the election out. Unfortunately for Democrats, these voters were less numerous in key battleground states than Obama-to-Trump voters).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Green’s study is consistent with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/upshot/nonvoters-2020-presidential-election.html">other survey data</a> showing that low-propensity Democratic voters are significantly <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/9/11/20856802/swing-voters-base-democrats-trump-2020-election">more moderate</a> than Democrats who reliably show up for elections. In truth, Americans who want the Democratic Party to be more uniformly progressive are, by and large, the most <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/10/opinion/sunday/obama-trump-voters-democrats.html">reliably Democratic voters</a> in the country. It is Democrats with more <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/24058352/what-were-getting-wrong-about-2024s-moderate-voters">heterodox views</a> — those who are progressive on some issues and moderate or conservative on others — that the party is most at risk of losing to either Republicans or the living room couch.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This said, ideologically extreme candidates do appear to have an influence on turnout, but only because they <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/who-punishes-extremist-nominees-candidate-ideology-and-turning-out-the-base-in-us-elections/366A518712BE9BCC1CB035BF53095D65">tend to mobilize the other party’s voters</a> in opposition, according to a 2018 study from political scientists at Stanford and UCLA.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of this means that Democrats must embrace across-the-board centrism in order to compete for the presidency in 2028. A large segment of both <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/13/us/politics/biden-trump-battleground-poll.html">swing voters</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/upshot/nonvoters-2020-presidential-election.html">Democratic nonvoters</a> share a deep skepticism about the political system and broadly progressive views on <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/08/poll-marijuana-legalization-data-for-progress-radical-ideas-popular-aoc.html">various economic issues</a>. A certain version of economic populism might play well with both constituencies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Further, Trump is likely to implement many controversial policies over the next four years and could very well <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/24137666/trump-agenda-inflation-prices-dollar-devaluation-tariffs">undermine the economy’s performance</a> with his trade and immigration agenda. It is therefore possible that he will solve the Democrats short-term problems for them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But if you believe that Democrats should aim to build a large national majority, then there is no alternative to heeding swing voters’ concerns — not least because your party’s turnout targets are likely to share their complaints.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">India and Pakistan are losing ground to a common deadly enemy. Vast clouds of dense, toxic smog have once again shrouded metropolises in South Asia. Air pollution regularly spikes in November in the subcontinent, but this year’s dirty air has still been breathtaking in its scale and severity. The gray, smoky <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm20k76d5xno">pollution is even visible to satellites</a>, and it’s fueling a public health crisis.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last week, officials in the Punjab province in Pakistan imposed lockdowns on the cities of Multan, <a href="https://populationstat.com/pakistan/multan">population 2.1 million</a>, and Lahore, <a href="https://populationstat.com/pakistan/lahore">population 13.7 million</a>, after reaching <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2024/11/4/record-high-air-pollution-shuts-schools-in-pakistans-lahore">record-high pollution levels</a>. “Smog is currently a national disaster,” senior Punjab provincial minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said during a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-punjab-smog-lahore-health-pollution-multan-899d54e8b4474c2468cdf59d9aaf5225">press conference last week</a>. Schools shut down, restaurants closed, construction halted, highways sat empty, and medical staff were recalled to hospitals and clinics. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Across the border in India, the 33 million residents of Delhi this week are breathing air pollution that’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-delhi-air-pollution-india-ae1ec1e6292009db198f18b113047cd5">50 times higher</a> than the safe limit outlined by the World Health Organization (WHO). The choking haze caused <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/delhi/2024/Nov/19/delhi-pollution-400-flights-delayed-in-seasons-worst-smog">15 aircraft to divert</a> to nearby airports and caused hundreds of delays. <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-air-pollution-live-updates-toxic-air-aqi-level-grap-4-restrictions-schools-private-offices/liveblog/115433153.cms">Students and workers</a> were told to stay home.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite all the disruption, air pollution continues to spike <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/11/22/16666808/india-air-pollution-new-delhi">year</a> after <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/11/8/18075340/delhi-pollution-diwali-india">year</a> after <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/11/8/20948348/delhi-india-air-pollution-quality-cause">year</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Why? The dirty air arises from a confluence of human and natural factors. Construction, cooking fires, brick kilns, vehicles, and burning leftovers from crop harvests are all feeding into the toxic clouds. The Himalaya and Hindu Kush mountains to the north of lower-lying areas like Lahore and Delhi hold the smog in place. In the winter, the region experiences <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/winters-deadly-blanket-how-thermal-inversion-traps-india-pakistan-in-toxic-air-2633696-2024-11-15">thermal inversions</a>, where a layer of warm air pushes down on cool winter air, holding the pollution closer to the ground.</p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As populations grow in South Asia, so will the need for food, energy, housing, and transportation. Without a course correction, that will mean even more pollution. Yet <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23757949/air-pollution-history-progress-clean-air-act-environmental-protection-agency-wildfires-smoke-smog">history shows</a> that <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22937366/air-polluted-city-smog-india-china-beijing">air pollution is a solvable problem</a>. Cities like Los Angeles and Beijing that were once notorious for dirty air have managed to clean it up. The process took years, drawing on economic development and new technologies. But it also required good governance and incentives to cut pollution, something local officials in India and Pakistan have already demonstrated can clear the air. The task now is to scale it up to higher levels of government.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">We’re still not getting the full picture of the dangers of air pollution</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s no shortage of science showing how <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/how-air-pollution-is-destroying-our-health">terrible air pollution is for you</a>. It aggravates asthma, worsens heart disease, triggers inflammation, and increases infection risk. It hampers <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5017593/">brain development in children</a> and can contribute to <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/air-pollution-may-increase-risk-for-dementia/">dementia in adults</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On average, air pollution has <a href="https://aqli.epic.uchicago.edu/news/polluted-air-shortens-human-lifespans-more-than-tobacco-study-finds/">reduced life expectancies around the world by 2.3 years</a>, more than tobacco. It contributes to <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ambient-(outdoor)-air-quality-and-health">almost 7 million deaths per year</a>, according to WHO, about <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/births-and-deaths">one in nine deaths annually</a>. It sucks <a href="https://www.clarity.io/blog/a-deep-dive-economic-impacts-of-air-pollution">trillions of dollars</a> out of the global economy. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The toll is especially acute in South Asia. Air pollution drains <a href="https://aqli.epic.uchicago.edu/country-spotlight/pakistan/">3.9 years of life in Pakistan</a>. In India, it <a href="https://aqli.epic.uchicago.edu/country-spotlight/India/">steals 5.3 years</a>. For <a href="https://restofworld.org/2024/riders-in-the-smog-gig-workers-pollution/">workers who spend their days outdoors</a> — delivery drivers, construction crews, farm laborers — the damage is even higher. Many residents report constant fevers, coughs, and headaches.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite the well-known dangers and the mounting threat, it remains a persistent problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Part of the challenge of improving air quality is that air pollution isn’t just one thing; it’s a combination of hazardous chemicals and particles that arise in teeming metropolises in developing countries. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the most popular metrics around the world for tracking pollution is the <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/23769186/bad-air-quality-index-wildfires-pollution">Air Quality Index</a>, developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The index is not a measurement of any one pollutant, but rather the risk from a combination of pollutants based on US air quality standards. The main villains are ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and particles. The particles are subcategorized into those smaller than 10 microns (PM10) and smaller than 2.5 microns (PM2.5). (Earlier this year, the <a href="https://document.airnow.gov/technical-assistance-document-for-the-reporting-of-daily-air-quailty.pdf">EPA modified the way it calculates the AQI</a>, so numbers from this year are not an apples-to-apples comparison to levels from previous years.) The tiny particles are pernicious because they penetrate deep into the lungs and trigger breathing problems.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">An <a href="https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/">AQI below 50</a> is considered safe to breathe. Above 200, the air is considered a health threat for everyone. At 300, it’s an emergency. In Delhi, the AQI this week <a href="https://www.iqair.com/us/newsroom/delhi-air-quality-alert-delhi-india-hazardous-air-quality">reached 1,185</a>. Lahore reached <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/how-is-lahore-worlds-most-polluted-city-battling-toxic-air-2024-11-06/">1,900 this month</a>. If a person breathes this air for over 24 hours, the exposure is roughly equivalent to smoking <a href="https://berkeleyearth.org/air-pollution-and-cigarette-equivalence/">90 cigarettes in a day</a>. </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/41586_2024_8046_Fig1_HTML.webp?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=16.082206405694,0,67.835587188612,100" alt="The same cityscape but the left picture shows a clear blue sky and the right shows gray smog." title="The same cityscape but the left picture shows a clear blue sky and the right shows gray smog." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Lahore, Pakistan, on a day when the air quality index was 37 (left) and on a day when the air quality index was 496 (right). | Dawar Hameed Butt/Nature" data-portal-copyright="Dawar Hameed Butt/Nature" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">However, air pollution poses a threat long before it’s visible. “Your eye is not a good detector of air pollution in general,” said Christi Chester Schroeder, the air quality science manager at IQAir,&nbsp;a company that builds air quality monitoring instruments and collects pollution data. “The pollutant that you have to be really careful about in terms of not being able to see it but experiencing it is ozone. Ozone levels can be extremely high on sunny days.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">IQAir has a network of air quality sensors across South Asia, including regions like <a href="https://www.iqair.com/us/pakistan/punjab/lahore">Lahore</a> and <a href="https://www.iqair.com/us/india/delhi">Delhi</a>. The company tracks pollution in real time using its own sensors as well as monitors bought by schools, businesses, and ordinary people. Their professional-grade air monitors can cost more than $20,000 but they also sell consumer air quality trackers that <a href="https://www.iqair.com/us/products/air-quality-monitors/airvisual-outdoor-2-pm">cost $300</a>. Both sources help paint a picture of pollution.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many schools and businesses across South Asia have installed their own pollution monitors. The US maintains its own air quality instruments at its consulates and embassies in India and Pakistan as well.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Happy Air Quality Week! Did you know that U.S. Consulate Lahore has an air quality monitor? Follow us on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/Lahore_Air?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Lahore_Air</a> for hourly AQI readings! <a href="https://t.co/nRAKAPbOph">pic.twitter.com/nRAKAPbOph</a></p>&mdash; U.S. Consulate General Lahore (@USCGLahore) <a href="https://twitter.com/USCGLahore/status/1654027753950261248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 4, 2023</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Schroeder noted however that IQAir’s instruments are geared toward monitoring particles like PM2.5 and don’t easily allow a user to make inferences about concentrations of other pollutants like sulfur oxides and where they’re coming from. “When you&#8217;re looking at places that have a really big mixture of sources — like you have a mixture of transportation and fires and climate inversion conditions — then it gets to be much murkier and you can&#8217;t really sort of pull it apart that way,” Schroeder said.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Politics lies at the core of the air pollution problem</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Air quality monitors in India and Pakistan show that air pollution can vary over short distances — between neighborhoods or even street by street — and that it can change rapidly through the day. Nearby bus terminals, power plants, or cooking fires contribute a lot to local pollution, but without tracking systems in the vicinity, it can be hard to realize how bad the situation has become.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think the most surprising, interesting, and scary thing, honestly, is seeing the levels of pollution in areas that haven&#8217;t been monitored before,” Schroeder said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another complication is that people also experience pollution far away from where it’s produced. “This automatically creates a big governance challenge because the administrator who is responsible for providing you clean air in your jurisdiction is not actually the administrator who is governing over the polluting action,” said <a href="https://politics.princeton.edu/people/saad-gulzar">Saad Gulzar</a>, an assistant professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Take crop stubble burning, which accounts for up to 60 percent of the air pollution in the region this time of year. In late fall, farmers in northern India and Pakistan harvest rice and plant wheat. With little time between the reaping and sowing, the fastest and cheapest way for many farmers to clear their fields of leftover stems, leaves, and roots is to burn it. The resulting smoke then wafts from rural areas into urban centers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The challenge is that farmers and urbanites are different political constituencies, and it’s hard to demand concessions from the former to benefit the latter. It has led to bitter political fights in both countries and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/why-is-pakistan-blaming-india-for-rising-air-pollution-in-the-country-as-lahores-aqi-hit-1900/articleshow/114955538.cms">between them</a>. Farmers also point out that the reason they have so little time between crops is because of water conservation laws: To cope with groundwater depletion, officials in India imposed regulations to limit rice planting until after monsoon rains arrive in the early summer to top up reservoirs. Delaying planting means delaying harvest, hence the rush to clear their fields. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Both India and Pakistan have even gone as far as to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/sixteen-farmers-arrested-burning-crop-waste-pollution-rises-north-india-2024-10-22/">arrest farmers who burn crop stubble</a>, but there are millions of farmers spread out over a vast area, stretching enforcement thin. However, local efforts to control smoke from crop burning have proven effective when local officials are motivated to act.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gulzar co-authored a study published in October in the journal <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08046-z"><em>Nature</em></a>, looking at air pollution and its impacts across India and Pakistan. Examining satellite data and health records over the past decade, the paper found that who is in charge of a jurisdiction plays a key role in air pollution — and could also be the key to solving it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When a district is likely to experience pollution from a fire within its own boundaries, bureaucrats and local officials take more aggressive action to mitigate it, whether that’s paying farmers not to burn stubble, providing them with tools to clear fields without fires, or threatening them with fines and arrest. That led fires within a district to drop by 14.5 percent and future burning to decline by 13 percent. These air pollution reductions led to measurable drops in childhood mortality. On the other hand, if the wind is poised to push pollution from crop burning over an adjacent district, fires increase by 15 percent.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The results show that simply motivating officials to act at local, regional, and national levels is a key step in reducing air pollution and that progress can begin right away.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But further air quality improvements will require a transition toward cleaner energy. Besides crop burning, the other major source of air pollution across India and Pakistan is fossil fuel combustion, whether that’s coal in furnaces, gas in factories, or diesel in trucks. These fuels also contribute to climate change, which is already contributing to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01577-5">devastating heat waves</a> and flooding from <a href="https://climateanalytics.org/publications/climate-change-increased-extreme-monsoon-rainfall-flooding-highly-vulnerable-communities-in-pakistan">torrential monsoons</a> in the region. Both countries have made <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/pakistan-solar">major investments</a> in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/india-gets-386-bln-financial-commitment-expand-renewable-capacity-2024-09-16/">renewable energy</a>, but they are also poised to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/pakistan-plans-quadruple-domestic-coal-fired-power-move-away-gas-2023-02-13/">burn more coal</a> to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/data-insights/india-now-consumes-more-coal-than-europe-and-north-america-combined">feed their growing economies</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/385183/cop29-climate-change-emissions-rising-trump-baku">COP29 climate change conference</a> this week in Baku, Azerbaijan, India is <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/india-calls-for-unrestricted-green-tech-climate-finance-criticises-unilateral-measures-by-developed-nations-at-cop29/articleshow/115455093.cms">asking wealthier nations to contribute more money</a> to finance clean energy within its borders and to share technologies that will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance air quality.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Solving the air pollution crisis in India and Pakistan will take years, and it’s likely to get worse before it gets better. But there are lifesaving measures both countries can take now.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Generally speaking, for many of the officials who served him during his first term, advising Donald Trump on foreign policy and national security does not appear to have been a very pleasant experience.&nbsp;Numerous former Trump officials have described him variously as a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/06/james-mattis-denounces-trump-protests-militarization/612640/">threat to the Constitution</a>, either “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/22/politics/trump-fascist-john-kelly/index.html">a fascist</a>” or “<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4948511-john-bolton-donald-trump-fascism-2024/">not capable</a>” of having an ideology as coherent as fascism, and “<a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/mattis-told-woodward-he-agreed-trump">the most dangerous person ever.</a>”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These criticisms, as much as they were <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-john-kelly-nazis-hitler-87d672e1ec1a6645808050fc60f6b8bc">played up by Kamala Harris</a>, do not appear to have resonated with voters. Trump was arguably able to use them to his advantage, portraying himself as a “<a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/10/27/vance-trump-candidate-of-peace-kelly">candidate of peace</a>” who would push back against the hawkish foreign-policy establishment and extract the US from costly foreign entanglements like the war in Ukraine. While Trump’s repeated claims that there were “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/13/trump-falsely-claims-no-terrorist-attacks-no-wars-during-his-presidency/">no wars</a>” during his first term were misleading at best, the raging conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza that broke out during the Biden administration undoubtedly made it easier for Trump to make this case.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During his first term, Trump initially stacked his administration with former generals like H.R. McMaster and James Mattis — whom Trump <a href="https://digitaledition.baltimoresun.com/tribune/article_popover.aspx?guid=c277259a-01f1-406a-af89-20f4878a065e">loved to refer</a> to by his nickname “Mad Dog,” much to Mattis’s chagrin —&nbsp; as well as hawks like John Bolton. But he often clashed with them on issues ranging from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/10/19/mcmaster-says-trumps-taliban-deal-is-munich-like-appeasement/">keeping troops in Afghanistan or Syria</a> to his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/30/us/politics/bolton-trump-north-korea.html">unconventional courtship of North Korea’s Kim Jong Un</a>. The presence of seasoned veterans like Mattis also reassured some of Trump’s critics, who hoped they would rein in his most erratic instincts. By the end of his first term, though, the president clearly felt he was being undermined.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Just two weeks after the election, it’s already clear that this time will be different.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“None of the so-called ‘adults in the room’ from the first term survived,” said Peter Feaver, a former national security staffer in the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, who now teaches at Duke University. Though there was <a href="https://www.politico.com/interactives/2024/potential-cabinets/trump-second-term-cabinet/#Defense%20Secretary">some speculation</a> immediately after the election that Trump might include figures like former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo or former national security adviser Robert O’Brien on his new team — the rare establishment figures from the first term who did not publicly break with Trump — the president-elect has largely opted for new faces this time around.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those include some picks that are deeply unconventional, to say the least, like Fox News host Pete Hegseth for secretary of defense and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence, leavened by a few more GOP mainstream figures like Rep. Mike Waltz for national security adviser and Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s still early days, and the Trump II team is still taking shape. As several experts told Vox, the department deputies who will eventually be selected can often be as important as the principals when it comes to actually designing and implementing foreign policy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But a few things do stand out about the names already picked. What they have in common is that they seem far less likely to push back against Trump’s ideas than his initial first-term team.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“In his first term, he made a series of senior appointments on the ‘Team of Rivals’ theory of building a Cabinet out of people with different views, so that they can thrash out the alternatives within the decision-making process,” said Kori Schake, director of foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. “And I think what we&#8217;re seeing now is a pattern of choosing people who already agree with the president or who are willing to agree with him.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What that means is that we’re more likely to get a purely Trumpian foreign policy this time around. Given how mercurial Trump can be — and given how different the picks are in experience and outlook, beyond simply loyalty — that doesn’t mean we know what that will look like in practice. But we can map out the loose ideological groups that will compete for Trump’s ear on foreign policy and defense.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">The three tribes of Republican foreign policy</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a 2022 <a href="https://ecfr.eu/article/polarised-power-the-three-republican-tribes-that-could-define-americas-relationship-with-the-world/">article for the European Council on Foreign Relations</a>, the policy analysts Majda Ruge and Jeremy Shapiro sketched out a model — which has since become widely used and cited — of the three “tribes” of Republican foreign policy in the Trump era.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, there are the “primacists,” who hold more traditionally hawkish views on the importance of US global leadership and the use of military force. They believe in increased military spending, continuing US military support for Ukraine, and preparation for a potential conflict with China. First-term Trump figures like Pompeo, Bolton, and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley would fall into this category. Some primacists are people who were once described as “neoconservatives in the post-9/11 years,” though that’s become something of a pejorative on both sides of the aisle, and very few people now describe themselves that way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then there are the “restrainers,” such as Sens. Rand Paul or Mike Lee, who want to limit US military commitments abroad and are more skeptical about alliances like NATO. In a classic example of the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-12-26/horseshoe-theory-of-politics-conservatives-liberals-ideology">“horseshoe” theory of politics</a>, their views sometimes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/opinion/harris-foreign-policy-america.html">overlap with left-wing critics</a> of intervention and the military-industrial complex.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The third group are the “prioritizers,” who have some characteristics of the two others. They want to reduce US commitments in Europe (including support for Ukraine) and the Middle East like the restrainers, but they want to use that shift&nbsp;to focus on what they see as the real threat: great power competition with China, a concern they share with the primacists.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Examples of this camp could include Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley and <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/jd-vance-tim-dillon-taiwan-priority-over-ukraine-1975851">Vice President-elect JD Vance</a>. Arguably, such a prioritization has been a goal of the last few US presidents: Barack Obama, at a time when the war on terror was still hot, promised a foreign policy “<a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/10/11/americas-pacific-century/">pivot” to Asia</a>, while President Joe Biden described China as America’s “<a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3294255/dod-is-focused-on-china-defense-official-says/">pacing challenge</a>.” The prioritizers would say making the pivot an actual reality, as opposed to just tough rhetoric, requires difficult choices about how America spends its finite military and political resources — prioritization they believe these administrations largely failed to make.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The conflict between the camps has been playing out as Trump’s team has come together, with the president’s choices reportedly influenced to some extent by his increasingly central son Donald Trump Jr., pundit Tucker Carlson, and billionaire backer David Sacks, all of whom have pushed to keep out the primacists from the first administration. “There were at least 25 people who called the president and said: ‘It’s got to be Mike Pompeo,’” one Republican official <a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/trump-foreign-policy-pompeo-haley-carlson">told the Free Press</a><em>.</em> “And none of it mattered.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Carlson <a href="https://x.com/TuckerCarlson/status/1855675378637090883">publicly touted Elbridge Colby</a>, an influential Pentagon official and China specialist during the first Trump administration and perhaps the purest prioritizer in Washington, for a position on the new team, but other officials criticized his more dovish views on Iran. As one critic put it anonymously to the <a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2024/11/elbridge-colby-trump-administration-iran/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=elbridge&amp;utm_content=elbridge+CID_53177358e7ce620ba3b9c09d09644fd3&amp;utm_source=Campaign%20Monitor%20JI&amp;utm_term=Read%20Full%20Article">Jewish Insider</a>:<em> </em>“I don’t know how you put a man who says he’s okay with Iran having a nuclear weapon in charge of any serious defense or national security job.” (Colby has said it would be possible to contain and manage a nuclear-armed Iran.) Colby has so far not been appointed to a position, though that could very well change in the coming days.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The purest restrainer of the group is undoubtedly Gabbard, an ex-Democrat turned Trump loyalist who has denounced her former party as an “<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/tulsi-gabbard-announces-leaving-democratic-party/story?id=91326164">elitist cabal of warmongers</a>.” Gabbard has blamed the war in Ukraine on the US ignoring Russia’s “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/11/14/tulsi-gabbard-russia-director-national-intelligence-trump/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">legitimate security concerns</a>” and even <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/25/politics/tulsi-gabbard-lead-syria/index.html">traveled to Syria</a> and met with dictator Bashar al-Assad at the height of that country’s civil war.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gabbard’s pro-Russia (even by Trumpwold standards) views have led to questions from some intelligence community insiders about whether her <a href="https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/11/extraordinarily-dangerous-intelligence-community-insiders-warn-against-trumps-dni-pick/401092/?oref=d_brief_nl&amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=The%20D%20Brief:%20November%2018%2C%202024&amp;utm_term=newsletter_d1_dbrief">appointment could pose a security risk</a>. Gabbard’s views could also potentially clash with her new boss’s: In 2020, she denounced the surprise drone strike ordered by Trump that killed senior Iranian General Qasem Soleimani as an “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/08/politics/tulsi-gabbard-no-justification-for-killing-soleimani-cnntv/index.html">unconstitutional act of war</a>” with no justification.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As for Hegseth, the secretary of defense nominee, he has <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pete-hegseth-background-pentagon-critic-recovering-neocon">described himself</a> as a “recovering neocon” who began his career in politics leading a pro-Iraq War veterans group but has since changed his views. &#8220;The hubris of the Pentagon is they want to now tell other countries how to do counterinsurgency based on what we did in Iraq and Afghanistan,” Hegseth said recently on the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pete-hegseth-background-pentagon-critic-recovering-neocon"><em>Shawn Ryan Show</em> podcast</a>. “The trust that our political leaders and our generals would have our best interests in mind is totally broken.” In the same interview, Hegseth <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-pentagon-pick-pete-hegseth-criticized-us-involvement-ukraine-aid-2024-11">questioned US support</a> for Ukraine and the value of the NATO alliance.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dan Caldwell, public policy adviser at Defense Priorities, a pro-restraint advocacy group, told Vox that Hegseth is not alone in having gone through an ideological transition like this. “Like a lot of veterans, including myself, his foreign policy views have evolved as the wars have dragged on,” he said. It’s worth noting that while Trump stacked his first Cabinet with what he called “my generals,” this time around he’s opting more for younger figures like Gabbard, Hegseth, and Waltz who served as mid-level officers during the war on terror.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite his criticism of the Pentagon, Hegseth is not quite a restrainer. He has <a href="https://www.lonestarlive.com/news/2024/11/defense-secretary-nominee-us-military-strikes-on-mexican-cartels-might-be-needed.html">said</a> the US might need to take military action against Mexican cartels — perhaps Trump’s most radical foreign policy proposal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, the Hegseth pick may have been less about his foreign policy views — and certainly wasn’t about his ability to oversee the nearly 3 million employees at the Defense Department, given his near total lack of management experience — than his very public opposition to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/14/nx-s1-5191941/pete-hegseth-defense-department-dei">“wokeness” and DEI initiatives</a> in the military. That would set him up for a potential clash with Joint Chiefs chair Gen. C.Q. Brown, who Hegseth <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-will-nominate-fox-news-host-pete-hegseth-defense-secretary-2024-11-13/">has suggested </a>may have gotten the job because he is Black. The Trump transition team <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/trump-draft-executive-order-would-create-board-to-purge-generals-7ebaa606?st=R2drEW">has reportedly been preparing</a> a plan to review senior military commanders for potential removal. Though it’s not unprecedented for a president to fire senior generals, even if it’s become rarer in recent decades, doing so for political reasons would be a cause for concern given Trump’s very public clashes with former Joint Chiefs chair Gen. Mark Milley.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">(Since Hegseth’s nomination, accusations have also surfaced that he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/us/politics/hegseth-sexual-assault-accuser.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">committed sexual assault</a> and that he was flagged as an “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-defense-department-pentagon-hegseth-fox-news-8cd9f065e54a7cbbaceeec8bae9261a6">insider threat</a>” by a fellow service member because of a tattoo associated with white nationalism, but so far, Trump is sticking with his pick. Hegseth has denied these allegations.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Waltz and Rubio could both fairly be described as primacists for most of their careers, but Caldwell says that may no longer be the case. “I think it&#8217;s lazy to call any of these picks pure primacists or neocons,” he said. “These are people whose views have evolved over the past few years and are continuing to evolve.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Both have recently seemed at least prioritizer-curious. Waltz, for instance, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-selects-mike-waltz-national-security-adviser-wsj-reports-2024-11-11/">initially criticized</a> the Biden administration for not providing enough aid to Ukraine following Russia’s invasion, but has since said that this support should be reassessed. &#8220;Is it in America&#8217;s interest, are we going to put in the time, the treasure, the resources that we need in the Pacific right now badly?&#8221; <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-selects-mike-waltz-national-security-adviser-wsj-reports-2024-11-11/">he said at an event last month</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rubio was once a textbook primacist, arguing for using American power and military might to spread democracy, but in a recent essay he criticized <a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/my-plan-for-american-renewal/">what he called the</a> “outdated foreign policy blob” for failing to “reprioritize and focus on America’s most pressing threat: the Chinese Communist Party.” He was among the senators who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/04/25/senators-house-members-opposed-ukraine-aid/">voted against aid to Ukraine earlier this year</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to sit here and pretend that Senator Rubio agrees with me on everything, but I don&#8217;t think it is fair to call him a neoconservative anymore,” Caldwell said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Shapiro, author of the original “three tribes” article, takes a more cynical view. “If you look at Rubio, you see someone who has a foreign policy ideology but who has been willing to be flexible in order to fit in with wherever he needs to be, be that with Trump or be that with the Republican base,” he told Vox. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One area to watch for Rubio’s influence may be Latin America policy. During Trump’s first term, the senator was nicknamed the “<a href="https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2020/08/03/how-marco-rubio-runs-trumps-latin-america-policy-1972792">secretary of state for Latin America</a>” for the amount of influence he had over policy toward the region. This generally meant taking a much harder line on left-wing authoritarian regimes in countries like Cuba (where his parents were born) and Venezuela, and included supporting opposition groups in those countries. It’s not out of the question that the Trump administration could be facing a <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/379206/cuba-power-grid-collapse-castro-venezuela-oil-blackout-russia">crisis</a> involving one or both of those countries early in its tenure.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">But what does the big guy think?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s always <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/370194/harris-foreign-policy-gaza-ukraine-china">difficult to predict</a> what a president’s foreign policy will be like based on campaign statements or personnel appointments, given that so much of foreign policy consists of responding to crises. Biden certainly didn’t anticipate that a major land war in Europe or a catastrophe in the Middle East would largely define his foreign policy legacy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The task is even harder with a president as altogether unpredictable as Trump, who clearly has some consistent impulses: He’s skeptical of defense alliances, security commitments, and long-term military deployments. He has next to no interest in promoting democracy or human rights globally or defending the so-called rules-based international order.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These views would align him generally with the restrainer camp, but his actual record doesn’t fall neatly into any of the tribes. Trump is hardly a dove. In Syria, he <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/article/1144601/trump-orders-missile-attack-in-retaliation-for-syrian-chemical-strikes/">ordered</a> airstrikes against Assad’s regime in response to the use of chemical weapons — a step the Obama administration, despite its “red line,” famously did not take — and oversaw what was arguably the deadliest ever <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/cia-director-couple-hundred-russians-killed-in-february-u-s-assault-in-syria/29162797.html">direct clash between US and Russian forces</a>. US <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-46612542">military involvement in places</a> like Somalia, to fight jihadist groups, increased under Trump.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though it’s true that Trump negotiated the deal with the Taliban that led to the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, he has since said that if he had been president, the US would <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-slams-bidens-afghan-withdrawal-says-he-would-have-kept-bagram-air-base-to-monitor-chinas-nuke-testing">have held on to Bagram Air Base</a> in order to keep pressure on China.&nbsp;(Keeping Bagram was not part of the original agreement.) Trump is also <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2024/11/07/what-a-second-trump-presidency-could-mean-for-the-defense-budget/">likely to increase defense budgets</a> in his second term.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s rhetoric on China has been consistently hawkish but has generally focused more on economics and trade than security issues. He was willing to tamp down US criticism of Beijing on issues like the crackdown in Hong Kong, persecution of the Uighurs, and the early handling of Covid while in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/04/world/asia/trump-china-uighurs-trade-deal.html">pursuit of a trade deal</a> with Beijing. Though military and diplomatic support for Taiwan <a href="https://www.csis.org/blogs/new-perspectives-asia/how-biden-building-trumps-legacy-taiwan">increased under Trump’s tenure</a>, he has also <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-would-the-trump-or-harris-administration-approach-taiwan/">questioned</a> whether the island is worth defending.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When it comes to the Middle East, all the names selected so far — with the exception of Gabbard — are staunch defenders of Israel and would qualify as Iran hawks. The selection of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/stories/0211/49750_Page3.html">Christian Zionist former Gov. Mike Huckabee</a> as ambassador to Israel and the staunchly <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/trump-transition-witkoff-middle-east-39364c30">pro-Israel real estate mogul Steve Witkoff as Middle East envoy</a> do not suggest he plans to scale back US support for Israel, even if Trump is <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq6lm62vm7zo">not as fond</a> of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as he once was.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Iran is a more complicated question. Trump ordered the strike that killed Soleimani, but then did not respond when Iran then <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/u-s-base-iraq-comes-under-attack-missiles-iran-claims-n1112171">retaliated with an attack on US troops</a>. Though Trump cultivated close ties with Saudi Arabia, he angered his allies in Riyadh by not <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/trump-says-he-does-not-want-war-after-attack-on-saudi-oil-facilities-idUSKBN1W10X6/">responding to Iranian attacks </a>on Saudi oil infrastructure in 2019. And while Tehran has not <a href="https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/506212/Iran-doesn-t-rule-out-potential-talks-with-Trump-says-national">ruled out new negotiations</a> with the incoming administration, it does seem unlikely that Trump would pursue a Kim Jong Un-style beautiful romance with the government that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/08/politics/doj-charges-three-iranian-plot-to-kill-donald-trump/index.html">allegedly tried to kill him</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not clear what Trump would do if Israel and Iran ended up in an all-out shooting war. Vance, for one, has said that despite US support for Israel, the two countries have diverging interests at times and that <a href="https://www.jpost.com/us-elections/article-826635">war with Iran would not be in American interests</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Ukraine, Trump will likely pursue his promised deal to end the war, presumably by pressuring Ukraine to accept territorial concessions. The question is what happens if Russian President Vladimir Putin, having realized <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/10/29/ukraine-is-now-struggling-to-cling-on-not-to-win">recent success on the battlefield</a>, doesn’t want to accept. Waltz, despite his recent prioritizer turn, has argued that if Putin fails to accept a peace deal, the US should “<a href="https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2024/11/02/china-is-the-big-winner-from-bidens-foreign-policy-say-michael-waltz-and-matthew-kroenig">provide more weapons to Ukraine</a> with fewer restrictions on their use.” Trump has <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-describes-how-he-could-solve-russia-ukraine-conflict-24-hours?msockid=0f99308216bb6307331e241f177062d1&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">made similar threats</a>. A Trump administration that ends up escalating US involvement in Ukraine would be an ironic outcome of the last election, but it doesn’t seem totally out of the question.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">If you don’t like this Cabinet, just wait</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However you might classify Trump’s coming foreign policy advisers, there’s no guarantee they’ll be in their positions for long. Trump went through two Senate-confirmed secretaries of state and four acting ones as well as four national security advisers. (Biden, for better or worse, has stuck with his core national security team through thick and thin.) Any talk of whether certain candidates for high jobs or foreign policy factions are being snubbed should be taken with a grain of salt, or at least patience. “It’s very possible that some of these figures may reappear, and that may be why they haven’t publicly announced or indicated their displeasure with the choices,” said Duke’s Feaver. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Two things seem certain: The clash between the GOP foreign policy tribes will continue to play out over the next few years, and the Trump administration we have on day one may not be the one we have six months later.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Every episode of <em>Say Nothing</em>, the FX/Hulu show based on the nonfiction book of the same name, ends with a disclaimer: “Gerry Adams has always denied being a member of the IRA or participating in any IRA-related violence.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Disclaimers aren’t unusual in film and television (arguably <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24147537/baby-reindeer-who-is-martha-stalking">even more shows</a> should employ them) but the Adams disclaimer still stands out.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Say Nothing</em> takes place across and beyond the 30-year period in late 20th-century Ireland known as “The Troubles.” Viewers experience this time and its fallout largely through the eyes of Catholic combatants in the Irish Republican Army (IRA), Dolours Price (played on the show by Lola Petticrew, and later Maxine Peake), and to a lesser extent Brendan “The Dark” Hughes (played by Anthony Boyle as a youth, Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as the elder Hughes), along with those affected by their actions. It was an era marked by bloodshed and fear, with political and psychological ramifications that can still be felt by many in the country today.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The problem? If this disclaimer is accurate, it would negate or at least undermine nearly everything the <em>Say Nothing </em>viewer has just witnessed. So what’s going on here? And what’s the real effect of this repeated legal language? Let’s break it down, piece by piece.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is Gerry Adams?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Officially, today, Gerry Adams is a retired Irish politician. He’s played in <em>Say Nothing</em> by Josh Finan as a young radical, and Michael Colgan as an older statesman.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 1998, Adams was integral to and present for the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-65294128">peace deal</a> brokered by US President Bill Clinton that brought an end to the everyday violence in Northern Ireland. Adams did this in his capacity as the president of the Sinn Féin party, a position he held from 1983 to 2018.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Throughout The Troubles, Sinn Féin was widely <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sinn-Fein">understood</a> to be the political wing of the IRA.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>And what is the IRA?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The IRA stands for the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Irish-Republican-Army">Irish Republican Army</a>, a paramilitary association that was first founded under that name in 1919, although it grew out of a long history of Irish resistance to British rule. The purpose of the IRA was to reunite Ireland by reclaiming the whole of the island, specifically the area that became known after the partition of Ireland in 1921 as Northern Ireland.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Irish Republican Army was known in particular for its use of guerrilla warfare tactics, from <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3gBpB1kl43kMQkGg4bxhMZ7/the-mystery-behind-northern-ireland-s-26-5m-bank-heist">bank robberies</a> to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Omagh-bombing">car bombs</a>, as well as the practice of <a href="https://www.iclvr.ie/en/iclvr/pages/thedisappeared">disappearing</a> accused informers, known as “touts,” and turncoats. The US labeled the IRA a terrorist group in the <a href="https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/terrorism-under-democratic-conditions-case-ira-irish-republican">1980s</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What were the British doing in Ireland?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The British had been politically and militarily involved with their Irish neighbors to the west since the Anglo-Norman Invasion in 1169. That conquest kicked off 800 years of dispossession, bloodshed, and strife across the region and usually along religious lines — with the majority Catholics on one side, and the Protestant minority aligned with British forces.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This timeline is briefly mentioned at the very top of the TV series <em>Say Nothing</em>. What’s less explored on screen, but takes up a good chunk of the meticulously reported nonfiction book of the same name — written by journalist Patrick Radden Keefe, who also the show’s executive producer — is the history of the conflict. Let’s go back, if not quite to the beginning.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 1914, after centuries of rebellion and retaliation, “<a href="https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/legislativescrutiny/parliamentandireland/collections/home-rule-1914/gov-of-ireland-act-1914/">Home Rule</a>” — under which the Irish would be in charge of themselves — was set to become law. Shortly before it was to be enacted, however, the British made the change contingent on military conscription, right at the start of the first World War.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 1916, Irish Republicans fought back, in a rebellion known as the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/history/1916/">Easter Rising</a>. This operation was a resounding failure that would nonetheless endear the nascent IRA to the Irish public, after the resulting British occupation of Dublin saw the jailing of 1,400 Republicans and the execution of 16 of their leaders. Following the brutal War of Independence and the Anglo-Irish Treaty, the Partition of Ireland was established in 1921, dividing the country into two self-governing entities, and a year later the Irish Free State was established in the south.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By the late 1960s, things weren’t great for the Catholics of Northern Ireland. There was clear evidence of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/zs2ncxs">discrimination</a> against Catholics in the north in hiring, housing, voting, and policing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At this time, the IRA was by most accounts not engaged in armed struggle, but a bombing on the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising helped inspire the formation of the “<a href="https://bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-11313364">Ulster Volunteer Force</a>” — another paramilitary group, but this time with British loyalties and, as per <em>Say Nothing</em>, occasionally government support, whose operations were largely marked by gun violence against Catholic civilians. This was the approximate start of what is known as The Troubles.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Say Nothing</em>, both book and show, depicts the resumed violence among the IRA, British forces, and loyalist paramilitary groups, which lasted from around 1968 to the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, as well as the fallout for Irish families that, in many ways, persist today.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Okay, Gerry Adams is a politician with a group affiliated with the IRA. But does that mean he’s responsible for the violence?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That might be a complicated question, were it not for the fact that <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/gerry-adams-ira-denial-a-lie-veteran-republican-says-in-tv-series-1.4020604">pretty</a> <a href="https://www.britannica.com/summary/Gerry-Adams">much</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Secret-History-Ira-Gerry-Thirty/dp/0141028769">everyone</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-68028109">agrees</a> that Adams not only participated in the Irish Republican Army and violent attacks the group carried out, but personally orchestrated much of it. This is exactly what we see on screen throughout <em>Say Nothing</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Keefe’s book carefully details<em> </em>Adams’s history in the movement, including the conception and execution of robberies and bombings, such as the Old Bailey bombing in London that saw Dolours Price and her sister Marian arrested and jailed for eight years. Among other sources and interviews, that book used the first-person accounts collected for the Belfast Project, an oral history of The Troubles compiled by researchers at Boston College from 2000 to 2006.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In other words, many, many IRA members are on the record saying that Gerry Adams was among them. Dolours Price has said he was her “<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1326593/Gerry-Adams-was-my-commander-says-IRA-bomber.html">commander</a>.” Brendan Hughes has <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/where-the-bodies-are-buried">said</a> he never did anything without Adams’s say-so. (Additionally, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/114076.A_Secret_History_of_the_IRA">historians</a> and contemporaneous media accounts link Adams to IRA violence.)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>If all that’s true, how did Gerry Adams get elected to political office?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Adams’s status as an IRA leader didn’t hurt his political life; if anything, it helped! Adams’s political persona has always been, knowingly, built on his <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-27238602">Republican bona fides</a>. In the book, Keefe details the way Adams would deny membership in the IRA out of one side of his mouth and raise the specter of violence out of the other, but you don’t need to decode his speeches to see the connections.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 1972, Adams was released from prison — where he was being held without charge, although he claims only as a political activist — to participate in ceasefire talks at the request of the IRA. He was 24. Nine years later, he played a “key role,” as per the BBC, in encouraging IRA hunger strikes, which saw 27-year-old IRA leader <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-56937259">Bobby Sands</a> starve himself to death in prison, just one month after Sands was elected MP.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Adams was himself elected as a Belfast West MP two years later, but refused to sit in the House of Commons, a Sinn Féin policy. That same year, 1983, he became the head of the party. A decade later, secret peace talks well underway, he carried the coffin of Thomas Begley, an IRA bomber who died in the Shankill bombing, after a premature explosion.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/Ep-7_23-10-23_0028R.jpg.webp?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4613147178592,100,93.077370564282" alt="A young man in glasses and a blazer" title="A young man in glasses and a blazer" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Josh Finan as young Gerry Adams. | FX" data-portal-copyright="FX" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">During the approximately five-year talks, Adams was meeting with more moderate Irish political parties, representing the promise of bringing the IRA to the table. His status as IRA leadership was key to his stewardship of Sinn Féin — not just at the outset, but throughout his entire career.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>So if this is all such an open secret, why is the disclaimer included?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In an interview with <a href="https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a62764745/say-nothing-hulu-gerry-adams-ira-disclaimer-explained/">Town &amp; Country</a>, author and executive producer Keefe explained, “It was ultimately FX legal that determined that we needed that disclaimer.&#8221; The reason why is simple: Adams himself. As Keefe told T&amp;C, &#8220;It&#8217;s not that he will take issue with little bits and pieces of what we show. He takes issue with the whole premise of the series, which is that he was in the IRA.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the show’s disclaimer seems to be more corporate necessity than rhetorical flourish, it ends up being a bit of a gift to the <em>Say Nothing</em> producers. It would be hard to find a more succinct way to communicate the doublethink necessary for life during The Troubles. It puts a darkly comic, increasingly absurd stinger on each episode of a show that sees only occasional lightness and crackles of Irish wit, while also giving a sense of the unspeakability of what you’re watching unfold.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s what Irish poet Seamus Heaney calls “the tight gag of place and times” in “<a href="https://www.blueridgejournal.com/poems/sh-what.htm">Whatever you say, say nothing</a>,” the poem from which the book and show take their name. This is the omertà that comes with the existence of the IRA. It’s a policy that, in this setting, makes intuitive if not entirely practical sense. Of course an insurgent political group can’t go shouting in the streets, and your friends and neighbors had better stay quiet, too. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the book and show, we see Gerry Adams employing his own baroque version of it early on: denying to arresting officers not just his role in the IRA but himself. He’s not Gerry Adams, he claims, but a man named John.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Price, on the other hand, doesn’t deny her name nor that she supports the goals of the IRA. She declares herself not guilty for the London bombing simply because she doesn’t recognize English authority.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Later in the show, as in real life, Price and Hughes definitively break this code of silence, speaking to the Belfast Project — and in Price&#8217;s case, some notable others — about the things they did and the little good they felt it accomplished. The Boston College tapes weren&#8217;t intended to be distributed until after the participants’ deaths, but some were later subpoenaed in the renewed investigation into the death of Jean McConville, the IRA disappearance that frames <em>Say Nothing</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Adams never cracks, though, in the show or reality. But Adams <em>isn’t</em> saying nothing. His persistent denial works as an admission that the methods of the Irish Republican Army violate some part of the collective moral consciousness (not to mention the law), while hinting that obscuring the facts doesn’t violate Adams’s own. It’s worth noting that Adams had real-life political colleagues, including eventual deputy first minister <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/02/martin-mcguinness-biography-divides-irish-opinion-as-he-did-in-life">Martin McGuinness</a>, who did not disavow their time in the IRA.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For some of Adams’s former compatriots, Price and Hughes among them, his public ascent was not about peacemaking, but little more than the fulfillment of his political aspirations. For those IRA members, even the signing of the Good Friday agreement was not something to be heralded; it leaves Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom — for as long as its majority Protestant citizenry chooses.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The episode disclaimers, along with this tension, effectively make Gerry Adams the show’s villain — willing to ask others for the ultimate sacrifice; not even loyal to the cause. You watch Adams, along with Price and Hughes, plan and execute acts that wound their enemies, their neighbors, their cities, and eventually themselves; you’re shown his rise, their fall; and over and over, you see his denial. But the only people who truly say nothing are the dead.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Welcome to Know-It-All. In the age of intellectual property grabs, docudramas, and so very many sequels, it can be difficult to find a way into the complicated worlds we see on screen. In this series, Vox experts explain what you need to know to get into the latest hot release.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Human existence is full of an unfathomably infinite number of things — real and fake, abstract ideas and actual physical objects, past and present and future — to consider, fixate on, learn about. Still, for many men, there’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2023/09/14/roman-empire-trend-men-tiktok/">one thing</a> they specifically think about constantly: <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2018/6/19/17469176/roman-empire-maps-history-explained">the Roman Empire</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Director Ridley Scott, a man, very clearly thinks about it a lot. But maybe not in exactly the same way others do.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Friday, Scott’s new movie <em>Gladiator II</em> will officially hit theaters. The sequel stars Paul Mescal, a man with the most adored side profile in Hollywood, and is set within the same world — with many of the same characters — as <em>Gladiator</em>, <a href="https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2001/memorable-moments">Scott’s Oscar-winning film from 2000</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many things happen in the movie. Mescal’s character, Lucius, bites a CGI baboon and chokes it with handcuffs; Denzel Washington’s Macrinus flounces around in caftans, terrorizing Roman senators about loyalty. There’s also a lot that doesn’t seem quite based in history: a naval battle in the Colosseum where sharks eat human competitors,&nbsp;at least one domesticated battle rhino, and what seems to be a newspaper despite Ancient Rome predating the printing press.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While your mileage may vary on the movie, there’s something entertaining about how Scott imagines Ancient Rome to be more exciting than it was. Maybe one day our descendants will imagine our mundane lives with as much anachronistic gusto as Scott.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To get a better understanding of what Scott was aiming for in this movie and what he was inspired by, I chatted with <a href="https://www.vox.com/authors/christian-paz">Vox senior politics writer Christian Paz</a>, another man who thinks about Ancient Rome often. Since middle school, Paz tells me, he was obsessed with the Roman Empire and that fixation has only grown stronger in adulthood. Paz is also slightly fascinated by Paul Mescal and, now, Ridley Scott’s off-kilter version of Ancient Rome. We talked about Roman naval battles, the egos of emperors, and what is, really, so endlessly fascinating about this period in history.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>How often do you think about the Roman Empire?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think about it quite a lot. Its influence and legacy are everywhere. I see reminders of it when I walk around DC, when I scroll TikTok and get videos about the Galactic Senate, the Galactic Republic, and the Empire, and when I watch videos about what ancient and historical peoples <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/vqJai-flawE?si=_nRuAufBj30uLwK0">used to cook and eat</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Also I took Latin in high school.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>How often do you think Ridley Scott thinks about the Roman Empire?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Insofar as he thinks about big battles, big historical events, and believes in the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/non-fiction/napoleon-ridley-scott-great-man-myth-history/">Great Man theory of history</a>, probably often enough to want to recreate the magic of the original <em>Gladiator</em>. And he probably wants an Oscar, no?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>If his movies reflect his personal desires and needs, I believe that man wants a lot of things. And sometimes I think this world simply does not have enough to offer Ridley Scott, so he sensationalizes. It feels like he is constantly tarting up the world he lives in or learned about.</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>For example, in </strong><strong><em>Gladiator II</em></strong><strong>, Paul Mescal bites a baboon in one of the arenas. Were there actual baboons in Roman gladiator fights?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lol, most definitely not. I was trying to track down where he got this idea for baboons, and apparently it came to him from a trip he took to South Africa where he saw some <a href="https://www.avclub.com/ridley-scott-gladiator-ii-baboons">tourist approach a baboon in a parking lot</a>. The baboon, naturally, freaked out when the man tried to pet it, and attacked — and that seems to be Scott’s inspiration for wanting this group of captives and future gladiators to fight something “formidable.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But how would [the Romans] capture and release these, like, 12 baboons?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Well, obviously one would need to train and house the baboons too!&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Also, if these are based on the baboons Scott saw in South Africa — the Roman legions never got that far!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>There’s also a moment where they fill the Colosseum with water and stage a naval battle with sharks.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Right, and to prep for that battle, Paul’s character is forced to practice rowing a boat until his hands bleed and blister. God,<strong> </strong>this Colosseum scene was actually ridiculous because, where are they finding these sharks? How would they catch them and transport them back to Rome?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Modern-day aquariums have a tough time </strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/7/26/16033996/white-shark-aquarium"><strong>keeping sharks alive</strong></a><strong>. But Ridley Scott believes Ancient Rome could.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sharks can’t really survive in freshwater, so where are they holding these massive amounts of salt water and tanks and sharks? Flooding the Colosseum with water was actually <a href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/encyclopaedia_romana/gladiators/naumachiae.html">a thing</a> that was done <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/ancient-rome-once-filled-the-colosseum-up-with-water-and-staged-epic-mock-sea-battle">a few times</a> earlier in the Roman imperial period — but that was fresh water transported through aqueducts and diverted from the Tiber River. On every level, that’s actually an insane decision to make.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GL2-FF-087K.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=9.6777777777778,0,80.644444444444,100" alt="The Roman Colosseum full of spectators watching a mock naval battle taking place in the flooded center." title="The Roman Colosseum full of spectators watching a mock naval battle taking place in the flooded center." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="The simulated naval battle in &lt;em&gt;Gladiator II&lt;/em&gt;. You can’t see them but there are sharks in the water. | Paramount Pictures" data-portal-copyright="Paramount Pictures" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">But mock naval battles were once actually fought in the Colosseum, or in bigger locations around Rome, as early as <a href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/encyclopaedia_romana/gladiators/naumachia.html">Julius Caesar’s reign</a> toward the end of the Republic. They were a hugely extravagant and expensive thing to do, so they didn’t happen too frequently. Even gladiatorial games were an irregular occurrence —&nbsp;happening like three to four times a year at most&nbsp;— because they were just so expensive to hold. And that’s the bottom line of why they went out of commission. It was just too expensive to run an empire, and to keep these circuses going contributed to the empire’s resource drain<strong> </strong>—&nbsp;and the gradual spread of Christianity finished the games off<strong>.</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>How do they get the sharks in and out?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Movie magic.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>There’s also one gladiator who rides a trained rhino. I’m guessing that’s a bit of embellishment too.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yup, another wild decision — made for great cinema action, but it’s not likely that Romans would train and ride a rhino into battle. There are records of rhinoceroses being brought into the Colosseum — like during the celebrations for when it was <a href="https://www.tertullian.org/fathers/martial_on_the_games_of_domitian_01_text.htm">inaugurated</a> and when the emperor Commodus, the inspiration for Joaquin Phoenix’s villain from the first <em>Gladiator</em>, <a href="https://ancienthistorybulletin.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AHBReviewsHopeOnToner.pdf">killed a rhinoceros</a> with spears and arrows from an elevated platform <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Day_Commodus_Killed_a_Rhino/gIKCoAEACAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;printsec=frontcover">in 192 AD</a>. When used, rhinos would fight other animals instead of gladiators.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Could you imagine all that effort to bring a rhino into the Colosseum, telling all your friends about it, getting the gladiators set, and then have it just run around killing a lion — a lion that may have been hanging around in the bowels of the Colosseum for ages because everyone was out trying to find a rhino? So then the rhino waits for another crew to find a hippo or something and the cycle repeats itself!&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">God, I’d hate to be a rhino and just be killed because of ego.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the whole point of having rhinos and other exotic animals in the Colosseum was to represent and demonstrate the power, wealth, and reach of the empire, and more specifically, of the emperor.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Another surprising thing: the Roman newspaper that one of the senators is reading.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This was one of the more ridiculous things in the film; it has been <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/gladiator-ii-fact-fiction-ai-1236047785/">ridiculed</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/19/gladiator-ii-ridley-scott-historical-inaccuracies-rhinos">extensively</a>. It was actually in two scenes, if I recall — in the pseudo-cafe in which a senator is having a beverage (which I will assume is wine, or a spiced wine, because the Romans didn’t really have tea or coffee yet) and then at the senator’s home when Macrinus shows up.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For those who need clarification: Paper, of the mass-produced variety, has not been invented yet, never mind the printing press.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Sadly, the Ancient Romans never knew the font that is Times New Roman.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Romans did have a version of, like, important announcements and news that were <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Acta">inscribed</a> into a stone tablet and which was primarily placed in public places — the Acta Diurna, or “Acts of the Day.” But it wasn’t very widely circulated to people&nbsp;— it might have been sent to some senators but was primarily shared with governors and administrative government officials.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Was the gladiator system — that wins could make you a celebrity and eventually a free man — real?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes and no.&nbsp; It was absolutely a system with schools and cells, and sponsors and teachers, and funding and people who fed you and tended to you; you were specially trained, and became a master essentially of a particular kind of weapon and armor and dress usually based on your ethnic or national origin —&nbsp;like Gauls, Thracians, Britons. Gladiators lost personhood and became a form of property — prisoners of war, enslaved people, people with significant debts who sought to repay those debts, and poor, lower-class people who volunteered. So the whole operation that Denzel Washington’s character is running was very real.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yes, you could essentially become a celebrity, and aristocratic women, of high society, would take them as lovers —&nbsp;but even if you got discharged or won your freedom after winning or surviving matches, there wasn’t much you could do in society —&nbsp;so they would return to teach other gladiators or fight again as free men.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>The real gladiator “system” feels more like an </strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area/24115013/pyramid-scheme-america-mlm-multilevel-marketing-wellness"><strong>MLM</strong></a><strong> than whatever’s happening in Scott’s movie. Why do you think Scott is so obsessed with it?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Honestly, I was thinking that too. When you’re in, you’re kind of stuck. You get nice perks on occasion but it was a nasty, brutish, short life. And I think that is probably part of his fascination — to trade up freedom for something greater, or to make the most of the hellish lot life has cast you.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I feel like you and Ridley Scott think about different things when thinking about the Roman Empire. What is it about the Roman Empire that fascinates you?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think we think very differently about the Roman Empire. Scott loves the battles and the concept of great men — and don’t get me wrong, me too! My favorite games are Rome Total War and Empire Total War. In middle school I recreated a Roman camp in Gaul in my school’s cafeteria for a class project and made a set of armor like what Julius Caesar’s legionaries probably wore.</p>

Washington is a gladiator owner, which seems like a very predatory MLM by today’s standards. | Paramount Pictures" data-portal-copyright="Paramount Pictures" />
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Did this make you popular? Like, did you have a lot of friends?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Um. First of all, that’s rude. And second of all, I didn’t go there to make friends. I came to win and put on a spectacle.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But also, I was fascinated by the politics of the Roman Republic, specifically — the concept of the senate, the idea of the “Senate and the People of Rome” being the source of power and legitimacy, of consuls and of aediles and of quaestors, of a civil service. And I was fascinated by its fall, the rise of a rag-tag system of tyrannical government in the form of the empire —&nbsp;which, for most people, didn’t really mean anything different in their lives but changed the world.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And so I think specifically of the tenuousness of democracy, the appeal of strongmen, and the fact that what binds so many nations today — representative democracy and imagined community —&nbsp;has its roots in Rome’s centuries of existence. I think what fascinates me the most is the “fall” of Rome —&nbsp;something that <em>Gladiator II </em>delves into with its talk about the “dream” of Rome, the threat of “tyranny,” and the idea of “civitas” or Roman citizenship. They were all such amorphous, delicate concepts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What do you think men who think about the Roman Empire a lot will think about </strong><strong><em>Gladiator II</em></strong><strong>?&nbsp; Will the historical inaccuracies and sensationalizing turn them off?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">True Roman history nerds will probably be annoyed and laugh at the inaccuracies and sensationalizing. But let’s be honest. We’re going to see this movie either because of the nostalgia, because we want to see battles and fights on the big screen, because of Denzel Washington’s stunning performance (which will be noted in my Letterboxd review because he’s basically the main character), or because we want to admire Paul Mescal’s … everything.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>In the next life, may you be reborn as a baboon in Paul Mescal’s Ancient Rome.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I am ready to be bitten, Paul.</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), an <a href="https://www.vox.com/donald-trump/384967/matt-gaetz-donald-trump-attorney-general">accused sex offender known for his firm loyalty to Trump</a>, will not lead the Department of Justice. (Gaetz has denied wrongdoing.) Several other lawyers President-elect Donald Trump has close personal ties to, however, remain up for<strong> </strong>top DOJ jobs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This means that, regardless of who eventually becomes attorney general, at least three of the highest jobs in the Justice Department, the office that brings federal prosecutions, will be held by people whose records suggest they will advance Trump’s personal interest. And unlike Gaetz, Trump’s nominees for these three jobs have serious legal credentials and institutional knowledge, and thus are likely to be effective in advancing those interests.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/us/politics/todd-blanche-deputy-attorney-general-trump.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">chose Todd Blanche</a>, the criminal defense lawyer in his <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24126338/trump-new-york-trial-stormy-daniels">New York hush money trial</a> (the one where he faced charges related to money paid to keep a sexual encounter quiet), to be deputy attorney general. That’s the No. 2 job in the Justice Department. The DAG, as this position is known within the department, wields tremendous power over federal criminal prosecutions. If successfully appointed, Blanche will <a href="https://www.justice.gov/doj/office-deputy-attorney-general#:~:text=The%20mission%20of%20the%20ODAG,organizational%20units%20of%20the%20Department.">supervise the 93 regional US attorneys</a> who bring the bulk of all federal prosecutions in the United States. So Blanche will have a great deal of authority over who is prosecuted.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, Trump wants <a href="https://x.com/kleavittnh/status/1857199006146822425">John Sauer</a>, the lawyer who represented him in the Supreme Court case holding that Trump is allowed to use the <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship">powers of the president to commit crimes</a>, to serve as solicitor general. The role <a href="https://www.justice.gov/osg/about-office">oversees the Justice Department’s legal strategy in the Supreme Court</a>, including arguing many of the most important cases. They also decide which cases the DOJ will appeal if the federal government loses a case in a trial court.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another one of Trump’s personal criminal defense lawyers, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/11/14/trump-todd-blanche-deputy-attorney-general">Emil Bove</a>, will serve as principal associate deputy attorney general, and will hold the DAG spot on an acting basis until Blanche or some other Trump nominee is <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/384356/trump-recess-appointments-explained-senate-confirmation-thune-scott-cornyn-cabinet">confirmed or otherwise formally appointed to the job</a>. Unlike the DAG and the solicitor general, Bove’s new role <a href="https://rollcall.com/2024/11/14/trump-picks-legal-defense-team-for-top-justice-department-roles/">does not require Senate confirmation</a>. So he will be able to move into this job on the first day of Trump’s second presidency.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This isn’t the first time a president has tried to put one of his personal lawyers in a position of high responsibility within government. President Lyndon Johnson, for example, <a href="https://thinkwy.org/columns/justice-abe-fortas-life-as-a-lawyers-lawyer-and-a-greek-tragedy/">named Abe Fortas</a>, his friend and personal lawyer, to the Supreme Court in 1965. If you know anything about Fortas’s very brief tenure on the Court, you may know that <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/cautionary-tale-abe-fortas">appointment didn’t end well</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Based strictly on their résumés, all three men are conventionally qualified for these jobs. Both <a href="https://04q.7c7.myftpupload.com/betsy-wright-2/">Blanche</a> and <a href="https://blanchelaw.com/emil-bove/">Bove</a> previously worked as federal prosecutors for nine years before entering private practice. Sauer is a former law clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia who <a href="https://fedsoc.org/contributors/d-john-sauer">previously served Missouri’s solicitor general</a>. It’s easy to see all three joining the Justice Department without much controversy if they were picked by, say, President Nikki Haley.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Trump talks often about using the DOJ to target his political adversaries and people he views as foes. An NPR report on October 22 found that Trump “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/21/nx-s1-5134924/trump-election-2024-kamala-harris-elizabeth-cheney-threat-civil-liberties">made more than 100 threats to prosecute or punish perceived enemies</a>.” That includes a threat to, in Trump’s words, “appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump also accused former Rep. Liz Cheney, a prominent Republican critic of the incoming president, of “TREASON” and threatened “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/21/nx-s1-5134924/trump-election-2024-kamala-harris-elizabeth-cheney-threat-civil-liberties">TELEVISED MILITARY TRIBUNALS</a>.” (Which, if they were to actually happen, would presumably take place in the Defense Department’s legal structure, but could involve some DOJ personnel.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s decision to name Gaetz, a staunch loyalist, to lead the Justice Department created <a href="https://www.vox.com/donald-trump/384967/matt-gaetz-donald-trump-attorney-general">considerable alarm</a>. Historically, the White House has <a href="https://www.vox.com/donald-trump/383152/donald-trump-criminal-indictments-supreme-court-reelected">obeyed strong norms</a> against interfering with Justice Department prosecutorial decisions, but these norms have no legal force. A Trump loyalist like Gaetz could have torn down this barrier altogether. (If someone like him is confirmed atop the Justice Department, that barrier could still go.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s decision to appoint his personal lawyers to top DOJ jobs is equally concerning. Federal lawyers are supposed to represent the interests of the United States, not of any particular politician, while they work for the government. But Trump has selected three people who aren’t simply accustomed to representing his personal interests, but who have also likely collected considerable legal fees from him.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Blanche, Sauer, and Bove’s conventional résumés also mean that, if they use their DOJ posts to pursue Trump’s personal campaign of vengeance, they are likely to be fairly effective in doing so. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Blanche and Sauer still need to be confirmed — assuming that Trump doesn’t <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/384356/trump-recess-appointments-explained-senate-confirmation-thune-scott-cornyn-cabinet">use recess appointments</a> or some other method to get around the Senate confirmation process. But if Trump gets his way, his attorney general will now be backed by people who know the Justice Department and the culture of elite federal lawyers quite well.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Update, November 21, 2 pm ET: </em></strong><em>This story, originally published November 15, has been updated to reflect the fact that former Rep. Matt Gaetz is no longer the nominee for attorney general.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Donald Trump’s nominee for attorney general, former<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/13/politics/matt-gaetz-attorney-general?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_google">Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL)</a>, has withdrawn from consideration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He was nominated just over a week ago. Since then, numerous details of a House investigation into alleged sexual misconduct — including a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/21/politics/matt-gaetz-second-sexual-encounter-minor/index.html">CNN report</a> on Thursday that investigators were told Gaetz twice had sex with a 17-year-old girl — have been made public. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gaetz has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, but <a href="https://x.com/mattgaetz/status/1859649045553402285">posted Thursday afternoon on X</a> that he was removing himself from consideration as attorney general because “my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gaetz was a startling pick, not just because of the sexual misconduct allegations that have long loomed over him. He is also<strong> </strong>a longtime Trump loyalist who could have tried to remake the Department of Justice. The department has traditionally adhered to strong norms against interference by the president; Trump and his allies have been explicit <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/381094/trump-second-term-2024-election-justice-department-civil-rights">in arguing that should change</a>. Trump has also repeatedly called for legal action against his political enemies, including <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/21/nx-s1-5134924/trump-election-2024-kamala-harris-elizabeth-cheney-threat-civil-liberties">promising</a> to “appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family,” in 2023.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Enforcing those sorts of threats would have fallen to Gaetz, had he been confirmed by the Senate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before being nominated to be attorney general, Gaetz received press primarily for two things. One is his <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/10/1/23898555/kevinn-mccarthy-speakership-matt-gaetz">longstanding feud with former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy</a> (R-CA), who was eventually ousted in no small part because of Gaetz. The other is the aforementioned<strong> </strong>string of sexual misconduct allegations. Again, Gaetz denied these allegations, and the Justice Department <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/doj-decides-not-charge-rep-matt-gaetz-sex-trafficking-investigation-rcna70839">dropped its investigation into them in 2023</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Gaetz had ended up running that same department, he’d be in a uniquely powerful role. The attorney general is be tasked with overseeing all federal prosecutions, providing legal advice to the president and the Cabinet, and has the final say on any legal stance that the United States takes in court. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of greater significance perhaps is the fact that the attorney general has enormous authority over who is prosecuted, who is allowed to get away with committing federal crimes, and who might be targeted for politically motivated prosecutions in an authoritarian administration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has repeatedly promised “<a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy">retribution</a>” against his Democratic rivals. And his fellow Republicans on the Supreme Court ruled last July that he can order the Justice Department to <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/366855/supreme-court-trump-immunity-betrayal-worst-decisions-anticanon">bring politically motivated prosecutions without consequence</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the first Trump administration, Trump reportedly wanted to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/11/20/18105462/trump-clinton-comey-order-justice">order the Justice Department to prosecute</a> his former political opponent Hillary Clinton and former FBI Director James Comey, but was dissuaded from doing so by White House Counsel Don McGahn. Gaetz’s strong support for Trump, by contrast, made it seem he’d have been much less likely to resist such an order. Whether Trump’s next nominee is cut from the same loyalist cloth remains to be seen.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Just who is Matt Gaetz?<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gaetz has a law degree, and he <a href="https://gaetz.house.gov/about">did previously practice law in northwest Florida</a>. He’s been a representative since 2017, and became known both for stunts on the House floor — like wearing a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/04/politics/gaetz-coronavirus-gas-mask/index.html">gas mask</a> to protest masking policies during the coronavirus pandemic — as well as his <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/10/23/20929023/house-republicans-impeachment-stunt-trump">staunch support for Trump</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2021, it was revealed that Gaetz was the subject of an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/us/politics/matt-gaetz-sex-trafficking-investigation.html">investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The allegations arose out of his relationship with Joel Greenberg, a former county-level tax collector who was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/politics/joel-greenberg-sentencing/index.html">sentenced to 11 years in prison</a> by a federal judge in 2022. Greenberg pled guilty to a wide range of crimes, including underage sex trafficking, wire fraud, identity theft, and conspiring to defraud the federal government. Judge Gregory Presnell, who sentenced Greenberg, said he’s “never seen a defendant who has committed so many different types of crimes in such a relatively short period.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to CNN, Greenberg also “cooperated extensively with the Justice Department’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/politics/joel-greenberg-sentencing/index.html">sex-trafficking probe into GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz</a>.” Among other things, Greenberg reportedly told investigators that he <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4751778-matt-gaetz-joel-greenberg-sex-trafficking-florida/">witnessed Gaetz having sex with a 17-year-old girl</a>. (Gaetz in 2021 issued a blanket denial of the allegations via a statement from his office, writing: &#8220;No part of the allegations against me are true.”)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a general rule, sex offenses such as soliciting prostitution are handled by state-level prosecutors, as the Constitution only gives the federal government <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3801442224983217117&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr">limited authority over sex crimes</a>. The Justice Department can get involved, however, in narrow circumstances.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The department’s investigation into Gaetz looked into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/us/politics/matt-gaetz-sex-trafficking-investigation.html">whether he had sex with this teenager and paid for her to travel with him</a>. It is a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2423#g">federal crime to transport someone</a> someone across state lines, with the intent that they engage in prostitution or “illicit sexual conduct.” The most serious violations of this statute carry a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In any event, the Justice Department <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/doj-decides-not-charge-rep-matt-gaetz-sex-trafficking-investigation-rcna70839">eventually decided not to charge Gaetz</a>. Its reasons for declining to do so have not been made public, but the lack of charges does not necessarily clear him of the allegations. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There was also a separate <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/witness-tells-house-ethics-committee-matt-gaetz-paid/story?id=111217102">House ethics investigation into Gaetz</a>. A report on that investigation’s findings was nearly complete when Gaetz resigned from the House upon being nominated for attorney general. That report hasn’t been made public, though reporters have begun to obtain information gathered by House investigators.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Besides CNN’s reporting on allegations of sexual encounters with a minor, other outlets, have reported that investigators were told Gaetz <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/20/gaetz-investigation-house-ethics-committee-vance/">compensated a number of women for sex</a>. The House is reportedly in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/19/politics/matt-gaetz-house-ethics-testimony-lawyer/index.html">possession of photos</a> taken during times two women who said they were paid for sex were in Gaetz’s company. Other witnesses called by the ethics committee said they were paid to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cew2z48rp70o">attend parties that Gaetz also attended</a>, where attendees used drugs and had sex. Again, Gaetz has denied any misconduct.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Reports also emerged that <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/20/congress/readout-from-vance-gaetz-meetings-00190682">some Republican senators</a> were growing concerned by these allegations, raising questions of whether Gaetz could get the votes needed for confirmation. Also complicating matters was Gaetz’s generally poor reputation on Capitol Hill. In 2023, for example, Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-OK) said that “<a href="https://x.com/mkraju/status/1709765049051381761">there’s a reason why no one in the [Republican] conference defended</a>” Gaetz after seeing some of the evidence against him.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As <a href="https://x.com/ezraklein/status/1856798502484910130">New York Times columnist Ezra Klein writes</a>, Trump’s decision to nominate Gaetz should be read as an effort to gauge whether Republican senators will permit him to take absurd and dangerous actions. “These aren&#8217;t just appointments,” Klein writes of Gaetz and Defense Secretary nominee Pete Hegseth, who also faces sexual misconduct allegations, “They&#8217;re loyalty tests.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Depending on who Trump choses in Gaetz’s stead, senators may have one less test to take.</p>

The dominance of animal products on Americans’ plates has had grave consequences for animals, nearly all of which are <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census">factory-farmed</a>, and has also accelerated <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/3/20/24105735/peak-meat-livestock-emissions-plant-based-climate-deadline">climate change</a> and the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/31/23852325/farming-myths-agricultural-exceptionalism-pollution-labor-animal-welfare-laws">polluting</a> of America’s waterways.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But these numbers are just population-wide averages — they don’t tell us much about the diverse range of dietary habits among 335 million Americans, nor about how many people swear off meat and other animal products altogether.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Understanding rates of vegetarianism and veganism, in particular, is tricky because people aren’t always reliable narrators of their own diets. Somewhere between <a href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/is-the-percentage-of-vegetarians-and-vegans-in-the-u-s-increasing/">2</a> to <a href="https://www.vrg.org/journal/vj2020issue4/2020_issue4_poll_results.php">6 percent</a> of Americans surveyed say they’re vegetarian, but many of these same people also report they’ve <a href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/is-the-percentage-of-vegetarians-and-vegans-in-the-u-s-increasing/">recently consumed meat</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Surveys on vegetarianism and meat consumption are “notoriously unreliable,” <a href="https://www.zachfreitasgroff.com/">Zach Freitas-Groff</a>, an economist at the University of Texas at Austin, told me.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In an attempt to understand what people are actually eating, Freitas-Groff and two fellow economists — <a href="https://www.trevorwoolley.com/">Trevor Woolley</a> at the University of California, Berkeley and Carl Meyer at Stanford University — reviewed people’s grocery receipts. The team analyzed tens of thousands of households’ grocery purchases from 2005 to 2020 to see how Americans’ meat consumption had changed over time. Their findings were <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4867295">published in June</a> as a working paper — not yet peer-reviewed, so the results should be viewed as tentative — by the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Their findings represent a growing chasm in American meat consumption: The number of households that avoid meat has increased slightly, while all other households have increased their meat purchases by an average of nearly 15 percent by weight relative to other foods. Overall grocery sales declined during this period, as Americans ate more of their meals outside the home, but as a share of groceries, meat purchases increased significantly.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From 2005 to 2020, the share of households that didn’t purchase any meat at the grocery store increased from 4.1 to 4.6 percent — a 12 percent jump. The share of households purchasing no animal products — meat, milk, or eggs — doubled, from a tiny 0.5 percent to a still-tiny 1 percent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The increase in meat avoiders is promising, but over 15 years, the increase appears very modest,” <a href="https://www.cgu.edu/people/joshua-tasoff/">Joshua Tasoff</a>, an economics professor at Claremont Graduate University who was not involved in the study, told Vox in an email.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"><img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-20-at-4.20.04%E2%80%AFPM.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,13.364279160145,100,73.271441679711" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="From 2005 to 2020, the average share of groceries that were meat (by weight) rose from 7.7 percent to 8.8 percent — a 14.3 percent increase. | Freitas-Groff et al (2024)" data-portal-copyright="Freitas-Groff et al (2024)" />

<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-20-at-4.21.50%E2%80%AFPM.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,5.3773811322767,100,89.245237735447" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="From 2005 to 2020, the share of households that didn’t purchase meat at the grocery store rose from 4.1 percent to 4.6 percent — a 12 percent increase. | Freitas-Groff et al (2024)" data-portal-copyright="Freitas-Groff et al (2024)" /></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The authors are hesitant to make sweeping generalizations about the state of American meat consumption based on these findings. The study only looked at food purchased at the grocery store, they note, which accounts for about <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=109781">two-thirds of caloric intake</a>, while the other third is eaten at restaurants and schools, which was not included in the study. The data also excludes meat sold at grocery store deli counters, including both raw meat and meat in prepared deli dishes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the paper provides a more granular view into consumers’ relationship with meat than we’ve had before, dovetailing with other recent research findings, like a 2023 study showing that just <a href="https://news.tulane.edu/pr/how-mere-12-americans-eat-half-nations-beef-creating-significant-health-and-environmental">12 percent</a> of Americans — mostly men and older people — eat 50 percent of the nation’s beef.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tasoff called the study an “impressive paper” that uses the best available data for consumer analysis.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The study’s time period, from 2005 to 2020, coincides with a growth in news coverage of farm animal welfare — a time in which numerous animal rights groups grew from tiny grassroots organizations into well-oiled machines; <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/8/31/9223391/undercover-videos-meat-america">undercover investigations into factory farms</a> gained national attention; around a <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23745935/proposition-12-pigs-pork-california-eggs-veal-hens">dozen states</a> passed farm animal welfare laws; cultural icons like <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-47085214#">Beyoncé</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/384508/billie-eilish-singer-songwriter-vegan-climate-animal-rights-activism-future-perfect-50">Billie Eilish</a> promoted the benefits of plant-based eating; and plant-based meat and milk, made by companies such as Beyond Meat, Impossible Foods, and Oatly, went <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/5/28/18626859/meatless-meat-explained-vegan-impossible-burger">mainstream</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But can increased media attention on factory farming — resulting from a growth in animal rights activism — and better vegetarian products explain the shift away from meat among a small but increasing share of American households? That might be part of it, the researchers concluded, but most of the shift, they found, can be attributed to other factors, including rising meat prices.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Digging into the data on America’s shifting meat consumption</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Around two-thirds of the increase in meat avoidance, the researchers estimate, is attributable to higher meat prices and to people buying less food at grocery stores and more at restaurants and elsewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The remaining third? Some of it could stem from older generations dying and younger people becoming heads of households. According to the paper, households in which the head was born after 1980 are 50 percent more likely to avoid meat and around twice as likely not to buy any animal products compared to other households.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2004, these households made up just 1 percent of the sample; by 2020, they accounted for 15 percent. If this trend holds, it could lead to a continued increase in households abstaining from meat in the decades to come, representing a bright spot in the paper’s otherwise discouraging findings. (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/738851/vegan-vegetarian-consumers-us/">Younger generations</a> also tend to <a href="https://today.yougov.com/consumer/articles/27440-veggie-meat-burger-poll">report higher rates</a> of vegetarianism, flexitarianism, pescetarianism, and veganism in surveys.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The difference among age groups is even more stark when looking at rates of all animal product avoidance. About 2.5 percent of households whose heads were born after 1990 didn’t purchase any animal products; for other age groups, the share hovers around 0.5 to 1 percent.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"><img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-20-at-4.15.29%E2%80%AFPM.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,14.094998106827,100,71.810003786346" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="Freitas-Groff et al (2024)" />

<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-20-at-4.15.44%E2%80%AFPM.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,12.631907332556,100,74.736185334889" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="“AP” is short for animal product. | Freitas-Groff et al (2024)" data-portal-copyright="Freitas-Groff et al (2024)" /></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though the study didn’t attempt to explain why younger people are avoiding animal products at such higher rates, it’s not unreasonable to think that animal advocacy — often directed at younger generations — could be changing social mores. That said, younger consumers have less money, so they could be more sensitive to rising meat prices, and they’re also <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/86401/eib-186.pdf">more likely to eat away from home</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The researchers also looked at whether the growth in media coverage of factory farming played a role in meat avoidance.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It “depends on the model we use,” Woolley wrote in an email. “Taken all together, it looks like media coverage probably played a role, but it&#8217;s hard to determine the magnitude of the effect given that it isn&#8217;t consistently statistically significant (unlike the effect of prices and total grocery purchase volume). It does seem to hold some explanatory power though.”&nbsp; </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1477-9552.2010.00266.x">2011 study</a> found that from 1991 to 2008, media coverage of cruelty on pig and poultry farms led to reduced demand for pork and poultry by <a href="https://agmanager.info/sites/default/files/AW%2520Media%2520Demand%2520Impacts%2520%28NIAA%2520_4.12.2011%29.pdf">2.6 percent and 5 percent</a>, respectively.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As for the role of plant-based meat alternatives, while they’ve generated a lot of buzz in the media and pop culture, and the sector’s sales have grown significantly in recent years, it’s still far too small a market to explain why more households have moved away from meat. The study found that plant-based meat products had no discernible displacement effect on animal meat sales. However, some of the most popular brands, like Beyond Meat and Impossible, didn’t become widely available in grocery stores until the final years of the data used in the paper.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Plant-based milks like oat and soy, however, displaced cow’s milk on a nearly 1-to-1 basis.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Meat’s price isn’t right</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The overall picture painted by the study is grim for factory-farmed animals and our warming planet. A small number of households have started avoiding meat at the grocery store in recent decades, but they’re overshadowed by all other households, which seem to be buying more meat.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The findings illustrate how critical the price of meat is to consumer behavior — a reality that’s painfully obvious to economists but often neglected in advocacy focused on animal cruelty. Work to change people’s hearts and minds may only go so far; changing the sticker price consumers see at the grocery store would likely have a much greater impact.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite rising food prices over the last two decades, meat and other animal products remain relatively cheap. That’s not because raising and slaughtering animals is an inexpensive endeavor, but because livestock companies have been <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/31/23852325/farming-myths-agricultural-exceptionalism-pollution-labor-animal-welfare-laws">exhaustively deregulated</a>, which in turn has diffused their costs throughout society.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Farmed animals pay the cost with their <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/3/9/22967328/animal-cruelty-laws-state-federal-exemptions-pennsylvania-martin-farms-dairy-calves-dehorning">suffering</a>, as do wild animals in the form of <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22287498/meat-wildlife-biodiversity-species-plantbased">mass deforestation</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/31/23852325/farming-myths-agricultural-exceptionalism-pollution-labor-animal-welfare-laws">polluted rivers</a>. Many farmers pay the cost by taking on a <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect-podcast/21363914/chicken-factory-farming-debt">mountain of debt</a>, while slaughterhouse workers pay the cost in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/05/amputations-serious-injuries-us-meat-industry-plant">lost fingers and limbs</a>. Ultimately, all of us pay it in the form of <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22905381/meat-dairy-eggs-climate-change-emissions-rewilding">climate change</a> and increasingly <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/1/8/23542789/big-meat-antibiotics-resistance-fda">ineffective antibiotics</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If livestock producers were to internalize these costs — and if we were to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/11/22/23471771/cory-booker-meat-farming-industrial-agriculture-accountability-act">do away</a> with much of the <a href="https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/2024/10/usda-livestock-subsidies-top-59-billion">subsidies</a> doled out to industry — meat would cost a lot more, causing some consumers to reduce or eliminate their meat purchasing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to True Price, a Dutch nonprofit that estimates the environmental cost of food, internalizing the environmental harms alone (excluding costs like animal cruelty and public health) of certain animal products would increase their price between <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/19/climate/food-costs-protein-environment.html">two- and five-fold</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Beef increases from $5.34 to $27.36 per pound</li>



<li>Cheese increases from $3.74 to $7.50 per pound</li>



<li>Chicken increases from $2.20 to $4.03 per pound</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Advocating for raising meat prices, especially after an election in which inflation and rising grocery bills played a <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/385932/biden-inflation-record-worse-unpopular-mistakes">major role</a> in ousting the incumbent party, feels — to put it lightly — insensitive and politically risky. But at the same time, consumers enjoy low meat prices at a steep cost to society, while polluting meat companies <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/meat-packers-profit-margins-jumped-300-during-pandemic-white-house-economics-2021-12-10/">celebrate record profits</a>. Some governments are reconsidering this longstanding deregulatory paradigm.<br><br>Just this week, the Danish government passed a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20nq8qgep3o">modest tax</a> on livestock emissions, and it’s also <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/384515/rune-christoffer-dragsdahl-vegetarian-society-denmark-animal-welfare-future-perfect-50">investing in programs</a> to make plant-based foods, which are much more environmentally friendly than meat, more affordable. If we’re serious about ensuring planet Earth is habitable for future generations, and mitigating one of humanity’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/363550/factory-farming-human-progress-sustainable-food-movement">greatest moral crimes</a>, the rest of us will need to follow their lead.</p>

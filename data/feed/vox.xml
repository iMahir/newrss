<p class="has-text-align-none">When President Joe Biden announced Sunday he was dropping out of the presidential race, a chorus of Democratic Party officials breathed a sigh of relief. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent weeks, Democratic bigwigs ranging from Nancy Pelosi to Barack Obama had been ratcheting up a pressure campaign to get Biden to step aside. Back in 2022, former Obama adviser and current political pundit David Axelrod was one of the first prominent Democrats to suggest Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/11/us/politics/biden-2024-election-democrats.html">should withdraw.</a> But yesterday’s news left him with mixed emotions. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“When I got the news yesterday, I was very, very sad,” Axelrod told <em>Today, Explained</em> co-host Sean Rameswaram Monday morning. “I thought he was a tremendous asset in the White House. Always enjoyed being with him, always appreciated the points that he was making. I think history will be a lot kinder to him than voters are right now, for the things that he’s accomplished.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Listen to Sean Rameswaram’s full conversation with Axelrod and follow <em>Today, Explained</em> on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/today-explained/id1346207297">Apple podcasts</a>,<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3pXx5SXzXwJxnf4A5pWN2A"> Spotify</a>,<a href="https://www.pandora.com/podcast/today-explained/PC:140"> Pandora</a>, or wherever you find podcasts. Below is a transcript of their discussion, edited for length and clarity. </p>

<iframe frameborder="0" height="200" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP8691595294" width="100%"></iframe>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Rameswaram&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You were part of this mounting call for [President Biden] to step aside. Did you think that was actually in the cards? Did you think the party was capable of what it’s going through right now?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">David Axelrod&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I thought it was almost inevitable after the debate. The debate kind of crystallized what had been a big and growing problem, which was doubts about his fitness to serve another four years. Those were not just magnified, but calcified by the debate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And then you had the bookend of Trump and the assassination attempt. And his preternatural marketing instincts to find the precise spot to take the hero pose. The two things read weakness and strength, which was the essence of the Trump message that the world was out of control. “Biden is not in command. He’s weak. Trump is strong. Vote for Trump.” That was their whole campaign. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now they have a complication because they don’t have Biden. So, it does change the nature of the race. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A lot of the people who were calling for Biden to step aside are now jubilant, if not endorsing Vice President Harris. Your friend and former colleague, former President Barack Obama, has not yet done that. What do you think is going on there?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">David Axelrod</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I don’t think he wanted to prescribe for the party what the party should do, but rather be available to be a force for pulling the party together once the party made its choice. I think what’s very clear as we sit here this morning, the day after the president made his announcement, is that Kamala Harris is going to be the nominee of the Democratic Party. I don’t think there’s any real debate about that. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She very quickly consolidated support in a way that should actually inspire some confidence, because that’s a political task and she did it. She did it very well. I think the last of the prospective opponents will endorse her and she’ll move on to the business of choosing a vice presidential candidate.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Rameswaram<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So you don’t think she’s going to do what the Republicans did and wait until the DNC to announce who’s going to be on the ticket with her?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">David Axelrod</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I don’t think she can, because they are committed to an early vote of the delegates to nominate two candidates in order to accommodate all the states filing deadlines for the fall ballot. They’re scheduled to meet next week to codify the ticket. I don’t think that they really can put this off until the convention. I anticipate that we’ll know relatively quickly who the vice presidential nominee is going to be.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You host a podcast with a Republican strategist named Mike Murphy, who’s anti-Trump, but he’s one of the few voices saying that it’s happening too fast with Harris. Do you understand his perspective on that?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">David Axelrod</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I do, but I think that she would be the nominee if there were a process or if there were not a process, for a variety of reasons.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One, she has more of a relationship with the delegates to the convention. Biden-Harris delegates were chosen by the Biden campaign. And so they’re naturally going to gravitate towards her. The composition of those delegates favors her. I think she might have benefited from more of a competition just to show that she could win. But I get Mike’s point of view. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the reasons why I spoke out as early as I did about my concerns about the president moving forward was that had he made this decision last year, we would have had a Democratic primary. In the Democratic primary is how you pressure test these candidates. Remember, Ron DeSantis was viewed as a behemoth in the fall of 2022, and then he had to go through the nominating battle, and he ended up not faring as well. You do find out about people through that process. That said, she’s been vetted quite a bit. She ran for president. She’s been vice president for three and a half years. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No matter what level of politics you’re at, there’s no training for it. There’s no simulator you can pop into to find out what the pressures of a presidential campaign are like. In many ways, the campaign simulates the sort of relentless pressure that presidents themselves will feel. She’s experienced that, she has been swimming in the deep end of the pool, and that, to me, is a big thing. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The other thing is she has apprenticed. She has been in those rooms. She has been in those meetings. She knows a lot about what the presidency entails. That, too, is something that’s very hard to learn, on the fly. So I think she’s got a lot of arguments on her side for this.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It seems like the Republicans really want to come after Biden, and now Harris, probably, on immigration, on inflation. Does Harris have the same weaknesses as Biden there, if not even more so?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">David Axelrod</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, they will try to depict her as the immigration czar, and I’m sure they’ve got about 100 ads in the can on this. But the truth is, she’s not Joe Biden. She can chart her own course now. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’m old enough to remember the ’68 campaign when Lyndon Johnson quit. Ultimately, his vice president, Hubert Humphrey, became the presidential candidate, and the heavy burden of Vietnam hung over him. He ended up losing by a point, but he also was like 20 points behind when he got nominated. And if that race had gone another month, another week, I should say he would have won. So, you know, she needs to chart her own course. Talk about what she would do. I think there are also points on this immigration issue that are vulnerabilities for Trump.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Are you looking forward to that debate?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">David Axelrod</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Oh, yes. You know, what’s interesting is that the addled old man on the platform is not going to be Joe Biden this time.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kamala Harris is a historic vice president. She’ll be an even more historic president, obviously. Do you think she leans into that, or do you think she leans into the issues? She leans into Donald Trump’s various criminal battles, what have you.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">David Axelrod</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Listen, when Barack Obama was running for president, we never talked about the historic nature of his candidacy because we thought that was obvious. Others might be talking about it, but he always said, I am proudly of the Black community, but I’m not limited to it, and I’m not running to be the first Black president or the Black president. I’m running to be president of the United States. The people who step forward and say, you can’t bypass her because she’s the first Black woman vice president? They were diminishing her. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The case they should have been making and should be making today is why she’s the best candidate, why she has the best chance to win, what she brings to this race. I know there’s a lot of enthusiasm among some folks about the historic nature of the race. But there are a lot of voters for whom other things are more important. And they want to know, are we going to have someone who understands our lives and is fighting for us? The more she focuses on that, I think the greater her chances of success.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Rameswaram&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You started saying that the news yesterday made you sad, but you obviously helped turn hope into a political strategy in 2008. Do you feel hopeful right now?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">David Axelrod&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I do, because I think that what was not a race yesterday is a race today. I see the enthusiasm that the vice president has generated in the first 24 hours. She raised $46 million in a matter of hours, online and small donations. That’s a record. It’s a gauge of enthusiasm which has been absent. So I am encouraged by what I see. It’s better to have hope than despair. And this morning, a lot of Democrats have hope that they didn’t have yesterday morning. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During every Olympic Games, lesser-known professional athletes are catapulted into household names overnight. Typically, they have to win medals. Other times, their personalities are enough to build their own fandoms. Heading into this summer’s Olympics in Paris, Noah Lyles expects to be recognized for both.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you don’t follow track and field, you may not be familiar with Lyles — although his name could soon become inescapable. Already, the new Netflix docuseries <em>Sprint</em>, set around the <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/olympics/news/track-and-field-world-championships-results-2023">2023 World Athletics Championships</a> in Budapest, has shone a bigger spotlight on him. The six-part series follows track and field’s brightest stars in the 100- and 200-meter sprints, including the fastest woman on Earth, Sha’Carri Richardson; Jamaican gold medalist Shericka Jackson; and British record-holder in the 100 and 200 meters, Zharnel Hughes. Despite this star power, the series’s main attraction has been Lyles, whose ambitions to outrun retired legend Usain Bolt have ruffled <a href="https://www.essentiallysports.com/us-sports-news-olympics-news-track-and-field-news-not-likable-at-all-noah-lyles-receives-heavy-criticism-from-twitters-track-field-community-for-netflixs-sprint-documentary/">some feathers</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many of Lyles’s soundbites in <em>Sprint</em> have been <a href="https://x.com/BadgyalTerryG/status/1811176867061260790">perceived</a> by <a href="https://x.com/willthefred/status/1811185176766038069">viewers</a> as <a href="https://x.com/pernillatweets1/status/1809892070334570956">arrogant.</a> In one scene, he says that to be a successful athlete, “you have to have the mindset of a God.” “I’m a true believer in that the moment isn’t bigger than me, the moment was made for me,” he says in another. Compare this attitude to Shericka Jackson’s. When asked by someone off-camera about claims that she’s the best in the sport, she refused to comment. Meanwhile, others seem confused about Lyles’s claim to “the fastest man in the world” title while Bolt is still living. Still, much like <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/shacarri-richardson-august-2024-digital-cover-interview" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vogue.com/article/shacarri-richardson-august-2024-digital-cover-interview">Richardson</a>, his bravado, personal style, and penchant for trash-talking has given Americans someone to place their bets on at the upcoming Olympics.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Currently, Lyles holds the title of the fastest man in the world after winning the 100 and 200 meters — also known as the sprint double — at last year’s World Championships. (He ran the 100 meter in 9.83 seconds and the 200 meter in 19.52.) Altogether, he holds six world titles. He also earned the bronze medal in the 200 meter at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, a disappointing result that he says inspired his lofty goals at this year’s games. Not only does he want to beat Bolt’s record times, he plans to take home four gold medals.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether he can actually achieve this feat is anyone’s guess. Regardless, it seems like he’ll leave this year’s Olympics having achieved another career goal — having everyone talk about him.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Lyles may have his critics, but it’s all part of his mythmaking&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When we think of celebrity athletes whose fame extends beyond their sport, sprinters aren’t exactly the first people to come to mind. While Bolt has practically become synonymous with running, it’s fair to say the sport doesn’t offer its athletes the same level of visibility that the NBA, for example, offers even its most unassuming players. For instance, it took a <a href="https://www.vox.com/22565419/shacarri-richardson-olympics-marijuana-ban-war-on-drugs">drug-test scandal</a> — coming up positive for marijuana, not performance-enhancing drugs — and her subsequent suspension from the Tokyo Olympics for Richardson to become a national talking point and a currently beloved underdog.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lyles wants this to change. “You have all these other athletes as stars, rockstars, popular wherever they go,” he says in the first episode of <em>Sprint</em>. “Track and field needs to be the same.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The 26-year-old has certainly been doing his part to bring attention to the sport, or maybe just to himself. While he doesn’t represent the most head-turning style in track and field right now — that may belong to Richardson with her occasionally flame-colored hair, numerous tattoos, and Flo Jo-esque acrylics — he frequently shows up to meets in snazzy, designer looks, like F1 champion Lewis Hamilton or one of a handful of NBA stars. Also in the spirit of ’80s icon Florence Griffith Joyner, he even enjoys a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nbcolympics/video/7344869517991922990">flashy manicure</a>. His accomplishments, thus far, have also gotten him a few magazine covers, most recently <a href="https://time.com/6991825/noah-lyles-olympics-2024-interview/">Time</a>, and an extremely lucrative contract for a track star with Adidas. </p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On social media, he delivers the same high-quality, fashion-forward content of a major influencer. (In <em>Sprint</em>, he refers to himself as an “artistic director.”) On his Instagram (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/nojo18/?hl=en">@nojo18</a>), where he’s approaching a million followers, you’re just as likely to see high-res photos of his pre-meet fits, posts with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C8k6QGHI7qq/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1">Snoop Dogg</a>, and wardrobe selections inspired by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8yKXDnRYer/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">his favorite anime</a> as you are content related to track. He also posts playful videos with his girlfriend, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C9LDOhMvteN/?hl=en">fellow runner Junelle Bromfield</a>, the pair seeming to be a power couple in the making.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On his way to becoming America’s most beloved track star, though, Lyles has already rubbed some sports fans the wrong way. In an interview following his World Championship wins last year, he questioned why NBA Finals winners are referred to as “world champions.” “World champions of what?” he asked at a post-meet conference.“The United States?” Soon came a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/29/sport/noah-lyles-nba-backlash-spt-intl/index.html">pile of responses</a> from NBA players, including Kevin Durant, Aaron Gordon, and Devin Booker denouncing his comments. Drake, a supporter of the Toronto Raptors, even chimed in, poking fun at Lyles. Others, like Ghanaian sports journalist <a href="https://twitter.com/garyalsmith/status/1696087026154541245?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1696087026154541245%7Ctwgr%5E95a150cf499700a49eda9372113c58a1dfff9e17%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.npr.org%2F2023%2F08%2F28%2F1196396026%2Fnoah-lyles-nba-world-champions-basketball-drake-kevin-durant">Gary Al-Smith</a>, said Lyles was simply observing a larger problem of American exceptionalism in basketball.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ironically, Lyles has been accused of displaying the same superior, <a href="https://x.com/wiiissssss/status/1810777524630397169">culturally American</a> attitude in his own sport. On the fourth episode of <em>Sprint</em>, Lyles discussed the backlash he received after he posted his predicted times in the 100 meter and 200 meter at last year’s World Championships on Instagram, which he ultimately fell short of, despite taking home the gold. “What the heck does me saying my goal have to do with you?” he asks in a talking-head interview. It’s a good question, considering that it’s every athlete’s goal to perform at their best and destroy their opponents, whether or not they vocalize it as much as Lyles does. Fans’ negative responses to this sort of behavior have also confused Richardson, who says in the docuseries that there should be “more trash-talking” in the sport.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This poor reception online can at least be partially explained by a heated rivalry between American and Jamaican sprinters that intensified at the<a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1269260-olympic-track-2012-breaking-down-team-usas-rivalry-with-jamaican-sprinters"> 2008 Beijing Olympics</a> where Bolt won the gold in the 100 meter and 200 meter, while achieving record times in both sprints. Jamaican track stars Shelly Ann-Frazer and Veronica Campbell-Brown also won the 100 meter and 200 meter, respectively. More than any athlete, though, Bolt has become a national symbol and icon in Jamaica, where track and field is the dominant sport. Announcing your plans to overthrow him, as Lyles has done, expectedly has some repercussions.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>All eyes are on Lyles at the Paris Olympics&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the US claims both the fastest man and woman in the world right now, one can assume an even larger number of American viewers will be tuned in to track this year, and there’s a lot at stake for Lyles’s reputation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Historically, the Olympics have been fraught territory for the runner. In 2020, fans&nbsp;witnessed the emotional toll that training for and competing at the Olympics has had on Lyles, and how he handles disappointment when he’s fallen short of his goals.&nbsp;After landing in third place in the 200 meter in Tokyo, Lyles broke down during a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2021/08/04/noah-lyles-bronze-olympics-depression/">post-meet interview</a> with the Washington Post. Tears started to fall when talking about his brother, Josephus Lyles, another professional sprinter, who failed to qualify for the Olympics that year. He spoke&nbsp;about his mental health and his journey with antidepressants leading up to the Olympics, as well as his experience marching alongside his brother in 2020’s Black Lives Matter protests, and the pressure he feels as a Black American athlete and a Black American man.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I knew there were a lot of people out there like me who were too scared to say something or start that journey,” he said. “I wanted them to know if you guys see me in a big light, I want you to know that it’s okay not to feel good and you can go out and talk to somebody … This is a serious issue.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-2158934967_fdcc65.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Noah Lyles, pictured from below, wears a red track suit and a gold medal around his neck, stands beside a replica of the Eiffel tower." title="Noah Lyles, pictured from below, wears a red track suit and a gold medal around his neck, stands beside a replica of the Eiffel tower." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Noah Lyles celebrates with the gold medal after winning the men’s 100-meter final on day three of the 2024 US Olympic Team trials Track &amp; Field at Hayward Field on June 23, 2024, in Eugene, Oregon. | Patrick Smith/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Patrick Smith/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, following a double-sprint win at the World Championships, Lyles is displaying more confidence than ever. During a recent appearance on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZRVEX2OG10"><em>The Tonight Show</em></a>, Lyles took the opportunity to tell the country what he planned to achieve in Paris. For one thing, he wants to beat Bolt, who holds the top two times in the 100-meter dash at 9.63 and 9.69 seconds. But he also wants to take home four gold medals. “It’s not just good enough to be faster than that,” Lyles told Fallon. “You also have to have the medals to go with it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition to taking home the gold in the 100 and 200 meter, Lyles wants to win in the 4&#215;100&nbsp;and 4&#215;400 meter relays. It wouldn’t be the first time an American sprinter nabbed four gold medals at one Olympics. For instance, Jesse Owens, Alvin Kraenzlein, and Carl Lewis have each won four. Their wins included the long jump, however; Lyles would be making history for those four sprints. Beyond any potential medals, the energy surrounding him and Richardson feels like a new era for American track stars, one defined by attitude and swagger. If Lyles can impress the world with his personality, he’ll at least have achieved half of his goals.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For a very long time in American politics, the primary question of presidential candidate likability was voters asking themselves, “Could I have a beer with them?” But over the course of the social media age, a new gut check has emerged to test a president’s ability to capture the internet’s attention: Does this person make a good meme?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After four years of a president for whom the answer was “not really” (with a minor caveat for <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23300286/biden-dark-brandon-meme-maga-why-confusing-explained">“Dark Brandon</a>,” which was funny for precisely one second), Democrats now have a candidate who can actually compete with Trump in the court of internet opinion. On social media timelines the world over, Vice President Kamala Harris is currently being made into <a href="https://x.com/JoePostingg/status/1815387172469387530">frenzied supercuts</a> where she dances, laughs, and delivers her now-iconic <a href="https://www.vox.com/kamala-harris/359072/kamala-harris-coconut-tree-context-unburden-meme-khive">metaphor about coconut trees</a> as she expounds on being “unburdened by what has been.” She’s being <a href="https://x.com/Saweetney/status/1813264361840148935">edited into pop songs</a> and remixed <a href="https://x.com/ryanlong03/status/1808510079382982870">queening out to “Brat,”</a> the <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/354634/charli-xcx-brat-album-review">Charli xcx album that’s become this summer’s</a> biggest cultural breakout and digital shorthand for unapologetic, messy hedonism.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Memeability is an ineffable quality with undeniable electoral repercussions: Obama’s grabby slogans and punchy graphic design made him infinitely <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/01/11/obamas-yes-we-can-thank-michelle-for-that/">more memeable</a> than standard-issue Republicans John McCain and Mitt Romney, while Trump’s exaggerated facial expressions and off-the-cuff remarks can admittedly be very funny (who could forget <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NRUJbivhnE">his reaction</a> to Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death as “Tiny Dancer” played?) when they’re not overtly cruel. In both cases, the candidates’ ubiquitous internet presence spoke to their wider ability to capture young people’s attention and energy, even when the memes themselves were barely legible to the average voter. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">why did I stay up till 3am making a von dutch brat coconut tree edit featuring kamala harris and why can’t I stop watching it on repeat <a href="https://t.co/hqcmerD1Pb">pic.twitter.com/hqcmerD1Pb</a></p>&mdash; ryan (@ryanlong03) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanlong03/status/1808510079382982870?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 3, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, Democrats have been handed the blessing of completely organic Kamala memes. The out-of-context clips and creative edits of the vice president, usually steeped in at least some level of irony, gained steam following <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357788/biden-trump-debate-winners-losers">Biden’s disastrous performance</a> at the June presidential debate, when swaths of voters were clamoring for a change in candidate and turned to the next most likely option.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Suddenly, mentions of the “KHive” were everywhere, referring to Harris’s supporters during her 2020 campaign, as were viral clips of Harris singing <a href="https://x.com/pIanetMEDIA/status/1589854533865607168?lang=en">“The Wheels on the Bus,”</a> theatrically sharing <a href="https://x.com/rayofvenuss/status/1814096303854403711">Thanksgiving turkey recipes</a> seconds before snapping to attention for an interview, and talking about her favorite subject, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dailymail/video/7394381952989596959">Venn diagrams</a>. Harris is particularly prone to being memed: Many people on the internet have <a href="https://x.com/gayest_tone/status/1808249313455493491?s=46&amp;t=eeeaRs85C85Eh6UanNOWaQ">described her kooky persona</a> as “your Xanned out aunt,” thanks to her propensity to burst into a high-pitched cackle at any moment.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Only recently has Harris herself embraced the jokes, now that she’s officially running for president with Biden’s backing. Should you visit the campaign’s <a href="https://x.com/KamalaHQ">account</a> on X, you’ll notice a lime green banner with “kamala hq” written in the “Brat” font, an homage to the album cover. After Charli xcx <a href="https://x.com/charli_xcx/status/1815182384066707861">tweeted</a> “kamala IS brat,” Harris followed her on both X and Instagram.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fellow Democratic politicians have followed suit, with Illinois Gov. <a href="https://x.com/JBPritzker/status/1815401261690208303">J.B. Pritzker asking</a>, “You think I just fell out of a coconut tree?” as his way of winkingly endorsing Harris (or perhaps gunning for a VP nomination), while Hawaii Sen. <a href="https://x.com/brianschatz/status/1815175570990276937">Brian Schatz posted</a> a photo of himself climbing a literal coconut tree.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>This, ultimately, is the power of memeability, or the talent of a candidate to transcend politics and become a legible cultural brand</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Is this the beginning of a campaign that, for the first time since 2008, Democrats have actually found &#8230; fun? In 2016, the MAGA crowd delighted in <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/9/21/12893656/pepe-frog-donald-trump">memes circulated on red-pill forums</a> that depicted Trump as a cartoonish strongman who was exactly as hateful and despotic as the left feared. Everything that made him invigorating to his fans — an unlikely nominee who captured a certain kind of irony-poisoned nihilistic impulse on the internet — now seems to be working in progressives’ favor.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Until recently, 2024 promised to be one of the most uninteresting elections in history. After a series of extremely unpredictable events (a <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357876/biden-trump-debate-cnn-won-step-down-atlanta">poor debate performance</a>, an <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360390/trump-shot-assassination-attempt-shooter-bullet-butler-pennsylvania-biden-secret-service-updates">assassination attempt</a>, a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-covid-rehoboth-beach-harris-2024-ef4d643927247c59868607a80129c190">case of Covid</a>, and a <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361827/biden-drops-out-2024-kamala-convention">historic dropout)</a>, Harris has now filled a most unlikely role: a Democratic presidential nominee who’s entertaining to watch, even if you don’t agree with everything she stands for.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This, ultimately, is the power of memeability, or the talent of a candidate to transcend politics and become a legible cultural brand. It has played a crucial role in elections since before anyone used the term: Memeability is Bill Clinton playing the saxophone on <em>Arsenio Hall,</em> and it’s Howard Dean’s awkward scream that lost him the 2004 Democratic nomination.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Candidates have always attempted to stage this kind of virality — Hillary Clinton’s <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/vvbwmj/hillary-clinton-accidentally-became-a-vine-meme">“I’m just chilling in Cedar Rapids” Vine</a><em>, </em>for one<em> —</em> but the moments that truly take off lock into the absurdist, chaotic energy of the internet and are almost impossible to predict. Clinton never cracked that particular formula, whereas Harris has done it while barely even trying.&nbsp;</p>

</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Ryan Long, the 22-year-old senior at the University of Delaware who created one of the most <a href="https://x.com/ryanlong03/status/1808510079382982870">viral Kamala “Brat” video edits</a>, puts it, “She’s the perfect candidate for the TikTok generation. I’ve gone so deep into the Kamala Harris YouTube archives, and there are just so many moments of her laughing and dancing.” The clips, he adds, stand in stark contrast to the stagnant mood coloring the Biden camp over the past year. “Kamala just brings new energy and the possibility of change,” he tells me. “She does such a good job of embodying ‘Brat’ summer.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It wasn’t long ago that Harris was dubbed “Copmala” by liberals and leftists <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/1/23/18184192/kamala-harris-president-campaign-criminal-justice-record">dismayed by her “tough on crime” criminal justice record</a>. The vibe online has shifted significantly since then, and the left seems ready to <a href="https://x.com/thetolerantweft/status/1815142058555744734">embrace the absurdity</a> and <a href="https://x.com/chickenstrip007/status/1808154777634890089">make peace</a> with the candidate they’ve been handed. Though <a href="https://x.com/julesterpak/status/1815444787375599814">some online</a> have warned the Harris campaign against leaning into the jokes and memes too heavily or risk coming across as corny and try-hard, it’s just as easy to imagine large portions of voters excited about the prospect of a candidate who can — convincingly! — laugh along with them. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m all in on President Kamala. We need a Gemini Rising woman President from California who is on pills+wine, is campy, and didn’t get married until she was middle aged because she was too busy being a 365 party girlboss.

At least she’s not a felon or 80</p>&mdash; superfun site (@chickenstrip007) <a href="https://twitter.com/chickenstrip007/status/1808154777634890089?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 2, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps progressives have finally learned from Trump, who understood that memes, even when they were theoretically unflattering, could help craft the persona that won him the presidency. There’s an infallibility that comes with being in on the joke, and now that the Harris campaign has joined in, the attacks from the right don’t stick as they might have with a different candidate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It was the RNC who made the <a href="https://x.com/RNCResearch/status/1736468129528602811">four-minute video</a> splicing together every time Harris used the phrase “unburdened” back in December. Now, the most popular quote tweet of that <a href="https://x.com/nikicaga/status/1815128527886303620">post reads</a>, “The RNC staffer that posted this is getting executed as we speak,” referring to how the right’s criticisms of Harris have, so far, backfired. That Trump’s <a href="https://x.com/bennyjohnson/status/1814796045173272846">epithet for her is “Laughin’ Kamala”</a> feels particularly uninspired when compared to “Sleepy Joe” and “Crooked Hillary” — laughing is, after all, a famously fun and good activity. The Harris campaign <a href="https://x.com/BMeiselas/status/1815226127121826009">even gleefully reposted</a> a tweet advising Republicans to drop the “unburdened” jokes because “[t]hey’re going to spin that into marketing for her campaign.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What this all amounts to is a viral marketing stunt that any presidential candidate would pay millions for, but one that no strategist or ad agency could create. It’s all entirely organic, forged from the fires of a truly bizarre and unpredictable time, and the feeling that a little chaos might be exactly what American politics needs. For once, it really does seem like we can become unburdened from what has been. And perhaps Kamala Harris will be laughing all the way to the Oval Office.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Democrats unite around Vice President Kamala Harris as their likely new nominee, their public mood is absolutely jubilant. Now, they hope, the party has a nominee who can take the fight to Trump — and win.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These hopes are not yet supported by polling data, which currently shows Harris on track to lose.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris’s approval rating is not good (38 percent approval, 50 percent disapproval in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/">FiveThirtyEight’s average</a>). She trails Trump by about 2 points nationally, <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-harris">on average</a>, and the <a href="https://elections2024.thehill.com/arizona/harris-trump-arizona/">few</a> <a href="https://elections2024.thehill.com/michigan/harris-trump-michigan/">public</a> <a href="https://elections2024.thehill.com/arizona/harris-trump-arizona/">polls</a> <a href="https://elections2024.thehill.com/georgia/harris-trump-georgia/">pitting</a> her against Trump in swing states nearly all show her behind, sometimes behind by a lot.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, maybe those polls aren’t worth much since voters haven’t truly gotten to know Harris. Maybe she’ll wage a smart, vigorous campaign and win them over. Maybe the excitement her selection brings to the ticket will supercharge enthusiasm.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Maybe.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Harris also has some very real weaknesses as a candidate that could turn things the other way.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Namely, she will be attacked as a San Francisco liberal elite. She will be held responsible for the Biden administration’s record rather than being able to have a clean slate. And her stint at the top of national politics has had its fair share of gaffes and reported staff turmoil.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">(Her race and gender will also be factors shaping how she is perceived, but they are not reasons to assume that she cannot win. And it’s worth evaluating her record, as well as her political persona, on their own terms.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has his own serious weaknesses, and it’s certainly possible that Harris could win. But she doesn’t start off as the favorite, and she has some real work to do.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Harris will be attacked as a San Francisco liberal elite</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden’s withdrawal and endorsement of Harris was met with tremendous excitement from Democrats’ donor base, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/22/us/politics/harris-fundraising-biden-actblue.html">$81 million</a> pouring into the campaign’s coffers in less than 24 hours. Anecdotally, I’ve heard tremendous optimism from people in my (educated coastal urban) circles that Harris will be a far superior candidate to Biden.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, if the presidential election was conducted among educated coastal urbanites, Harris would surely win in a walk. But in reality, a winning candidate needs the votes of other demographics too, including from some people who don’t like educated coastal urbanites very much.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps the biggest electoral story of the past decade has been the phenomenon of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/10/01/understanding-electorate-diploma-divide/">education polarization</a>, in which college-educated voters have been trending increasingly toward Democrats while non-college voters have been moving more toward the GOP. These shifts were arguably decisive in tipping key Midwestern swing states — Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan — toward Trump in 2016. Biden — “Joe from Scranton” — <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/5/10/22425178/catalist-report-2020-election-biden-trump-demographics">reversed them a bit</a> in 2020, just enough to eke out an Electoral College win. Notably, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/08/us/politics/how-college-graduates-vote.html">Trump made significant gains</a> among voters of color without degrees that year, and 2024 polling has suggested these trends could continue.</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>President Joe Biden endorsed Kamala Harris for president. Here’s what to know about her.</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Vice President Kamala Harris could replace Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket in 2024.</p>

</ul>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Part of the reason for this, some Democrats <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/opinion/democrats-david-shor-education-polarization.html">have argued</a>, is that their national party has lost the ability to communicate to non-college voters, that the party’s donor and staffer class are so dominated by the educated coastal elite that they no longer speak the same “language” as swing-state voters and their values have dramatically diverged from them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris is extremely good at speaking the language of Democrats’ upscale voter base. That is how she rose in blue San Francisco and California politics, and that is why there was initial enthusiasm for her 2020 presidential campaign. It’s also a main reason why, after that campaign flopped, she still got picked as Biden’s running mate (Biden’s campaign was <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/12/joe-biden-fundraising-394488">similarly flooded with donations</a> after her selection).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But can she convince Midwestern swing voters she’s on their side, that she doesn’t view them as “<a href="https://time.com/4486502/hillary-clinton-basket-of-deplorables-transcript/">deplorables</a>,” that she’s not some out-of-touch San Francisco liberal extremist? Can she “speak” swing voter in a convincing way? We simply don’t know yet. While she has made some campaign appearances in swing states, doing so as the nominee means she&#8217;ll be in the spotlight in a new way, with much higher stakes.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Harris will have to defend the Biden administration’s unpopular record</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s probably unfair to put too much blame on Harris for her low approval numbers when their main cause is likely that she is part of the Biden-Harris administration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And if most Americans are not happy with the administration Harris has been a part of, that will be a problem for her candidacy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the effort to push Biden off the ticket, there’s been a tendency among Democrats (who generally believe Biden has done a good job) to blame his political woes on his age rather than his record. They theorize that the policies have been good but there’s been a communication problem in explaining how good they are.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Polling, though, has been pretty consistent that the American public believes the administration has handled <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/approval/joe-biden/issues">major issues poorly</a> — most notably the economy, immigration, and foreign policy, with voters <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-leads-biden-double-digits-three-key-issues-pew-research-survey">consistently saying</a> Trump would do a better job on all three issues.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris was not personally responsible for policy on inflation, the border, the Afghanistan withdrawal, or the Israel-Gaza war. (Republicans have falsely called her the “<a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361635/kamala-harris-border-czar-immigration-mexico-guatemala-rnc">border czar</a>,” when Harris was in fact tasked with the much more limited role of addressing “root causes” of unauthorized immigration abroad.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s true that Harris has staunchly defended the administration’s policies on these issues. It will be tough for her to criticize any decision (since doing so would raise the question of why she didn’t criticize it earlier). And it will be hard for her to make the case that she’d do things all that differently from Biden, considering she’s already been vice president for four years.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Typically, when a new nominee runs for president, they get to offer idealistic promises of change and break with how the incumbent has been doing things in areas where the public wants change. That will be difficult for Harris. She does not start with a clean slate; she is burdened by what has been. And the public is <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1669/general-mood-country.aspx">not happy</a> with how things have been under Biden.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Harris has had a tumultuous political history in national politics</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, there is the question of whether Harris will be able to run an effective and successful presidential campaign. There’s an idealized, <a href="https://www.vox.com/kamala-harris/359072/kamala-harris-coconut-tree-context-unburden-meme-khive">meme-worthy</a> image of Harris’s political appeal that has spread among Democrats eager to turn the page on Biden, but her track record at the top of national politics has been more mixed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That began with her 2020 presidential campaign, which actually ended in December 2019. There is no shame in running in your party’s presidential primary and losing. Not every defeat is the candidate’s “fault” rather than a reflection of larger circumstances. A loss can position a candidate well for success next time.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Harris’s campaign was chock-full of public missteps and reports of behind-the-scenes chaos.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She had one viral moment in which she <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/27/18932212/joe-biden-kamala-harris-desegregate-busing">confronted Joe Biden</a> about his historic opposition to busing policy on the debate stage, but days after, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/harris-clarifies-stance-on-federally-mandated-school-busing">she acknowledged</a> that her views on what busing policy should currently be weren’t any different from Biden’s.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris also <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/27/18919494/democratic-debate-2019-kamala-harris-healthcare-policy">struggled to answer questions</a> about her health care policy, at times seeming to support a version of Medicare-for-all that eliminates private health insurance and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/8/20/20813658/kamala-harris-bernie-sanders-medicare-for-all-2020">at other times</a> saying she supported no such thing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Internally, her campaign “became a hotbed of drama and backbiting,” <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/politics/kamala-harris-2020-campaign/index.html">according to CNN</a>, with finger-pointing leaks from rival factions constantly spilling out. She gave her sister Maya a key role, and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/29/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020.html">New York Times reported</a> that “one campaign strategist said it was impossible to tell if Maya Harris was speaking for herself, as an adviser, or as her sister’s representative.” But in both of those stories, sources argued that the candidate’s own strategic indecisiveness was perhaps the campaign’s biggest problem.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of this prevented Biden from picking her as his running mate in 2020. Then, early in his term, a similar story unfolded in the vice president’s office. In a high-profile interview with NBC’s Lester Holt in June 2021, Harris <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/06/us/politics/kamala-harris-vice-presidenct-legacy.html">struggled</a> to answer questions about the administration’s border policy, and claimed “we’ve been to the border” even though she had not. Afterward, she clamped down on her interview availability, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/06/us/politics/kamala-harris-vice-presidenct-legacy.html">reportedly</a> for fear of making further gaffes. (Amid all the scrutiny on Biden for doing few high-profile interviews, it’s worth noting that Harris hasn’t exactly been ubiquitous either.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/12/04/kamala-harris-staff-departures/">story</a> after <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/14/politics/kamala-harris-frustrating-start-vice-president/index.html">story</a> told of staff chaos in and departures from Harris’s office. A former aide offered scathing comments <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/12/04/kamala-harris-staff-departures/">to the Washington Post</a>: “It’s clear that you’re not working with somebody who is willing to do the prep and the work. &#8230; With Kamala you have to put up with a constant amount of soul-destroying criticism and also her own lack of confidence. So you’re constantly sort of propping up a bully and it’s not really clear why.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To be sure, Donald Trump’s staff drama in his campaigns and White House was far more intense (and it didn’t prevent him from winning in 2016). And reports of feuding in Harris’s office <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/12/politics/kamala-harris-democratic-party/index.html">have lessened</a> in the past year or so; perhaps Harris has found advisers with whom she is more comfortable. But now she’s suddenly back in the spotlight, and the pressure is on. So now the question is will she rise to the challenge, overseeing and implementing a strategy and team that can win?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Harris is the underdog — but she<em> could</em> win</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of this means that Harris absolutely cannot win.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The problems above may be serious challenges for her campaign. And yes, she currently trails in the polls. But challenges can be addressed and polls can change. The election is more than three months away.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris’s opponent, Donald Trump, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/">is also unpopular</a>. Democrats hope she can lean on her past as a former prosecutor to “prosecute” the case against him. Trump’s performance in the first debate was no great shakes; he may compare unfavorably to Harris in another — if he agrees to do it (and if he doesn’t, she can criticize him for that).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris will indeed energize the liberal base, and perhaps she’ll be more appealing to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/06/05/nx-s1-4987296/young-voters-biden-gaza-inflation-abortion-trump-genforward-poll">young voters</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/30/biden-black-voters-00160520">Black voters</a>, who Biden has struggled with. She clearly has more energy and ability to campaign than Biden has had to this point.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And if the past month should tell us anything, it’s that the future of politics is never set in stone.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President Joe Biden’s decision to <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361827/biden-drops-out-2024-kamala-convention" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vox.com/politics/361827/biden-drops-out-2024-kamala-convention">withdraw from the 2024 presidential race</a> after winning the Democratic primary puts the party in an unprecedented position.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With just weeks to go before the Democratic National Convention in Chicago — and less than four months until Election Day — they are running short on time to lock down the ticket and launch a campaign around an entirely new candidate. Democrats appear to be rallying around Biden’s preferred successor, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360327/vice-president-kamala-harris-joe-biden-nominee">Vice President Kamala Harris</a>, and it seems likely that she’ll be the presidential nominee.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here are seven questions answered about what needs to happen before Harris can become the nominee, what an open process for selecting Democrats’ next presidential candidate might look like, and what’s next for Harris and her party.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1) <strong>Will Harris automatically replace Biden as the Democratic nominee?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris is not officially the Democrats’ nominee; the endorsement of the Democratic Party’s leader isn’t enough. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris has acknowledged this and said that she intends to <a href="https://x.com/KamalaHarris/status/1815122383415529963">“earn and win this nomination</a>.” While there is still technically a chance that she will not become the nominee, she has already locked in endorsements she needs to make it unlikely that anyone will credibly challenge her. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She has been endorsed by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/all-50-democratic-party-us-state-chairs-back-harris-sources-2024-07-21/">all 50 Democratic state party chairs</a>, party leaders including <a href="https://x.com/axios/status/1815439766155874376">former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</a>, and many of her would-be Democratic rivals. That list includes <a href="https://x.com/gretchenwhitmer/status/1815388428256637356">Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer</a>, <a href="https://x.com/GavinNewsom/status/1815168477562646858">California Gov. Gavin Newsom</a>, <a href="https://x.com/PeteButtigieg/status/1815170171327443041">Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg</a>, <a href="https://x.com/JoshShapiroPA/status/1815147937543925873">Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro</a>, <a href="https://x.com/CaptMarkKelly/status/1815116346491084878">Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly</a>, <a href="https://x.com/EugeneDaniels2/status/1815385641917501834">Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker</a>, <a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1815377959768789363">Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear</a>, <a href="https://x.com/jaredpolis/status/1815159618588553390">Colorado Gov. Jared Polis</a>, <a href="https://x.com/iamwesmoore/status/1815378012164018377">Maryland Gov. Wes Moore</a>, and <a href="https://abc11.com/post/gov-roy-cooper-endorses-kamala-harris-following-joe/15079093/">North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper</a>. Many of them are seen as her <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/362043/kamala-harris-vice-running-mate-democratic-presidential-ticket">potential vice presidential picks</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, who left the Democratic Party to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/sen-joe-manchin-leaves-democratic-party-registers-independent-rcna154885">register as an independent</a> earlier this year, seemed to briefly consider re-registering as a Democrat to run, but quickly said that he <a href="https://x.com/MacFarlaneNews/status/1815356470029869298">will not challenge Harris</a> — though he stopped short of endorsing her. </p>

</ul>
</div>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2) <strong>Does Harris get Biden’s delegates?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rules committee for the Democratic National Committee is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/biden-drops-out-election-2024/card/dnc-rules-committee-seeks-framework-to-select-new-nominee-ufoqd3hVJJ4LJ740B6m4">convening this Wednesday</a> to establish a process by which a new nominee can be selected through an open process (essentially meaning that people other than party leaders get some input into who the nominee will be). </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The fact that some states have <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2024/07/18/if-a-presidential-nominee-drops-out-what-happens-to-states-ballots/">August deadlines</a> for the nominee to make it on the ballot — including Iowa, whose deadline is August 16 —  may dictate how that process works. That means the nominee may be selected before nearly 4,000 delegates gather at the convention beginning August 19. Typically, delegates formally vote for the winner of the party’s primaries to be the official nominee at the convention — a process that recently played out at last week’s Republican National Convention. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These delegates are party loyalists — everyone from poll workers to elected officials — and are allocated to every state or territory by the party. They are pledged to the candidate who wins their state’s primary, but they can theoretically deviate from that under the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2024/07/12/biden-delegates-good-conscience-convention/76c735d2-4092-11ef-83bf-e35a32077d3e_story.html">DNC’s rules</a>, which state that they “shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden won over 3,800 of those delegates in the Democratic primary. They will now be released and allowed to vote for whichever candidate they wish. As of Monday afternoon, Harris had already secured the endorsement of <a href="https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2024/ap-dnc-delegate-survey/">1,1152</a> of the 1,986 delegates she would need to win the nomination.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3) <strong>How will DNC delegates choose a nominee to replace Biden?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">State delegations will need to decide among themselves who they will back.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, of those that have convened in the hours since Biden announced he was dropping out, many seem to be coalescing around Harris.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When elaborating on their reasoning, many delegates have cited the fact that voters in their state <a href="https://x.com/edewittNH/status/1815192248209830243">already backed the Biden-Harris ticket in the Democratic primary</a> and that she is qualified to carry the torch forward. In that sense, they see themselves as keeping the will of Democratic voters, but they are not directly soliciting new input from voters — at least not formally.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4) <strong>What happens at the Democratic National Convention?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before Biden dropped out, the DNC had <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360917/biden-trump-harris-dnc-delegates">planned a virtual roll call</a> to lock up the nomination before the convention. The DNC adopted the virtual procedure during the pandemic when the roll call — which would normally happen in person at the convention and in which delegates formally announce their votes and select their nominee — had to happen remotely.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democrats may now decide to hold a similar meeting before the convention and, if a majority of delegates support Harris, her nomination would be secured. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If not, then the matter could go to a technically open convention, which hasn’t happened since 1968. In every election since 1968, the convention has been about rallying around the nominee, rather than selecting them. But Harris has already secured the endorsements of so many delegates that it seems unlikely she would face any real competition at the convention or that an open convention would be nearly as contentious as 1968 was.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5) <strong>What is an open convention?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">An open convention simply means one in which delegates hash out who the nominee will be. That’s a process more akin to how presidents used to be picked, but one that fell out of style following a <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24034712/iowa-caucuses-history-first-gop-primary-2024">Democratic convention meltdown in 1968</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since then, the process has been: Every state has a primary, many of them fairly early in the presidential cycle, and then the convention is held to certify the will of voters through a ceremonial nomination process that energizes the party ahead of Election Day.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That can’t happen this time, but something like it might. An open convention doesn’t seem likely at this point, given how quickly Harris has rallied delegates in her favor. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, on the off chance it does happen, here’s how an open convention would work. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The big thing to know is the process would unfold with delegates voting on the convention floor for the candidate they support as the nominee.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A candidate would need a majority of the pledged delegates to win the nomination on the first ballot. If no candidate achieves this majority, then the convention would move to additional ballots, where delegates continue to vote until someone emerges as the winner.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/21/open-convention-democrats-biden-drop-out/">749 superdelegates</a>, who are high-profile party leaders ranging from members of Congress to former presidents. If they voted in a block, they could quickly help end the process by coalescing around one candidate (presumably Harris). However, they cannot vote on the first ballot at the convention. They participate in voting only if the convention goes to a second ballot or beyond.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6) <strong>What is the timeline for this process?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s up in the air for now, but the DNC’s meeting on Wednesday will be livestreamed. The rules committee is expected to lay out a timeline around then.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7) <strong>So, can Kamala Harris go ahead and campaign?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris can start campaigning immediately. Indeed, she has already hit the ground running.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She can <a href="https://www.vox.com/joe-biden/361991/361991biden-campaign-funds-after-drops-out">draw from Biden’s $240 million in campaign cash</a> because she was already on the Biden-Harris ticket. Unless they could self-fund their campaign, any other Democrat would face a steep uphill battle to counter the kind of resources currently behind Harris.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The DNC might not be able to officially support her until she secures the nomination, but that creates an imperative for the party to act quickly in deciding on a nominee. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Every so often, a true crime case comes along that seems to be a Rorschach test — where there’s so much complicated, compelling, and contradictory evidence on all sides that it becomes easy to believe what you want to believe.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s arguably the best way to describe why the case of Karen Read, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/01/us/karen-read-murder-trial.html">deadlocked</a> a “starkly divided” jury after an intense nine-week trial, has hypnotized and polarized the city of Boston, and increasingly the rest of the nation. Following Judge Beverly Cannone’s declaration of a mistrial, the prosecution immediately vowed to pursue a retrial; the second trial is <a href="https://people.com/karen-reads-new-trial-date-set-8681424">currently scheduled</a> to begin in late January 2025. That likely means heightened public interest and further entrenchment of the bitter camps in this case. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The prosecution alleges that Read, a successful finance analyst and adjunct professor who’s far from the “typical” murder suspect, killed her boyfriend, 46-year-old Boston police officer John O’Keefe, in the early, snowy morning hours of January 29, 2022. According to prosecutors, Read, who stood trial for second-degree murder and manslaughter, deliberately backed into O’Keefe with her SUV while she was intoxicated, then drove home, leaving him lying in the cold. O’Keefe <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/karen-read-trial-john-okeefe-death-what-know-rcna155905">died from</a> blunt force trauma and hypothermia. But at trial, things were anything but clear; <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-juror-unanimous-verdict-not-guilty/">reports indicate</a> the jury would have unanimously acquitted Read on charges of murder and leaving the scene, but were torn on the lesser charges, with a “soft” 9-3 split in favor of conviction for manslaughter.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Among the main pieces of evidence in the state’s favor: Read herself asking various witnesses, “Could I have hit him?” the next morning, after awakening and returning to the house to look for him.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Read, on the other hand, alleges that she’s been framed, in a spiraling conspiracy that began with a party full of witnesses lying about what happened and soon encompassed the entire Boston Police Department (BPD) and the prosecutor’s office. While from one standpoint, Read’s defense may be grasping at straws in its attempt to paint the case as a frame-up, from another, it’s the kind of police work Bostonians — and those in other cities across the country — have come to expect.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The trial has developed from what initially seemed to investigators like an open-and-shut case into a reckoning with a criminal justice system the public no longer trusts.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The murky facts of the case</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Read claims that after she and O’Keefe spent until <a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/05/10/karen-read-murder-trial-day-9-a-full-day-of-new-witnesses/">around midnight</a> drinking at a local bar, she dropped O’Keefe off to hang out at the home of retired BPD officer Brian Albert. Several people who were either members of the BPD or affiliated with the local justice system were also at the house, but no one who was there corroborates her story. Not one of them says they saw O’Keefe enter the building; instead, they all claim they had no idea O’Keefe had even arrived at the house until his body was located outside of it in the snow the next morning.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Read, however, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZvaqbbul6o">maintains</a> that she watched O’Keefe go into the house before she left the scene. She alleges that O’Keefe must have been injured inside the house, that the partygoers staged the crime scene to look like a hit-and-run, and that they have lied about it ever since. Her defense argues that the injuries O’Keefe sustained resulted from a physical fight and a dog attack from a German shepherd mix Albert owned.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The defense alleges the investigation was hindered from the start by a failure to treat the Albert house as a possible crime scene and a failure to treat the witnesses as possible persons of interest; <a href="https://apnews.com/article/karen-read-officer-death-boston-officer-testimony-298b2aa70e1b6d8b13cc556daf3b4b0c">two</a> of the primary investigative team members also have <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/karen-read-trial-day-13/3371005/">personal links</a> to the witnesses. Further undermining the police were the <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/police-red-plastic-cups-collect-204315489.html">bizarre methods</a> they used, including using leaf blowers to clear away snow (and potentially evidence) at the crime scene, and using <a href="https://www.boston25news.com/news/local/karen-read-trial-items-police-used-scene-john-okeefes-death-canton-shown-court/L7ZEE2HGAVEU5NKMINUYB6KJWQ/">solo cups and grocery bags</a> to collect evidence. Add to that a parade of unprofessional conduct and comments from officers, particularly from a lead investigator <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/canton-karen-read-case/michael-proctor-relieved-of-duty-state-police-say-after-karen-read-mistrial/3416025/">who was fired</a> immediately after the mistrial, and the case has morphed into a genuine public scandal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Throughout the investigation and the widely publicized trial, a highly vocal contingent of supporters from Boston and beyond have made Read into a true crime cause célèbre; one <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/809459493961162/">Facebook group</a> supporting her has over 50,000 members. Thanks to <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/351238/serial-true-crime-podcast-criminal-justice-adnan-syed">a decade of thriving interest in true crime</a>, trial-watchers are hyper-vigilant to potential injustices and the shortcomings of law enforcement. In the eyes of many, the case has become a referendum on corrupt cops — a subject Bostonians <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/investigations/cdl-bribery-scheme-is-one-of-several-recent-misconduct-cases-plaguing-mass-state-police/3263475/">know</a> all too well after decades of police misconduct ranging from <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/mass-state-trooper-ordered-to-falsify-records-cleared-of-wrongdoing/1959608/">cover-ups</a> to <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/ex-head-of-mass-state-police-union-gets-prison-for-fraud-racketeering/3042305/">kickbacks</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Read’s relentless conspiracy defense has been driven by incendiary star lawyer Alan Jackson, a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/la-xpm-2013-feb-06-la-me-jackson-20130207-story.html">former prosecutor</a> turned defense attorney who’s defended both <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24144453/harvey-weinstein-overturned-conviction-explained-eliza-orlins-molineaux-rule-sandoval">Harvey Weinstein</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/11/3/16602628/kevin-spacey-sexual-assault-allegations-house-of-cards">Kevin Spacey</a>. O’Keefe, the victim, has been fully overshadowed by the conversation around the case, with Read’s supporters <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-trial-aidan-kearney-turtleboy-canton-massachusetts/">allegedly</a> <a href="https://www.courttv.com/title/okeefe-family-reportedly-being-harassed-by-read-supporters/">harassing</a> his family members.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This polarization outside of the courtroom seems to have been reflected in the jury. After deliberating for less than a week, the jury tried repeatedly to declare themselves deadlocked to Judge Cannone, sending her notes to that effect. “We find ourselves deeply divided by fundamental differences in our opinions and state of mind,” a note from the day of the mistrial <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/karen-read-deadlocked-jury-note/3415285/">read</a>, citing “deeply held convictions that each of us carry, ultimately leading to a point where consensus is unattainable.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A deadlocked or hung jury results in a mistrial, after which the prosecution has to decide whether to retry the case. In this case, the prosecution seems intent on a retrial — despite the many, many problems with their arguments.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">The prosecution’s case is a circumstantial mess</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite presenting over 70 witnesses at trial, the prosecution’s primary evidence against Read remains largely circumstantial — meaning there’s very little direct or physical evidence backing their theory of what happened — and Read’s defense has offered up alternative theories for much of it. The timeline of the evening goes like this: After leaving a bar in Canton, Massachusetts, Read — whose blood alcohol content was likely <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-live-stream-today-brian-higgins/">over</a> the legal limit — drove O’Keefe to Albert’s house. There, she either saw him safely inside or backed over him in the snow. In either event, she left the scene and drove home.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Afterward, she left him an <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-trial-live-stream-today-day-27/">angry voicemail</a> declaring, “John, I fucking hate you.” Throughout the night, <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/crime/2024/06/20/karen-read-murder-trial-livestream-video-thursday-june-20/">Read called</a> O’Keefe and numerous other people. Early the next morning, she met up with two friends, including major prosecution witness Jennifer McCabe, who is also Albert’s sister-in-law, and drove back to Albert’s house, where they discovered O’Keefe in the snow. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-live-stream-today-brian-higgins/">According to witnesses</a>, Read repeatedly asked whether O’Keefe could have been hit by a snow plow, or whether she could have hit him. Multiple first responders <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-live-stream-today-massachusetts-murder-trial/">also testified</a> to hearing Read repeatedly exclaiming that she hit him, though none of them <a href="https://www.boston25news.com/news/local/court-video-updates-karen-read-murder-trial-continues-with-more-first-responder-testimony/CINVO2VGPJCVDF6JDAPI3VJ6PU/">noted this</a> in their <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/canton-karen-read-case/karen-read-trial-day-2-witness-testimony-continues/3354128/">initial reports</a> from the scene.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This alleged repeated refrain of, “Could I have hit him?” and “I hit him,” was one the prosecution <a href="https://www.wcvb.com/article/i-hit-him-prosecution-quotes-testimony-in-closing-argument-for-karen-read-case/61367569">leaned on heavily</a> as an argument for guilt. However, per witness accounts, Read also appeared to have no clear idea what had happened to O’Keefe.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What concrete evidence the prosecution did offer was hotly contested inside as well as outside the courtroom. One crucial piece: a broken taillight. An investigator who interviewed Read at her parents&#8217; house that night <a href="https://www.thesunchronicle.com/news/local_news/state-police-lead-investigator-testifies-about-taillight-pieces-texts-at-karen-read-murder-trial/article_58683bd5-8ca1-55fc-9dcc-42da220c3228.html">reported</a> seeing “some damage” to the right rear light of Read’s SUV; he testified that it was allegedly “cracked and a piece was missing.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nearly three weeks after O’Keefe’s death, the state’s lead investigator, Michael Proctor, <a href="https://www.courttv.com/title/scientist-compares-plastic-tail-light-pieces-in-karen-read-trial/">allegedly located</a> more fragments of a tail light at the crime scene and transported the evidence to the crime lab. <a href="https://www.thesunchronicle.com/news/local_news/state-police-lead-investigator-testifies-about-taillight-pieces-texts-at-karen-read-murder-trial/article_58683bd5-8ca1-55fc-9dcc-42da220c3228.html">Prosecutors say</a> they found minute traces of O’Keefe’s DNA on those fragments, as well as tiny particles from the tail light on some of O’Keefe’s clothes. Yet the defense hammered home the enormous delay in locating what would have been an incredibly significant piece of evidence, as well as the unreliability of evidence suddenly unearthed by Proctor.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s because Proctor has multiple personal ties to both the victim and the witnesses. In texts he sent a day after the investigation began, he used a <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/karen-read-trial-michael-proctor-texts/3395222/">misogynistic slur</a> to refer to Read, made it clear he thought Read’s guilt was obvious from the beginning, and even <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-murder-trial-live-stream-michael-proctor/">texted</a> his sister that he hoped Read would kill herself. The defense alleges Proctor helped frame Read for the murder, deliberately damaging her tail light in order to claim the damage was caused when she hit O’Keefe with her car. In fact, <a href="https://www.wcvb.com/article/karen-read-trial-mirrored-video-evidence-impact/61041808">a mysteriously altered video</a> of Read’s car that purportedly showed the damage made it all the way to trial before the defense pointed out that the image was misleadingly reversed — a “mirror” video with the tail light in question inverted from its actual position.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It doesn’t help any of these optics that Proctor’s sister <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/karen-read-trial-michael-proctor-texts/3395222/">texted him</a> that Albert’s wife Julie wanted to send Proctor “a gift” after the investigation was over. Proctor protested on the stand that none of these texts impacted the integrity of the police investigation, but given Monday’s mistrial, some jurors may have disagreed with him. They evidently weren’t alone: State police announced that they had <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/canton-karen-read-case/michael-proctor-relieved-of-duty-state-police-say-after-karen-read-mistrial/3416025/">fired Proctor</a> immediately after the mistrial based on “information about serious misconduct [that] emerged in testimony” — an <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/10/19/21523030/police-unions-misconduct-accountability-brutality-massachusetts-reform-violence">extraordinarily rare move</a> on their part.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other facts of the case that on their surface might have supported the prosecution proved murkier on closer inspection. O’Keefe died of blunt-force trauma from a skull fracture and hypothermia, according to the medical examiner. He also had <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/06/19/metro/karen-read-trial-what-does-the-forensic-evidence-say/">gashes on his arms</a> that seemed unlikely to have been made from a car impact. The defense alleged these resulted from a dog attack on O’Keefe inside the house. O’Keefe also <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/karen-reads-boyfriend-john-okeefe-had-no-broken-bones-doctor-reveals">lacked</a> many of the injuries you’d expect to see from a car impact, such as broken bones or significant bruises.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The prosecution’s witnesses are also controversial. In addition to Read&#8217;s former friend McCabe, who had ties to both O’Keefe and the Alberts, the party attendees included several people that Read’s defense argued should have been investigated by police before taking the stand. Among them: Brian Higgins, a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agent who’d been <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/crime/2024/05/24/karen-read-trial-brian-higgins-flirty-texts-kiss/">sporadically flirting</a> with Read in the lead-up to O’Keefe’s death, and Albert’s son Colin, who as a teenager had made <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-live-stream-today-murder-trial-day-13/">violent threats against other teens</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many of the witnesses who were at the party, including McCabe and the Alberts, exchanged a litany of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-irresolvable-tragedy-of-the-karen-read-case">phone calls to one another</a> throughout the time O’Keefe supposedly lay on the lawn, per phone records. Several later <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/why-so-many-butt-dials-who-called-who-and-when-in-the-karen-read-case/3384232/">testified</a> that the calls were “butt dials,” placed randomly and by complete mistake. As circumstances go, it’s eyebrow-raising, to say the least.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">The defense’s evidence is equally unreliable</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite all the problems with the prosecution’s case, the strongest evidence for the defense is likewise fully debatable. One of the defense’s key witnesses was a veteran snowplow driver who made multiple trips past the Alberts’ house during the time O’Keefe was allegedly wounded in the snow, yet <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-trial-live-stream-today-day-28/">claimed</a> he saw no body lying anywhere on the lawn. However, snow impedes visibility, even with a bright snowplow light, and <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-the-eyes-have-it/">eyewitness testimony</a> is notoriously unreliable.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another piece of crucial evidence that many Read supporters consider a “smoking gun” for the defense has also been fully debunked by prosecution analysts. At issue: <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-live-stream-today-day-16-jennifer-mccabe/">Two searches</a> McCabe made on her cellphone at some point during the early morning hours surrounding O’Keefe’s death, including a misspelled query, “Hos long to die in cold.” The prosecution claims, and McCabe testified, that she made the searches around six in the morning when she and Read found O’Keefe lying in the snow. The official cellphone records for the search, however, show the <a href="https://x.com/bostonherald/status/1793566054066569408">timestamp</a> for the search at 2:27 am.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The implication is that if McCabe searched for this then, she was part of a conspiracy to stage the scene and frame Read. But McCabe claims she merely opened that tab on her phone browser at 2:27 am, left it open, and searched the phrase hours later, after she and Read found him together. Multiple data analysts for the prosecution <a href="https://whdh.com/news/state-police-troopers-digital-forensic-expert-testify-as-karen-read-murder-trial-continues/">corroborated</a> this interpretation of the cellphone data. Still, the defense scored a point in their favor by <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/crime/2024/06/21/karen-read-murder-trial-livestream-video-friday-june-21/">noting</a> that their expert witness, who argued the search occurred at 2:27, arrived at his conclusion by using a method developed by one of the prosecution’s witnesses.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other findings that leaned toward the defense included O’Keefe’s fitness tracker app, which showed him taking about 80 steps around the time Reed claimed she dropped him off. Yet here again, nothing about the timeline or O’Keefe’s activity is clear or corroborated by witnesses. The defense’s argument that O’Keefe was attacked inside the house, including by the family dog, is also speculative and unsupported by much evidence — which they claim is because the police never properly investigated. A medical expert <a href="https://www.boston25news.com/news/local/karen-read-trial-will-judge-allow-testimony-doctor-who-believes-okeefe-was-attacked-by-dog/67PPY2IWJ5DZTMVTK46CLMGEOE/">testified</a> on the stand in support of the dog bite theory, but forensic bite mark evidence is incredibly unreliable and has been more or less <a href="https://www.todaysrdh.com/the-unreliability-of-bitemark-evidence-implications-for-forensic-odontology-in-legal-proceedings/">fully debunked</a>, at least in cases involving humans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So where does all of this leave us?&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Corruption at the core</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ironically, outrage for the police’s conduct in this case has united Bostonians across political lines, with <a href="https://www.masslive.com/news/2024/04/as-jurors-are-empaneled-at-karen-reads-trial-her-supporters-gather-at-a-distance.html">community activists</a> joining the likes of local conservative pundit <a href="https://wrko.iheart.com/featured/the-howie-carr-show/content/2024-06-20-1270-the-howie-carr-radio-netw-meatball-morrisseys-revenge-messages-against/">Howie Carr</a>. Meanwhile, hundreds of Read supporters traveled from <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/free-karen-read-supporters-murder-trial-dedham-court/">across the country</a> to protest for her freedom outside the courthouse. They sometimes clashed with O’Keefe’s family and their&nbsp;supporters, who <a href="https://www.wcvb.com/article/tensions-run-high-outside-courthouse-as-jury-deliberates-karen-read-case/61456283">argue</a> Read’s defense has turned a clear case of murder into a distorted media circus and fueled unfounded accusations of conspiracy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The mistrial means that the narrative of the case has also expanded.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the one hand, popular resistance to the idea that a successful, articulate white woman could commit such a brutal murder might be fueling a good deal of the support for Read — which speaks to lots of assumptions about how we view class, privilege, and who gets to be seen as a victim. We’re accustomed, after all, to seeing women like Read in the role of the victim,&nbsp;no matter that she is the one on trial here. When it comes to true crime, the media <a href="https://jgrj.law.uiowa.edu/sites/jgrj.law.uiowa.edu/files/2022-11/True%20Crime%20and%20Danger%20Narratives-%20Reflections%20on%20Stories%20of%20Violence%2C%20Race%2C%20and%20%28In%29justice%20.pdf">gives more attention</a> and sympathy to attractive middle-class white women than it does to male victims, much less victims who are poor or people of color.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the other hand, Boston police are famously corrupt, with a long history of <a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/1986/1027/abos.html">bribery</a>, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/retired-boston-police-captain-found-guilty-overtime-fraud-scheme">fraud</a>, and <a href="https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2022-03-16/reforming-the-boston-police-has-been-a-hard-fought-uphill-series-of-battles-over-the-last-50-years">racial bias</a>. The Read case is being compared to another possible homicide involving a <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/06/24/metro/sandra-birchmore-death-stoughton/">horrifying allegation</a> of police conspiracy in nearby Stoughton, but this isn&#8217;t just a regional issue. American cities are frequently <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/7/26/9036859/compstat-police-corruption">beset</a> by <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/8/4/23820288/six-former-mississippi-police-offers-plead-guilty-assault">actual</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/2/16961146/baltimore-gun-trace-task-force-trial">proven</a> police <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/7/7/21293259/police-racism-violence-ideology-george-floyd">corruption</a>. Boston isn’t unique. What does feel unique is the amount of public attention and scrutiny being given to the role of potential corruption in such a high-profile trial. It all adds up to what may well be a hopelessly irreconcilable pursuit of truth.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It started with a coconut tree. Sorry — actually it starts with the context of what came before.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re an active internet denizen, you might already know what I’m referencing: a viral clip of Vice President Kamala Harris delivering a speech while repeating a question that she says her mother often posed to her: “‘You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But if you’re fortunate enough not to live online, this is your guide to catching up on all the Kamala Harris memes. Many have been percolating for months (or even longer). Now that President Joe Biden has announced he will <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361827/biden-drops-out-2024-kamala-convention">step off the Democratic ticket</a> and endorse Harris as his preferred presidential nominee, the memes are everywhere.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The coconut line is more than a year old: from a swearing-in ceremony that Harris led in May 2023 in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. But it’s also a stand-in for how the vice president is often perceived in pop culture, in mainstream media, and online: as a bit of a punchline, someone lacking serious power and with a perplexing political track record, and as the closest we’ll get to recreating Julia Louis-Dreyfus’s character in HBO’s <em>Veep.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Call it ironic or unironic #<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/7/25/20697783/khive-twitter-kamala-harris-2020-candidate-doug-hive">KHive</a> posting, being “Kamalapilled” or “coconutpilled,” or simply feeling “unburdened” (I’ll get to that in a second). The surge in Harris memes after Biden&#8217;s <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357746/biden-trump-debate-democrats-replace-dnc">disastrous debate</a> performance was<strong> </strong>a symptom of the angst and uncertainty many Americans were feeling as the country and the Democratic Party navigated yet another crisis. Now, it appears to be a more earnest excitement and bewilderment by the internet&#8217;s denizens as the Democratic Party moves to nominate the first woman of color to be a major party presidential nominee.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, to guide you through this discourse, I’ve rounded up a few of the most popular memes, starting with the foundational one.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>“Coconut trees” and the context of what came before</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When the vice president referred to her mom’s question about falling out of a coconut tree, she was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JWR29RT5sw">recounting a lesson</a> about the importance of history. Speaking to government appointees who would work on economic and education equity for Hispanic Americans, she emphasized that their task would be to aid not only young people, but also their parents, grandparents, teachers, and communities, “because none of us just live in a silo. Everything is in context.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And she <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/05/10/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-at-swearing-in-ceremony-of-commissioners-for-the-white-house-initiative-on-advancing-educational-equity-excellence-and-economic-opportunity-for-hispanics/">continued</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">“My mother used to — she would give us a hard time sometimes, and she would say to us, ‘I don’t know what’s wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?’&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, the takeaway is clear enough, something that’s been said for centuries: No person is an island.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it was her delivery that turned it into a meme: in a joking voice, with exaggerated hand and arm gestures, and with a signature Kamala Harris laugh.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the time, social media users and right-wing accounts <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/fell-out-of-a-coconut-tree">accused</a> her of behaving strangely: “Obviously drunk,” one <a href="https://x.com/Rifleman4WVU/status/1656441274906320896">viral tweet</a> said, while others used clips of the speech to describe being intoxicated or inebriated (which itself is <a href="https://twitter.com/slimjosa/status/1808303666203697643">another Harris meme</a>).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Being “unburdened by what has been”</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Around the time of the most recent return of the coconut tree clip, another of Harris’s quotes began to circulate: not a memorable one-off, but a catchphrase she uses over and over.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It was a <a href="https://x.com/KamalaHarris/status/1310607188566724610">go-to line</a> during her 2020 presidential primary campaign and into the general election as Biden’s running mate: “What can be, unburdened by what has been.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And thanks to a <a href="https://x.com/RNCResearch/status/1736468129528602811">Republican Party supercut</a> of all the times Harris has used the phrase in speeches, interviews, and appearances, the phrase went viral again. “Four straight minutes of ‘what can be, unburdened by what has been.’ It’s incredible. I had no idea she used it this much,” one Republican staffer <a href="https://x.com/thejcoop/status/1806867772988625316">said</a> as he reshared the clip in the aftermath of the first presidential debate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The literal meaning of this catchphrase varies from speech to speech, but it’s often used in the context of Harris’s trailblazing career, marking historic firsts as a woman of color in elected office and carrying the weight of history, or as a call to arms to dream bigger and leave the past behind.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a way, this quote contradicts Harris’s coconut tree line. As one <a href="https://x.com/Sturgeons_Law/status/1807513289330450566">X user</a> put it: “How are you supposed to exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you AND be, unburdened by what has been at the same time? Waiting for her 3rd great revelation that synthesizes these two.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The “significance of the passage of time”</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Speaking at an <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?518860-1/vice-president-harris-remarks-affordable-broadband-access">event in Louisiana</a> to announce millions of dollars in funding for broadband access, Harris referenced touring a library and reflected on historical inequities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We were talking about the significance of the passage of time, right? The significance of the passage of time. When you think about it, there is a great significance in the passage of time in terms of what we need to do to lay these wires.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She repeated the phrase a few more times, as noted in a clip widely <a href="https://x.com/EndWokeness/status/1808533077271990424">shared online</a>, and especially by right-wing users in the last few days.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The wheels on the bus </strong><strong><em>do</em></strong><strong> go round and round</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When seeing her campaign tour bus for the first time in 2019 during the Democratic presidential primaries, another video of Harris being a little awkward was shared on social media.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As the camera pans 180 degrees around her, she walks across a lawn and onto the bus as she giggles and sings “the wheels on the bus go round and round,” slightly <a href="https://x.com/drmistercody/status/1808229682825122190">off-key</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">The vice president does impressions</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More recently, clips of Harris showing another kind of less polished persona have also reappeared online: one from the ceremonial swearing-in of senators in January 2023, when <a href="https://x.com/_natemorris/status/1610652197968089088">Harris imitates</a> Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet’s deep booming voice, and another from 2019, when she <a href="https://x.com/GraduatedBen/status/1808276737005916267">imitates</a> her husband’s parents’ voices <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtAPOKDV-nY">during an interview</a> at the 92<sup>nd</sup> Street Y in New York City.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>There are plenty more</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You might remember other classic Harris deliveries — or you might be encountering them for the first time:&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/we-did-it-joe">“We did it, Joe.”</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://x.com/findareaction/status/1588718308060168193">“I love Venn diagrams.”</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://x.com/TheMemesArchive/status/1557191149424713728">“I love good news.”</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How she <a href="https://x.com/CapehartJ/status/1595526310335586305">seasons a turkey</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://x.com/SirajAHashmi/status/1794818668200608070">“Do not come.”</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris’s stint as vice president has often been pretty unremarkable, but it has provided a rich vein of memes, in part because she can be an awkward communicator.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s part of what fueled critical media coverage of her during the first year of her tenure, and which led the White House to largely sideline her during the first half of the Biden presidency.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other Kamala memes are rooted in the hokey nature of a lot of modern political speech: derived from aphorisms and pseudo-philosophical diction in the hope of echoing something like former President Barack Obama’s oratory.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As the first female, Black, and South Asian vice president, Harris was always doomed to receive an extraordinary amount of scrutiny and bias — and emphasized her persona as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuEZcAgOQs0">“joyful warrior”</a> in part to combat some of those stereotypes. The joyful warrior, it seems, is sometimes a goofy one too. Harris delivers many of these lines in a genuinely funny way, with an affect unlike many politicians (described sometimes as just <a href="https://x.com/Chelsea_Fagan/status/1591478294444400640">vibing</a> along).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, all this talk about being KHive pilled, or coconutpilled<strong>,</strong> especially from people who were skeptical or critical of the vice president just a few weeks ago<strong> </strong>speaks to the uncertainty of this moment. Plenty of people were wondering whether Biden would still be the Democratic nominee by the end of the summer. They’re meme-ing their way to a new celebration of Harris — unburdened by what has been. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Just a few hours before President Joe Biden announced that he will not seek a second term in the White House, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/21/biden-johnson-2024-elections-laws-00169973">threatened lawsuits</a> to try to force Biden to appear as the Democratic candidate on at least some state ballots.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Every state has its own system,” Johnson told ABC News, “and in some of these, it’s not possible to simply just switch out a candidate.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a system governed by the rule of law, Johnson’s threats are empty. Though Biden was the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee until he decided to withdraw from the race, he would not legally have become the Democratic nominee until he was formally nominated by delegates to the party’s convention, which is <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/21/when-is-dnc-convention-chicago-2024/74491378007/">scheduled to begin August 19</a>. So there’s no need to “switch out” Biden for another candidate because Biden was never formally on any state’s 2024 ballot.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, the world we live in is post-<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf"><em>Trump v. United States</em></a><em> </em>(2024), the Supreme Court decision holding that former President Donald Trump is immune from prosecution for any crimes he committed using his official authority as president. That decision had <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/359206/supreme-court-incompetent-abortion-trump-immunity">no more basis in law</a> than a decision forcing Democrats to run Biden for president would have. So the possibility that a GOP-controlled Supreme Court will make up some reason to sabotage Democrats’ chances of holding the White House cannot be entirely ruled out.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Court would struggle to justify such sabotage, in part because its own decisions benefiting Trump undercut the kind of lawsuits envisioned by Johnson. The Supreme Court’s recent decision in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-719_19m2.pdf"><em>Trump v. Anderson</em></a> (2024), which reversed Colorado’s attempt to remove Republican Donald Trump from the 2024 ballot because of Trump’s role in the January 6 insurrection, also cuts against allowing any state to overrule the Democratic Party’s choice of candidate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Anderson</em> relied heavily on <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/514/779/"><em>US Term Limits v. Thornton</em></a> (1995), which held that “powers over the election of federal officers had to be delegated to, rather than reserved by, the States.” That means that, even if a state wanted to remove the Democratic presidential nominee (who will almost certainly be Vice President Kamala Harris) from the ballot and replace her with Biden, it would have to point to a federal constitutional provision or law permitting it to do so.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>State laws generally do not prevent Democrats from putting Harris on the ballot instead of Biden</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though Speaker Johnson did not identify which state laws might prevent Democrats from nominating Harris instead of Biden as their presidential candidate, the Heritage Foundation, a far-right think tank closely aligned with the GOP, published a memo claiming that three states — <a href="https://x.com/OversightPR/status/1805239354505257196">Georgia, Nevada, and Wisconsin</a> — may have laws that will frustrate the Democratic Party’s transition from Biden to Harris.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But none of these states’ laws should be read to prevent Harris from appearing as the Democratic Party’s nominee on the 2024 ballot.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Georgia law does require some presidential candidates to file a “notice of candidacy” in early July, but that same law <a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2022/title-21/chapter-2/article-4/part-1/section-21-2-132/">exempts the nominees of political parties</a> that held “a national convention and therein nominated candidates for President and Vice President of the United States.” In case there is any uncertainty about what the Georgia law means, Gabriel Sterling, a high-ranking state elections official, confirmed on X (formerly known as Twitter) Monday morning that <a href="https://x.com/GabrielSterling/status/1815370759985856541">whoever Democrats choose at their August convention</a> will appear on the Georgia ballot.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similarly, in Nevada, regulations promulgated by the secretary of state’s office provide that “each major political party must provide the names of the party’s respective candidates for president and vice president of the United States to the secretary of state by <a href="https://www.nvsos.gov/sos/home/showpublisheddocument/13075/638446205331930000">not later than 5 pm on the first business day of September</a> of the year of a presidential election.” The first business day of September has not happened yet.</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race. Catch up on this story.</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">President Joe Biden surrendered to pressure from top Democrats and campaign donors who urged him to step aside amid concerns over his age and low polling numbers against Donald Trump.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/358559/biden-harris-whitmer-newsom-shapiro-buttigieg-alternative-nomination-candidate-2024">Do other Democrats actually poll better against Trump than Biden?</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.vox.com/joe-biden/361991/361991biden-campaign-funds-after-drops-out">What happens to Biden’s campaign cash?</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357955/biden-age-democrats-nominee-kamala-harris">How did Democrats get here?</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/358084/biden-drop-out-lbj-harry-truman">What can we learn from incumbents who stepped aside</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/362062/biden-drop-out-republicans-accuse-democrats-coup">Why Republicans are accusing Democrats of a &#8220;coup&#8221;</a></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wisconsin law, meanwhile, provides that “nominees chosen at a national convention” must be certified “<a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/8/16/7#:~:text=The%20state%20or%20national%20chairperson,(2)%20(a).">no later than 5 pm on the first Tuesday in September preceding a presidential election</a>.” So, much like in Georgia and Nevada, Biden was never certified as the Democratic Party’s 2024 nominee, and the party has plenty of time to choose a different candidate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So that should be the ball game. In all three states flagged by Heritage, major party presidential nominees are determined after each party’s convention takes place. So there is no need to switch the Democratic Party’s nominee from Biden to Harris because Biden never formally became the Democratic nominee.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, there is one possible vehicle the Supreme Court could use to sabotage Harris. The normal rule is that state Supreme Courts have the final word on all questions of state law, so the US Supreme Court should play no role in deciding which candidate qualifies for each state’s ballot. In <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-1271_3f14.pdf"><em>Moore v. Harper</em></a> (2023), however, the Supreme Court said that it could overrule a state court’s interpretation of a state election law if a majority of the justices thought that the state court’s decision “<a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/6/27/23775378/supreme-court-moore-harper-john-roberts-independent-state-legislature-north-carolina-bush-gore">exceed[s] the bounds of ordinary judicial review</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Court, however, has never actually invoked this self-given power, and it’s unclear how the justices would defend a decision overruling state law.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Republican lower court judges could wreak havoc before the Supreme Court weighs in</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One risk Democrats should be prepared for is that a lower court judge closely aligned with the Republican Party might issue a court order forcing Biden’s name back on the ballot. It’s far from clear what the legal basis of such a decision would be, but there are judges — think of figures like <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/12/17/23512766/supreme-court-matthew-kacsmaryk-judge-trump-abortion-immigration-birth-control">Christian Right crusader Matthew Kacsmaryk</a> or Aileen Cannon, the trial judge who has <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/6/13/23757893/aileen-cannon-donald-trump-jack-smith-indictment-mar-a-lago-maga">behaved like a member of Trump’s criminal defense team</a> — who’ve shown an extraordinary willingness to bend the law to achieve Republican goals.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also trivially easy for Republicans to bring a lawsuit before a friendly judge. Any lawsuit filed in Amarillo, Texas, for example, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/5/24/23725897/abortion-planned-parenthood-matthew-kacsmaryk-supreme-court-medical-progress-medicaid">automatically lands in Kacsmaryk’s courtroom</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Would the Supreme Court affirm a decision by someone like Kacsmaryk or Cannon which sought to rig the 2024 election for Donald Trump? Again, such a decision would require an unusual amount of cynicism by the justices, even by the standards of this unusually cynical Supreme Court.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even if everything works out for the Democratic Party in the end, Democrats should at least be ready for a Trump-aligned judge to temporarily throw the election into chaos.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Historically, vice presidents have been selected to complement the main candidate. Biden chose Harris because she would bring youth, diversity, and legal experience.

<p class="has-text-align-none">What might Harris look for? Based on that history, there are a few guesses: Her pick could be someone from a purple or red state, who offers geographic diversity given her roots in California. And — to assuage voters who still hold sexist or racist attitudes, as President Barack Obama did with Biden in 2008 — it might be a white man.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Below is a rundown of some of the possible candidates who might be considered — and what they’d bring to the ticket.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/gettyimages-2159037882_26f6dd.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Gov. Roy Cooper, in a navy suit, speaks from a podium to a large crowd holding Biden-Harris campaign signs." title="Gov.

Roy Cooper speaks before President Joe Biden at a post-debate campaign rally on June 28, in Raleigh, North Carolina. | Allison Joyce/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Allison Joyce/Getty Images" />
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Gov. Roy Cooper</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Cooper, 67, is the governor of North Carolina, a battleground state that Trump won narrowly in 2020 and 2016 that offers <a href="https://www.ncsbe.gov/about-elections/electoral-college">16 electoral votes</a> (of the 270 needed to win). He’s known for winning repeatedly statewide even as other Democratic candidates have struggled to do the same for roles like the Senate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As governor, he’s also vetoed Republican bills on abortion and guns, and has strong approval <a href="https://abc11.com/post/2024-elections-could-governor-roy-cooper-replace-president/15011995/">ratings overall</a>. Prior to becoming governor, he served as the state’s attorney general and in the state legislature.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Cooper could help improve Democrats’ chances in a battleground state, though it will still likely be an uphill battle given past contests in North Carolina. He’s also been pretty popular in his role, and has secured backing from some moderates and Republicans.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He previously collaborated with Harris while they each served as their states’ AG, meaning they have experience working alongside one another. And more recently, Harris and Cooper <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsVNTI1BqZo">have campaigned together</a> in the wake of <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357788/biden-trump-debate-winners-losers">Biden’s disastrous June debate</a>, during which the governor cautioned against the return of “Donald Trump’s America.”</p>

Josh Shapiro arrives to deliver remarks at a building trades union conference on April 24, in Washington, DC. | Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images" />
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Gov. Josh Shapiro</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Shapiro, 51, is the governor of Pennsylvania, another likely battleground state (with <a href="https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/allocation">19 Electoral College votes</a>), which Biden won in 2020 and which former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton lost in 2016.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He was elected in 2022, the same year that freshman Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) was elected to the Senate. Shapiro ran far ahead of Fetterman, <a href="https://www.politico.com/2022-election/results/pennsylvania/">winning 57 percent of the vote, to Fetterman’s 51 percent</a>. Shapiro has established himself as a moderate who helped negotiate bipartisan deals when he was in the state legislature, and is also known for his work as attorney general, when he secured settlements for victims of sexual abuse by the Catholic Diocese. He’s also been a vocal supporter of Israel amid the country’s devastating military offensive in Gaza, following Hamas’ brutal October 7 attack.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him?</strong> Like Cooper, he’s the popular Democratic governor of a swing state and could help the party improve their chances there. He’s also seen as more of a centrist who could appeal to moderate voters and independents, though his staunch backing of Israel could turn away progressive Democrats.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/gettyimages-2161807297_5538e2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Gov.

Andy Beshear speaks to reporters following a ribbon-cutting ceremony in Hazel, Kentucky, in October 2023. | Lexington Herald-Leader/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Lexington Herald-Leader/Getty Images" />
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Gov. Andy Beshear</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Beshear, 46, is the governor of Kentucky and <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/11/7/23950792/election-day-2023-kentucky-governors-race-results-democrats-republicans">has won twice in a red state that previously overwhelmingly voted for Trump</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As governor, he’s been praised for his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic as well as multiple crises in the state, including <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/4/11/23679512/louisville-kentucky-shooting-workplace">a mass shooting at a bank</a> and severe flooding. Prior to this role, he also served as Kentucky’s attorney general.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Beshear is the rare Democrat who has been able to win multiple times in a red state and could offer additional appeal to some swing voters. In addition to the support he’s received for his leadership during various crises, he’s also touted infrastructure and private sector investment in the state during his tenure.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unlike other possibilities, though, he probably wouldn’t increase Harris’s chances of winning his home state, which is solidly GOP.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-2160763179.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Gov. J.B.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Gov. J.B. Pritzker</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he? </strong>J.B. Pritzker, 59, is the governor of Illinois, a Democratic state that Biden and Clinton both won in 2020 and 2016. Before becoming governor, he was a businessman and philanthropist, and is a scion of the family behind Hyatt hotels, who’ve also been consistent and influential Democratic donors.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As governor, Pritzker has established a modest national profile, including remarks he’s given attacking Trump and calls he’s made for more federal resources to address immigration in Illinois.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Pritzker has already built some name recognition as a fixture on cable news, and has proven to be a vocal Trump antagonist. Pritzker’s personal wealth could also potentially be a boon to the campaign, though his own state is not a battleground that would expand the Democratic map.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-2160744008_a0c39e.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Sen.

Mark Kelly (D-AZ) is questioned about the candidacy of President Joe Biden after a Senate luncheon on July 9. | Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images" />
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Sen. Mark Kelly</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Kelly is the junior senator of Arizona — a swing state with <a href="https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/allocation">11 Electoral College votes</a> — <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/11/5/21537670/senate-2020-results-arizona-mark-kelly-winner">who was elected in 2020</a> by framing himself as a candidate willing to work across the aisle. Previously, Biden won Arizona in 2020, while Clinton lost the state in 2016. Kelly is also known for his career as an astronaut alongside his twin brother Scott Kelly, and as the husband of gun control advocate and former US Rep. Gabby Giffords.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Kelly has a higher profile than some of the other names on this list, and is respected both for his scientific expertise and contributions as an astronaut in addition to his time in the Senate. He’s been a prominent gun control advocate alongside Giffords and made pushing these policies a priority.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given his efforts to appeal to both Republicans and independents in Arizona, he’d be another option who could help with trying to reach those voters. Arizona also continues to be an important battleground this time around, including in its <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings">Senate race</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-1394802139.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Pete Buttigieg, in a navy suit and white shirt, is shown from the side, while pinning an index card onto a wall full of similar cards with handwritten notes.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Secretary Pete Buttigieg</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he?</strong> Buttigieg, 42, is the secretary of transportation who rose to prominence as a former 2020 presidential candidate. He’s staked out more moderate positions and was previously mayor of South Bend, Indiana.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He’s become known for his media savvy and strong television appearances as an advocate for the Biden-Harris administration. He’s also had to respond to crises including the train accident and <a href="https://www.vox.com/science/2023/2/18/23603471/east-palestine-ohio-derailment-water-contamination-health">chemical spill in East Palestine</a>, Ohio, as well as the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024/1/8/24030677/boeing-alaska-airlines-plane-737-max-door-plug">Alaska Airlines mishap</a> when a door plug dropped out of a plane.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Buttigieg has been a strong spokesperson for the Biden-Harris White House and is well-established among the Democratic electorate. He’s among the youngest of possible choices, would contribute more representation from the Midwest,<strong> </strong>and could appeal to centrist voters. He’d also become the first openly LGBTQ person to be on a presidential ticket.&nbsp;</p>

Gavin Newsom speaks during a press conference in Oakland, California, on July 11. | Stephen Lam/San Francisco Chronicle/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Stephen Lam/San Francisco Chronicle/Getty Images" />
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Gov. Gavin Newsom</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Newsom, 56, is the governor of California, and a longstanding political personality. He’s been a vocal advocate for more progressive policies, and for Democrats to more directly confront Republicans.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Prior to being governor, he was also lieutenant governor and mayor of San Francisco.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Newsom has already made clear that he wants to be a fighter for Democrats and has supporters who are interested in his approach. He’s also used opportunities like a debate against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to make some splashy points for the party and to get more attention, and could do the same for a possible campaign.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As governor of California, however, he wouldn’t bring additional geographic diversity to the ticket, and he also wouldn’t help with delivering a swing state, as his own is solidly Democratic.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Out of the running</h2>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-1247112367.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Gov.

Gretchen Whitmer speaks at a press conference about an electric-vehicle battery plant in February 2023 in Romulus, Michigan. | Bill Pugliano/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Bill Pugliano/Getty Images" />
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Gov. Gretchen Whitmer</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is she? </strong>Whitmer, 52, is the governor of Michigan, a key swing state with <a href="https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/allocation">15 Electoral College votes</a> that Biden won in 2020 and that Clinton lost in 2016.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She’s been a popular leader in this role, and was initially known for how much she emphasized infrastructure and “fixing the damn roads.” Since then she’s been an outspoken advocate for abortion rights and for gender equity, speaking openly about how she was sexually assaulted in college. Prior to being governor, Whitmer was a member of the state legislature and the first woman to become the Democratic leader of the state Senate. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What was the case for her? </strong>She’s among the members of the list who have strong and positive national recognition, and who could help raise Democrats’ chances in a pivotal swing state. Whitmer has also focused on issues including infrastructure and health care, which could broaden Democrats’ appeal to moderate voters. And if Harris and Whitmer were on the same ticket, they would form a groundbreaking all-woman ticket — something that neither major party has run before.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Why she won&#8217;t be the new VP:</strong> Less than 24 hours after Biden endorsed Harris, Whitmer emphatically told reporters that she has no desire to be vice president. “I’m not planning to go anywhere,” <a href="https://x.com/kenvogel/status/1815417822056755621">she said, adding</a>, “I am not leaving Michigan; I&#8217;m proud to be the governor of Michigan.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Update, July 22, 2024, 12:58 pm ET:</em></strong> <em>This piece was originally published on July 21 and has been updated to include Gov. Whitmer’s remarks on her unwillingness to serve as vice president.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Correction, July 21, 2024, 11:59 pm ET: </strong>A previous version of this story misstated Gabby Giffords’s position on guns. She is a gun control advocate.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After weeks of intense media speculation and sustained pressure from Democratic lawmakers, major donors, and senior advisers, President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/21/us/biden-withdraw-letter.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has announced</a> that he is bowing out of the presidential race. He is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/07/21/us/biden-drops-out-election" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first sitting president to step aside so close to Election Day</a>. “I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus entirely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,” Biden said in a letter on Sunday. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris, to take his place. “Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year,”&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/JoeBiden/status/1815087772216303933" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">he said</a>&nbsp;in another statement. Not long after, Harris announced via the Biden campaign that she intends to run for president. “I am honored to have the president’s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/21/kamala-harris-running-for-president-00170067" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">she said</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During his term, President Biden managed to shepherd a surprising number of major policies into law with a razor-thin Democratic majority in the Senate. His crowning achievement is signing the <a href="https://grist.org/politics/one-year-in-the-inflation-reduction-act-is-working-kind-of/">Inflation Reduction Act</a>, or IRA — the biggest climate spending law in US history, with the potential to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions up to 42 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. In announcing his withdrawal, Biden called it “the most significant climate legislation in the history of the world.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite his legislative successes, the 81-year-old Democrat couldn’t weather widespread blowback following a debate performance in June in which he appeared frail and struck many in his party as ill-equipped to lead the country for another four years. He will leave office with a portion of his <a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/biden-administration-tracking-climate-action-progress" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proposed climate agenda unpassed</a> and the US <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/hope-dims-that-the-u-s-can-meet-2030-climate-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still projected to miss</a> his administration’s goal of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/20/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-catalyze-global-climate-action-through-the-major-economies-forum-on-energy-and-climate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reducing emissions by at least 50 percent by 2030</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Former President Donald Trump has vowed to undo many of the policies Biden accomplished if he becomes president, <a href="https://www.taxnotes.com/featured-news/ill-scrap-ira-tax-credits-day-1-trump-says/2023/09/28/7hdjq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including parts of the IRA</a>. And scores of his key advisers and former members of his presidential administration contributed to <a href="https://grist.org/politics/what-project-2025-would-to-do-climate-policy-in-the-us/">a blueprint</a> that advocates for scrapping the vast majority of the nation’s climate and environmental protections. Whichever Democrat runs against Trump has a weighty mandate: protect America’s already tenuous climate and environmental legacy from Republican attacks.</p>

</ul>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With Biden’s endorsement, Vice President Harris, a <a href="https://scorecard.lcv.org/moc/kamala-harris" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">former US senator from California</a>, is the favored Democratic nominee, but that doesn’t mean she will automatically get the nomination. There are fewer than 30 days until the Democratic National Convention on August 19. The thousands of Democratic delegates who already cast their votes for Biden will either decide on a nominee before the convention or hold an open convention to find their new candidate — something that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/21/open-convention-democrats-biden-drop-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hasn’t been done since 1968</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As vice president, Harris <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/16/politics/kamala-harris-inflation-reduction-act-climate-change/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">argued</a> for the allocation of $20 billion for the Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, aimed at aiding disadvantaged communities facing climate impacts, and frequently promoted the IRA at events, touting the bill’s investments in clean energy jobs, including installation of energy-efficient lighting, and replacing gas furnaces with electric heat pumps. She was also the highest-ranking US official to attend the international climate talks at <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/kamala-harris-at-climate-cop28-summit-world-must-fight-those-stalling-action/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COP28 in Dubai last year</a>, where she announced a US commitment to double energy efficiency and triple renewable energy capacity by 2030. At that same conference, Harris <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/02/politics/kamala-harris-cop28-saturday/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a $3 billion commitment to the Green Climate Fund to help developing nations adapt to climate challenges, although <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/kamala-harris-at-climate-cop28-summit-world-must-fight-those-stalling-action/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Politico reported</a> that the sum was “subject to the availability of funds,” according to the Treasury Department. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Vice President Harris has been integral to the Biden administration’s most important climate accomplishments and has a long track record as an impactful climate champion,” Evergreen Action, the climate-oriented political group, said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris caught some flak for using a potentially overstated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/white-house-puts-1-trillion-price-tag-on-climate-efforts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“$1 trillion over 10 years”</a>&nbsp;figure to describe the Biden administration’s climate investments. She got that sum from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/white-house-puts-1-trillion-price-tag-on-climate-efforts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adding up all of the administration’s major investments over the past four years</a>, some of which are only vaguely connected to climate change.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a presidential candidate in 2019, Harris <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/04/politics/kamala-harris-climate-plan/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proposed</a> a $10 trillion climate plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045 on the campaign trail, including 100-percent carbon-neutral electricity by 2030. Under the plan, 50 percent of new vehicles sold would be zero-emission by 2030; and 100 percent of cars by 2035. But that proposal, like similarly ambitious climate change proposals released by other Democrats during that election cycle, was nothing more than a campaign wishlist. A better indicator of what her plans for climate change as president would look like — better, even, than her record as vice president, as much of her agenda was set by the Biden administration — could be buried in her record as San Francisco’s district attorney from 2004 to 2011 and as California’s attorney general from 2011 to 2017. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As district attorney, Harris&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/SAN-FRANCISCO-D-A-creates-environmental-unit-2666667.php" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">created</a>&nbsp;an environmental justice unit to address environmental crimes affecting San Francisco’s poorest residents and&nbsp;<a href="https://calepa.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2016/10/Enforcement-Orders-2009yr-UHComplaint.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">prosecuted</a>&nbsp;several companies including U-Haul for violation of hazardous waste laws. Harris later touted her environmental justice unit as the first such unit in the country.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.leefang.com/p/kamala-harris-greenwashed-justice" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">An investigation</a>&nbsp;found the unit only filed a handful of lawsuits, though, and none of them were against the city’s major industrial polluters.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As attorney general, Harris secured an $86 million settlement from Volkswagen for rigging its vehicles with emissions-cheating software and investigated ExxonMobil over its climate change disclosures. She also&nbsp;<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-sues-phillips-66-and-conocophillips-over" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">filed</a>&nbsp;a civil lawsuit against Phillips 66 and ConocoPhillips for environmental violations at gas stations, which eventually resulted in a $11.5 million&nbsp;<a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-environmental-violations-settlement-20150508-story.html#:~:text=ConocoPhillips%20and%20Phillips%2066%20agreed,settle%20a%20California%20civil%20complaint.&amp;text=Texas%20energy%20companies%20ConocoPhillips%20and,anti%2Dpollution%20laws%20since%202006." rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">settlement</a>. And she&nbsp;<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-announces-indictment-plains-all-american" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">conducted a criminal investigation</a>&nbsp;of an oil company over a 2015 spill in Santa Barbara. The company was found guilty and&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-98c6da87a0f8469a8d401ace5196ff12" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">convicted on nine criminal charges</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We must do more,”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/kamala-harris-at-climate-cop28-summit-world-must-fight-those-stalling-action/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Harris said</a>&nbsp;late last year at the climate summit in Dubai. “Our action collectively, or worse, our inaction will impact billions of people for decades to come.”</p>

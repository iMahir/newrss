<p class="has-text-align-none">Academy Award-nominated director Todd Phillips and his new sequel <em>Joker: Folie à Deux</em> bravely ask the daring question: What if the most annoying man you know got an equally annoying girlfriend? And what if they sang show tunes to each other? And what if you had to watch?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The man in question is one Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/9/10/20858765/joker-review-joaquin-phoenix">the social outcast turned serial killer from 2019’s <em>Joker</em></a>, who is in jail awaiting trial following the events of the first film. The girlfriend is one Harley Quinn (Lady Gaga), a woman with both a master’s in psychiatry and an obsession with Fleck, who gets herself locked up in order to stalk him better. Harley Quinn and Joker’s toxically codependent relationship has existed in the Batverse for decades — first appearing in <em>Batman: The Animated Serie</em>s in 1992 — and the former doctor and the one-time patient who drove her mad have been explored across comics, movies, and TV. In Phillips’s new film, however, their entanglement is rewritten to be even more grim and, frankly, flat (especially Quinn’s arc), but with a lot more singing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes, though he is loath to tell anyone, Phillips has also managed to make a movie musical about the Joker’s murder trial. On paper, creating a supervillain movie that doesn’t involve setting a city on fire or threatening the world is about as subversive as a director can get. Potentially ignoring the strict directives that come with franchise filmmaking and the demands of Warner Brothers and then throwing in singing and dancing? There was potential here for something truly subversive. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But as Fleck reminds us, some people don’t seek change, but simple misery. For two hours and 20 minutes of <em>Joker: Folie à Deux</em>, Phillips shows us how. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do not be fooled,<em> Joker 2</em> is actually a musical&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Following a trend of movies like <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/wonka-mean-girls-marketing-musicals-1235723781/"><em>Mean Girls</em> and <em>Wonka</em></a>, the marketing and creative team behind <em>Joker: Folie à Deux,</em> a.k.a. <em>Joker 2</em>, have <a href="https://people.com/joker-folie-a-deux-is-a-musical-joaquin-phoenix-lady-gaga-8719343">refrained</a> from making it clear the movie is a musical (a choice the upcoming <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6COmYeLsz4c">Wicked</a></em> also seems to be making). Some of that obfuscation might be a conscious effort not to alienate <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/10/14/20906190/joker-film-controversy-discussion"><em>Joker</em>’s original audience</a>, but it may also be based on the notion that movie-going audiences don’t like musicals. <em>Mean Girls</em> and <em>Wonka</em> didn’t sell themselves as musicals, and they were <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/box-office/timothee-chalamet-wonka-box-office-milestone-600-million-globally-1235915495/">considered</a> <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/box-office-mean-girls-musical-leads-32-million-opening-weekend-1235871262/">box office successes</a> — meanwhile obvious musicals like the <a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/west-side-story-box-office-steven-spielberg-1235131598/"><em>West Side Story</em></a><em> </em>revival and <em><a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/newsletter/2021-06-15/in-the-heights-box-office-the-wide-shot">In the Heights</a></em> underwhelmed. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, and despite the reluctance, <em>Joker 2 </em>is very much a movie musical — at times trying to be a very edgy one.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Phillips uses music as a very obvious storytelling device, if not a very sensitive one. Throughout the film, Fleck’s sanity is in question. Everyone from judges to doctors talk about him living in a “fantasy world.” Enter: the singing and dancing. From “Get Happy” to the Carpenters’ “Close to You,” the movie’s numbers function as a glimpse into Fleck’s desires, fears, and mental illness all rolled into one. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One can only know the surreal interior life of this man by peering into his delirious hallucinations, where we find a sparkly, razzle-dazzle version of his trauma and mental illness. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These moments also allow Lady Gaga to take off her pop star mask and show us <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/5-memorable-performances-stefani-germanotta">Stefani Germanotta</a>, theater kid. She’s good — especially when Fleck envisions himself and Harley as a kind of chaotic Sonny and Cher duo. Gaga’s committed, crackling performance is proof there is room for another Judy Garland biopic, as long as she can audition.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Phoenix, on the other hand, warbles and screeches through his numbers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The result sounds like a big bird harassing another smaller bird. Phoenix’s vocal performance is knowingly bad, especially when you consider this man won an Oscar for playing Johnny Cash in <em>Walk the Line</em>. Perhaps Phillips believes that his audience wouldn’t be able to fully comprehend how disturbed Fleck is if he sounds smooth and delightful in his own fantasies, but Phoenix deliberately makes him sound discordant. After three or so songs, the singing just feels a little like some kind of petty punishment. I suppose that’s the point: Being in Joker’s head is supposed to be an unpleasant experience. I just wanted to be unpleased in a different way. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Imagine if you took all the fun out of <em>My Cousin Vinny,</em> then you have Joker 2</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The most perplexing element of <em>Joker 2</em> is not that it’s a musical; it’s that it’s a courtroom procedural. While there’s a rich cinematic history of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104952/">clowns and their girlfriends</a> in courtrooms, this is not a choice that makes for an exciting film.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the heart of this two-hour and 20-minute<em> </em>movie is the question of whether or not Arthur Fleck, a.k.a Joker, is insane and, by extension, if the Joker is real. His attorney (played by Catherine Keener) claims as a defense strategy that while Fleck did kill five people, he has dissociative identity disorder (DID), formerly known as multiple personality disorder. (The police don’t know Fleck killed his own mother, which would bring the body count to six.) Joker is that other personality, and so Fleck can’t be held responsible. Prosecutor Harvey Dent (Harry Lawtey) — the man who will become the Batman villain known as Two-Face — argues that Fleck and Joker are one and the same: a violently depraved murderer. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Watching Fleck in jail waiting for trial or on trial waiting to go back to jail just doesn’t make for thrilling viewing. Dissociative identity disorder as a legal argument is sort of compelling but less so when it becomes all that’s happening. (It’s also important to note that despite some media portrayals, people with DID are not more violent than the general public.) Courtroom procedurals need some kind of twist or some kind of build to enhance the drama. Starting with all the cards on the table — Arthur Fleck is culpable for Joker or he isn’t — just takes the air out of the genre.  </p>

" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="What if the most annoying man you know happened to find an equally annoying girlfriend? | Warner Bros." data-portal-copyright="Warner Bros." />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Maybe that’s why it’s a musical?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a character who has been an icon since the 1960s, the Joker was created to terrorize Gotham City. The Joker was not created to sit in a jail cell and talk legal strategy with his lawyer. There’s a reason that so many Batman comics and adaptations have a jailbreak scene. Batman’s villains are more interesting when they’re doing crime!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Phillips seems to want to make a bigger point about how the most terrifying part of the character is Joker’s influence over Gotham’s citizens. If Fleck is allowed to be Joker, then what’s stopping everyone else in the city from being Joker? If Fleck is declared legally insane, how can the laws in Gotham keep people safe? If no one can be held accountable for murder, it doesn’t matter how powerful Gotham’s police force is; it doesn’t even matter how powerful its heroes are. But other than the huge crowds outside of the courtroom, some in Joker masks, Phillips doesn’t really show us what’s happening in Gotham. We aren’t really made to understand the stakes for Joker’s verdict, even if they’re the destruction of a civilized society. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Worst of all, Phillips has intentionally or unintentionally created a bizarro, humorless version of <em>My Cousin Vinny</em>. In the 1992 classic, a clown and his Italian girlfriend are the only people that stand in the way of a mixed-up town convicting a pair of dweebs of murder. In <em>Joker 2</em>, a clown and his Italian-ish girlfriend are the only people that stand in the way of a mixed-up town convicting a dweeb of murder. Now, imagine if Marisa Tomei wasn’t charming, the clown wasn’t funny, and there were no twists, no turns, and no 1963 Pontiac Tempest with its independent rear suspension. Your honor, that dour, miserable thing is <em>The Joker 2</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Workers at ports on the East and Gulf Coasts have agreed to go back to the docks —&nbsp;at least for now. Dock workers with the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA) went on strike Tuesday following a breakdown in negotiations between the ILA and the organization of international shipping companies that employ them. Now, they are back to work as negotiations on a new contract continue. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Approximately 45,000 workers walked off the job at 12:01 am Tuesday, making it the most significant strike the union <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/dockworkers-at-port-of-ny-and-nj-go-on-strike-for-first-time-since-1977">has engaged in since 1977</a>. ILA laborers stopped work after their six-year contract with the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX) expired, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/east-coast-port-strike-what-to-know/">shutting down 14 ports</a>, including some of the country’s largest. That could have had a monumental impact on the US economy, with a weeks-long strike bringing higher prices and goods shortages ahead of the presidential election and holiday season. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The striking workers shut down some of the country’s biggest ports, like the <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/dockworkers-at-port-of-ny-and-nj-go-on-strike-for-first-time-since-1977">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</a>. Overall, the affected ports handle about 50 percent of the imports and exports to the US.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The pause in the strike is an opportunity for the ILA and USMX to come back to the bargaining table and try to negotiate a new six-year contract. Workers will be covered by their old contract <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/port-strike-ends-tentative-deal-until-jan-15-dockworkers/">until next January</a>, though the two sides have <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/port-strike-ends-tentative-deal-until-jan-15-dockworkers/">apparently made progress on a wage hike</a>: The dockworkers have <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/dockworkers-strike-suspended-sources/story?id=114445386">reportedly secured a 62 percent raise</a> over the course of the new contract. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the </strong>International Longshoremen’s Association? Why are its members <strong>striking?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The ILA represents the approximately 45,000 workers who manage the unloading of massive shipping containers from large cargo ships. Eventually, inventory from the ships makes its way to warehouses, store shelves, and factories. The members work at ports up and down the East Coast as far north as Maine, as well as Gulf Coast ports in Louisiana and Texas.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There&#8217;s a strike over two main issues,” Art Wheaton, director of labor studies at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said. “One is money. Two is technology.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The union has demanded a significant pay raise for dock workers over the six-year life of the contract, as well as increased contributions to their retirement plan and a say in the role of automation in their industry. Some reports indicate the union asked for as much <a href="https://apnews.com/article/longshoremen-strike-pay-automation-ports-jobs-consumers-3aa66e0a05db25a49645fad404a5f000">as a 77 percent pay increase</a>; the most recent proposal from USMX offered a 50 percent increase over the life of the contract.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The biggest concern is, the dock workers do not want automated machines to be responsible for picking up, dropping off, and releasing the cargo automatically,” Wheaton said. “They would like to have a human operator there” to ensure the quality and safety of their operations — and job security.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Negotiations between USMX and ILA for a new contract stopped in June, reportedly over the use of <a href="https://mynbc15.com/news/local/hundreds-of-mobile-dockworkers-set-to-go-on-strike">automation at a port in Mobile, Alabama</a>. USMX filed a complaint with the National Labor Review Board last week claiming that ILA refused to continue with contract negotiations. USMX did not respond to Vox’s request for comment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Shipping companies that compose USMX —&nbsp;all of which are based abroad —&nbsp;have made billions as global trade and shipping has boomed, the union argues, while worker wages have stagnated in the face of inflation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dock workers on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/business/economy/port-strike-economy.html">West Coast make about $55 per hour compared</a> with the East and Gulf Coast <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/01/business/us-port-workers-strike-tuesday/index.html">average of $39 per hour</a> for experienced workers. West Coast dockworkers received an impressive <a href="https://www.portoflosangeles.org/references/2023-news-releases/news_083123_ilwu_contract">wage increase</a> in their most recent contract<a href="https://www.portoflosangeles.org/references/2023-news-releases/news_083123_ilwu_contract">;</a> they belong to a different union, the International Longshoremen and Warehouse Union (ILWU), which has long been much more radical than the ILA in terms of its politics, demands, and tactics, according to Gabe Winant, a labor historian at the University of Chicago.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the ILWU workers’ big wage wins proved that it was possible to demand more — and get it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, the ILA hopes to achieve a similar victory.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Which goods will be impacted?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More than 50 percent of all goods <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/east-coast-port-strike-what-to-know/">imported into the US using container ships</a> come in through the East and Gulf Coast ports, and nearly 70 percent of containerized exports leave through them. However, since the potential for a strike had been well-known for months, companies had plenty of time to prepare. The most immediate casualty of the strikes would have been perishables. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We have all these perishable goods coming imported [to] the East Coast,” like blueberries, bananas, and fish from South America, Chris Tang, a professor of supply chain management at UCLA, told Vox. “We also have apparel, toys, electronics, we import through the East Coast.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The automotive industry also depends on East Coast ports, as many cars and car parts are imported from Europe. “There’s still some inventories available in the car manufacturing, and as well as the car dealers, so in the short term, it is not a major impact,” Tang said. Under a prolonged strike, that inventory will run out, and car repairs could become more challenging as parts shipments are delayed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition to the strike, there are other factors affecting global shipping at the moment, including <a href="https://www.vox.com/videos/24113479/what-the-red-sea-ship-attacks-are-really-about">Houthi attacks in the Red Sea</a> that have disrupted shipping since November of last year, as has <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/374867/hurricane-helene">extreme weather</a>. The Panama Canal has also been impacted independent of the strikes; the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/business/panama-canal-drought.html">waterway is suffering from a drought</a>, which has created a shipping backlog there.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“As anyone who tried to buy toilet paper during the pandemic can tell you, we have a delicate supply chain, and when you start messing with the cargo ships, the rail, and the semi trucks, you&#8217;re toast,” Wheaton said. “You just aren&#8217;t going to get anything moved. Add to that that you just had a huge chunk of the East Coast get buried in water from the hurricane that just went through.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How might the dockworker’s strike end?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The progress on negotiations is a positive sign. The two sides agreed on January 15, 2025, deadline for finalizing a new contract, which gives them a cushion to negotiate on outstanding issues, namely the role of automation at the ports and an increase in pension contributions.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given the enormity of the potential fallout from the strike, there was some question of whether President Joe Biden would order dockworkers back to the ports for 80 days as USMX and the ILA continue contract negotiations through powers granted by the Taft-Hartley Act —&nbsp;something Biden said <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/01/biden-administration-dockworker-strike-00181839">he did not want to do</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The administration faced “pressure from the consumers, from the retailers, from the manufacturers, and also the shipping companies” to take action and reopen the ports, Tang said. Some business groups had <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/01/biden-administration-dockworker-strike-00181839">already called on Biden</a> to send ILA members back to work.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Biden has also been largely supportive of union action, save the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/11/29/23484623/congress-rail-strike-biden-sick-days">2022 railway workers strike</a>, and union support has been important to <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/372935/teamsters-union-harris-biden-uaw-labor-trump-endorsement-vote">Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The official policy of the government for more than 100 years, that the best solution is a negotiated solution,” Wheaton said. “The union won&#8217;t get everything they want, management won&#8217;t get everything they want, but you sit at the bargaining table to see what both sides can live with.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Update, October 4, 10:40 am ET:</strong> This story was originally published on October 1 and has been updated to reflect the dock workers’ return to work as a contract is negotiated. </em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">An outbreak of Marburg, a virus closely related to Ebola that can cause severe and often <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON537#:~:text=This%20is%20why%20it%20is,low%20at%20the%20global%20level.">fatal</a> disease, is <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON537">spreading</a> in Rwanda. As Africa struggles with <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/1/24/24048361/mpox-covid-outbreak-africa-cdc-public-health">compounding public health challenges</a>, this one presents a rare silver lining: the chance to test new vaccines that could save lives across the continent in the future.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first patient infected with the virus in the country died on September 8, the World Health Organization (WHO) said at a press conference Thursday. As of September 29, a total of 36 cases and 11 deaths have been reported, making it one of the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/marburg/outbreaks/index.html">largest</a> Marburg outbreaks in history. Although most infections are among health care workers from two hospitals in Kigali, the capital of the East African country, seven of Rwanda’s 30 districts have seen cases. It is the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON537">first</a> time the virus has been known to cause infections in Rwanda.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The WHO <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON537#:~:text=This%20is%20why%20it%20is,low%20at%20the%20global%20level.">indicated</a> the outbreak is highly likely to spread to neighboring countries, but the risk of further global spread is low. Typically, humans become infected when they come into contact with a Marburg-carrying Egyptian <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/marburg-virus-disease">fruit bat</a>, a species found across Africa, the Middle East, and parts of western Asia. Once a person has the virus, though, it can then spread to others through contact with bodily fluids or contaminated surfaces and materials, like clothing or bedding. This mode of transmission means that Marburg virus will not spread as easily as, say, Covid-19 or other respiratory diseases.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, as we have seen in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/marburg/outbreaks/index.html">previous</a> Marburg virus outbreaks, travelers returning from countries experiencing an outbreak can introduce the disease into their home countries. Already, <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON537">one person</a> who came into contact with an infected patient in Rwanda has traveled to Belgium, underscoring the possibility of isolated overseas cases.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Historically, Marburg virus disease is fatal in about <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON537#:~:text=This%20is%20why%20it%20is,low%20at%20the%20global%20level.">50 percent</a> of patients, but in some previous outbreaks, the mortality rate has exceeded 80 percent. People <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/marburg-virus-disease">experience</a> high fever, severe headache, extreme fatigue, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/marburg/about/index.html">rash</a>, bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/marburg-rwanda#:~:text=Marburg%20is%20a%20viral%20hemorrhagic,Marburg%20virus%20is%20often%20fatal.">unexplained bruising</a> and bleeding from the nose and gums. Symptoms can appear anywhere from <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON537#:~:text=Burial%20ceremonies%20that%20involve%20direct,severe%20headache%20and%20severe%20malaise.">2 to 21 days</a> after the initial infection.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/marburg/outbreaks/index.html">previous</a> Marburg virus outbreaks have occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, most recently in Tanzania, where there were <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/marburg/outbreaks/marburg-virus-disease-outbreak-linked-to-marburgvirus-in-tanzania.html">eight</a> confirmed cases and five deaths, and in Equatorial Guinea, where there were <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/marburg/outbreaks/marburg-virus-disease-outbreak-linked-to-marburgvirus-in-equatorial-guinea.html">16 confirmed cases</a> and 12 deaths; both outbreaks occurred in 2023. Between 1967 and 2008, the US, Germany, Yugoslavia, and the Netherlands have reported Marburg disease among travelers returning from Uganda.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To date, there is no approved treatment or vaccine for Marburg virus disease, but there are at least <a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/blue-print/who-tag-cvp-report-marburg-trial-for-tag-cvp-review.pdf?sfvrsn=49e8c1ad_6&amp;download=true">four</a> vaccines in development. All four have been <a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/blue-print/who-tag-cvp-report-marburg-trial-for-tag-cvp-review.pdf?sfvrsn=49e8c1ad_6&amp;download=true">effective</a> in studies involving animals. A small, early-stage clinical <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)02400-X/abstract">trial</a> in humans had promising results; however, study participants who received the Marburg vaccine were not exposed to the virus to test how protective the shot was. Two other <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/marburg-virus-disease">vaccines</a> for Ebola virus could also be effective against Marburg virus.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Researchers in Rwanda are preparing to submit protocols for phase 3 trials to a Rwandan ethics committee for approval. This would be an opportunity to expedite the development of Marburg virus vaccines and treatments and perform larger trials in a real-world outbreak.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the trial moves forward quickly, the current crisis could allow scientists to identify a shot that protects millions of people in the years to come.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The slim vaccine silver lining</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The WHO, Rwandan public health officials, and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1010805">a group of scientists and institutes</a> working on vaccine research <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03218-3">met</a> earlier this week to discuss quickly setting up a vaccine trial that could help quell the ongoing outbreak.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of the vaccine candidates being developed, the most promising one that seems most likely to be tested if a trial moved ahead in Rwanda is the cAd3-Marburg vaccine developed by the National <a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/">Institute</a> of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Last year, the NIAID tested the vaccine for safety in humans for the first time in a phase 1 clinical <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)02400-X/abstract">trial</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Forty healthy adults received one of two different doses of the vaccine and were monitored for adverse reactions and to see if their immune systems produced antibodies, an indication that the vaccine would be effective if the individuals were exposed to the virus. The vaccine was deemed safe, and 95 percent of the participants had developed antibodies four weeks after receiving it. However, the participants were never exposed to the virus, so the vaccine’s practical effectiveness was not evaluated.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Earlier this year, the <a href="https://www.sabin.org/">Sabin Vaccine Institute</a> started a <a href="https://www.sabin.org/resources/sabin-vaccine-institute-begins-phase-2-clinical-trial-for-marburg-vaccine-in-uganda/">phase 2</a> clinical <a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05817422?cond=Marburg%20Virus%20Disease&amp;term=Sabin&amp;rank=1">trial</a> for the NIAID vaccine in Uganda and Kenya. Healthy adults will randomly be assigned to receive the vaccine or a placebo shot and then will again be monitored for adverse responses and antibody responses. Participants will also not be exposed to the Marburg virus during this trial.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Typically, if phase 2 trials are successful, scientists proceed to larger phase 3 trials and roll out the vaccine to a large group of people and then observe its impact when individuals are exposed to the virus. The emergency situation in Rwanda may accelerate this process. Scientists may move ahead with a phase 3 trial even though phase 2 results are not yet available.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Researchers and health officials have been preparing for this. Earlier this year, scientists from the WHO and 17 countries at risk for Marburg virus outbreaks developed <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/events/detail/2024/02/20/default-calendar/building-research-readiness-for-a-future-filovirus-outbreak-workshop-february-20-22-2024-uganda">protocols</a> to test both <a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/consultation-rdb/vx-discussion_martha-nason_who-filovirus-workshop-key-analyses-and-endpoints.pdf?sfvrsn=fccf158_3">vaccines</a> and treatments during an outbreak. A phase 3 clinical trial in Rwanda would follow a ring vaccination strategy where contacts of infected people are vaccinated. The trial would have two groups, one group of contacts who are immediately vaccinated and then a second “delayed” group who are presumably vaccinated at a later time. Researchers would then compare the impact of the vaccine between the two groups.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Scientists may also test a treatment that uses antibodies, proteins made by the immune system to kill viruses and other pathogens, against the virus. One <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5719873/">study</a> found that treating animals such as guinea pigs and monkeys with these antibodies after they were infected with Marburg virus prevented serious illness and death. Medical workers successfully treated patients with antibody <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(23)00552-2/fulltext">cocktails</a> during previous Ebola virus outbreaks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The WHO’s ethics committee has already approved protocols to test vaccines and the antibody treatment, a spokesperson told Vox. The next step is for these protocols to be approved by an ethics committee within Rwanda. Two Rwandan researchers have been selected to lead these efforts in the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One other hurdle remains. There are fewer than <a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/blue-print/who-tag-cvp-report-marburg-trial-for-tag-cvp-review.pdf?sfvrsn=49e8c1ad_6&amp;download=true">2,000</a> total vaccine doses currently available. In April 2023, the Sabin Vaccine Institute had produced about 850 of those doses. Oxford University, which is developing another Marburg vaccine, had about 1,000 doses. Larger-scale production could be needed, especially if the outbreak becomes more widespread. Both the Sabin Vaccine Institute and Oxford University have existing manufacturing capacity for the Marburg vaccines and previously reported to the WHO that they could rapidly produce additional doses.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Marburg outbreak has ignited amid a surging mpox outbreak in the region, which the World Health Organization <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/14-08-2024-who-director-general-declares-mpox-outbreak-a-public-health-emergency-of-international-concern">declared</a> an international health emergency in August. The Democratic Republic of the Congo, which neighbors Rwanda, is the <a href="https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/mpx_global/">epicenter</a> of the mpox outbreak. (The DRC has not yet recorded any Marburg cases.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fortunately, Rwanda has one of the <a href="https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/rwandas-health-care-success-holds-lessons-others">strongest</a> public health systems in Africa and has only reported a handful of mpox cases. An estimated <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10926934/">90 percent</a> of the population have health insurance, much higher than most of its neighbors. Rwanda also has a strong infectious disease surveillance <a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/lessons-rwanda-building-systems-protect-against-infectious-diseases-and-biothreats">system</a> and a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771424001800">history</a> of successfully containing outbreaks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That makes it an ideal setting for testing a Marburg vaccine during the current outbreak —&nbsp;if public health authorities can move quickly. The race is on.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In April, Kristen Wiig hosted <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, an occasion that, under normal circumstances, would merit some excitement. But anyone familiar with the peculiar lore of <em>SNL</em> would know better: This was Wiig’s fifth time hosting, and when someone hosts <em>SNL</em> five times, the opening monologue becomes absolutely unbearable.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is the fault of <em>SNL</em>’s longtime schtick known as “the Five Timers Club,” where the conceit is once you host the show five times, you get a velvet smoking jacket and entrance into a mythical exclusive society full of other laureates like Steve Martin and Tina Fey and Justin Timberlake.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is also an excuse for the show to indulge its worst impulses: Packed with A-list guest appearances, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qetxH1hcOSM">Wiig’s monologue</a> saw Paul Rudd pitifully ask why he wasn’t asked to be one of the celebrity cameos; Matt Damon, who has hosted only twice, wearing a Five Timers jacket because executive producer Lorne Michaels said he was so good that he deserved it; and Jon Hamm and Martin Short begging Michaels offstage for a chance to host again. In total, eight of the country’s most beloved actors joined together to fawn at the altar of <em>SNL</em> and, specifically, its creator. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div><div><iframe title="Kristen Wiig Five-Timers Monologue - SNL" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qetxH1hcOSM?rel=0" allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></div></div>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are infinite ways for <em>SNL</em> to be unbearable: a sketch outstays its welcome, the rookie featured player keeps flubbing his lines, the writers forgo jokes altogether and instead force us to listen to <a href="https://www.spin.com/2018/05/snl-kate-mckinnon-hallelujah-gq-interview/">a bizarre piano ballad</a> in an attempt to say something earnest about politics. But by far the worst version of <em>SNL</em> is when the show becomes more interested in its own mythology than making people laugh.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This year, the institution’s 50th, promises to be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/15/business/dealbook/lorne-michaels-snl.html">full of such moments</a>. In the season premiere, host Jean Smart recalled her younger self watching the very first episode of <em>SNL</em>, knowing she’d one day host the show, while the “SNL50” branding was everywhere, from interstitials to the top story on Weekend Update.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The slate of hosts this fall are largely limited to repeat hosts, including John Mulaney and Michael Keaton, who will return for their sixth and fourth time hosting, respectively. The nostalgia tour extends beyond the show: On October 11, <em>Saturday Night,</em> a movie that dramatizes the story of <em>SNL</em>’s 1975 debut, will premiere in theaters. In the meantime, Questlove is producing a documentary about <em>SNL</em>; filmmaker Morgan Neville of <em>Won’t You Be My Neighbor?</em> is, somehow, producing <em>five </em>of them. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The worst version of <em>SNL</em> is when the show becomes more interested in its own mythology than making people laugh.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And on Valentine’s Day 2025, <em>SNL</em> will host a “homecoming” event at Radio City Music Hall, produced by Michaels and Mark Ronson, in addition to a live primetime reunion special with current and former cast members to air the following Sunday.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The film <em>Saturday Night,</em> directed by Jason Reitman, received just-okay reviews, with many critics irked by its exorbitant flattery of both Michaels and <em>SNL</em>. Rolling Stone <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/saturday-night-review-snl-biopic-1235089839/">called it a</a> “gushing love letter”: “<em>Saturday Night Live</em> has long swooned over its own self-mythology, and <em>Saturday Night </em>is happy to add to that backpatting as the show’s golden anniversary approaches,” writes David Fear. Put more plainly, according to <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/186393/saturday-night-live-deserved-better-saturday-night">the New Republic</a>, the film is little more than “a cinematic circle jerk.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To be fair, franchise nostalgia is a plague affecting more than just <em>SNL</em>. Pop culture is in a deeply self-referential, self-obsessed mood: <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/haollywood-blockbuster-ip-addiction-box-office/">Endless reboots that recycle previously successful intellectual property</a> is a symptom of an entertainment industry that has strained under the weight of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/business/economy/hollywood-producers-challenges.html">crushing corporate consolidation</a>. The result is films about <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91119526/unfrosted-hollywood-corporate-nostalgia">recognizable companies’ origin stories</a> (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16419074/">Nike</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14914430/">Pop Tarts</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21867434/">BlackBerry</a>, Flamin’ Hot Cheetos, to name a few), TV prologues (<a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/369488/rings-of-power-season-two-lord-of-the-rings-amazon-trailer"><em>The</em> <em>Rings of Power</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/354702/house-of-the-dragon-season-two-what-to-know-recap"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a>), and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/12/14/arts/music/pop-rap-songs-familiar-samples.html">constant sampling in pop music</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Or take, for example, the sprawling Marvel Cinematic Universe, which sold movie tickets throughout the 2010s by promising hardcore fans that they might see their favorite character in a post-credits scene. Or the other blockbuster cultural product of the decade, Taylor Swift, who orchestrated the highest-grossing tour of all time by packaging and repackaging nostalgia for her fans.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When <em>SNL</em> commits the sin of self-referentiality, it feels worse, not because it’s any more guilty than the rest, but because <em>SNL</em> is supposed to be funny. There’s nothing hilarious about watching rich and famous people congratulate themselves (that’s what award shows are for!). Instead, it comes across as profoundly lazy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>SNL</em>’s best moments have always been the ones where you haven’t a clue what kind of brain they could have come from. With few exceptions, its topical and political material is never as memorable as its quirky characters and absurd sketches — recent standouts include last year’s silly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86qKgK0asGo">Beavis and Butthead sketch</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxxCaw74ptk">Lisa from Temecula</a>. In other words, <em>SNL</em> works when it lets the young comedy nerds who staff the show do their thing without reminding us that we’re watching a show that’s been on the air for 50 years.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div><div><iframe title="Beavis and Butt-Head - SNL" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/86qKgK0asGo?rel=0" allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></div></div>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That, however, isn’t usually what happens when an aging leader doesn’t understand that the best use of their power is to hand it to someone else. Lorne Michaels is a show business icon who is also nearly 80 and can be forgiven for wanting to stick around long enough to enjoy a victory lap (50 years helming a network powerhouse is nothing to sneer at, after all). </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite Michaels’s <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/snl-interview-trump-jokes-2024-election-lorne-michaels-future-1236005680/">statements to press</a> in 2020 that he was planning to retire after the 50th season — a position repeated in 2023 when he <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/saturday-night-live-lorne-michaels-tina-fey-1235790798/">hinted that</a> his replacement “could easily be Tina Fey” — he recently told multiple media outlets that he now plans to stay indefinitely. “I’m going to do it as long as I feel I can do it,” he said to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/15/business/dealbook/lorne-michaels-snl.html">the Times</a>, adding to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/snl-interview-trump-jokes-2024-election-lorne-michaels-future-1236005680/">the Hollywood Reporter</a>, “As long as it’s important and I can be useful, I’ll stay.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To say you watch (or even care about) <em>SNL</em> in 2024 is itself kind of embarrassing, though this has been the case for decades — people who tuned in as children or teenagers tend to believe no cast could possibly live up to the one who introduced them to sketch comedy. You could say it sucks at any point in its history and you’d at least be a little bit right, but it’s especially depressing to watch talented writers and performers spend their energy deifying and worshiping their own employer.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Like too much of pop culture right now, <em>SNL</em> is relying on audiences pointing and saying, “I get that reference!” instead of creating work that’s genuinely fresh or funny or compelling. After all the meta in-jokes, all the celebrity cameos, all the cutaways to the big boss looming offstage, there’s hardly any room left for laughs. If the bland <a href="https://www.wsj.com/arts-culture/television/saturday-night-live-season-50-review-premiere-jean-smart-maya-rudolph-dana-carvey-jim-gaffigan-jelly-roll-7c531f2e">season premiere</a> is any indication, don’t expect many of those this year. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While Virginia is reportedly for lovers, most everyone acknowledges that nearby Washington, DC, is not. The nation’s capital has been <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2015/08/27/why-the-dating-scene-sucks-for-women-in-dc/">consistently</a> ranked as one of <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/dc-disaster-dates-slide-into-our-dms-and-tell-us-your-funny-or-awkward-date-story/3531324/">the worst</a> places <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/04/03/dating-in-washington-is-really-hard-is-it-d-c-or-is-it-me/">to date</a> and one of the US’s <a href="https://wtop.com/news/2014/02/dc-is-second-worst-city-for-singles/">worst cities for singles</a>. Too many type As, too many people too into their jobs, too many people ready to leave after two years — it’s not exactly a city that screams romance. They say that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/08/modern-politics-show-business-for-ugly-people">politics is show business for ugly people</a>, which would make DC the Hollywood of uggos.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given Washington’s notoriety, it was only a matter of time before Netflix took <em>Love Is Blind</em> to the nation’s capital.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In its first season, the Netflix reality dating series asserted the hopefulness of romance — the possibility of falling in love with someone sight unseen and marrying them within a month — but it has become a show about <a href="https://www.vox.com/22958499/love-is-blind-season-2-recap-review">irreparable incompatibility</a> featuring terrifying tales of <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2023/9/22/23885294/love-is-blind-season-5-review-uche-villain">red flag-waving monsters</a>. There have also been <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2024/01/04/renee-poche-love-is-blind-netflix-lawsuit/72101776007/">lawsuits from contestants</a> alleging toxic and inhospitable <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/05/27/is-love-is-blind-a-toxic-workplace">workplace environments</a> in and out of the “<a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/love-is-blind-pods">pods</a>.” Yet the love experiment is one of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryroeloffs/2024/04/16/love-is-blind-most-popular-streaming-show-netflix-the-gentlemen-avatar-brooklyn-99-bluey/">Netflix’s biggest hits</a>, and each season a captive audience tunes in to see a new batch of daters and the horrors — body shaming, weaponized therapy speak, flies in toilets — that await them on the other side of the wall.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/Love_Is_Blind_n_S7_E1_00_23_01_22RC.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4383212962771,100,93.123357407446" alt="A group of women in colorful dresses gather in a beige living area and raise glasses of wine to each other in a large circle." title="A group of women in colorful dresses gather in a beige living area and raise glasses of wine to each other in a large circle." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Let’s go girls! Time to talk to faceless men! | Courtesy of Netflix" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Netflix" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Now we have what sounds like a perfect, hellish match: one of the worst dating cities in the US, combined with one of the bleakest reality TV dating shows in history. On paper, it feels more like a dare or taunt, a gift to haters. Truly only the freakiest freaks, some real District of Columbia sickos would sign up to be on <em>Love Is Blind: DC</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But while this immensely watchable season has plenty of villains and inter-crossing love triangles, it, sadly, doesn’t feel very DC.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For one thing, no one on this season explicitly works in government. To be fair, the show isn’t very specific when it comes to its participants’ professions, so an “IT specialist” could ostensibly be working for some military government contractor and an “engineer” could be doing research for, say, Lockheed-Martin. Still, the closest we get is a cast member being described as a “policy advocate,” which seems like a nice euphemism for lobbyist.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Capitol Hill keeping their employees from representing on <em>Love Is Blind</em> is understandable because of how embarrassingly and negatively many of the participants are portrayed. But that dynamic of an adjacency to national political power fueling a person’s dating identity is exactly what makes DC dating unique and (from all these news stories about people who hate dating there) so hostile. That the show spent a season in DC and couldn’t capture the snobbiness of a staffer asking “Who do you work for?” feels like a loss.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There seems to be a reluctance to get into politics this season, too. A contestant talks about how he voted in the 2016 and 2020 elections, and there’s a conversation about what kind of political beliefs one has while serving in the military, but politics as they relate to dating preferences  — e.g., whether love trumps politics, whether similar politics mean compatibility, etc. — is barely addressed. That’s a missed opportunity, not only given how politically active DC allegedly is, but also because finding partners who share the same politics has increasingly become <a href="https://thehill.com/changing-america/enrichment/arts-culture/3917348-politics-are-increasingly-a-dating-dealbreaker-especially-for-women/">more and more important</a> to singles. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, there’s still enough relationship dysfunction this season to sustain its horror-junkie audience.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Brittany, a beautiful woman who wants to be a trophy wife and tells the camera she cannot spell the word “physicist,” falls for Leo, a young art dealer who tells everyone that one of his insecurities is that he inherited a humongous amount of money and never has to worry about anything financially. The more the audience gets to know Leo, the more it seems like this isn’t an insecurity at all. The more Brittany gets to know Leo, the more interested she is in his “insecurity.”&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/Love_Is_Blind_n_S7_E1_00_22_59_12RC.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4383212962771,100,93.123357407446" alt="A group of men sit and stand around a long table, all dressed in suits or business casual, raising wine glasses to each other." title="A group of men sit and stand around a long table, all dressed in suits or business casual, raising wine glasses to each other." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="The dudes from Love Is Blind | Courtesy of Netflix" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Netflix" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s also Hannah, a 26-year-old woman who quit her “dream job” to be on the show. The dream job in question? Medical device sales. Perhaps there is honor and allure in, say, the vending of CPAP machine accessories, but she’s given it all up for the possibility of sight-unseen reality TV love. To that end, she tells Nick, one of her pod suitors, that she dates athletes and she’s always worried that men only see her as a hot girl. Nick tells her he looks like a less buff Henry Cavill. Neither is setting themselves up to overdeliver.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hannah, Nick, Leo, Brittany and their cohort deliver a season draped in red flags and dealbreakers. From chilling fights about yapping too much to roundabout conversations about getting the ick from watching your partner straddle patio furniture, there’s plenty here. If you’re coupled, they’ll make you breathe a sigh of relief that you’re not in the dating pool. If you’re single, they’ll make you relish it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Love Is Blind </em>is still a riveting, deranged exploration of the worst people falling in and out of love, even if it doesn’t feel like DC.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It has been a year since the horrific events of October 7, 2023. What has happened since is best described as a global tragedy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The scale of the immediate suffering is staggering. From the 1,200 Israelis killed by Hamas on October 7 to the over 40,000 Palestinians killed by Israel in the war since, the human toll of the conflict is terrible and growing higher. Though the past year should have discredited the idea that there can be any stability without <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22442052/israel-palestine-two-state-solution-gaza-hamas-one">a solution that satisfies both Israeli and Palestinian national aspirations</a>, a negotiated settlement seems further away than ever.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And as the dramatic <a href="https://www.vox.com/israel/375125/lebanon-hezbollah-israel-iran-invasion-gaza">military escalation</a> of the past few weeks illustrates, the consequences of October 7 are traveling wider and wider. The Middle East is aflame, with Israeli soldiers fighting Hezbollah in Lebanon and direct hostilities between Israel and Iran, Hezbollah’s patron. The risk of a full-scale regional war is growing —&nbsp;if we are not already in one.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/AP24274763395736.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Israeli shelling hit an area in southern Lebanon, as seen from northern Israel on September 30, 2024." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Zooming even further out, the year since October 7 has seen dire developments for the entire world.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">America’s disastrous mishandling of the conflict has not only failed to stop the bloodshed, but also done serious damage to its already-frayed credibility as a guarantor of the rules-based international order — weakening global support for Ukraine’s eminently just defensive war against Russia and strengthening China’s attempts to undermine pillars of global stability.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The war has also created new forms of global instability. The <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24094638/houthis-red-sea-yemen-gaza-israel">Houthi militants in Yemen</a> have wreaked havoc on global shipping, demonstrating how a well-positioned terrorist group can pose a serious threat to the global economy using relatively low-cost weapons. A global surge of Islamophobia and antisemitism has further scarred divided Western democracies, and internal divisions between pro-democracy political factions over Gaza have weakened their capacity to stand united against rising anti-democratic forces.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To call the past year a global tragedy is not to distract from the most immediate victims, the Israelis and Palestinians killed and immiserated by bullets and bombs. These are the protagonists of any moral story about the past year of war, the people who should be placed first in any accounting of the past year’s events.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rather, it is to put the full range of consequences into view: to show that events that might seem contained to the Middle East have come to hurt people around the world in ways that we may not yet fully understand or even be capable of predicting. This is not a world war, but it is a global tragedy, one whose horrors are not yet done being revealed.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A nightmare in Palestine&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Life for ordinary Gazans was difficult prior to October 7, thanks to a combination of Israeli restrictions on trade and movement and Hamas’s theocratic governance. But since then, Israel’s military response has made it unbearable.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nearly 42,000 Gazans have been killed since October 7, according to data from the Gaza Ministry of Health. That’s about 2 percent of the Gaza Strip’s<em> </em>entire population, the proportional equivalent of 6.5<em> </em>million Americans dying in a war. Israeli estimates of Hamas fighters killed — <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-death-toll-how-many-palestinians-has-israels-campaign-killed-2024-07-25/">between 17,000 and 18,000</a> — suggest around 60 percent of the dead are civilians.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-2173345769_8cf8df.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Palestinian kids walk over the rubble of a building, which collapsed after Israeli bombardment on a building adjacent to it, in the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood in Gaza City on September 23, 2024." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Some have called the death data into question on the grounds that Hamas controls the health ministry. However, its numbers have <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/27/un-says-gaza-health-ministry-death-tolls-in-previous-wars">proven accurate in previous conflicts</a> and provide at least a rough approximation of the total death count.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In fact, it’s likely an understatement. Official data compiled by Al Jazeera shows at least <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2023/10/9/israel-hamas-war-in-maps-and-charts-live-tracker">half of all homes in the Strip</a> are damaged or destroyed; so too are 80 percent of “commercial facilities” and 85 percent of school buildings. In May, a UN agency estimated that there were <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/05/1149256">likely 10,000 Palestinian dead trapped</a> under the rubble and that it might take as long as three years to recover all of the bodies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel’s bombs and bullets, together with its <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/gaza-palestine-israel-blocked-humanitarian-aid-blinken#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20government's%20two%20foremost,food%20and%20medicine%20into%20Gaza.">intentional disruption of humanitarian aid</a>, has made life in Gaza unbearable.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ninety percent of Gazan residents <a href="https://webtv.un.org/en/asset/k15/k15udfv2p3#:~:text=Ninety%20per%20cent%20of%20Gaza's,on%20the%20struggle%20to%20survive.">have been displaced from their homes</a>. Food is so scarce that nearly every Gazan has trouble finding it in adequate amounts, per <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/06/25/g-s1-6193/gaza-famine-hunger-war-israel">an international expert report released in June</a>. UN data from around the same time found that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/25/middleeast/israel-gaza-children-starvation-malnutrition-intl/index.html">50,000 Gazan children were suffering from acute malnutrition</a>. Gaza’s health infrastructure has collapsed, thanks in part to Israeli bombs destroying a majority of Gaza’s hospitals. Rates of disease are skyrocketing; an April report from <a href="https://www.msf.org/gazas-silent-killings-destruction-healthcare-system-rafah">Doctors Without Borders</a> found that the number of diarrhea cases had increased by 25 times over the pre-war baseline.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, in the West Bank, Israeli extremists both in and outside of government have used the war in Gaza as a pretext to accelerate their colonization campaign.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since October 7, there have been over 1,000 violent attacks on Palestinians by Israeli settlers. This is an “all-time high” rate of settler violence, per a report by <a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/east-mediterranean-mena-israelpalestine/246-stemming-israeli-settler-violence">the International Crisis Group</a>. Yet despite this spiking violence, Israel has arrested <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/israel/fight-new-israel?utm_campaign=tw&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter">a fourth of the number of Jewish suspects</a> in the West Bank as it did in 2022 — the year before the current far-right government took power.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-2175529158_3d0179.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A group of Jewish settlers under the protection of Israeli soldiers raids the Old City area of Hebron, West Bank on September 14, 2024." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Some leaders in the current government — like Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir — are themselves settler radicals, and they have pursued their goals via policy throughout the war. In 2024, the Israeli government officially seized more than nine square miles of land from Palestinians — the <a href="https://tcf.org/content/commentary/israel-is-seizing-a-record-amount-of-palestinian-land-in-the-west-bank-the-implications-for-peace-are-dire/">most in any year</a> since the 1990s Oslo Accords gave Palestinians a measure of self-determination in the West Bank.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The past year, in short, has been hell for Palestinians. And there is no respite in sight.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">An insecure and more authoritarian Israel</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After Hamas fighters slaughtered 1,200 Israelis in cold blood last year, the group was not only expecting an Israeli response, they were counting on it. Any extended Israeli campaign in Gaza would surely come with massive civilian casualties, a level of death that would rally the Palestinian population to Hamas’s side and isolate Israel internationally.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Based on classified evidence “described by more than a dozen current and former intelligence and security officials from four Western and Middle Eastern countries,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/11/12/hamas-planning-terror-gaza-israel/">the Washington Post</a> concluded that Hamas planners aimed to “strike a blow of historic proportions, in the expectation that the group’s actions would compel an overwhelming Israeli response.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel fell right into their trap.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since October 7, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly declared his war aim to be destroying Hamas. Nearly everyone credible <a href="https://www.vox.com/24055522/israel-hamas-gaza-war-strategy-netanyahu-strategy-morality">agrees that this is</a>, in the most literal sense, impossible: Israel does not have the capability to wipe the organization off the earth&nbsp;in any kind of reasonable time frame. So no one knows what Netanyahu means by “destroying” Hamas. He has never really explained it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The result is that, if the war were to end tomorrow, Hamas would still be intact and the dominant power in the Gaza Strip. It will almost certainly be able to reconstitute itself as the governing force in Gaza again, owing in part to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/26/g-s1-12949/khalil-shikaki-palestinian-polling-israel-gaza-hamas">rising support among the Palestinian population</a>. Thirty-six percent of Palestinians currently support Hamas, per the <a href="https://www.pcpsr.org/sites/default/files/Poll%2093%20English%20press%20release%2017_Sept2024.pdf">authoritative Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PCPSR) poll</a> — nearly twice as high as the support for their more moderate rival Fatah (21 percent). Prior to the war, Fatah commanded a small plurality in the same poll (26-22 percent).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Israel has bought security through bloodshed in Gaza, it is only a temporary reprieve. The foundations of its security problem —&nbsp;a political status quo in which dispossessed Palestinians turn to terrorist groups as an act of “resistance” — remain intact.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/AP24274095052970.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Palestinians look at the destruction after an Israeli airstrike on a crowded tent camp housing Palestinians displaced by the war in Muwasi, Gaza Strip, on September 10, 2024." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Absent a political solution that gives Palestinians hope for peaceful coexistence, Israelis will always have reason to fear an attack. The war has obliterated any hope of such an agreement in the immediate term, with polls displaying <a href="https://pcpsr.org/en/node/989">record-low levels</a> of support among Israelis for pursuing one. Even if their opinion shifts after the war, as it likely will when the trauma of October 7 fades, wartime settlement growth and land grabs in the West Bank deepen the logistical barriers in the way of any kind of agreement.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More broadly, Israelis are generally hopeless about their government’s ability to manage both the conflict with the Palestinians and their own basic needs. A series of failures, ranging from an inability to support Israelis displaced on October 7 to the failure to return the hostages, has made Israelis question whether their government is up to the most basic tasks of governing. One recent poll found that <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/less-than-one-fifth-of-israelis-have-high-level-of-trust-in-government-poll-finds/">only 17 percent of Israelis</a> expressed a high degree of trust in their government.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, the long-evident authoritarian tendencies of the Netanyahu government have asserted themselves during the war.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the weeks and months immediately following October 7, there was a <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/11/1/23941810/israel-crackdown-dissent-war-critics">crackdown on dissent</a> from the government’s line on the war. Arab Israelis and left-wingers were harassed and even arrested. Ben Gvir’s ministry <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/police-deny-permit-for-anti-war-protest-left-wing-groups-vow-high-court-appeal/">approved permits for pro-war protests but not anti-war ones</a> as the minister himself called for a full ban on pro-peace demonstrations.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This climate has changed as the war went on. Israelis recently staged a massive ceasefire protest, which organizers say was <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/organizers-claim-largest-ever-rally-in-tel-aviv-as-calls-for-hostage-deal-intensify/">the largest single-day demonstration in the country’s history</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But other problems have arisen. After Israeli authorities arrested soldiers accused of torturing Palestinian detainees at the Sde Teiman military base, far-right demonstrators stormed the base to try and free them by force. Sitting members of the Knesset, Israel’s Parliament, actually joined the group who breached the fence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The event, widely described <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/364343/israel-riot-military-base-sde-touman-torture-member-knesset">as Israel’s January 6</a>, illustrates just how <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reactionary-Spirit-Insidious-Political-Tradition-ebook/dp/B0CMQB8S94">deep the rot in the country’s democracy runs</a> and how war, as it so often does, is damaging the principles that free government depends on.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">An unstable Middle East</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel’s recent blitz assault on Hezbollah, including the killing of its longtime chief Hassan Nasrallah and much of its senior leadership, has <a href="https://x.com/PhillipSmyth/status/1840558079269642746">done serious damage</a> to a group that has been firing rockets at Israel since October 8. It also displaced about 60,000 Israeli citizens from their homes along the northern border.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Targeting Hezbollah, which is deeply integrated into the Lebanese population, comes at a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-lebanon-hezbollah-e3ca9c83642056f962fdf76319e3b8de">high cost in civilian lives</a>. And we’ve seen in many recent wars that <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/09/28/hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah-lebanon-israel/#">tactical victories do not amount to strategic success</a>. Israel’s ultimate goal — breaking the Iran-led “axis of resistance” that includes Hezbollah, Hamas, Iraqi militias, and the Houthis in Yemen —&nbsp;<a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/09/29/can-israel-kill-to-victory-over-hezbollah/?tpcc=recirc_latest062921">has not yet been accomplished</a>. It’s possible that, in pursuit of this goal, Israel begins a process of escalation that evolves into a region-wide conflagration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The most obvious catalyst is the current Israeli ground operations inside Lebanon.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Were Israel to escalate and send in larger numbers of troops for a Gaza-style invasion, the immediate result would be a very bloody conflict in which large numbers of civilians are sure to die. In the longer term, Israel might get trapped into <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fcb30f0e-9faf-451f-bc46-8715779c0e44">another long-term occupation of Lebanon</a>. The last one, which stretched from 1982 to 2000, ended in <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/10/01/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-middle-east-wars?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&amp;stream=top">Israeli defeat and the rise of Hezbollah to power inside Lebanon</a>. A more recent war in Lebanon, in 2006, was less bloody but still widely seen as a failure — prompting an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/30/world/middleeast/31winograd-web.html">official inquiry</a> into why Israel’s military performed so poorly against Hezbollah.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Were the current Israeli operation in Lebanon to look too successful, Iran would treat it as a major threat. Hezbollah is Iran’s most important regional proxy, the group’s large rocket arsenal a powerful deterrent against any Israeli attack on Iranian interests. Were Hezbollah to look like it was on the brink of a military rout, Iran might unleash both other proxies and its own military to try and turn the tide. This would mean a full-scale open war between Israel and the Iranian alliance — far greater in scope than this week’s missile barrage on Israel.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such a conflict could lead to any number of disasters. One of the scariest scenarios involves <a href="https://israelpolicyforum.org/2024/09/26/the-rewards-and-risks-of-israels-war-against-hezbollah/">an Iranian dash for a nuclear bomb</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The more military success Israel has against Iran’s proxies, the more likely Iran is to believe that its homeland is at risk from an Israeli strike. It is already close to building a nuclear weapon — able to create enough fissile material for one in “<a href="https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2024/08/29/deterring-irans-dash-to-the-bomb/#:~:text=Iran%20is%20Rapidly%20Advancing%20Toward,Antony%20Blinken%20on%20July%2019.">one or two weeks</a>,” per Secretary of State Antony Blinken — but seemingly preferred to remain on the nuclear brink rather than crossing it. A wider war with Israel might change that, leading to a development many have feared for decades: a Middle East with two hostile armed nuclear powers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These dire outcomes are not inevitable. It’s possible that Israel steps back from the brink of full war in Lebanon or that Iran has been so cowed by Israel’s extraordinary success in penetrating Hezbollah that it doesn’t respond aggressively.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But betting on the best-case scenarios in war is dangerous. The only thing we can say with confidence is that the new <a href="https://abuaardvark.substack.com/p/what-after-israels-killing-of-nasrallah?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=866290&amp;post_id=149448555&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=7ttw&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email">Middle East is extraordinarily insecure</a>, brought to the precipice of region-wide catastrophe by post-October 7 developments. Whether it tips over the brink remains to be seen.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">America weakened&nbsp;and its enemies emboldened</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Biden administration has taken a strange and confusing approach to the Gaza war.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After initially expressing unconditional support for Israel, the administration has criticized Netanyahu&#8217;s approach, becoming suspicious that the prime minister lacks a credible strategy for ending the war. Yet as it has <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2024/09/israel-gaza-war-biden-netanyahu-peace-negotiations/679581/">worked for a ceasefire</a>, the US has steadfastly refused to put major pressure on Israel to get it to back down —&nbsp;declining to use its biggest stick, cutting off military assistance, to pressure Jerusalem to end the war.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The result is an American policy that is seen by much of the world as doubly hypocritical. The US claims to support peace while providing the weapons to wage war, and it seems to treat war crimes differently based on whether an ally or an enemy is perpetrating them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whatever sympathy Israel garnered from much of the world after the horrors of October 7 has been erased by the horrors it has perpetrated in Gaza. <a href="https://ecfr.eu/publication/living-in-an-a-la-carte-world-what-european-policymakers-should-learn-from-global-public-opinion/">Polls</a> as well as <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/12/1144717">votes at the UN</a> show an overwhelming global consensus that the war needs to end immediately, with only the United States and a handful of aligned countries supporting the Israeli line.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When South Africa filed an International Court of Justice case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza, many in the West scoffed. Yet the South African litigators <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/19/middleeast/israels-war-in-gaza-has-exposed-a-deepening-global-divide/index.html">enjoyed widespread support</a> among residents of the global South, where elites and mass public alike overwhelmingly see Israel as a violent aggressor&nbsp;and America as its superpower enabler.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-2152786672.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.76363770124,100,78.472724597521" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="South Africa&#039;s ambassador to the Netherlands, Vusimuzi Madonsela, during a hearing of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands on May 16, 2024." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">For years now, global South countries have chafed at what they see as Western hypocrisy when it comes to war and peace. America and its allies trumpet a “rules-based international order,” yet go ahead and invade Iraq without UN authorization because they’ve decided that they want to.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a 2023 speech, former NSC official Fiona Hill warned that this sentiment had become a <a href="https://lmc.icds.ee/lennart-meri-lecture-by-fiona-hill/">major problem for American policy in Ukraine</a>: that however correct America might be about Russia’s unjustified war, it had lost the credibility to claim to be standing on behalf of sovereignty and international law. This made many countries wary of joining America’s pro-Ukraine efforts, seeing it less as a defense of a vulnerable country than a means of advancing Western geopolitical interests relative to Russia’s.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US approach to the Gaza war has supercharged this sentiment. How can the US claim to be standing for international law in the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/4/22/23034480/russia-donbas-new-phase-war-ukraine-explained">Donbas</a>, many ask, when it is enabling its client in Jerusalem to commit atrocities?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Research suggests that these allegations of hypocrisy can, in fact, matter, <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/why-whataboutism-works">undercutting both domestic and international support</a> for American policies. And as America’s global standing weakens, its competitors — not only Russia, but also China —&nbsp;are trying to take advantage.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“With every civilian casualty from an Israeli airstrike, the West’s arguments in defense of a rules-based order ring hollower in the global South,” <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/chinas-game-gaza">writes Mark Leonard</a>, the director of the European Council on Foreign Affairs. “If, at some point in the future, Xi [Jinping] makes the fateful decision to invade Taiwan, he will surely hope that his stance on the Gaza war has made it more likely that the global South will line up behind Beijing rather than Washington.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A globe primed for chaos</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Gaza war has not only thrown the Middle East into chaos and weakened America’s position relative to authoritarians. It has also given rise to new sources of global chaos, ones that could further destabilize a world order already facing major challenges.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first of these threats is the Houthi campaign on shipping in the Red Sea and Mediterranean. The Yemeni rebel group, part of Iran’s “axis of resistance,” has been launching cheap rockets and drones at ships passing through since last fall — actions it claims are designed to target Israeli shipping and put pressure on Israel to end the war.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In actuality, the target selection has been fairly loose. The Houthis’ objective appears to be less opening a new front in the Gaza war than in using it as a pretext to demonstrate their power and capabilities. Their strikes have done comparatively minor damage to shipping, but the threat that they might sink a ship has <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/houthi-attacks-in-the-red-sea-hurt-global-trade-and-slow-the-energy-transition/">wreaked havoc on a cornerstone of the global economy</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Moreover, there’s a real fear that the Houthis have set a precedent that other militant groups could potentially mimic.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The peril posed by the Houthis is not just that shipping in the Red Sea will continue to be dangerous. Their campaign also sends the message that the global maritime order is crumbling and those violating its rules can do so with impunity,” <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/what-attacks-on-shipping-mean-for-the-global-maritime-order/#houthi-attacks-on-merchant-vessels">writes Elisabeth Braw</a>, an expert on maritime security at the Atlantic Council think tank. “If these forms of aggression are not deterred, they will continue to grow in quantity and will be joined by new forms.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-2152895248.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,9.070211641114,100,81.859576717772" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A fighter of the Houthi group looks at the Galaxy Leader cargo ship as he guards it, on the Red Sea coast off Hudaydah, Yemen on May 12, 2024.  " data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">But aggression in the sea lanes is not the only demon unleashed by the Gaza war globally. It has also led to a rise in hatred and division inside countries across the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One the most dire manifestations of these internal divisions is rising Islamophobia and antisemitism. In <a href="https://www.vox.com/23930119/hate-crimes-muslims-jews-palestinians-arabs-fear">the United States</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-11-30/antisemitism-islamophobia-rise-around-world-amid-israel-hamas-conflict?embedded-checkout=true">elsewhere</a>, there has been a spike in hate crimes directed at both Jews and Muslims — including even deadly violence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/6/2/22455622/anti-semitism-israel-gaza-hamas-new-york-los-angeles-2021">sadly common</a> during times of heightened Israel-Palestine conflict: The passions raised by the issue push unstable, violent people toward action. But given how intense this round of fighting has been, qualitatively different from anything that has come before it, the surge has been more intense.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Separately, major divisions have emerged inside global political factions. In the United States, for example, anger over Biden’s war policy <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/368411/dnc-palestinian-speaker-uncommitted-democratic-national-convention">has alienated Muslim and Arab American voters</a> — a critical bloc in the swing state of Michigan. This could possibly play a material role in the November election, that tensions over Gaza might lead to the return of Donald Trump, a man who personifies global disorder, to the presidency of what remains the world’s most powerful country.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We are, in short, already living in a world fundamentally reshaped by Hamas’s October 7 murder spree and Israel’s bloody reprisal, with no sense on the horizon that what’s broken will be repaired.</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Among the signs that the 2024 presidential contest is reverting to a more “normal” election is a big shift from the country’s youngest voters. After abandoning President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/24125496/young-voters-trump-biden-polling">in favor of third-party candidates, former President Donald Trump, or simply not voting</a>, they have rallied to support Vice President Kamala Harris since her entrance to the race this summer.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s true across much of the electorate, though to differing degrees. After all, Harris took over from a candidate in political free fall. But young voters have responded with particular enthusiasm: They <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/27/kamala-harris-identity-zoom-00171489">organized</a> Zoom calls for her nascent campaign. Their activist groups <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2024/07/31/kamala-harris-young-voters-gen-z-mobilizing/74566303007/">rushed to endorse</a> the VP. They signed up to <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/gen-z-feels-the-kamalove-youth-led-groups-see-surge-of-energy-around-harris-campaign">volunteer</a> for her campaign and registered to vote for the first time. “A breath of fresh air” was the phrase of the day, and some Gen Z activists wondered if this was what it felt like to be young during Barack Obama’s first presidential run in 2008. And, of course, you <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/363560/gen-z-brat-coconut-kamala-harris-vote-young-voter">can’t forget the memes</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The conventional wisdom from pundits and pollsters was that, like any honeymoon, the good vibes could be temporary. It seemed only natural that as young voters who didn’t really know Harris learned more about her, some share of them would be turned off by elements of her political track record or personal history. And surely the usual fusillade of Trump attacks would sour some part of the electorate, including young voters, against her.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet, about two months later, Harris has managed to sustain that youth enthusiasm and recover much of the support Biden received in 2020. Part of that success, polls suggest, is because her campaign is tackling some deep-seated frustrations young voters have had with American politics in the Trump era: a disconnected feeling, an absence of representation, and a sense that they just aren’t being heard by the political establishment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That appeal may be key to what’s going on with Harris and young voters. While she’s made gains with a number of groups since entering the race — independents, suburban voters, even white non-college-educated voters, to name a few — only Black voters have swung as hard in her favor as young voters have. <a href="https://x.com/admcrlsn/status/1838038449703567570/photo/1">An analysis of crosstab data</a> from polls conducted before Biden’s dropout and after Harris’s debate performance by the former Democratic pollster Adam Carlson found a Harris gain of nearly 12 points with voters 18–29, compared to a shift of 4.2 points for the electorate at large.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/fallbackimg.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Young voters desire to be seen and heard, particularly in this presidential race that just felt really disconnected from them,” Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, cofounder of Way to Win, a political strategy group that focuses on mobilizing minority voters, told me. “The opportunity now is to present this campaign as a response to young voters’ desire for younger candidates at the top of the ticket, affirming their collective power and their ability to affect change.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That ability may rest in part on turnout; while millennial and Gen Z voters combined <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/gen-z-millennials-vote-republican/674328/">are on track</a> to make up a larger chunk of the electorate this year than they ever have, they regularly participate at <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/voter-turnout-rate-by-age-usa">lower levels than older generations</a>. Even in 2020, a year of record young voter turnout, only <a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/half-youth-voted-2020-11-point-increase-2016">about</a> <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/04/record-high-turnout-in-2020-general-election.html">half</a> of those younger demographic cohorts voted. And yet, turning out and winning less reliable young voters by large margins is a necessary part of any Democratic presidential victory, even if it’s not enough to swing the whole race.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Young voter enthusiasm has shot up — and stayed there</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most polls since the Democratic National Convention in August and the first Harris-Trump presidential debate last month present similar accounts of the “youth vote”: After nearly a year of bad polling for Biden, Harris has managed to open and hold a margin of support nearly equal to what Biden got four years ago.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2020, for context, Biden won voters under the age of 30 by about 24 points, according to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GIovkPfwUJvFZeFPdOi0fK8Rr7aOVFCYBzrlMG4Vjro/edit?gid=0#gid=0">post-election surveys</a>. That result itself was a decline from the support Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama received in past cycles, but Biden had <a href="https://www.vox.com/23042037/joe-biden-young-voters-disapprove-progressive-gen-z">long had trouble</a> energizing young people.<strong> </strong>Harris now has an average polling lead of about 22 points with young voters when you look at <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16D9GSxqF5LFIRTcoVJlvWWefU_h-ZMzlomghgbvYRaM/edit?pli=1&amp;gid=1863533280#gid=1863533280">aggregated crosstab results</a> from polls in September.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even a return to the 2020 status quo, though, represents a dramatic shift. Before dropping out, Biden was routinely just <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/02/26/biden-trump-gen-z-millennial-poll">barely leading</a> Trump with young voters, if not falling <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/19/us/elections/times-siena-poll-registered-voter-crosstabs.html">slightly behind</a>. Pundits and the public were regularly asking if the polls were just broken or if Biden could really be <em>that</em> unpopular with young people. Harris’s candidacy may have provided an answer: By late July, mere days into her campaign, she had begun to restore the Democratic edge. She was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/25/us/elections/times-siena-poll-registered-voter-crosstabs.html">leading</a><a href="https://www.generationlab.org/trump-vs-harris-vs-biden"> Trump</a> by about 20 points in some of the same polls that had spelled doom for Biden. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Polling isn’t the only sign of this sudden reversal. Voter registration rates for young people provide another data point. According to tracking from the Democratic strategist Tom Bonier, rates of new registration for the young, particularly young Black and Hispanic women, have <a href="https://x.com/tbonier/status/1828457890228629534/photo/1">surged</a> both in the immediate aftermath of Biden’s dropout and Harris’s ascension, and in the <a href="https://x.com/tbonier/status/1838393369057169834">six</a><a href="https://x.com/tbonier/status/1836002142122885200"> weeks</a> since. These statistics <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/363560/gen-z-brat-coconut-kamala-harris-vote-young-voter">mirror</a><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/21/young-voter-registration-breaking-records-swift/75306021007/"> what</a> independent voter registration trackers, like Vote.org, <a href="https://x.com/Jemsinger/status/1816065585844764715">say</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Polls gauging the enthusiasm of young voters and their interest in the presidential election have also shifted in the last few months. The <a href="https://iop.harvard.edu/youth-poll/48th-edition-fall-2024">Harvard Youth Poll</a>, one of the best surveys of young voters out there, found significant movement in young Democrats’ enthusiasm for the election from March to September 2024. In the spring, similar shares of young Democrats (66 percent) and young Republicans (64 percent) told pollsters that they would “definitely” vote in the November election. Last month, young Democrats were much more likely to say they will vote: 74 percent compared to just 60 percent of young Republicans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Harvard pollsters argue that much of this boost is due specifically to Harris. Back in March, just <a href="https://iop.harvard.edu/youth-poll/47th-edition-spring-2024">44 percent</a> of self-identified Biden voters in the Harvard poll said they were enthusiastic about supporting him. In September, <a href="https://iop.harvard.edu/youth-poll/48th-edition-fall-2024">81 percent of Harris voters said so</a>. And views of Harris specifically have gotten much more positive: Her overall favorability ratings have risen since the spring, and she also holds an advantage over Trump in the kinds of personal attributes they ascribe to her and in who they trust more on most policies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The University of Chicago Institute of Politics Youth Poll found similar shifts from its<a href="http://api.genforwardsurvey.com/download/431/?f=true&amp;_gl=1*13jlxhq*_ga*MTk2NjgzMzY1LjE3MjczMTIyNTE.*_ga_CSCXTK5ECE*MTcyNzMxMjI1MC4xLjEuMTcyNzMxMjI2OC4wLjAuMA.."> May</a> 2024 survey to its most recent poll from <a href="https://politics.uchicago.edu/uploads/homepage/2024-08-August-Toplines-Public-Young-Adult-Sample.pdf">late July and August</a>, which was taken shortly after Biden exited the race. Both young Republicans and young Democrats are now paying more attention to election news, but the share of young Democrats who say they will “definitely” vote this year has risen, while the share of Republicans has stayed flat.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Taken together, these surveys and statistics suggest not only that the rush of early youth enthusiasm for Harris is sticking but that there are clear opportunities for Harris’s campaign to continue to increase these margins of support.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Harris is a symbol for some of the longer-term, deeper changes young voters want from politics</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris’s apparent success with young voters wasn’t a given, but reckoning with just how rotten the vibes had gotten for young voters while Biden was the nominee is key to understanding how it came about. That context also explains why so many young people are projecting a new kind of hope onto Harris — and what she can still come to represent in the little over a month left of the campaign.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition to national-level polling, researchers and strategists are using focus groups and surveys to zoom in on young voter sentiments and better understand the “why” and “how” of their evolving support for the Democratic ticket. Fernandez Ancona’s Way to Win, for example, identified and surveyed a group of battleground state young voters to examine how young people were feeling about the country, the electoral process, and the candidates before them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://waytowin.docsend.com/view/kzsc2x277i73gjkz">survey</a> was conducted this summer before Biden dropped out of the race. “One of the challenges that we saw early on with Biden’s candidacy,” Fernandez Ancona said, “was [that young people] felt like Biden had abandoned them. They felt like Biden couldn’t fight for them because … he was too old and he could no longer understand them or feel empathy for them. So that disconnect was a huge problem.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The results were grim for Democrats and confirmed what other <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/05/28/2024/a-dying-empire-led-by-bad-people-poll-finds-young-voters-despairing-over-us-politics">qualitative research</a> of young voters has found: that young people feel like the American dream is a “fading mirage” that is increasingly “out of reach.” They were still hopeful, dreaming about what could be, but felt especially left out of political discussions, uninspired by Biden or Trump, and pressured by the cost of living, debt, and threats to abortion rights.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I am struggling in every aspect when it comes to the cost of living, the cost of food, everything is barely making it so that I can [stay] just above water … (barely making it),”<strong> </strong>one 28-year-old Biden-supporting female participant told the researchers. Pluralities of respondents felt the same way. And more than half of them said 2024 was trending in a worse direction than any of the past few years. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“You’d see over and over again, just how young people do feel powerless and out of control, regarding their finances, their own ability to provide themselves, health care, and just the state of the world. That is something that [persists] and is still a thing we have speak to,” Fernandez Ancona said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The results offered a clear picture of what Democrats needed to change if they wanted to win in November: Replace Biden, promote younger leadership, and offer a clearer, more positive, and more forward-looking platform that moved beyond Biden or Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s just what has happened in the following months. “What we see in the data is that Harris is almost kind of the ideal candidate for them, because [she presents] the three things that [young people] said they wanted most: authenticity, actionable policies, and a change from the status quo,” Fernandez Ancona said. “Harris becomes that avatar for everything you are asking for. So she can possibly help solidify them as a voting block by speaking to their agency in [pushing for this change].”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Aside from representing the kind of shock to the political system that many young people were hoping for, Harris is also benefitting from a high level of trust from young people, both on the issues they said matter most and on being the “change” candidate. The University of Chicago poll, for example, found that while young people continue to disapprove of Biden, they <a href="https://politics.uchicago.edu/get-involved/youth-poll#keyTakeaways">don’t necessarily apply</a> that same disapproval to Harris. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What all these surveys and studies also confirmed was the way these narratives of trust, change, and hope were boosted by viral memes and social media engagement. It was through social media, and <a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/what-are-we-getting-wrong-about-young-voters">TikTok in particular</a>, that many young voters were reintroduced to Harris as a candidate and prompted to <a href="https://www.scholarsandstorytellers.com/young-voters-in-a-digital-world">tune back</a> into election news and look into her policies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, these analyses also point to a central vulnerability for Harris, one that existed even before the summer shakeup. Young voters, and voters writ large, are still concerned <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/22/politics/young-voters-election-issues/index.html">about affordability and their economic prospects</a>, and that’s the big issue holding back stronger support from young men, and young men of color, in particular. It’s the biggest issue where Trump continues to hold an advantage over Harris in the Harvard Youth Poll,<strong> </strong>it’s the <a href="https://politics.uchicago.edu/get-involved/youth-poll#keyTakeaways">most important issue</a> in the University of Chicago poll, and it’s the<a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/newsletter/2024-09-21/harris-hasnt-sealed-the-deal-focus-groups-with-young-voters-show-why-politics"> major sticking point</a> for undecided and marginal young voters in the focus groups that Harvard’s John Della Volpe, the director the youth poll, has been running.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It also swamps the share of young voters who are concerned about the other big vulnerability Biden faced — his handling of the war in Gaza. Anywhere from 1 to 4 percent of respondents in either poll prioritized the Gaza war, though 11 percent of respondents in the <a href="https://politics.uchicago.edu/uploads/homepage/2024-08-August-Toplines-Public-Young-Adult-Sample.pdf">UChicago poll</a> said they were Harris voters who felt less likely to support her because of the administration’s handling of the war.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris, scholars and researchers say, should focus on her economic vision as young voters continue to prioritize issues and “change” in their vote choice.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Having an economic plan and a real plan for the future — yes, she talks about the opportunity economy that she envisions, but really spelling out for people how that’s going to work and play out, and how she may get that through Congress, is going to be critical, especially for that kind of cohort, these different demographic splits of Gen Z,” Alisha Hines, the director of research at the UCLA Center for Scholars and Storytellers, told me.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris and her team may be getting the message. She <a href="https://kamalaharris.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Policy_Book_Economic-Opportunity.pdf">rolled out</a> an extensive economic policy vision in late September, followed in quick succession by a major <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/25/harris-economy-pittsburgh-speech-00181079">speech</a> and an <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/4900063-kamala-harris-stephanie-ruhle-interview-takeaways/">interview</a> with MSNBC to flesh out her plans — all of which mark a new phase of her campaign, drilling down on the policy specifics she has slowly rolled out since becoming the nominee. Polling and surveys tell us that young people want more of that. Harris has about a month left to do it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Palm Springs, California, hit a staggering 117 degrees Tuesday, setting a new October record for itself, and <a href="https://x.com/US_Stormwatch/status/1841286708773744641?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">matching the highest temperature</a> that’s ever been documented in the US in <a href="https://x.com/US_Stormwatch/status/1841286708773744641?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">October</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other places in <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/weather/article/san-jose-october-heat-record-19811577.php">California</a>, <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/phoenix/2024/10/02/october-heat-wave-110">Arizona</a>, and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/extreme-october-heat-wave-ongoing-west-latest-forecast/story?id=114458952">Wyoming</a> have also experienced some of their hottest October temperatures ever, with <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/weather/article/san-jose-october-heat-record-19811577.php">San Jose</a> reaching a temperature of 106 degrees, <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix-weather/2024/10/01/weather-records-shattered-in-phoenix-as-october-begins-with-unprecedented-heat/75472128007/">Phoenix</a> hitting 113, and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/extreme-october-heat-wave-ongoing-west-latest-forecast/story?id=114458952">Cheyenne</a> reaching 85 degrees.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All this is part of a larger trend, one with serious consequences: Heat can, in and of itself, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/extreme-heat/risk-factors/index.html">be dangerous</a>, especially to the elderly, the very young, and those with chronic health concerns. But it can also have cascading effects, from increasing wildfire risk to disrupting harvests. And, because of the effects of climate change, temperatures like those seen across the western US this week could become far more common.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Human-caused climate change … is loading the weather dice toward more frequent and intense heat waves,” University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann told Vox.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>It’s part of a larger trend</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This October heat is largely the result of a phenomenon currently happening <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/10/02/record-heat-wave-west-palmsprings-phoenix/">in the West known as a “heat dome”</a> — which involves a high-pressure system trapping heat closer to the Earth’s surface.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Long-term climate change, however, is likely exacerbating the heat dome’s effects. Greenhouse gasses that fuel climate change also trap heat, leading to higher temperatures that can make an already hot heat dome even hotter. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to a <a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/risky-summer-heat">study from the climate nonprofit Climate Central</a>, 91 million people in the US experienced 30 or more “risky heat days” this summer, and those were made twice as likely because of climate change. The organization describes “risky heat” days as ones warmer than “90 percent of temperatures observed in a local area over the 1991-2020 period.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Climate change has also led to higher temperatures around the world throughout this past year, including a particularly hot summer in states across the US. According to the <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news/us-sweltered-through-its-4th-hottest-summer-on-record">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),</a> this was the country’s fourth-hottest summer on record, when looking at temperatures from June through August 2024. During those months, the average temperature in the contiguous United States was 73.8 degrees Fahrenheit — 2.5 degrees above the average from 1991-2020.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That was noticeable in multiple places, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/09/03/phoenix-100-degree-temperatures-record/">including Phoenix</a>, which experienced more than 100 consecutive days of 100-degree heat or higher this year. Globally, the world could also be on track to <a href="https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/news/20240906/2024-shaping-up-as-the-hottest-year-on-record">hit its hottest year on record.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition to getting warmer, summers are getting longer, with Drexel University researchers noting that seasonal temperatures <a href="https://drexel.edu/uhc/about/News/2024/July/data%20summers%20getting%20longer%20and%20hotter/#:~:text=UHC%20researchers%20also%20noted%20an,are%20getting%20hotter%20and%20longer.">are lasting 30 days longer</a> than they have in the past, meaning well into October for some in the northern hemisphere.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That means fall doesn’t bring the same relief from heat it once did. As a September <a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/2024-fall-package">Climate Central</a> report, which looked at 242 US cities, found, fall temperatures went up 2.5 degrees, on average, between 1970 and 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The warmer fall days could have major implications for natural disasters, especially for wildfires in places like Southern California, where heat amplifies the risk of potential blazes on drier landscapes that have also seen decades of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46702-0">fire suppression</a>. While wildfire season has typically run from early summer into the fall, <a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/longer-more-intense-fire-weather-seasons">it has the potential to go longer</a> as higher temperatures persist.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/2023/7/21/23799004/invisible-consequences-extreme-heat-physical-mental-health">More days with higher temperatures</a> can also translate to increased cases of heat stroke, cardiovascular problems caused by stress on the heart, and respiratory challenges. They can extend, too, the window <a href="https://www.vox.com/22383707/allergies-2021-pollen-allergy-covid-19-climate-change-asthma">when people experience seasonal allergies.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Additionally, warmer falls could affect plant and animal preparations for hibernation, severely shortening the time they usually take to prepare for winter, and delaying <a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/fall-foliage-and-climate-change">processes like changes in foliage and leaf dropping</a>. Farmers may increasingly need to shift <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/warmer-weather-fall-farming-illinois/">planting and harvesting schedules for different crops</a> as temperatures continue to fluctuate as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Short of major changes needed to curb human contributions to global warming, this year’s October heat waves aren’t likely to be a fluke. As Mann told Vox, “The warming will continue until we bring carbon emissions to zero.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the wake of <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/374867/hurricane-helene">Hurricane Helene</a>, a devastating Category 4 storm that has ravaged the Southeast, leaders are <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/live-blog/helene-deadly-storm-live-updates-rcna173203">rushing to restore homes, infrastructure</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-power-outages-32958ff95f6e51e8c69e56e587de46d2">power for millions</a> of people. But amid the overwhelming destruction and chaos, and a death toll already <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hurricane-helene-survivors-north-carolina-rescue/">exceeding 160</a> people across six states, one group risks being overlooked in the scramble: the homeless population, those already vulnerable before the storm.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Disaster relief for people who were homeless prior to a hurricane has always been lacking, as FEMA, the main federal agency tasked with providing aid, has a policy that <a href="https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_iappg-1.1.pdf">explicitly excludes</a> those unhoused people from most forms of help, including housing and direct assistance. In recent years, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has stepped up to try to plug some of those gaps in social safety, but a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr1605/BILLS-118hr1605ih.pdf">new bill moving</a> through Congress <a href="https://nlihc.org/sites/default/files/HR_1605_Sign_on_Letter_Final.pdf">threatens these efforts</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These dynamics have grown more pressing as major hurricanes <a href="https://www.vox.com/natural-disaster/374366/hurricane-helene-florida-big-bend-beryl-storms-climate">increase in frequency</a> and the number of unsheltered Americans <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/ahar/2023-ahar-part-1-pit-estimates-of-homelessness-in-the-us.html">continues to grow</a>. In June the US Supreme Court <a href="https://www.vox.com/homelessness/357861/homelessness-encampment-grants-pass-supreme-court-housing">issued a landmark decision</a> in <em>Grants Pass </em>v. <em>Johnson</em>, greenlighting local governments’ legal authority to clear out <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/3/8/23618237/homelessness-tent-encampments-housing-affordable">homeless tent encampments</a> even if a city lacks any available housing or shelter for the unhoused person to stay in.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since then, more jurisdictions have passed laws criminalizing homelessness, part of a broader effort to crack down on those sleeping outside. Just this week <a href="https://www.flgov.com/2024/03/20/governor-desantis-signs-legislation-to-address-homelessness-and-protect-the-public-and-quality-of-life-for-floridians/">a new law</a> in Florida —&nbsp;that bans sleeping on public property anywhere in the state — took effect. While the law <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2024/1365/?Tab=BillText">includes exceptions</a> during emergencies like major storms, those protections end when the hurricane order is no longer in place.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In practical terms, this means that when Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis or a county official lifts Florida’s emergency hurricane order, Floridians who were homeless before Helene — <a href="https://fchonline.org/the-issue/">roughly 31,000</a> people —&nbsp;could face new criminal penalties. Local homeless advocates say there are countless questions and rumors circulating about how the new law will be interpreted and enforced in the wake of disasters just like Helene, which <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/373874/hurricane-helene-florida-forecast-warm-ocean-water">made landfall last week</a> in Florida’s Big Bend region.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most people experiencing homelessness were aware the new anti-camping law was set to take effect, according to Martha Are, the executive director at the Homeless Services Network of Central Florida. “Some people are already trying to relocate their encampments to harder-to-find areas,” she told me in mid-September, about a week before Helene hit Florida.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><br>Leaders like Are have little idea yet what to expect, and she hears unofficially that most jurisdictions are in wait-and-see mode, watching to see which city gets sued first and what the judge who reviews that lawsuit decides. (Under the new Florida law, any citizen or business can sue beginning in January if they feel the anti-camping ban is not being properly enforced.) <br><br>“It’s going to be a challenge for how leaders actually enforce these [anti-camping] laws, like if I’ve lost my house from a hurricane and I’ve lived in that town for a decade, will I be found in violation of the law and are they going to arrest me?” asked Noah Patton, the manager of disaster recovery at the National Low Income Housing Coalition. “These laws create significant complications, will really make aid more difficult to sort out, and what I have been saying is it makes a community less resilient to disasters.” </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Moving homeless people to safety when a hurricane hits is difficult — and the anti-camping laws make that harder</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s always a stressful scramble to try and reach homeless people when a hurricane is coming. “A lot of people have phones but they don’t have data, they aren’t getting texts,” said Kelly Young, the CEO of the Coalition for the Homeless of Houston and Harris County.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Typically, homeless outreach workers will try and go out to spread the word, and existing homeless shelters will work to make extra room, sometimes allowing people to sleep in places like the kitchen and hallways. Unhoused individuals can usually seek refuge in convention centers and public schools, or at newly-erected Red Cross emergency shelters. Some governments and nonprofits arrange transport for unhoused people to get indoors, while others leave it on the individual to figure out their own travel.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We had up to 13,000 people at George R. Brown Convention Center <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/8/28/16211392/100-500-year-flood-meaning">after [Hurricane] Harvey</a> and there was no distinguishing between the homeless versus people who had just lost their homes and needed a place to be,” said Larry Satterwhite, who leads the Houston Mayor’s Office of Public Safety and Homeland Security.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Not everyone experiencing homelessness gets the information they need, and not everyone living outside <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/Understanding-Encampments.pdf">feels comfortable going to a shelter</a>, said Eric Camarillo, the executive director of SALT Outreach, which works with unsheltered homeless people in Orlando and central Florida. Some people fear losing their personal belongings, while others may have had traumatic prior experiences at shelters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The face of homelessness is not the same as it was 50 years ago,” Camarillo added. “These are single moms who can’t afford day care, these are seniors in their 70s and 80s on fixed incomes who can’t afford their rent increases, and youth and young adults.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The new anti-camping laws are intensifying the already tumultuous disaster response situation, as many homeless people living outside now try to become less visible to avoid jail time. The punitive laws are also expected to increase distrust between local government and homeless individuals, making it even more difficult for people to accept help if they are found.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“These laws exist, in my opinion, to push people away and out of sight which makes our job tougher,” said Eric Samuels, the president of the Texas Homeless Network. (Texas passed its statewide camping ban in 2021.) “And if people are badly hurt and they’re miles from public view because they don’t want to get a ticket, then emergency crews might not be able to get out to help.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Disaster aid for those already experiencing homelessness faces an uncertain future</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">FEMA has the primary responsibility of providing disaster relief and works with states and local communities to manage emergency shelters, <a href="https://maps.redcross.org/website/maps/ARC_Shelters.html">which are mostly run by</a> the Red Cross. FEMA prohibits housing assistance from going to those who were already homeless — “because the need for housing was not caused by the disaster,” as their policy states — though homeless individuals may qualify for temporary transportation, funeral, child care, and medical aid.<br><br>FEMA policy does permit those who lived, pre-disaster, in “non-traditional forms of housing” like “tents, certain types of huts, and lean-to structures” to apply for a few months of rental assistance. But to receive this FEMA money, applicants must obtain verification of their pre-storm situation from “a credible or official source” which, according to Patton, makes accessing the aid virtually impossible.<br><br>“People do not apply,” he said. “It’s an exceptionally burdensome and administratively difficult process.”<br><br>Recently, in light of this, and after years of advocacy by housing organizations, HUD stepped up to establish the <a href="https://www.hudexchange.info/news/rapid-unsheltered-survivor-housing-rush-notice/">Rapid Unsheltered Survivor Housing</a> (RUSH) program, using unspent funds from <a href="https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/comm_planning/esg">another emergency grant program</a>. RUSH aims to help those who were homeless prior to a storm or other climate disaster, and the first grants <a href="https://www.nhlp.org/resources/nlihc-and-nhlp-release-report-on-huds-rapid-unsheltered-survivor-housing-rush-program/">were deployed</a> in the <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/23389508/hurricane-ian-death-toll-storm-florida-landfall-climate">wake of Hurricane Ian</a> in 2022.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We were very pleased to have the ability to launch the program because we see that people who are doubled up or experiencing homelessness during the disaster often don’t access FEMA funds or receive support from FEMA for long,” said Marion McFadden, HUD’s principal deputy assistant secretary for community planning and development. “By providing funds specifically for these situations, we’re filling in gaps.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><br>The other way HUD comes in is through its <a href="https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/comm_planning/cdbg-dr">Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery</a> program (CDBG-DR), which is a highly flexible, long-term disaster aid program that can be used to provide months of rental assistance and build new affordable housing well after FEMA is gone. However the program is not permanently authorized — meaning it relies on periodic appropriations from Congress, which are often delayed and insufficient. The Biden administration has called for Congress to permanently authorize CDBG-DR, and a bipartisan bill in Congress <a href="https://www.naco.org/news/bipartisan-bills-introduced-support-counties-disaster-recovery-process">has called for the same</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1605">a separate bill</a> currently moving through Congress seeks to move much of this longer-term disaster recovery work back over to FEMA, something low-income housing advocates believe will threaten those who are homeless before a hurricane.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We are concerned that the bill, as written, may lead to the misuse of scarce federal recovery funds and prevent critically needed long-term recovery assistance from reaching low-income disaster survivors,” more than 35 national<strong> </strong>housing advocacy groups wrote in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U15ZfvjLRefLildANBu3ij7zRXRGjL_51893RBYPTaE/edit">a congressional letter</a> last week.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">McFadden, of HUD, said there’s “a real role” for her agency to play in supporting communities after disasters. “We are making billions of dollars in grants every year and we understand the unique needs of low-income people and of low-income housing,” she told Vox.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">FEMA was noncommittal when I inquired about the agency’s plans for unhoused individuals during a disaster if Congress granted them new authority, or whether they’d reconsider their stance on aiding the pre-disaster homeless.<br><br>“If additional or new authority is passed by Congress and signed into law, FEMA would then develop guidance necessary to implement the new authority,” an agency spokesperson said. “FEMA would focus on supporting communities’ recovery in addressing needs resulting from a disaster and adhering to the intent of Congress in approving any new authority.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As climate change escalates, communities across the US face increasing threats not only from hurricanes but also from heat waves, floods, and wildfires. Advocates <a href="https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/energy-justice/pdfs/EMBARGOED_FEMA-Petition-on-Heat-and-Wildfire-Smoke.pdf">have been petitioning</a> FEMA over the last year to expand its criteria for disaster aid to include heat and smoke, emphasizing the need for more adaptable responses to these challenges. The nation’s severe shortage of affordable housing worsens the struggles of both the newly displaced and the long-unsheltered, and addressing these intertwined crises of climate resilience and housing stability has never been more urgent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel appears to be expanding a military invasion of Lebanon it initially said <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/09/30/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas-war-news-gaza/">would be “limited,”</a> launching <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/03/world/israel-iran-lebanon-hezbollah">hundreds of airstrikes</a> on targets throughout the country, and engaging in <a href="https://apnews.com/live/israel-lebanon-ground-operation-updates">ground combat</a> in the country’s south. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Several of Israel’s recent strikes have focused on the Lebanese capital Beirut; one of the most recent <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-iran-hezbollah-attack-hamas-war-airstrikes-beirut-gaza-latest/">killed 46 people and wounded 85</a>. In the past days, Israel has also instructed residents of <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-iran-hezbollah-attack-hamas-war-airstrikes-beirut-gaza-latest/">77 southern towns and villages to flee</a>, telling people to move far north of an internationally recognized border zone — <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-war-news-10-03-2024-5fad98f56ebcc7e1751388b608c7c8dd">possibly indicating Israel’s intention to move further into Lebanon</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These attacks follow weeks of bombing campaigns near and within Beirut, and the Israeli military’s announcement that it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/01/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah/here-are-the-latest-developments?smid=url-share">transferred one army division</a>, typically numbering around 10,000 troops, to the Lebanese border.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The invasion marks a dangerous new phase in the long conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Islamist militant organization and Lebanese political party that has fought Israel since its founding decades ago. Israel has recently escalated its attacks on Hezbollah, <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/10/28/23935157/hezbollah-lebanon-israel-hamas-palestine-gaza-iran-militia-group">assassinating the group’s reclusive leader</a>, Hassan Nasrallah, in a bombing in a Beirut suburb after reportedly launching a <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/372399/pager-explosions-lebanon-syria-hezbollah-israel-gaza">series of attacks on thousands of mobile devices</a> used by members of Hezbollah throughout Lebanon. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel’s latest operations have been costly: More than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/israel-strikes-yemen-lebanon-attack-hezbollah-middle-east-war-latest">1,000 Lebanese have been killed, 6,000 wounded</a>, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-strikes-heart-beirut-killing-six-2024-10-02/">more than a million displaced</a>, according to Lebanese government officials. Hezbollah’s recent attacks on Israel — largely missile strikes — have meanwhile left at least <a href="https://www.jns.org/idf-probing-cause-of-sirens-in-central-israel/">eight</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/25/g-s1-24452/hezbollah-fires-missile-tel-aviv">people</a> wounded. Close combat in Lebanon’s south has <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-war-ground-operations-as-hamas-war-continues/">killed eight Israeli soldiers thus far</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although the two sides have fought on and off over the decades, Hezbollah has been engaged in more intense fighting with Israel since the October 7 attacks on Israel by Hamas last year. Hezbollah has vowed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas/here-are-the-latest-developments-on-strikes-in-lebanon?smid=url-share">continue its missile strikes</a> into Israeli territory until Israel agrees to a ceasefire in Gaza, where at least <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-death-toll-how-many-palestinians-has-israels-campaign-killed-2024-07-25/">40,000 Palestinians</a> have been killed. Israel has shown no sign it is contemplating ending its operations, either. The country’s leaders have said they want to <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-podcast/352059/why-israel-cant-destroy-hamas">completely eradicate Hamas</a>, and Israel’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/us-looks-unable-to-talk-netanyahu-out-of-planned-invasion-of-lebanon">defense minister said Monday</a> that the “next stage in the war against Hezbollah will begin soon.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Key allies also seem unable to end the fighting. The United States reportedly had a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/us/politics/us-israel-lebanon-hezbollah.html">Hezbollah-Israel peace plan that it has now abandoned</a>. While the US has publicly told Israel it should try to deescalate the situation, the US <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/30/us-israel-military-hezbollah-00181797">reportedly privately offered Israel support</a> for its Hezbollah strategy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, Iranian officials have responded to Israel’s recent attacks with a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/iran-launched-ballistic-missile-attack-israel-rcna173434">ballistic missile strike</a> on Tuesday. The regime launched at least <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-news-10-01-2024-eb175dff6e46906caea8b9e43dfbd3da">180 missiles at Israel</a>, though <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-us-prepared-israel-defend-iranian-attack/story?id=114393069">US forces in the region</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-what-to-know-hezbollah-incursion-c44358cb4c70db69bdab4b254cb2ed76">Israel’s own missile defense system </a>intercepted most.<strong> </strong>Iran’s mission to the UN suggested the country did not have further attacks in store, <a href="https://x.com/Iran_UN/status/1841162849286308106">writing on X</a> that the country’s “response … has been duly carried out,” though it added the threat: “Should the Zionist regime dare to respond or commit further acts of malevolence, a subsequent and crushing response will ensue.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here is what we do know so far about what has happened, and what’s likely to come next.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How did we get here?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The animosity between Hezbollah and Israel is decades old; in fact, Hezbollah formed in <a href="https://merip.org/1982/09/the-war-in-lebanon/">1982 in southern Lebanon</a> as a response to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2022/6/4/a-cosmic-stink-israels-invasion-of-lebanon-40-years-on">Israel’</a>s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1982/09/03/war-casualties-put-at-48000-in-lebanon/cf593941-6067-4239-a453-71bdcaf9eba0/">disastrous invasion</a>, which killed tens of thousands of Lebanese, and subsequent decades-long occupation of that area. Hezbollah <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/may/24/israelandthepalestinians.lebanon">waged guerilla warfare against Israeli troops for decades</a>, and Israel finally left in 2000 following years of brutal fighting and a UN resolution requiring it to do so.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The two sides settled into a conflict that simmered until 2006. After Hezbollah killed eight Israeli soldiers and captured two others, Israel responded with a counterattack that led to a short, bloody war in which <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/echoes-of-2006-israel-hezbollah-and-the-potential-for-regional-war/">more than 1,000 Lebanese and 160 Israelis were killed</a>.<strong> </strong>A UN-brokered ceasefire ended that conflict, but fighting continued for years — and it intensified again in the wake of Hamas’s October 7 attack.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah is allied with Hamas, and, starting on October 8, 2023, began firing major salvos into northern Israel, eventually displacing around <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cglkkrj94ldo">60,000 residents there</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Initially, with Israel focused on uprooting Hamas in Gaza, fighting along its northern border with Lebanon was limited to tit-for-tat strikes. But starting in September, Israel escalated the fighting significantly, first by attacking Hezbollah members and leadership with exploding electronics, then bombing Hezbollah’s stronghold in southern Lebanon and the outskirts of Beirut.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ever since the October 7 attack, observers have warned about the possibility that Israel’s war with Gaza might spread to encompass Hezbollah and, perhaps, the entire region.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not clear if that’s what’s happening now or what a full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah might look like. Despite Hezbollah’s previous ability to stand up to Israeli firepower, it’s also not clear how it will fare with its communication networks disrupted by <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/372772/hezbollah-israel-pagers-radios-lebanon">the recent pager and walkie-talkie attacks</a> —&nbsp;which Israel has not claimed but is widely assumed to be behind. What’s more, a significant number of mid-level and senior Hezbollah leaders were killed in that attack and <a href="https://www.vox.com/israel/373428/lebanon-hezbollah-israel-hamas-gaza">subsequent bombings</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What might Hezbollah’s next move be?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah is considered the most widely armed and powerful militia group in the Middle East. It boasts a vast weapons arsenal, including as many as <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/9/20/hezbollah-to-israel-precision-missiles-now-obtained">120,000 missiles</a>, and has deployed it with increasing success inside Israel’s borders since the war in Gaza began. Israel <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hezbollahs-tunnels-flexible-command-weather-israels-deadly-blows-2024-09-25/">claims to have destroyed thousands of the group’s rockets and shells</a>, and <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/people/natan-sachs/">Natan Sachs</a>, director of the Middle East policy program at the Brookings Institution, says Israel may have destroyed some of Hezbollah’s precision munitions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, Hezbollah has demonstrated advanced military tactics such as <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/hezbollah-introduces-new-weapons-tactics-against-israel-as-war-in-gaza-drags-on">using drones to fire missiles at key Israeli targets</a> and effective intelligence capabilities including <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/tool-of-first-resort-israel-hamas-war-in-cyber/">digital espionage</a>. And recent Israeli attacks on Lebanese mobile devices and the assassination of Nasrallah haven’t completely wiped out that capacity. Hezbollah claimed to strike at least two locations in northern Israel on October 3 — <a href="https://aje.io/l9o832?update=3220211">a military site and civilian settlement</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There was kind of this gleefulness about Hezbollah being completely disabled and destroyed now because all the leadership’s gone,” said <a href="https://x.com/phillipsmyth?lang=en">Phillip Smyth</a>, an independent analyst focusing on the Middle East and terrorism. “That’s not how it works.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the success of recent Israeli attacks has called into question the extent of Hezbollah’s capabilities — and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/29/world/middleeast/iran-hezbollah-israel-nasrallah.html">reportedly shaken Iranian leadership</a>. In that sense, Hezbollah may have limited options going forward, even though it had previously pledged not to relent until a ceasefire in Gaza is reached. On October 3, Israel’s military claimed to have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-strikes-heart-beirut-killing-six-2024-10-02/">killed more than a dozen Hezbollah militants in an attack in central Beirut</a>.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Hezbollah turns out to be less capable, militarily, than I expected,” <a href="https://tcf.org/experts/thanassis-cambanis/">Thanassis Cambanis</a>, a senior fellow and director of the think tank Century International, said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cambanis and other experts believed that Hezbollah had the technology to effectively strike military targets in Israel, as well as civilian infrastructure in Haifa and even Tel Aviv, a major population center. But if it was willing and able, it seems it would have done so by now.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It turns out that Hezbollah wasn’t willing to use its most powerful military options, or that it couldn’t because Israel was able to infiltrate or neutralize Hezbollah capabilities,” Cambanis said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The group’s second-in-command, Naim Qassem, sought to dispel doubts about Hezbollah’s capabilities in a speech on Monday, though he also seemed to suggest Hezbollah is currently on the defensive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Israel was not able to reach our military capabilities, and what its media says about hitting most of the medium and long-range capabilities is a dream they have not achieved and will never achieve,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCVhaCv-BSQ" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCVhaCv-BSQ">Qassem said</a>. “We will face any possibility and we are ready if the Israelis decide to enter by land and the resistance forces are ready for a ground engagement.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He added that an announcement will be <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/hezbollah-says-choose-nasrallahs-successor-at-earliest-opportunity">made in the coming days</a> about Nasrallah’s successor, who Smyth said will most likely be <a href="https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-822451">Hashem Safieddine</a>, Nasrallah’s handpicked heir and cousin. Safieddine currently oversees&nbsp; Hezbollah’s political affairs and sits on the council managing the group’s military operations.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Iran’s role here?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tuesday’s missile barrage is Iran’s most escalatory move since April, when the regime sent around 300 missiles and rockets toward Israel, nearly all of which were intercepted by US and regional partner forces, as well as Israel’s own air defenses.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel has threatened to retaliate against Iran for this latest attack. “The regime in Tehran does not understand our determination to defend ourselves and to exact a price from our enemies,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said during a meeting of the country’s security cabinet Tuesday.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not clear <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/10/02/iran-israel-missile-attacks-response?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&amp;stream=top">exactly what form that retaliation will take</a> —&nbsp;whether it will be an outright attack on Iranian territory, more covert actions like assassinations or disruptions to critical infrastructure, or increased attacks against Iranian partner groups. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the most part, Iran asserts its regional power and carries out foreign policy goals —&nbsp;primarily, antagonizing Israel —&nbsp;by funding and providing resources to a network of militia groups. Those include Hamas, Yemen’s Houthi rebels, Shia militia groups in Iraq and Syria, and, of course, Hezbollah.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Iran’s relationship with Hezbollah is really like two NATO allies,” Ali Vaez, director of the Iran project at the International Crisis Group, <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/10/14/23917078/israel-hamas-war-gaza-iran-hezbollah-khamenei-lebanon">told Vox</a> last October.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, while NATO allies pledge to defend one another from attacks, Iran has been reluctant to be actively involved in a war against Israel; a drone attack on Israeli territory in April, following the assassination of an Iranian military leader in an Iranian diplomatic building in Damascus, Syria, was obviously telegraphed and minimally destructive. And the July assassination of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-hamas-israel-30968a7acb31cd8b259de9650014b779">Ismail Haniyeh</a>, the former Hamas leader, while he was in Tehran prompted no obvious retaliation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s not to say that Iran has no appetite for conflict: “The appetite for them was quite high, to be perfectly frank,” Smyth said.&nbsp;“They just thought that they could micromanage this so that it wouldn’t get to this point. And the Israelis clearly called their bluff.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, it seems, Iran has offered a show of force — but there are limits to how far the country will go.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Escalation could come, but [the Iranians] need to thread a needle,” Sachs said. That involves trying to show solidarity with Hezbollah and that Iran is capable of attack, without getting into an extended war with both Israel and the US.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Is Israel’s Lebanon campaign a prelude to a larger ground invasion?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel’s plan for its “limited” ground invasion <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/09/30/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas-war-news-gaza/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzI3NjY4ODAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzI5MDUxMTk5LCJpYXQiOjE3Mjc2Njg4MDAsImp0aSI6ImFlMTRkYjY5LTk5YTYtNDIzMS05YmVkLTlhODEzNjVhOTdiYSIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDI0LzA5LzMwL2lzcmFlbC1sZWJhbm9uLWhlemJvbGxhaC1oYW1hcy13YXItbmV3cy1nYXphLyJ9.gPdOCFqWeUNDOOgWc_u8OxxY2nTy62a09dLm8KwWSa4"><strong>initially appeared to </strong>involve</a> rooting out Hezbollah along Lebanon’s southern border with Israel to neutralize the threat to Israeli communities nearby. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, by Thursday, there were some indications that Israel could move further into Lebanon’s south: The military instructed residents in Lebanon’s southern Nabatieh governorate to move about 36 miles to the north, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-war-news-10-03-2024-5fad98f56ebcc7e1751388b608c7c8dd">according to the Associated Press.</a> That’s beyond the Litani River, which serves as the northern border of an internationally recognized border zone between Israel and Lebanon. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there’s a fear that Israel’s narrow mission could balloon into something bigger — much as it already has in Gaza, where Israel’s stated operational objective of eliminating Hamas has given way to widespread destruction of civilian life. If the conflict with Hezbollah does grow, that would likely spur fierce Lebanese resistance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“An invasion of Lebanon will mobilize Lebanese as a national issue to resist, including the many Lebanese who don’t support Israel but also oppose another Israeli invasion and occupation,” Cambanis said. “Perhaps in the short term Israel can achieve some of its aims by pursuing the logic of total war, but it will only make Israel and the entire Middle East less safe.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Lebanese government —&nbsp;or what passes for it, since an unelected caretaker government has been in place since 2022 — has clearly demonstrated that the country is not interested in yet another war with Israel. Caretaker <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/lebanon-hold-session-elect-president-after-ceasefire-caretaker-pm-says-2024-09-30/">Prime Minister Najib Mikati announced Monday</a> that his government is prepared to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war. That resolution would deploy the Lebanese army to the country’s south to crack down on Hezbollah and require Israel to pull out of southern Lebanon. Now that Israel has entered Lebanon, it’s unclear whether Mikati will trigger the resolution. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The conflict has already taken a significant toll on Lebanese civilians and it could only get worse from here. In anticipation, Lebanon and the United Nations petitioned for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/01/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah/23dd80ed-e9dd-5ee3-a552-622fbac870f6?smid=url-share">$426 million</a> in humanitarian aid on Tuesday to help those affected in the next three months.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lebanon has already struggled under decades of war and government dysfunction, as well as an influx of Syrian refugees that have stretched already-limited state capacity. Now, Israel’s bombing attacks and invasion have displaced around 1 million Lebanese from the south of the country, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgveeyrl47o">according to Mikati</a>, and the Lebanese government says <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-news-09-30-2024-83ea5f243688f309754ec74850de4238">at least 1,000 people have been killed in the past two weeks</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s next for the Gaza-Hezbollah-Israel conflict overall?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There seems to be no end in sight for the widening conflict, for several reasons: US unwillingness to restrain Israel by restricting weapons shipments; Hezbollah’s stated position that they will not stop attacks on Israel until a ceasefire with Gaza is reached; and the repeated breakdown of Gaza ceasefire talks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US and France did attempt to negotiate a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/26/lebanon-temporary-ceasefire-plan-hezbollah-israel">21-day ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel last week</a>, but “Israel (Netanyahu) has flat out rejected the US-French 21 day ceasefire proposal in Lebanon,” <a href="https://history.stanford.edu/people/joel-beinin">Joel Beinin</a>, a professor of Middle East history at Stanford University, said. As Hezbollah also frames its attacks as support for Gaza, it most likely won’t agree to a ceasefire as long as Gaza is still under attack.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As for the US, there seems to be almost no effort to truly restrain Israel following the failed ceasefire attempt.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The United States is just not driving events,” <a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/who-we-are/people/michael-wahid-hanna">Michael Hanna</a>, director of the US program at the International Crisis Group, said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We support Israel’s right to defend itself against Hezbollah and all Iranian backed terror groups. Of course, we know that mission creep can be a risk and we will keep discussing that with the Israelis. And ultimately, a diplomatic resolution is the only way to achieve lasting stability and security across the Israel-Lebanon border,” a spokesperson from the National Security Council told Vox in an email.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US could, however, do more to deter escalation; <a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/in-the-news/bernie-sanders-preparing-resolutions-to-block-20b-in-us-arms-sales-to-israel/">Sen. Bernie Sanders </a>(I-VT) has introduced <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-resolution-forces-vote-arms-sales-israel-gaza_n_66f5b5a4e4b0b663235fb66d">a resolution to block arms sales to Israel</a>, on the premise that the arms transfers violate international law, although that is unlikely to pass in Congress.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although Lebanon is the current site of the crisis, Israeli military operations are ongoing in Gaza, where <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20240711-more-than-186-000-dead-in-gaza-how-credible-are-the-estimates-published-on-the-lancet">as many as 186,000 people may have been killed in the past year of fighting</a>, according to some researchers. (Many media sources put that figure at 40,000, but an accurate count is difficult given that much of Gaza is destroyed and fighting is ongoing.) Medical infrastructure has been destroyed, and there are many reported instances of communicable disease and malnutrition.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“People are getting killed in Gaza daily, the humanitarian situation is dire,” Hanna said. “Life is disrupted and on hold — there are no schools, there’s no functioning society. There’s nothing.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel appears to be emboldened by its victories, and Hezbollah appears reluctant to launch large-scale attacks on Israel. The US has maintained its support for Israel and is sending <a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-troops-middle-east-israel-hezbollah-e37e2dbef573e33c0f8fb6a8103f27f1">more troops to the region</a>. Iran has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-israel-mideast-tensions-hezbollah-lebanon-analysis-5020aeed3c88790d5483fdf40c9ba392">issued some threats</a>, but hasn’t yet been much of an active participant in the fighting. All that makes it impossible to say where the war goes from here. Cambanis, however, predicts the worst.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There’s a dangerous and delusional march to war on Iran,” he said. “I would have liked to rely on the US government to restrain Israel, but it’s clear that the Biden administration supports Israel’s widening gyre of escalation.”</p>

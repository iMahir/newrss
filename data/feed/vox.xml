<p class="has-text-align-none">Somewhere between San Luis Obispo and Monterey, California, I wondered if the rain would ever cease. Pounding storms had followed me on my two-week solo road trip from Los Angeles to San Francisco, so much so that the Pacific Coast Highway was closed to motorists through Big Sur — one of my planned pit stops. While I meticulously planned the drive and itinerary down to the hour, I never once considered a backup plan for something as common as a closed road. At a loss for what to do, I scrambled to find an Airbnb in a remote area for the night. I had unintentionally broken one of the top road trip rules, according to seasoned roadtripper and blogger <a href="https://southernersays.com/">Lori Blalock</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Having a plan B and C is a good idea,” she says.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For nearly as long as cars have been on the road, Americans have practiced the art of the road trip. In the 1910s and ’20s, motorists drove from cities to more remote areas to <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-america-joined-its-two-great-loves-cars-and-the-outdoors">set up camp beside their cars</a>. After World War II, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/american-road-trip/">road trips were the family vacation of choice</a>, with many visiting national parks and extended family in other cities. The humble road trip has been immortalized in countless movies over the years including <em>National Lampoon’s Vacation</em>, <em>Lost in America, </em>and <em>Little Miss Sunshine</em>. Hesitant to travel by plane during the pandemic, many <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/04/travel/to-many-travelers-2020-was-the-summer-of-1965.html">Americans opted to adventure by car</a>. The love for the open road hasn’t let up in post-pandemic years either: A recent poll found that 73 percent of Americans <a href="https://swnsdigital.com/us/2024/04/why-3-in-4-prefer-road-trips-over-flying/">preferred to drive</a> to their vacation destination instead of flying.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/MSDNALA_EC015.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="A still from the movie “National Lampoon’s Vacation.”" title="A still from the movie “National Lampoon’s Vacation.”" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="Everett Collection" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">While road trips allow travelers to avoid the hassle and expense of air travel, there are plenty of considerations roadtrippers should keep in mind. From planning a practical route to keeping the peace with your travel companions, road trip experts offer their best advice for planning a vacation on wheels.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Be realistic when planning an itinerary</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Blalock’s road trip planning begins first with a timeframe and then a list of sites and stops she wants to see — not the other way around. “A lot of people reverse that,” she says. “People know where they want to go, but then they don’t quite have the time, and then they end up having road trip failures, because where they want to go just does not fit into their timeframe.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Map out your route based on the time you have and then determine your must-see sights and attractions, whether it’s a national park or a brewery. Estimate how long you’ll spend at each destination — be generous — to avoid rushing from one place to the next. Have an idea of what you might do instead if a trailhead is closed because of bad weather or other unforeseen circumstances.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you only have three days earmarked to get from point A to point B and back, you don’t want to feel overwhelmed racing from one roadside attraction to the other. The trip should be just as much about the journey as the destination.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When planning itineraries for clients, Sam Highley, CEO and founder of road trip travel company <a href="https://www.allroadsnorth.com/">All Roads North</a>, focuses on the “in-between places”: off-the-beaten-path towns, restaurants, and parks. The routes themselves are on scenic backroads rather than highways. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Don’t overlook lesser-known landmarks. “National parks are treasures in the US and they form a big part of our itineraries,” Highley says. “But I think there’s also a ton of other state parks, public land wilderness areas, that can be equally as beautiful and rewarding and you’re likely to be there with a tenth of the people that you might experience in a national park.”</p>

</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you need some inspiration for in-between places, check out tourism board websites for the various towns and cities you’ll be passing through, suggests Danielle Desir Corbett, the host of the podcasts <a href="https://roadtripreadypodcast.com/"><em>Road Trip Ready</em></a> and <a href="https://thoughtcard.com/podcast/"><em>The Thought Card</em></a>. She also discovers unique pitstop destinations from travel blogs, vlogs, and Instagram posts. As you’re planning, save Instagram posts to road trip inspiration folders or make Pinterest boards to organize your research, Desir Corbett says. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Book your tickets and accommodation for popular locations ahead of time, such as camping at tourist-heavy national parks or Instagram-famous motels, Blalock says. As soon as you know which towns you want to spend the night in, book a hotel, Desir Corbett says. Similarly, secure tickets for can’t-miss museums, cooking classes, pick-your-own produce, and other experiences early. “It&#8217;s not something that you have to necessarily do months and months in advance,” Desir Corbett says. “It could be the week you’re planning everything out.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Leave room for spontaneity, too, Desir Corbett says. If you see a billboard for an interesting museum or farmers market while you’re driving, don’t be afraid to check it out. These unplanned excursions are part of the magic of road trips. When you stop for gas at welcome centers or rest stops, pick up pamphlets for local tourist attractions. Ask bartenders, employees at the front desk of hotels, or other locals you encounter for their recommendations, Desir Corbett says. “You could either fit it during this trip or just have it back in your back pocket for your next adventure,” she says.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Make sure your car is in top shape</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A perfectly planned itinerary is only as good as the car getting you there. A few weeks before you depart, take your car in for a regular maintenance check, says AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz. That way, you won’t be delayed if your car needs a repair that might take a few days. Make sure your tire pressure, car battery, oil levels, and windshield wipers are in working order. Try to fill up your gas tank or charge your car the night before you leave home and each subsequent night of the trip.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Don’t forget to pack the essentials (like snacks)</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Aside from the clothes and other necessities you plan on bringing with you, there are a number of things you should have in your car to keep comfortable or in case of a breakdown. Diaz suggests having jumper cables, a flashlight, wet wipes or baby wipes, and a first aid kit on hand. Depending on the time of year, you might want to keep blankets or personal fans around. Have multiple chargers for your phone, tablet, or other devices in case you lose one or more than one person needs to charge up at a time. Blalock recommends packing a portable tire inflator and a kit for repairing a flat tire. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Desir Corbett and Highley suggest packing a cooler stocked with easy-to-eat, nonperishable meals, like sandwiches, yogurt pouches, granola bars, nuts, popcorn, and water — items that won’t melt or make a mess. Desir Corbett recommends bananas, grapes, cheese, and crackers for kid roadtrippers since they’re not too sugary or sticky.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Take safety seriously</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While you may be motivated to barrel through an eight-hour drive, experts suggest taking a break or switching out drivers every two hours or so. “Drowsy driving, just like distracted driving, is a problem and can be very dangerous,” Diaz says. Try to depart in the morning on each day of your trip to maximize daylight driving. Either find a rest stop, fast food spot, or an interesting attraction to take a break and stretch your legs. If you have kids with you, expect to stop more frequently, Desir Corbett says. Try to find a park or a rest stop with a playground so they can burn off energy. And always keep your phone away and on do not disturb while you’re driving. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Don’t annoy your travel companions</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re traveling with kids, you’ll want to make sure they’re comfortable and entertained. In Desir Corbett’s experience traveling with a toddler, limited-mess snacks and drinks are a must, as is entertainment. “We’re not afraid to pull out our iPad, and we have some holders in the back of our car,” she says. “We may put on one of his favorite shows. We also try to put on his favorite music.” Make sure any devices are fully charged (and you have backup chargers handy) and download movies or shows in case you lose service.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Diaz recommends playing games with kids, like imagining where the other cars on the road are heading. “Try to get their imagination going and engage with them,” she says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As for the adults in the car, Blalock likes to assign roles to passengers to help keep the peace. Knowing who is in charge of navigation, music, snacks, and driving holds everyone accountable. Let passengers have some time to themselves if need be. For example, Blalock says her daughter occasionally pops in headphones and listens to her own music during their road trips.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Keeping the car clean and organized can prevent fights, Blalock says. Have a bag for trash and organizational bins for other essentials, like camping supplies, food, and hygiene products.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Regardless of who you’re traveling with, road trips can be the perfect opportunity to choose your own adventure and uncover offbeat treasures along the way. Just make sure to do your homework first.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nothing prepares a casual Olympics fan for falling in love with a sport they know nothing about.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During the gymnastics trials in Milwaukee this year, I waited to watch Simone Biles, Suni Lee, and the rest of the ladies dazzle with their awesome skills. Could we get the men’s competition over with already?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet there I was, transfixed as the men’s team went through their routines. Yes, the men showed massive feats of strength and ability, but they also had a certain … rizz? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I wasn’t alone in watching men’s gymnastics for the first time. The US men’s team’s bronze win in the Paris 2024 Olympics left many awestruck at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4phBsrPsYAo">athletes they underestimated</a> or <a href="https://x.com/njdlauren/status/1817985576056082697">didn’t know much about</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The American women gymnasts have outperformed the men in the Olympics for decades. But this week’s win brought a new amount of attention to US men’s artistic gymnastics, ending a 16-year run of watching other countries beat them to the podium.</p>

<iframe frameBorder="0" height="200" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP5255415754" width="100%"></iframe>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps no one personified this turnaround better than “<a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/who-is-pommel-horse-guy.html">Pommel Horse Guy</a>” — Stephen Nedoroscik, whose only event was pommel horse, and was constantly featured on camera in a state of meditation, eyes closed in Clark Kent style glasses, all while his teammates (Brody Malone, Frederick Richard, Asher Hong, and Paul Juda) were hitting it big in their routines.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They did their jobs, but to clinch a medal, Nedoroscik had to do his. The glasses came off, Nedoroscik perfectly pommeled, and the internet went wild. </p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beijing 2008 was the last time the US men’s team won a medal, taking home America’s first bronze in the team event. “We believe that absolutely stimulated an interest in men&#8217;s gymnastics,” Justin Spring, who was part of that winning group, told <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-podcast"><em>Today, Explained</em></a>. “It&#8217;s got to be cool.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But that momentum wouldn’t last. After retiring from competition, Spring went on to become head coach for men’s gymnastics at the University of Illinois. Throughout his tenure, he saw a troubling trend of colleges across the US cutting men’s gymnastics programs. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Back in the 1970s, more than 150 universities had men’s gymnastics programs. Today there are only <a href="https://web3.ncaa.org/directory/memberList?type=12&amp;division=I&amp;sportCode=MGY">12 Division I teams</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the culprits that some observers have pointed to is the need to comply with Title IX programs and balancing budgets. (Title IX forbids discrimination based on sex in schools that receive federal funds.) According to this view, in order to achieve equity between men’s and women’s athletics, schools tended to cut men’s sports like swimming, diving, track and field, and gymnastics.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There are so few opportunities outside of the Olympics and NCAA scholarships that it&#8217;s hard to keep kids in the sport,” said Lauren Hopkins, founder of the GymTernet blog, on <em>Today, Explained.</em> </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How is a sport to thrive — and win medals — if the pickings are slim?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Newly minted Paris 2024 bronze medalist Fred Richard has made it a big deal to bring all eyes back to the sport. “You know, we&#8217;re in a sport where there&#8217;s not as many viewers. You know, it&#8217;s a much smaller sport, especially on the men&#8217;s side,” Richard told Good Morning America before a segment recreating his popular TikTok <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@frederickflips?lang=en">@frederickflips</a> of somersaulting into the air and landing into a pair of shorts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That video is part of a steady stream of content that’s helped him amass more than a million followers on the app — and, men’s gymnastics fans hope, will prod more boys to join the sport.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The men’s gymnastics pipeline, explained</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the 1940s and ’50s, high schools in every state had some kind of boys gymnastics programs. Today, that’s <a href="https://theleanberets.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/A-History-of-United-States-Artistic-Gymnastics-GROSSFELD.pdf">all but disappeared</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Spring says boys have to start training super young. “It’s discipline, focus, unbelievable strength, and technical precision from the age of 5. And I think that is why it’s not a sport for everyone.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a reality that gymnasts — of any gender — usually start their Olympic journey while they’re still learning how to read. Fred Richard was competing at <a href="https://www.michigandaily.com/sports/i-dont-know-if-its-an-addiction-if-its-a-lifestyle-it-just-is-fred-richards-lifelong-journey-with-gymnastics/">age 5</a>. Asher Hong’s parents <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/texas-sports-nation/olympics/article/houston-gymnast-asher-hong-paris-us-olympics-19547328.php">told the Houston Chronicle </a>he was gunning for the Olympics at age 6. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A majority of the 2024 men’s team were collegiate athletes, including all the guys from the 2024 Paris Olympics who either went to Stanford or Michigan.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Almost every collegiate institution is a mini national training center,&#8221; said Spring. “You just cannot supplement, provide support for Olympic athletes better than a collegiate program does. You have nutritionists. You have sport’s psychologist, you have multiple coaches.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To get to college, you have to be the best of the best for a dwindling amount of college recruiters. And for those who can’t afford college, you have to compete for a limited amount of scholarships.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think a lot of kids, once they hit 13, 14, 15, and they realize they’re not going to be at the same level as the guys that are getting the scholarships, in their minds, there’s probably no reason at this point,” said Hopkins of the GymTernet blog. “And putting in all that extra effort and hours and work, it’s easier for them to kind of drop down and do other sports that aren’t as demanding. A lot of them will go into diving or track and field, where there’s just more opportunities for college programs to take them in.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Adding insult to injury, you can already be an athlete at a university, and your program can still be cut.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The decline of NCAA programs</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Shane Wiskus, a member of the US’s 2020 Tokyo Olympic team, is also an alternate for this year’s Paris Olympics. He was a senior at the University of Minnesota, where his team placed second in the NCAA championships. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Afterward, the men’s gymnastics program was <a href="https://gophersports.com/news/2020/9/10/an-open-letter-to-the-university-of-minnesota-athletics-community">cut</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“My first thought is the next generation and even the guys on my team that are behind me, I was thinking a lot about them,” <a href="https://www.fox9.com/news/gophers-star-gymnast-shane-wiskus-reacts-to-university-of-minnesotas-plan-to-cut-mens-program">Wiskus told Fox 9 Minneapolis</a>. “And the missed opportunity that they won’t have that I had going through these programs.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Title IX has been blamed for the decimation of men’s college gymnastics. On paper, universities had to make sure that the percentages of male and female athletes are about the same as the percentages of male and female students enrolled at the school.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some schools have <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-some-schools-sidestep-title-ixs-protections-for-women">gotten creative</a> to get in compliance with Title IX. And while there are options to create more women’s sports or cut some men’s, many colleges have chosen the latter, citing budget concerns.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/college-sports-cuts-gymnastics-swimming-pandemic-60-minutes-2020-12-06/">In a <em>60 Minutes</em> interview,</a> historian Victoria Jackson, who specializes in the history of college sports at ASU, said, “Every time there&#8217;s an economic downturn, you protect the core business, which is football. Which means that other sports are on the chopping block.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sports like football and basketball bring in hundreds of millions in revenue each year from ticket sales to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/04/ncaa-and-espn-ink-8-year-920-million-media-rights-deal.html">television contracts.</a> Men’s gymnastics just doesn’t have that pull. Since the onset of COVID-19, championship-winning men’s programs have been cut. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mike Burns, who was head men’s gymnastics coach for 17 years at the University of Minnesota, told Vox he’s not giving up.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“They pissed off the wrong 62-year-old from Boston who teaches cartwheels for a living,” Burns said, “that’s gonna be the thing they wish they hadn&#8217;t done, because there’s gonna be a fight.” </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Staying alive</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now that Minnesota men’s gymnastics is no longer part of the school’s athletic roster, Burns and other volunteers have spun off the 117-year-old program into a club sport supported by the school’s Office of Student Affairs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In June 2024, they were officially <a href="https://www.startribune.com/mens-gymnastics-university-of-minnesota-leaving-cooke-hall-practice-facility-mike-burns/600372508?refresh=true">kicked out</a> of their beloved practice gym, Cooke Hall, a place they’ve practiced since the 1930s, to make space for diving.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They’ve had to get scrappy by creating the nonprofit Friends of Minnesota Gymnastics, whose board is staffed by former alumni. From donations and other fundraising efforts like hosting gymnastic meets, Burns said the association is able to raise about a tenth of what the University of Minnesota offered a year. Students who used to train at the university now have to drive about 45 minutes to train.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“My one desire is to keep this program alive,” said Burns. “And I’m going to do everything in my power to do so.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When asked about this new class of Olympians in Paris, Burns mentions how Fred Richard “brings the confidence and cockiness that I just love every time I see that kid.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He said that’s the sort of thing that can make men’s gymnastics contagious. But he admits the US has a long way to go if they’re going to reach silver and gold without the state-sponsored resources offered by powerhouses like China and Russia. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The fact is: Olympic medals bring lots of attention, and attention is currency. The question is whether this year’s athletes can hold onto it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s a strange question: What if the greatest threat to the United States is our own Constitution?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even if you think the American Constitution is the most brilliant political document in human history (and it arguably is), it was written in the late 18th century, which means it’s a product of a very different world than the one we currently inhabit.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">America was an agrarian slave society at the time of the founding. The citizenry was confined to white, property-owning males. People lived in small, self-contained communities. All of these anachronisms are reflected in the Constitution, not just in the treatment of race but in the structure of the government itself. The Electoral College, the unrepresentative Senate, the Supreme Court — these are all deeply undemocratic institutions and they’re becoming unsustainable in an increasingly polarized society.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We could change the Constitution, of course, but there’s a problem. While the Constitution is open to revision, the truth is that it has become almost impossible to revise. The result is a political system that feels permanently stuck.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Erwin Chemerinsky is the dean of the law school at UC Berkeley and the author of a new book called <a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9781324091585"><em>No Democracy Lasts Forever: How the Constitution Threatens the United States</em></a>. Chemerinsky’s book makes a pretty convincing case that we’re in trouble if we don’t find a way to seriously reform — or even rewrite — the Constitution.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So I invited him on <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> to talk about how we got here and why he’s not sure there’s any viable path forward. As always, there’s <em>much</em> more in the full podcast, so listen and follow <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/id1081584611">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6NOJ6IkTb2GWMj1RpmtnxP">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://www.pandora.com/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/PC:30793?source=stitcher-sunset">Pandora</a>, or wherever you find podcasts.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What are the biggest problems with the Constitution at this moment?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Erwin Chemerinsky</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Right now I would say the Electoral College and two senators per state are what pose the greatest threat to democracy. But if you asked me what was the worst choice historically, I’d say it was what the framers did with regard to slavery and race — that has haunted this country from the beginning.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is, as you know, a pretty common defense of the anti-democratic features of the Constitution, which goes something like this: Democracy is great but we also need protections from the tyranny of the majority, we need a firewall against all the vulnerabilities of democracy in order to protect it from itself. Do you buy this argument?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Erwin Chemerinsky</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes and no. The yes is that the Constitution is inherently anti-democratic. The Constitution is meant to limit what the majority can do at any point in time, and I believe in that. I don’t think it should be as difficult to change as the current Constitution, but I accept we should be governed by a document that’s more difficult to change than just any other statute or ordinance. I also believe in checks and balances. I think one of the good things in the Constitution to help prevent tyranny is the diffusion of power among several branches of government.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the other hand, I don’t think the Electoral College helps to prevent tyranny. I don’t think the Electoral College is in any way a check on democracy. It’s just a terrible way of choosing a president. I don’t think two senators per state has anything to do with protecting our democracy. So my answer is yes, there are features in the Constitution to protect democracy and that’s a good thing, but the things that we’re talking about now, the Electoral College and the Senate, don’t in any way contribute to protecting democracy.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Is there another advanced liberal democracy anywhere in the world that has equivalent institutions to the Senate and the Electoral College?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Erwin Chemerinsky</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They’re unique to the United States. There’s not any other country in the world that has a popular election for its chief executive, in which a person who loses the popular vote can be chosen. In parliamentary systems there might be a way in which you can put together coalitions to make that happen, but nothing like the Electoral College and nothing like the United States Senate, where every state gets two senators regardless of the size of the state.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the time the Constitution was written, the difference between a populous state like Virginia and the least populous state like Delaware was about nine to one. Today, the difference in population between Wyoming and California is 68 to one. In the last session of Congress, there were 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans, but the 50 Democratic Senators represented 40 million more people than the 50 Republican Senators. And the filibuster, which changed greatly and formed in the 1970s, makes it possible for a small minority of senators representing a small minority of the population to be able to block virtually any legislation.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Supreme Court, for obvious reasons, gets a lot of attention in your book. What is the Court supposed to be doing and what is it actually doing?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Erwin Chemerinsky</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Supreme Court is there to enforce the Constitution, to give a document written in broad language contemporary meaning. The Constitution is meant to limit what the government can do, the kind of check we were talking about before, and the limits of the Constitution only have meaning if they’re enforced, and that’s what the courts are about.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think the current Supreme Court, for so many reasons, is itself a threat to democracy. Some of that has to do with specific decisions of the Supreme Court, like <em>Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</em>, which allowed corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money on elections. Or <em>Shelby County v. Holder</em>, which gutted key provisions of the Voting Rights Act. Or <em><a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/27/18681923/supreme-court-gerrymandering-partisan-rucho-common-cause">Rucho v. Common Cause</a></em>, which says that no federal court can hear a challenge to partisan gerrymandering, no matter how egregious. And I also think that the Hall of Shame is going to include <em>Trump v. United States</em> from July 1, 2024, which gives the president very broad absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for almost anything done in office.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Is that decision about presidential immunity as bad as it sounds?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Erwin Chemerinsky</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes, it’s that bad. The Supreme Court basically said that anytime the president is using a power that’s created by the Constitution or statute, the president cannot be criminally prosecuted. So if the president uses his power as commander-in-chief to call out the military to assassinate a political rival, that’s part of the president’s constitutional powers. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the president says to the Justice Department, “I want you to prosecute somebody as retribution” — and this shouldn’t be hypothetical because Donald Trump has said, including at the debate, he wants to do that. If a president wants to sell pardons, since the pardon power is an official power under the Constitution, the president can’t be prosecuted. And the Supreme Court said explicitly that the motive of the president doesn’t matter. So the fact that the president is acting to get rid of a political rival or for retribution or for personal monetary gain, isn’t something to be considered. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think what’s happened here, and feel free to disagree, is that the Republican Party decided a long time ago that they were going to use one of the most undemocratic institutions in our system, the Supreme Court, to execute a political project without democratic support or accountability, which they have done, which means the Court is now a blunt political instrument, which is how we ended up with decisions like this.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Erwin Chemerinsky</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Supreme Court has always played the role that you attribute to it now. Everything you said about the current Court, conservatives would say about <a href="https://supremecourthistory.org/history-of-the-courts/warren-court-1953-1969/">the Warren Court</a>. Now, I agree with what the Warren Court was doing, finally ending apartheid in the country, striking down the Jim Crow laws, etc. I agree with what the Warren Court was doing in equalizing voting power by ending male apportionment of legislatures. I agree with what the Warren Court was doing for the first time, providing basic protections under the Constitution for the rights of criminal suspects and defendants. But everything you say about the court arrogating power to itself today is what conservatives said about the Warren Court.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The argument against this Supreme Court, and the one I basically just made, is that it’s overstepping its bounds, but it sounds like you think that’s not quite right, that it’s more about the values driving it and the undemocratic consequences of its decisions.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Erwin Chemerinsky</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The problem with the Roberts Court’s decision is that they’re based on values that are inconsistent with what the Constitution was about. Take the example of<em> Trump v. The United States</em>, absolute presidential immunity. I think that the framers of the Constitution made a value judgment that they didn’t want to create a king. They did not want to have royal prerogatives. But I also think in addition to being ideological, the problem with this court is also methodological. They embrace the view that the Constitution means what it did in 1787 or 1791 or 1868 when the 14th Amendment was adopted, which is a terrible way to approach the Constitution.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President Biden <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/363557/supreme-court-biden-kamala-harris-reform-term-limits-ethics">just proposed</a> term limits and an ethics code for the Supreme Court. Does that seem wise or doable?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Erwin Chemerinsky</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think an ethics code passed by Congress would be wise and doable. There was no ethics code for the Supreme Court until it adopted its own in November of 2023, and then it was a watered-down version compared to what applies to all other federal and all state judges. They took the word “shall,” which is mandatory, and made it “should,” which is advisory. They had no enforcement mechanism. And I think that the lack of an ethics code for the Supreme Court tarnishes not just that court, but all courts in the country.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In terms of term limits, I strongly favor 18-year non-renewable terms. I favored it for a very long time. My own view, unfortunately, is I don’t think that Congress can impose term limits, certainly not ones on current justices, by statute. I think it requires a constitutional amendment. The understanding of Article Three has always been that when somebody is confirmed for the Supreme Court, it’s their position for life unless they choose to resign. I don’t think Congress can change that by statute — I think it would take a constitutional amendment. A constitutional amendment could make it retroactive and apply it to current justices. I would certainly favor that.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How would you triage all the reforms you think we need?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Erwin Chemerinsky</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If I had a magic wand to change the Constitution, the most essential thing I’d do is eliminate the Electoral College and eliminate two senators per state. I don’t think the path this country is on is sustainable in the long term. I hope I am wrong. I’ve never before written a book where I say at the end that I hope everything that I’ve said in this book is incorrect, but I think there’s a widespread sense on both the left and the right that there’s a crisis facing our democracy, and the question is, where will it go? Will we drift toward authoritarianism? I was chilled to see J.D. Vance, now the Republican candidate for vice president, saying that what the country should emulate is Hungary and Viktor Orbán, an autocrat.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As I say on the first page of the book, no democracy lasts forever. Democracies are there until they’re not. But my hope is that when the country sees that abyss, it will recoil and it will do the things to fix it. And so I don’t think there’s going to be a new constitution next year or maybe in my lifetime, but it’s time to begin thinking of one that corrects these problems. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the shorter term, there can be things like an ethics code for Supreme Court justices passed by Congress. Congress can eliminate partisan gerrymandering for congressional seats — that just takes a statute. Congress can get rid of the filibuster. There are several things that can be done without a constitutional amendment or a new constitution.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I don’t know how these things get done because, as you admit, doing so will have explicit advantages and disadvantages for each side, and so you can’t get enough consensus to do anything. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Erwin Chemerinsky</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I fear you’re right, though I also believe that there are solutions, and again my hope is that if the country faces the abyss, they’ll recoil and come up with solutions. But I want to strongly agree with what you say that the Constitution assumes that those who occupy office will act in good faith and follow certain norms.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Let me give you a couple of examples. Throughout American history, when there’s been a vacancy on the Supreme Court, even late in a president’s term, the president’s nominees have been appointed and confirmed by the Senate. There was a vacancy in 1956, just a month before the presidential election, President Eisenhower named a Democrat, William Brennan, and the Senate confirmed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What we saw instead was when Antonin Scalia died in February 2016, Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, said, “We’re not going to hold hearings and we’re not going to consider whoever President Obama nominates. We shouldn’t let a lame-duck president pick a Supreme Court nominee.” Nonetheless, when Ruth Bader Ginsburg died in September of 2020, the Republicans rushed through and confirmed Amy Coney Barrett just days before the presidential election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Throughout American history, until January of 2021, incumbent presidents who lost left the White House. It started with John Adams in 1800. It continued through George H.W. Bush in 1992, but Donald Trump did everything he could to subvert the election. These are examples of norms that have to be followed and they’ve been transgressed.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You pose an interesting question early in the book: Was it better to have one nation with a constitution that institutionalized slavery, or would it have been better for the country in 1787 to just split into two smaller countries?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Erwin Chemerinsky</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I ask my students this every time I teach constitutional law, whether they’re law students or undergraduates. From the perspective of hindsight, I ask if it would’ve been better to have two countries, a country that repudiated slavery and a country that accepted slavery? I think the reason that those who strongly favored abolition thought one country was better is they thought that slavery would naturally fade away. That didn’t happen. Slavery dominated every political issue up until the Civil War.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As we sit here today, I think it’s much better that the country stayed together and that we continue to be one United States. On the other hand, I worry that if we don’t fix the flaws, there will be great pressure toward secession, not next year but in the longer term, because I think the hard question is: Is what unites us as a country greater than what divides us as a country? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’ll make what I think is a very frightening prediction: If Donald Trump wins in November of 2024 and the Republicans take both houses of Congress, we will hear the first serious discussion of secession since the Civil War. I think there will be discussion of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/11/10/politics/calexit-donald-trump/index.html">Calexit</a>. I don’t think much will come of it now, but from that discussion, the longer-term could be quite cataclysmic changes. I am not advocating it. I am not predicting that it’s imminent, but I do think the divide between the red states and the blue states is so great that people will ask if it still makes sense to be one country.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">An Olympic women’s boxing match — and misinformation about one of the athletes involved — is now being used by conservatives to promote their anti-trans agenda.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/aug/01/angela-carini-abandons-fight-after-46-seconds-against-imane-khelif">On Thursday,</a> Algerian boxer Imane Khelif faced off against Italian boxer Angela Carini, winning in 46 seconds after Carini abruptly pulled out of the fight. Following the match, Carini burst into tears and declined to shake Khelif’s hand, telling reporters that she withdrew due to the intensity of her opponent’s initial punches. “I put an end to the match because after the second blow,” Carini said, “I felt a strong pain in my nose.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That reaction has since spawned scrutiny of Khelif, who was assigned female at birth and identifies as a woman. False claims that she is a trans person or that she is a man pretending to be a woman quickly spread thanks to reports she was <a href="https://www.iba.sport/news/statement-made-by-the-international-boxing-association-regarding-athletes-disqualifications-in-world-boxing-championships-2023/">disqualified from a 2023 International Boxing Association event</a> and the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sports/olympics/boxing-two-boxers-who-failed-gender-tests-world-championships-cleared-games-2024-07-29/">resurfacing of comments</a> by the president of that organization suggesting that her elimination was because she failed a hormone test.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The inaccurate statements about her identity were boosted by prominent anti-trans individuals <a href="https://x.com/jk_rowling/status/1819335159591604560">like <em>Harry Potter</em> author J.K. Rowling,</a> as well as politicians like US <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1819085100363272282">Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance</a> and conservative <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/culture-war-women-boxing-angela-carini-olympics-imane-khalif-testosterone-giorgia-meloni/">Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni</a>. Their statements stirred up a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/olympics/boxer-quits-gender-angela-carini-imane-khelif.html">storm of anger on the right</a> despite the fact that Khelif is a cisgender woman. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/364032/trans-athletes-olympics-2024">As Vox’s Alex Abad-Santos has explained</a>, there aren’t any <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/trans-athletes-paris-olympics/">transgender athletes</a> at the Olympics this year who are competing outside of the sex they were assigned at birth, though IOC rules don’t bar their inclusion so long as they meet certain eligibility criteria. “There has been some confusion that somehow it’s a man fighting a woman,” <a href="https://www.today.com/health/news/imane-khelif-boxer-gender-eligibility-controversy-rcna164854">International Olympic Committee (IOC) spokesperson Mark Adams</a> told reporters. “The question you have to ask yourself is, are these athletes women? The answer is yes.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The 2024 Olympic boxing match between Imane Khelif and Angela Carini, explained&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During their match this week, Carini and Khelif competed against one another in their respective first fights of this Olympics. Olympic boxing contests group competitors by weight class and operate in a knockout fashion, meaning the winner of a match moves forward while the loser is eliminated. Both had also previously competed in Tokyo, with Carini getting eliminated in her first bout during those Olympics, and Khelif getting eliminated in her second bout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The two fighters started the round trading blows; after Carini paused the match to adjust her headgear, Khelif went on the offensive, landing a solid punch to her opponent’s face. Rather than continue, Carini, pulling at her nose, relinquished the competition completely. That’s atypical for a boxing match, which often includes three rounds of combat.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As the referee prepared to call the match, Carini told her team, “It’s not fair.” Carini could then be seen dropping to her knees and refusing any attempts at a handshake or other customary gestures of sportsmanship from Khelif.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The match may have passed unnoticed except for the controversy that erupted after it, which was fueled by events that occurred more than a year before it even began.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2023, Kehlif and Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-ting hoped to compete in the boxing world championships held by the International Boxing Association (IBA) in New Delhi, India. Kehlif and Lin were disqualified by the IBA, and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/who-is-olympian-imane-khelif-an-algerian-woman-boxer-is-facing-anti-trans-backlash#:~:text=Khelif%20reached%20the%20final%20of,of%20testosterone%20in%20her%20system.">press reports suggested</a> that it was because they failed a test of some sort and had elevated testosterone levels. The <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sports/olympics/boxing-two-boxers-who-failed-gender-tests-world-championships-cleared-games-2024-07-29/">IBA’s president reportedly told a Russia outlet</a> at the time that both Khelif and Lin had “XY chromosomes” — a chromosomal composition most commonly seen in those assigned male at birth.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Exactly what led to this statement is unclear. The IBA did not disclose documentation at the time or reveal what tests were conducted. Questions were also raised because the organization, which was led by Russian official Umar Kremlev, did not disqualify Khelif until after she had already beaten a Russian boxer.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent days, the <a href="https://www.iba.sport/news/statement-made-by-the-international-boxing-association-regarding-athletes-disqualifications-in-world-boxing-championships-2023/">IBA released a statement</a> claiming that in 2023, Khelif and Lin “did not undergo a testosterone examination but were subject to a separate and recognized test, whereby the specifics remain confidential.” The statement also said the test “conclusively indicated that both athletes … have competitive advantages over other female competitors.” Both Khelif and Lin had also competed in the 2022 world championships, also administered by the IBA the year before.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The IBA’s 2023 decision was heavily criticized by the IOC, which deemed it “arbitrary” and not transparent. Both athletes competed without issue in the Olympics in 2021. At the time, neither medaled, and both lost to multiple female opponents. Adding to the confusion is the fact that the IOC has declared the IBA an unreliable steward of global boxing: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/22/ioc-expels-international-boxing-association-olympic-movement">Officials banished the group from regulating the sport at the Olympic level</a> due to concerns over its financial dealings, leadership, and allegations of match-fixing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The lack of clarity about what happened in 2023 has helped mis- and disinformation about Khelif to fester. The IOC, however, has been clear that Khelif and Lin qualify to compete based on its rules.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those do not include sex testing, which the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/olympics/boxer-quits-gender-angela-carini-imane-khelif.html">IOC abandoned in 2000</a> and which has long been scrutinized for operating off <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/sex-testing-in-the-olympics-and-other-elite-sports-is-based-on-flawed/">questionable and flawed science</a>. The committee does still disqualify some athletes who have Differences of Sexual Development (DSD), “a group of rare conditions involving genes, hormones and reproductive organs,” <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sports/olympics/olympics-dsd-rules-focus-womens-boxing-2024-07-31/">per Reuters</a>. When it comes to DSDs, IOC rules governing eligibility use factors like safety and fairness to determine who can compete.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyond questions of sex, there are racial dynamics at play in the perceptions of this match. Female athletes of color — particularly those of African and African American descent — have long been accused of being men when they’ve beaten white women in competition. This happened most notably with tennis phenom <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/gender-debates-around-the-2024-olympics-people-still-fear-powerful-women#:~:text=Former%20Olympian%20Aly%20Raisman%20and,Caster%20Semenya%20faced%20intense%20scrutiny">Serena Williams and track star Caster Semenya</a>, both of whom endured tropes that <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/hannaheko/aint-i-a-woman">cast Black women as more masculine and threatening</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Following the attention on this week’s match, Carini has said she’d like to apologize to Khelif: “If the I.O.C. said she can fight, I respect that decision.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other boxers have expressed they aren’t concerned about competing against Khelif. “I don’t care about the press story and social media,” said Anna Luca Hamori, a boxer from Hungary who will compete against Khelif next. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sports/olympics/taiwans-lin-beats-uzbek-turdibekova-amid-fierce-gender-row-2024-08-02/">Lin’s first match proceeded as planned</a> — like Khelif, she won.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The attention is being used to advance conservatives’ agenda</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The facts of Khelif’s Olympic journey have not gotten in the way of the false narrative that exploded in the wake of her win. Her victory proved to be an opportunity for those with transphobic views to score rhetorical and political points.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rowling and other prominent anti-trans figures like Tesla CEO Elon Musk were quick to spread lies and cite the boxing match as an example of why they believe it is important to back stark gender binaries. “We object because we saw a male punching a female,” <a href="https://x.com/jk_rowling/status/1819335159591604560">Rowling wrote in a post on X.</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">US conservatives who&nbsp;misattributed and questioned Khelif’s gender identity also used the fight to weaponize the anti-trans rhetoric they’ve utilized in the past to activate their voter base. <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1819085100363272282">Vance was quick to wrongly link</a> Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris to the international boxing match in a nonsensical post, writing on X, “This is where Kamala Harris’s ideas about gender lead: to a grown man pummeling a woman in a boxing match.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://mynbc15.com/news/nation-world/trump-vows-to-keep-men-out-of-womens-sports-after-olympic-gender-controversy-donald-trump-angela-carini-imane-khelif-paris-olympics-boxing-sports-transgender">Former President Donald Trump similarly wrote on Truth Social</a> that he would “keep men out of women’s sports.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/23631262/trans-bills-republican-state-legislatures">As Vox’s Nicole Narea and Fabiola Cineas have explained,</a> this sort of rhetoric on the part of GOP leaders is tied to an explosion of anti-trans legislation in states across the country focused on bathroom access, women’s sports, and gender-affirming care for minors. Collectively, these bills have sought to frame trans people as a threat and to stoke fear among GOP voters.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Women’s sports is an arena where the GOP has leaned into this messaging because they see it as activating religious Republicans, including Evangelical voters, and potentially <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3745559-lgbtq-groups-slam-walker-for-ad-attacking-transgender-athletes/">resonating with more moderate women, too</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Trans issues in particular challenge … biblical concepts of gender,” Sophie Bjork-James, a Vanderbilt University anthropologist who studies the religious right, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/3/29/23660580/nashville-shooting-conservatives-anti-trans-statements">previously told Vox.</a> “Evangelicals tend to believe that men and women have very different qualities that are innate in us. I think there’s a huge interest in maintaining a gender binary because it really does provide a foundation for their theology and their everyday lives.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Republican state legislatures including those in Tennessee and Texas have successfully passed bills that limit athletes to participating in sports for the sex they were assigned at birth. The attacks on Khelif are just the latest manifestation of such ideas. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Intel stock is tumbling amid news that the company will lay off 15 percent of its staff after a steep decline in revenue and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-discloses-financials-foundry-business-2024-04-02/">billions in losses in its chip foundry business</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/02/intel-share-plunge-drags-down-global-chip-stocks-from-tsmc-to-samsung.html">largest drop for the company in half a century</a>; at Friday’s closing bell, shares were trading at $21.48 — a price not seen since 2013.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The company is scrambling to shore up reserves by introducing layoffs and suspending stock dividends. But even those moves may not be enough to return the veteran tech company to its once-vaunted spot as an industry leader, especially in the face of heavy competition, particularly from <a href="https://www.vox.com/business-and-finance/357250/nvidia-stock-shareholder-ai-investor-market-capitalization-bubble">rival chipmaker Nvidia</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Intel’s bad week really is more of a bad quarter: It started back in April, when <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-discloses-financials-foundry-business-2024-04-02/">the company revealed during an investor presentation</a> that its chip manufacturing unit had, through a series of poor decisions, sustained $7 billion in losses in 2023, on top of a 31 percent decrease in revenue from 2022. Cost-cutting and other measures will save the company $10 billion in 2025, <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/actions-accelerate-our-progress.html#gs.cgovp0">according to CEO Pat Gelsinger</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Semiconductor technology — which is crucial to everything from our phones to operating airplanes — was the foundation of Intel’s business when the company started in the 1960s. (Co-founder Gordon Moore was responsible for Moore’s Law, which theorized that semiconductor power would grow exponentially smaller, more powerful, and less expensive over time.) But as the company’s recent announcements indicate, Intel is no longer the innovative leader it once was. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are also concerns about the global semiconductor industry — shares of other major chip companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Samsung were down at closing on Friday, too, and <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nvidia-faces-doj-antitrust-probe-over-complaints-from-rivals">industry leader Nvidia is reportedly facing an antitrust investigation by the Department of Justice</a>. But Intel is in a particularly difficult position.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How did things get so bad for Intel?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is not the first time the company has had to implement cost-cutting measures — Intel did <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-27/intel-cuts-sales-forecasts-pledges-further-cost-reductions?sref=qYiz2hd0">mass layoffs</a> back in October 2022, after a brief, Covid-powered bump in the company’s fortunes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“In February ’22, they put out revenue targets that — I mean, I use the phrase outlandish, they were ridiculously high,” <a href="https://www.semi.org/en/connect/events/industry-strategy-symposium-iss-2024-speaker-abstract-bio-stacy-rasgon">Stacy Rasgon</a>, senior analyst at Bernstein Research, told Vox. “They were sizing the company and sizing the investments to that COVID level of revenue,” based on the need for technology that allowed people to work from home or for kids to attend school remotely — a business that collapsed nearly as quickly as it arose.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the current CEO, Pat Gelsinger, inherited a business that was coming off a decade of stumbles when he started in 2021. “He came into a situation that they were dire straits; they had no competitive product to really bring to market,” while Jensen Huang’s Nvidia dominated the curve on AI tech, Daniel Newman, CEO of the Futurum Group, told Vox.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Intel’s <a href="https://www.hpcwire.com/2021/03/24/intel-invests-10b-in-new-foundry-business/">other recent big bet</a> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-discloses-financials-foundry-business-2024-04-02/">has been its foundry business</a> — <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000089875/programs/intel-corporation.html">three facilities in the US and three overseas to manufacture semiconductor chips</a>, with other facilities in Asia and Latin America for testing and assembly. But that’s gotten a bumpy start; for instance, Intel declined to invest in cost-effective extreme ultraviolet machines for its manufacturing facilities, then had to outsource 30 percent of the manufacturing to a rival company, TSMC.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Intel is no longer ahead of the technological pack</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Historically, Intel has been the company that was pushing the leading edge,” Newman said. But in the lead-up to Gelsinger’s tenure, the company “missed the AI transition,” he said —&nbsp;and companies like Nvidia, AMD, and TSMC, which are manufacturing semiconductor chips that can be used to accelerate AI technology, filled the market.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nvidia, in particular, has become a dominant force. <a href="https://www.vox.com/business-and-finance/357250/nvidia-stock-shareholder-ai-investor-market-capitalization-bubble">As my colleague Nicole Narea explained</a>, some of the technical capabilities of its earlier work in graphics cards for gaming translated well to the needs of generative AI. Starting in 2018, well before ChatGPT came on the scene, the company bet big on that possibility:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">The company structured its research and development and mergers and acquisitions strategies to benefit from a coming AI boom.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">“They were playing the game when nobody else was,” Newman said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Intel is now trying to catch up with <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/processors/ai-accelerators/gaudi-overview.html">its Gaudi technology</a>, but in the meantime, companies that used to use Intel products are shifting away from the company. Apple, for instance, switched from Intel processors to manufacturing their own processors in 2020 and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-appears-to-have-shunned-nvidia-chips-for-google-ai-2024-7">reportedly relied on Google to build Apple Intelligence</a> —&nbsp;Intel wasn’t even in the running.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Intel will survive (for now), on the money saved from the layoffs and dividend pause. Government subsidies from the CHIPs Act, and investments from hedge funds like Brookstone and Apollo, which have bought into the foundry business, will also help.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think they are a critical infrastructure company to the US and to the world,” Newman said. But getting back on track will depend on making sure the foundry business becomes profitable.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Even if they’re number two, or number three behind Samsung, we still need it — this demand for AI change, nobody can go fast enough,” Newman told Vox.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But even if Intel can slot itself into that number two or three spot, there’s still the question of AI’s place in the tech sector and society —&nbsp;whether it needs to be more tightly regulated, or if it’s getting overhyped.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“In general for AI, people are just nervous that the numbers have gotten so big, so quickly, you just worry about sustainability,” Rasgon said. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For now, the silver lining of Intel’s current situation is that there’s nowhere to go but up.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">2024 was supposed to be the year MDMA, perhaps better known as “ecstasy” or “molly,” got its big break.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Until this summer, it was on track to rise out of the underground and into mainstream mental health care. Amid a lack of novel treatments for PTSD and staggering rates of veteran suicide, results from late-stage clinical trials seemed promising and advocates were hopeful the FDA would approve the drug for medical use.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then, an FDA advisory panel raised red flags about trial methodology, bias, and potential data suppression, which could imperil the future of medicinal MDMA. Now, the psychedelic drug is at a make-or-break point, with the FDA scheduled to make an announcement this month on whether it is ready to move forward as a PTSD treatment.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a three-part series, <em><a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-podcast" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-podcast">Today, Explained</a></em>’s Haleema Shah reports on the promise and precarity of MDMA. Starting with the rogue chemist and therapists in the 1980s who believed it could change psychotherapy, the series traces the decades-long effort to make a dance-floor drug medicinal, journeying through the war on drugs, the rave era, and the psychedelic renaissance to explain how a once-maligned drug became an emblem of healing — and how, no matter what the FDA decides, therapy will never be the same.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Listen to the first two episodes below or wherever you find podcasts. The final episode of the series will be published Thursday, August 8.</p>

<p>J.K. Rowling’s supporters frequently claim the author has never actually said or done anything transphobic. It’s a position you can see on social media, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/17/new-york-times-contributors-open-letter-protest-anti-trans-coverage">in the pages of the New York Times</a>, and even on <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/witch-trials-jk-rowling-podcast-essay-review.html">a new podcast</a> with Rowling herself.</p>

<p>It’s also an easily debunked lie.</p>

<p>Some of this confusion around Rowling’s opinions can be cleared up with <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/transphobia">a definition of transphobia</a>, which doesn’t — despite the “phobia” — solely<strong> </strong>mean fear of <a href="https://www.vox.com/lgbtq" data-source="encore">trans</a> people, but, per Merriam-Webster, also an “irrational fear of, aversion to, or discrimination against transgender people.”&nbsp;(In fact, Merriam-Webster’s own <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/transphobia#examples">examples list</a> cites multiple articles related to Rowling.) Rowling can say she likes everyone, but she has displayed that prejudice time and again. She’s also peddled explicit fear of trans people, particularly trans women, insisting they’re an inherently dangerous threat to cisgender women.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although some in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/opinion/jk-rowling-transphobia.html">the media</a> distort the anger directed at Rowling from trans activists, trans people, and allies, the truth is those feelings — not just anger, but betrayal and grief — are justified. Rowling has made her antagonistic position on trans issues clear through tweets, sound bites, actions, and even a <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/21285396/jk-rowling-transphobic-backlash-harry-potter">3,600-word blog post</a>. By 2024, her transphobia has become so rampant and constant that it’s difficult to build a completely comprehensive timeline of it. For those attuned to it, she doesn’t have to spell it out every single time; it’s a huge part of her identity. These dog whistles only lead to more confusion, however, allowing people to point to the absence of immediately obvious bigotry to claim she’s being unfairly maligned. Additionally, she <a href="https://www.tricitynews.com/local-news/jk-rowling-threatens-legal-action-against-coquitlam-transgender-activist-over-tweets-3123135">increasingly</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1416680018416181248">threatens detractors</a> <a href="https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2023/02/lgbtq-activist-forced-to-apologize-for-calling-jk-rowling-a-nazi-after-she-threatens-him-with-legal-action/">with legal action</a>, which contributes to critics of her behavior <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/02/bbc-apologizes-again-jk-rowling-transphobia-1235266083/">falling silent</a>. Conspicuously, many of her legal threats appear to be directed at individuals identifying as part of the LGBTQ+ community.</p>

<p>Since Rowling began airing her views, her community, especially online where many of these conversations are had, is now stacked with similarly minded people who share her transphobic beliefs. For instance, Rowling is friends with numerous anti-trans activists, including Helen Joyce, who’s made <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2022/06/03/helen-joyce-transgender-lgbtq/">alarmingly transphobic statements</a> calling for a “reduction” in the number of trans people. She’s <a href="https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1502679601335705603">tweeted</a> public support for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140626075425/http://www.columnist.org.uk/2014/05/06/caroline-farrow-is-homophobic-there-ive-said-it/">anti-gay</a>, <a href="https://thepinktriangletrust.com/tag/caroline-farrow/">anti-trans </a>activist <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2022/03/14/caroline-farrow-jk-rowling-trans-twitter/">Caroline Farrow</a>. These connections are part of a social network echo chamber of <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/9/5/20840101/terfs-radical-feminists-gender-critical">trans-exclusionary radical feminists, or TERFs</a> (sometimes called “radfems” or the “gender-critical” movement).&nbsp;In Rowling’s native UK, <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/12/19/21029874/jk-rowling-transgender-tweet-terf">TERFism has gained a unique stronghold</a> over some particularly vocal, ostensibly liberal feminists like Rowling.</p>

<p>The facts we can easily point to suggest that Rowling has been turning toward an anti-trans stance over a long period, beginning mostly with simple engagement on social media and leading to fiery and extremist statements. While labeling something transphobic is a serious accusation, and not something we do lightly, it’s important to recognize Rowling’s bigotry for what it is. The rundown that follows shows her growing embrace of transphobic, even extremist rhetoric.</p>

<p><strong>2014:</strong> Rowling writes <em>The Silkworm</em>, the second novel in the Cormoran Strike mystery series, which involves a trans woman who is <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkeynz/jk-rowlings-transphobia-wasnt-hard-to-find-she-wrote-a-book-about-it">portrayed as conspicuous and unable to pass</a>. The book includes a scene where the main character gleefully threatens this character with prison rape.</p>

<p><strong>October 2017: </strong>Rowling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180921175900/https://www.facebook.com/549800225039203/photos/a.775757485776808.1073741831.549800225039203/1714016318617582/?type=3&amp;theater">“likes” a tweet</a> linking to a controversial, since-deleted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171027163603/https://medium.com/@GappyTales/me-too-now-what-sex-the-left-and-gender-identity-236b08f194b0">Medium article</a> referring to a theoretical trans woman in a female space as “a stranger with a penis.” While liking a tweet might seem small, this is notable because the piece made the basic argument Rowling continues to make today, namely that trans women are by default part of a “male-bodied” group who are dangerous to women and who should not have access to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/5/5/11592908/transgender-bathroom-laws-rights">women’s bathrooms</a>. In the public sphere, this kicks off questions about whether Rowling is anti-trans, which are followed by the author entrenching further.</p>

<p><strong>​​2018: </strong>In March, Rowling<strong> “</strong>likes” (and then unlikes) a <a href="https://twitter.com/Philip_Ellis/status/976476549531754501">tweet</a> referring to trans women as “men in dresses” and implying that trans rights are “misogyny.” A JKR spokesperson later <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2018/03/22/jk-rowling-reps-blame-middle-aged-moment-for-liking-tweet-calling-trans-women-men-in-dresses/">claims</a> that this “like” was an accident and that Rowling was having “a middle-aged moment.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In September, Rowling “<a href="https://phaylen.medium.com/oops-she-did-it-again-transphobic-j-k-rowling-no-fox-belongs-in-a-henhouse-b3cdf0e81dd8">likes” a tweet</a> linking to an opinion column by <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2018/12/11/times-janice-turner-award-trans-rights/">known TERF Janice Turner</a>, which argues yet again that trans women are inherently sexual predators, referring to them as “fox[es] in a henhouse &#8230; identify[ing] as [hens].”&nbsp;The myth that trans women are a danger to cis women is a grossly transphobic stereotype with almost <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13178-018-0335-z">no real-world justification</a>, but Rowling pins most of her anti-trans&nbsp;arguments on it, using her experience as a survivor of domestic abuse to justify her prejudice.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>December 2019:</strong> In a shift toward openly voicing her anti-trans sentiments, Rowling <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/12/19/21029852/jk-rowling-terf-transphobia-history-timeline">vocally supports</a> the plaintiff of an employment discrimination suit in the UK. Maya Forstater became a cause célèbre in the TERF community after suing the company that chose not to renew her contract. In 2018, Forstater posted <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/j-k-rowling-s-maya-forstater-tweets-support-hostile-work-ncna1105201">numerous anti-trans tweets</a>, both generalizing about trans people and directly targeting one nonbinary person. The tweets made staff members at her company uncomfortable, and ultimately, in March 2019, the organization declined to renew Forstater’s contract. Rowling’s <a href="https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1207646162813100033">tweet</a>, in which she distorts trans identity and the facts of the case, marks the first time many people become aware of her growing transphobic tendencies.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>June 2020:</strong> In a tweet, <a href="https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1269382518362509313">Rowling mocks</a> the trans-inclusive phrase “people who menstruate” in an article about pandemic menstrual health, implying that the phrase, meant to encompass trans men and nonbinary people, erases, overrides, or obscures the word “women.”</p>

<p>In a follow-up to the previous tweet and the backlash it spawned, Rowling <a href="https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1269389298664701952">posts a thread</a> implying that trans activists are “erasing the concept of [biological] sex” and along with it “the lived reality of women.” She also states, “I’d march with you if you were discriminated against on the basis of being trans.”&nbsp;(To date, she has not.)</p>

<p>Days later, Rowling produces her most overt and lengthy discussion of her views, <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/21285396/jk-rowling-transphobic-backlash-harry-potter">a 3,600-word manifesto</a> published on her website responding to “the new trans activism.” The post is replete with myths and false transphobic stereotypes, particularly revolving around the narratives that gender and biology are inextricable and that trans women are dangerous. Rowling states the movement offers “cover to predators”. She also repeatedly amplifies the alarmist, <a href="https://juliaserano.medium.com/all-the-evidence-against-transgender-social-contagion-f82fbda9c5d4">false idea</a> that teens are transitioning as part of a social media trend, a claim based on a handful of inaccurate and shady scientific studies claiming that an outsize number of trans teens will detransition later, studies that have <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-end-of-the-desistance_b_8903690">since been</a> <a href="https://www.kqed.org/futureofyou/441784/the-controversial-research-on-desistance-in-transgender-youth">widely debunked</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>August 2020: </strong>After the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights organization issues a statement repudiating her transphobia, Rowling doubles down on her position and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/28/jk-rowling-robert-f-kennedy-human-rights-award-trans-views">returns an award</a> given to her by the org in 2019.</p>

<p><strong>September 2020: </strong>Rowling releases the Cormoran Strike book <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/21449215/troubled-blood-review-jk-rowling-transphobia-controversy"><em>Troubled Blood</em></a> and is <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/09/jk-rowling-transphobia-new-novel-troubled-blood-controversy">widely</a> <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2020/09/15/jk-rowling-troubled-blood-transgender-comments-can-you-separate-art-artist/5760735002/">criticized</a> after she creates a villain who preys on women by wearing women’s clothes. This is exactly the specter of a sexual predator that Rowling believes hides behind the label of “trans woman.”&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>December 2020: </strong>In an interview with Good Housekeeping, <a href="https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2020/12/j-k-rowling-says-90-fans-agree-transphobia-theyre-afraid-say-publicly/">Rowling claims</a> that “90 percent” of Harry Potter fans secretly agree with her anti-trans views, but that “many are afraid to speak up because they fear for their jobs and even for their personal safety.” This once again stereotypes trans activists as an angry, entitled, and vicious mob.</p>

<p><strong>July 2021: </strong>Rowling <a href="https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1415631382068535296">tweets</a> a screenshot of a tiny account — <a href="https://twitter.com/leahmcelrath/status/1415772649633075203">reportedly</a> with around 200 followers at the time — of a self-identified trans user who mentions her in a tweet discussing <a href="https://www.vox.com/gender" data-source="encore">gender identity</a>. Since Rowling did not remove the trans user’s information in the screenshot that went out to her 14 million followers,&nbsp;that user is subsequently inundated with transphobic harassment and ultimately deletes their <a href="https://www.vox.com/twitter" data-source="encore">Twitter</a> account.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>November 2021: </strong>Rowling <a href="https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1462758324177444870">publicizes</a> that a group of three trans people shared a photo of themselves holding protest signs outside of her house, saying that she had called the police out of alarm (a fact Scottish police also verified). Rowling claims that these protesters had “doxxed” her, and the media runs with this report, which plays into the larger evolving media narrative of Rowling as a victim of trans harassment. But as many people have <a href="https://twitter.com/PantiBliss/status/1462820326048423936">pointed out</a>, Rowling’s address is publicly known — so well-known, in fact, that it is a frequent fan tour stop. Police later officially state there is “<a href="https://www.them.us/story/jk-rowling-doxxing-no-criminality-scotland-police">no criminality</a>” in what the trans protesters had done.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As trans culture vlogger Jessie Earl <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w29O8r7bLA4">points out</a>, trans people themselves are at <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/12/27/21028342/trans-visibility-backlash-internet-2010">much higher risk</a> of experiencing doxxing, bullying, and harassment than cisgender people. Earl also notes that Rowling has supported and platformed (through Twitter likes, follows, and retweets) multiple TERFs who had themselves doxxed other people, including Marion Millar, who <a href="https://randompublicjournal.com/2021/08/31/this-is-not-womens-rights/">faced criminal charges</a> for homophobically doxxing a police officer (though those charges were <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2021/10/28/marion-millar-transphobia-charges-gender-critical/">dropped pending review</a>); Rosie Duffield, an MP who drew criticism for “<a href="https://labourlist.org/2020/10/gmb-mps-staff-branch-condemns-actions-of-rosie-duffield-towards-staff-member/">publicly outing</a>” a staff member who resigned over her transphobia; and Rosa Freedman, a professor who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/transgenderUK/comments/oamjgs/transphobic_uni_of_reading_prof_rosa_freedman/">doxxed a student</a> who emailed her requesting a chat about her views on trans equality.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignleft"><blockquote><p>“War is Peace. Freedom is Slavery. Ignorance is Strength. The Penised Individual Who Raped You Is a Woman.”</p></blockquote></figure>

<p><strong>December 2021: </strong>Rowling shares a Sunday Times article that mocks the Scottish police for recognizing transgender identity. In her <a href="https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1470092815506063365">tweet</a>, she parodies <em>1984</em>, writing, “War is Peace. Freedom is Slavery. Ignorance is Strength. The Penised Individual Who Raped You Is a Woman.”</p>

<p>Later that month, in the middle of a thread ostensibly attempting to support trans equality, Rowling <a href="https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1476194393631645699">tweets</a>, “The question at the heart of this debate is whether sex or gender identity should form the basis of decisions on safeguarding, provision of services, sporting categories and other areas where women and girls currently have legal rights and protections.” The idea behind what Rowling is saying is that allowing trans women equal access to those spaces will erode current legal rights for cisgender women and girls. This is a position that only makes sense if you are denying that trans women and girls are women and girls. Rowling then adds an insistence on separating “sex” from “gender,” an essentialist idea that contradicts current medical practice and scientific research, which advocates for treating gender identity as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/22/health/transgender-trump-biology.html">linked primarily to the brain</a>, not anatomy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>March 2022: </strong>In response to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220307161320/https://twitter.com/GordieKat/status/1500867150596169730">since-deleted tweet</a> (which was itself a reply to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220307161320/https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1500865487621742596">tweet</a> in which Rowling implied trans women were “predators”), Rowling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220307163226/https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1500871932597747716/">tweets about</a> a sexual assault committed by a trans woman, using this single incident to imply that all trans women should be denied access to public spaces designated for women.</p>

<p>The next day, on International Women’s Day, Rowling posts a <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/tinashe-jk-rowling-shut-up-transphobic-twitter-1235042079/">series of tweets</a> maligning gender-inclusive language and mockingly referencing Voldemort by sarcastically opining that the day in future would be known as “She Who Must Not Be Named Day.” She also <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2022/03/jk-rowling-transphobia-international-womens-day-rant-1234705640/">explicitly criticizes</a> gender-inclusive legislation.</p>

<p>Later that month,&nbsp;British lawyer Alison Bailey <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-62294030">partially wins</a> an employment discrimination lawsuit in which she claimed that she was discriminated against because of her gender-essentialist views. While the lawsuit was in progress, Rowling <a href="https://twitter.com/HPANA/status/1518650786347163651">posted a tweet</a> urging her followers to financially support Bailey.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>August 2022: </strong>Rowling’s latest Cormoran Strike book, <em>The Ink Black Heart</em>, once again <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/08/31/1120299781/jk-rowling-new-book-the-ink-black-heart">comes under fire for transphobia</a> because of its depiction of a character broadly viewable as a satirical stand-in for Rowling herself — an anti-trans public figure who is “canceled” by the&nbsp;internet&nbsp;on trumped-up charges of transphobia and then killed.</p>

<p><strong>December 2022: </strong>Rowling <a href="https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1604180531155017731">screencaps</a> a thread about the controversial new <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/23599799/hogwarts-legacy-review-rowling-trans">Hogwarts Legacy</a> video game by the aforementioned popular transgender YouTuber Jessie Earl, a.k.a. Jessie Gender. Earl <a href="https://twitter.com/jessiegender/status/1603942028555210752">points out</a> that <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/22254435/harry-potter-tv-series-hbo-jk-rowling-transphobic">supporting the franchise</a> would “justify her continued targeting of trans people”; Rowling, in response, sarcastically accuses Earl of practicing “purethink,” implying trans advocacy is a type of religious dogma. An <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=(to%3Ajessiegender)%20until%3A2022-12-19%20since%3A2022-12-17&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live">onslaught</a> of transphobic social media harassment targeting Earl follows.</p>

<p>This month, Rowling also personally funds a new domestic violence support center in Edinburgh, Scotland, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/12/jk-rowling-launches-support-centre-for-female-victims-of-sexual-violence">explicitly excludes trans women</a>; Rowling frames this new center as offering “women-centered and women-delivered care.” Edinburgh’s longstanding domestic violence support center has had a trans woman as its director since 2021. Trans women, in particular women of color, are at <a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/press/ncvs-trans-press-release/">a vastly higher risk</a> of experiencing domestic violence and sexual assault than cisgender women.</p>

<p><strong>January 2023:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1619302315248488450">Rowling tweets</a> that she is “Deeply amused by those telling me I’ve lost their admiration due to the disrespect I show violent, duplicitous rapists.” The most immediate context for this comment is presumably both the backlash to Hogwarts Legacy and the ongoing backlash over Rowling’s views writ large regarding trans women being dangerous predators. So a reasonable implication of Rowling’s words seems to be that she considers trans women, by default, to be “violent, duplicitous rapists.”</p>

<p><strong>March 2023: </strong>A <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/witch-trials-jk-rowling-podcast-essay-review.html">new podcast</a>, <em>The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling</em>, produced by Bari Weiss’s The Free Press and hosted by prominent former Westboro Baptist Church member Megan Phelps-Roper, featured interviews with Rowling. In its <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5r8SZLhLsgroLqPC1owm0m?si=8ed16b7423d04d5b">fifth episode</a>, Rowling begins discussing the modern trans rights movement, calling it “a cultural movement that was illiberal in its methods and questionable in its ideas” and insisting, “I&nbsp;believe, absolutely, that there is something dangerous about this movement and that it must be challenged.”</p>

<p>She then compares the movement to Death Eaters — the villainous supremacists in her books, analogous to Nazis:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>[S]ome of you have not understood the books. The Death Eaters claimed, “We have been made to live in secret, and now is our time, and any who stand in our way must be destroyed. If you disagree with us, you must die.” They demonized and dehumanized those who were not like them.</p>



<p>I am fighting what I see as a powerful, insidious, misogynistic movement, that has gained huge purchase in very influential areas of society. I do not see this particular movement as either benign or powerless, so I’m afraid I stand with the women who are fighting to be heard against threats of loss of livelihood and threats to their safety.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While Rowling can say she only intends to target the specific trans activists who are angry at her, that’s an impossible distinction. She does not mention any formal group or entity that represents trans rights that has acted against her. The only context we have for what she is responding to are non-affiliated individuals on Twitter sending angry messages in response to her transphobic comments. Indeed, the episode is titled “The Tweets” and features Phelps-Roper reading angry and sad tweets from former fans of Rowling. This generalization doesn’t distinguish “the movement” from people who are simply angry and upset with Rowling. Instead, it seems to imply that “good” trans people are the ones who accept Rowling’s version of their identity and allow her viewpoint — that they aren’t who they say they are — to dominate their fight for social acceptance.</p>

<p>Trans people are estimated to comprise about half a percent of populations in both <a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Trans-Adults-US-Aug-2016.pdf">the US</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-06/transgender-population-uk-census-shows-gender-identity-in-england-and-wales">the UK</a>. A <a href="https://www.axios.com/2018/09/22/study-transgender-policies-bathroom-safety-lgbtq">2018 study from UCLA</a> found no evidence to support that anti-trans legislation makes designated public spaces safer, but did find that “reports of privacy and safety violations in these places are exceedingly rare.” In essence, there was no danger to begin with.</p>

<p><strong>March 2024: </strong>On March 13, Rowling appears to deny on X (formerly Twitter) that trans people were targeted during the Holocaust. This all started when Rowling retweeted <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesEsses/status/1767648977090998775">a post</a> by James Esses about having been “canceled.” Esses is a blogger and former student who was <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/05/13/questioned-children-encouraged-transition-cost-dream-career/">fired</a> from his counseling job and expelled from his therapy degree program for his anti-trans campaigning.</p>

<p>Esses’s post claimed he was fired for opposing the use of puberty blockers for trans children. In the threads of Esses’s post, in response to one of his supporters but also copying both Esses and Rowling, a Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/jaytuberr/status/1767910144539844610">responded</a> with, “The Nazis burnt books on trans healthcare and research, why are you so desperate to uphold their ideology around gender?”</p>

<p>Rowling then takes this tweet and screencaps it, <a href="https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1767912990366388735">asking</a>, “I just… how? How did you type this out and press send without thinking ‘I should maybe check my source for this, because it might’ve been a fever dream’?”</p>

<p>The literal burning by Nazis of books and research from Berlin’s pioneering <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-forgotten-history-of-the-worlds-first-trans-clinic/">Institute for Sexual Research</a>, which conducted the world’s first gender-affirming surgeries for trans people, was <a href="https://youtu.be/QU-WVjwJPNk?t=347">captured</a> in German newsreels at the time and has been <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/new-research-reveals-how-the-nazis-targeted-transgender-people-180982931/">well-documented</a> since, including by the UK’s own<a href="https://www.hmd.org.uk/resource/6-may-1933-looting-of-the-institute-of-sexology/"> Holocaust Memorial Day Trust</a>. Calling this very well-sourced history a “fever dream” quickly drew significant backlash from Twitter users, with many framing it as a form of Holocaust denial. When <a href="https://twitter.com/Esqueer_/status/1767914998808953316">challenged</a> on her claim with multiple sources by Harvard Cyberlaw Clinic instructor Alejandra Caraballo, Rowling first <a href="https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1767925285008064592">responds</a> that the original tweet had made claims it didn’t say: that the Nazis burnt <em>all</em> research on trans health care, and that trans people were the <em>first</em> victims of the Nazis.</p>

<p>Rowling then doubles down on Twitter, by <a href="https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1767928717538644460">quote tweeting</a> another tweet claiming trans people were not targets of the Nazis during the Holocaust. In her quote, Rowling frames the verified history of Nazi violence toward trans people as “persistent claims.” She then, again in response to Caraballo’s pushback in reply, <a href="https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1767939048427896900">attempts to separate</a> “trans-identifying people” from “gay people, who were indeed victims of heinous treatment by the Nazis.”</p>

<p>Caraballo’s <a href="https://twitter.com/Esqueer_/status/1767952608604365269">reply</a>, which cited sources including <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-forgotten-history-of-the-worlds-first-trans-clinic/">Scientific American</a>, and a <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/central-european-history/article/transgender-life-and-persecution-under-the-nazi-state-gutachten-on-the-vollbrecht-case/0779A24B130C4F0CA64DB639FA6DBF46">thorough accounting</a> by a historian about the ways trans people faced persecution under Nazi Germany, did not receive a rejoinder from Rowling.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>April 2024: </strong>On April 1, 2024, Rowling posted a thread on X pegged to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/mar/31/scotlands-new-hate-act-what-does-it-cover-and-why-is-it-controversial">implementation</a> of the Hate Crime and Public Order (Scotland) Act, which added “threatening or abusive behaviour which is intended to stir up hatred” around a number of identities, including age, religion, and transgender identity to the hate crimes statute; the law does not, somewhat controversially, include <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/01/scotland-hate-speech-law-britain/b47ccffe-f029-11ee-a4c9-88e569a98b58_story.html">hatred of women</a>. In her posts, Rowling spotlit a number of women, from a handful of convicted or reported sex offenders to UN appointees Katie Neeves and Munroe Bergdorf as well as Mridul Wadhwa, head of a Scottish rape crisis center. All of the women Rowling listed are reportedly trans — leading the author to <a href="https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1774749954629652873">write</a>, “Obviously, the people mentioned in the above tweets aren’t women at all, but men, every last one of them.” Rowling ended the thread with the hashtag #ArrestMe.</p>

<p><strong>May 2024:</strong> As part of a Twitter discussion that began with Rowling <a href="https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2024/05/cruel-jk-rowling-calls-trans-soccer-official-a-crossdressing-straight-man-for-no-reason/">deliberately misgendering</a> a trans soccer manager, she doubled down in response to criticism, both by <a href="https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1789641182164688934">claiming</a> that trans women are “crossdressing straight men” and by comparing trans identity to cultural appropriation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Do I get to be black if I like Motown and fancy myself in cornrows?” <a href="https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1789681522544455976">she wrote</a>. “What if I claim the authentic me has always been black and that you’re being racist to me? Would that be OK, or would you find it ludicrous and deeply offensive?” She did not respond to the many platform users who replied to address her use of racist stereotypes or to point out that race, unlike gender, is a genetic identity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>August 2024: </strong>Rowling contributed to ongoing harassment and attacks upon Olympics boxer Imane Khelif, who was one of two female boxers disqualified by the Russian-led International Boxing Association (IBA) from the 2023 World Championships after an unspecified biochemical test. The test detected <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2024/08/olympic-boxers-gender-test-controversy-explained.html">elevated levels</a> of testosterone in Khelif’s system; while the specific reason for this result is unconfirmed, cis women can have elevated testosterone levels due to natural differences in sex characteristics. Although Khelif is a woman and was assigned female at birth, many extremists have used this vague test result to attack her with transphobic rhetoric, accusing her of being a man in disguise.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Both Khelif and the other IBA-disqualified athlete, Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting, qualified under the International Olympic Committee guidelines and were approved to compete in the Olympics. But following a dramatic match on August 1, in which Khelif’s opponent Angela Carini of Italy forfeited in under a minute after exchanging just a few hits, Khelif once again came under scrutiny from transphobes on the suspicion of secretly being a man. Among the transphobic commentary she faced was vitriol from J.K. Rowling, who tweeted a photo of Khelif looking at Carini after Carini abruptly retired.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Could any picture sum up our new men’s rights movement better? The smirk of a male who’s knows he’s protected by a misogynist sporting establishment enjoying the distress of a woman he’s just punched in the head, and whose life’s ambition he’s just shattered. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Paris2024?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Paris2024</a> <a href="https://t.co/Q5SbKiksXQ">pic.twitter.com/Q5SbKiksXQ</a></p>&mdash; J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) <a href="https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1819007216214573268?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 1, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Carini, shown in tears in the photo after withdrawing as Khelif looks on, refused to shake Khelif’s hand after the match, which may have contributed to the belief she had been unfairly treated in the ring. She later <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/c2j3jg51rg4o">said</a> to the BBC, however, that she wished to apologize to Khelif for not shaking her hand — an act Carini explained came from anger at herself, not Khelif. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rowling, however, saw things much differently. In <a href="https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1819007216214573268">her tweet</a>, she framed the photo as a misogynistic assault, writing, “The smirk of a male who’s knows he’s protected by a misogynist sporting establishment enjoying the distress of a woman he’s just punched in the head, and whose life’s ambition he’s just shattered. #Paris2024”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Again, Khelif was born female and has always been a cisgender woman. Rowling seems to be arguing that any hormone-related variance at all among women — despite the millions of women who have hormone imbalances — is enough to render them inauthentic or not “real” women. It’s an alarming development in her ongoing shift into extreme transphobic views.</p>

<p><strong><em>Clarification, March 3, 2023, 12:15 pm ET</em>:</strong> <em>Updated to clarify details of the character who is “canceled” in&nbsp;</em>The Ink Black Heart.</p>

<p><em><strong>Clarification, March 16, 2023, 3:20 pm ET: </strong>Updated to clarify that Rowling’s remarks drew a comparison between the Death Eaters and the trans rights “movement,” rather than trans people. </em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Update, August 1, 2024, 12:00 pm ET: </strong>This story, originally published March 3, 2023, has been updated several times, most recently with Rowling’s transphobic remarks about a cisgender Olympics athlete.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a young man in the 1990s, walking to school in New Delhi, Anant Sudarshan would watch the vultures perched along telephone wires, waiting for the discards of nearby leather tanning factories. So when the birds started to disappear, he couldn’t help but notice.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What Sudarshan, who now researches environmental policy and economics at the University of Warwick in the UK, did not realize at the time but would help discover decades later, was that the extinction of India’s vultures had far-reaching consequences for the humans who lived alongside the birds. In just a few years, the species’s disappearance contributed to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of his fellow citizens.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Together with Eyal Frank, an environmental economist at the University of Chicago, Sudarshan used his adolescent experience as inspiration for <a href="https://www.anantsudarshan.com/uploads/1/0/2/6/10267789/vultures_manuscript.pdf">a new study</a> being published in the American Economic Review. As in other developing nations, they found, the scavengers functioned as a natural sanitation system for communities with a less developed infrastructure than the US or Europe, helping control diseases that could otherwise be spread through the carcasses they consume.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Outside experts unaffiliated with the study say it will be a classic that unlocks further research on how the loss of critical species can have disastrous effects on human populations that depend on them, in often underappreciated ways. The findings should reshape how the public and policymakers alike relate to the world around us, and how we consider the unforeseen consequences of ecological destruction.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We’re interconnected with the rest of the natural world,” Frank said. “I think for a lot of people, it’s this hippie, quasi-tree-hugger concept. Turning it into numbers and an outcome that people care about like mortality does change how people think about this statement: that we’re one with nature. What does that actually mean? It’s not a spiritual statement. It’s a statement about causal mechanisms.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The human costs of India’s extinct vultures</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sudarshan and Frank estimate that from 2000 to 2005, an additional 500,000 people died in India above the preexisting trend, after the rapid dying off of vultures in the 1990s. The near-extinction was an unexpected (and for a long time unknown) byproduct of the country’s farmers introducing a medication to livestock that had previously only been prescribed to humans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Within a few years, 95 percent of the country’s vulture population was wiped out, dropping from tens of millions to a few thousand. A decade later, researchers discovered the drug led to kidney failure and death in the vultures when they fed on dead livestock that still had it in their system.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sudarshan and Frank compared death rates in the years following the die-offs between regions that had previously been home to vulture populations and those that hadn’t, finding that people started dying at higher rates in areas where the birds had lived.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the communities that lost vultures, there were an estimated 104,000 excess deaths annually —&nbsp;deaths that may be attributed to the species’ near-extinction — from 2000 to 2005, the years immediately following their dramatic decline that were the focus of Sudarshan and Frank’s study. It adds up to more than half a million deaths over five years, costing India an estimated $69 billion annually.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I would not have guessed the effect would be so large,” Sudarshan said. But as he and Frank came to realize the various vectors by which diseases might spread without vultures around, Sudarshan realized the extinction was “the largest sanitation shock you could imagine, where you have 50 million carcasses every year not being disposed of.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Keystone animal species are vital to human health</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ecologists and conservationists have long known that some species — called “keystone” species — play a pivotal role in their ecosystems. Scientists have also suspected that those species’ role is so important that their loss could have life-and-death consequences for human beings. That relationship, though, has been hard to prove.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There has been plenty of circumstantial evidence. In India, vultures are known to be extremely efficient scavengers, eating nearly all of a carcass less than an hour after finding it. Before the extinction, Indian regions that were home to vultures already recorded lower baseline mortality rates than those without them. After the birds died off, people in affected areas reported seeing more feral dogs and more rotting carcasses building up in fields.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Without vultures to consume them, there were more dead animals lying around, which sometimes ended up in rivers or other bodies of water, tainting local water supplies. The absence of vultures became an opportunity for other scavengers, such as rats and dogs. India did not attempt a census of feral dogs until 2012, well after the study period. But when they did, there were more of the animals in the areas previously hospitable to vultures, which Sudarshan and Frank argue implies the dogs may have flourished after the birds were eliminated.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dogs and rats are less efficient than vultures at fully eliminating flesh from potentially disease-carrying carcasses, creating more opportunities for a person to come in contact with infected remains. They’re also more likely to transmit diseases like anthrax and rabies to people. Orders of the rabies vaccines started to rise in the years after the vulture population plummeted. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I was mind-blown that it happened so drastically, so quickly,” Frank said. “We often say that anecdotes are not evidence, but the amount of anecdotes about how people were negatively affected by the disappearance of the vultures, we read more and more and more of it and said, ‘Okay, this has got to show up in data.’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sudarshan and Frank have now provided a template for studying the impacts of species loss on human health, and researchers unaffiliated with the study told me that they expect more such research to follow.&nbsp; Frank hopes future work might be able to identify whether specific causes of death increase after the elimination of a keystone species.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Rethinking our relationship to the animals we live alongside</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The findings should inform conservation efforts in other regions, such as sub-Saharan Africa, where vultures play a similar sanitation role, the researchers argue. Small investments to support local populations could have big payoffs. More broadly, supporting species believed to be ecologically critical, of which vultures are only one, is a wise investment.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is also clear that farmers and agricultural officials should consider the potential ripple effects when giving new medications to livestock. This is a textbook example of One Health, the public health paradigm that says we should protect animal and environmental health to protect the well-being of humans.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The drug in question, diclofenac, had been introduced because it was a cheap way to treat fevers and inflammation in farm animals. The medicine was banned once Indian officials learned of its role in the vulture die-off, but by then, the damage was already done.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vultures remain critically endangered in India, with only a few thousand individuals. Sudarshan and Frank argue their findings should encourage conservation efforts in India, though vultures’ life cycles will make them difficult to restore: They lay, at most, one egg in a year and take years to sexually mature.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The enormous consequences of their near-extinction in India remind us that promoting biodiversity means embracing every species, not only those that look good on a T-shirt; they and we are all part of a whole.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We need to really remember these connections. They are crucially important,” Andrea Santangeli, a conservation scientist at the Research Centre for Ecological Change at the University of Helsinki, told me. “We cannot live a healthy life without a healthy nature.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Welcome to&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.vox.com/personal-finance/2019/8/20/20813748/money-debt-personal-finance"><em>Money Talks</em></a><em>, a series in which we interview people about their relationship with money, their relationship with each other, and how those relationships inform one another.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Nicole Alesi is a 42-year-old New York native who has been running </em><a href="https://www.nicolemariepaperie.com/"><em>Nicole Marie Paperie</em></a><em>, a stationery company, since 2013, and whose cards are featured in more than 100 retailers, including TJ Maxx. Constance Panton, a 52-year-old Baltimore resident, is the CEO and founder of </em><a href="https://bifties.com/"><em>Bifties Gifts</em></a><em>, a gifting platform that allows people to buy Black, support small businesses, and donate to charity. The two met in 2020 when Panton was looking for Black-owned businesses selling products that could be included in Bifties gift boxes.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>The following conversation has been lightly condensed and edited.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Nicole:</strong> I started as an illustrator, and I was looking for affordable ways to communicate my artwork. During the holiday season, people were always asking, “Can you draw me a card?” So I decided to mass-produce one. At the same time, I was walking through the stationery shop at a drugstore and I noticed that I didn’t see cards that really spoke to me. These cards always had a message inside in a font I didn’t like. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I was also very tired of coloring my face in, you know? I just didn’t see cards that represented me or my friends, who were about ready to get married. This was <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/6/26/8823655/gay-marriage-legal-scotus-obergefell-v-hodges">before gay marriage was even legal</a>, and I was, like, “I don’t see cards I can send that are appropriate for their weddings!” I felt really inspired to draw what I know and love, and it took off from there.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/LGBTQ-wedding-V.2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,23.821989528796,100,52.356020942408" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">This is one of my original cards. A wedding card. We’re talking about, like, 2013? It was such a fun time to explore. It felt like social media was smaller. You could post something and it felt, dare I say, a little bit kinder? I was able to find my illustration community, and a community of makers on Etsy, because this was around the time of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/9/4/20841475/etsy-free-shipping-amazon-handmade-josh-silverman">handmade movement</a>. It was post-recession. Everyone was laid off, and people were starting to knit scarves and make things. I was thinking, “Maybe this will be my profession now.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It was a great time to try something different. It felt potent and exciting. Nicole Marie Paperie — it just made sense, because Marie is my middle name, so I’ll never get tired of it, I’ll never regret it — and Paperie, it just went together like peanut butter and jelly, so why not?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Constance:</strong> Bifties started in 2016 as a gift exchange. This was during <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/5/30/15713254/cleveland-police-tamir-rice-timothy-loehmann">Tamir Rice</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/8/27/20835639/daniel-pantaleo-eric-garner-nypd-protests-activists-de-blasio">Eric Garner</a> — I was starting to get really depressed. I was starting to really feel it, and I thought, “Wouldn’t it be really great if I could just give the Black community a hug? Give everybody a hug, because it’s tough right now, being a Black person in America.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It was around the holidays, and serendipitously my aunt invited me to a gift exchange. The only thing you had to do was pay $5, and it went to a ladies’ charity, and then she matched you with random people to buy gifts. I thought, “This is fantastic. I’m going to do the same thing, but instead of $5, just buy your gift from a Black-owned business.” We’re going to give an economic hug to the Black community.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I ran that gift exchange for about four years, and there were a lot of challenges. This was pre-<a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2020/5/27/21271667/george-floyd-death-police-kneed-in-the-neck">George Floyd</a>, and many people weren’t “buying Black.” I’d have people send a gift to someone, but they bought it at a big-box retail store, and it was an African print. Or they got something from Mary Kay because the Mary Kay vendor was a Black person — there were a whole lot of different versions of “buying Black.”  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The other component was a lot of my non-Black friends were, like, “This is a call to action for Black people. I don’t know if I’m supposed to be participating.” I said, “No no no, this is a call to support Black businesses!” When you combine all of that together, the people who didn’t think they could be involved in this opportunity, the gifts I didn&#8217;t think were matching my idea of what I was looking for, I decided in January 2020 to launch Bifties as a service.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What is Bifties? I literally took the words “Black,” “best,” and “gifts” and made it into “Bifties.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bifties are a community of people — yes, it’s a noun — regardless of race, color, religion, and creed, who buy the best Black-owned gifts. The “giving B(l)ack,” with the parentheses, is because a portion of our proceeds goes to charity. It’s like “giving back, giving Black.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2020, I launched that, and I said, “Okay, now you have no excuse. No matter what you look like, no matter what you believe in, you can go on this site and you can build your own gift.” And I curate the gifts! I don’t have to worry that you bought it at a big-box store or from the Mary Kay lady down the street. I was able to create the lane that I actually wanted, and that’s how Bifties came to be.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Nicole:</strong> The month that she launched, January 2020, is really important. It was a wild year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Constance:</strong> Yes it was. I launched Bifties as a platform in 2020. Come May of 2020, with the George Floyd incident, it was an opportunity — here I am, trying to get people to buy Black regardless of who you are, and then all of a sudden the nation decided that we needed to buy Black. I had corporations looking for me. I had the exact thing that they needed at that time to show up for their employees, their friends, their family — and that’s what took off for me.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Nicole: </strong>I always say that authenticity is key. As much as my cards are art-driven, we’re selling a feeling and an emotion. The only way to communicate that through the internet is jokes, memes, laughter. If I’m not doing a belly laugh when I see this card, “Congrats on your quiet quitting” —</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Constance:</strong> I saw that one!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Nicole:</strong> And I saw your smile. I saw how your face lit up. I couldn’t do this in the ’90s or the early aughts, but thanks to Facebook and Instagram, I can just draw something, and the middleman is gone. That’s very liberating for people like us. Women like us.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Constance and I are both divorced. We’re both moms. I say to her, when things get hard, “We don’t have a choice. This has to succeed.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/quiet-quitting.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,23.821989528796,100,52.356020942408" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">We started working together during the Buy Black movement. We didn’t know it would be this thing that we’d get swept up in. It was like getting caught in a maelstrom. There were all of these emotions, positivity and empathy, but also negative emotions like, “I’m an artist, my work speaks for itself.” It was hard to open my inbox and see things that made me feel like people were buying from me because of the way I looked instead of the work I did.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Constance:</strong> There are a lot of Black-owned businesses that you didn’t know were Black-owned. I’m doing my market research and I’m putting my boxes together, and verifying who was a Black-owned business before 2020 was very challenging because people weren’t identifying their businesses that way back then. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, on Facebook and Instagram, you can put “Black-owned” and “women-owned,” but before then I had to search and dig. I had a lot of companies say, “I don’t want to be identified as Black-owned. I don’t want to be put into a box.”  I get that. <a href="https://www.vox.com/first-person/2019/11/30/20985982/buy-black-business">That’s a real issue</a>. There was a period of time around 2020 when everyone wanted to be identified as Black-owned, but now that we’re coming out of that, we’re having those same discussions again. “My work should speak for itself.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I want to sell awesome gifts. It just happens to be that everything in that gift box is Black-owned.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Nicole:</strong> And you just happen to like it!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Constance: </strong>You can give it to your friends and it doesn’t matter because it speaks to everyone. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Nicole: </strong>For me, personally, I’m going to keep that hashtag [#blackownedbusiness] regardless. I’m not ashamed — it’s nothing to be ashamed of. Bring back Black joy, number one, and number two, representation matters. I remember being a kid and not seeing anything that looked like me. My mom is Italian, and she doesn’t even look like me. Now you have millions of TV shows with people who look like me and people who have moms who look different from them — there was nothing like that when I was a kid. If there&#8217;s anybody, anywhere in the world who sees my artwork, and they look like me, and they’re in my inbox asking, “How do I do this?” it’s my responsibility to pass that information on. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Constance:</strong> Long-term, my vision is to have a brick-and-mortar store that you can come into. I want to be the next Black Hallmark! I want you to come in and everything in the store is Black-owned. I want to be in Downtown Disney, too!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Nicole:</strong> For me, I would just love to expand the medium. I’d like to see my products on more than just cards — clothes, home goods, that area. I’d also like to explore new creative and artistic areas. I always say, at the beginning of every year, “This is the year I’m going to paint.” I want to paint, I want to consult, I want to mentor. That’s something I love doing — helping people. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Constance:</strong> She’s really good at helping people, and she’s an incredible businesswoman. It’s uncanny. I had two business issues, and I came to Nicole, and she said, “Okay, here’s what we need to do.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Nicole:</strong> Because we’re going to Downtown Disney!</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">We all know the medal winners for the competitions that have taken place so far in the 2024 Paris Olympics (or, rather, they’re all <a href="https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/medals/medallists">a single click away</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US women’s gymnastics team reclaimed gold for the team all-around after a second-place finish in Tokyo, while the men’s team won its first medal in the team event since 2008. Some of China’s swimming successes are <a href="https://www.si.com/olympics/china-swimming-success-deserves-doubt-pan-zhanle">being scrutinized</a>, given recent doping scandals. The triathlon finish line was incredibly impressive — and a reminder of <a href="https://www.marca.com/en/olympic-games/2024/08/01/66ab4ef9e2704e7d3e8b45a7.html">how intensely these athletes push themselves</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the Games aren’t beloved just for the games themselves. We fall in love with athletes’ stories, and the stories we tell ourselves about them, too. With that in mind, here are some of the biggest winners (and one loser) of our hearts so far.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Winner: America’s favorite pommel horse son&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Not all heroes wear capes; some wear glasses and are very good at pommel horse.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For nearly three hours, American gymnast and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@teamusa/video/7397596179477056814">part-time Rubik’s Cube solver</a> Stephen Nedoroscik waited for his turn. Sitting on the bench, the electrical engineer looked relatable; more like Clark Kent’s nerdier cousin than Superman.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Nedoroscik, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BmOov5mKzE">McKayla Maroney on the vault</a> in the 2012 Games, is an apparatus specialist — a “one and done” gymnast called in to do an event because they’re so exceptional at it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The pommel horse requires massive upper body and core strength as gymnasts use only their arms to glide up and down the body of the horse. At the same time, they flare their legs like breakdancers, whipping them in circles and intricate patterns. The pommel horse has, in some years, been a weak spot for American men.&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It also just so happened to be the last event for USA’s men’s gymnastics team at the team final on Monday.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As the final wound down, Team USA needed Nedoroscik’s pommel horse score to ensure that the team would be going home with Olympic hardware. With the pressure on and all eyes on him, the bespectacled athlete delivered. His champion performance earned the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTNXAN7Cb/">highest-ever US score on the horse</a> and gave the US team the bronze medal — the first medal for American male gymnasts in 16 years.&nbsp;<em>—Alex Abad-Santos, senior correspondent, culture</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Winner: Simone Biles’s social media</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We all knew the <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/363796/simone-biles-gold-medal-team-final-2024-olympics-result">gymnastics GOAT</a> was going to get the glory, but some out there (cough cough) were a little less certain about her teammates — who are now officially gold medal winners for the gymnastics team all-around competition. And Simone Biles has something to say about that.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The original shade came from former Olympic vaulter and 2020 silver medalist MyKayla Skinner, in a now-deleted video on her own YouTube channel earlier this summer. Other than her former teammate Biles, Skinner <a href="https://x.com/gymguyri/status/1808619618010829261">claimed</a> that “the talent and the depth” of the US women’s Olympic team “just isn’t like what it used to be.” She went on to say, “Obviously a lot of girls don’t work as hard. The girls just don’t have the work ethic.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These comments appear to be what Biles was referring to when she <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-ESNIFIQ8l/?img_index=1">posted</a> her celebratory Instagram after the team’s Tuesday win, pairing pictures of herself and teammates Suni Lee, Jordan Chiles, Jade Carey, and Hezly Rivera with the caption: &#8220;Lack of talent, lazy, olympic champions ❤️🥇🇺🇸.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-ESNIFIQ8l/?utm_source=ig_embed&#038;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14"><div> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-ESNIFIQ8l/?utm_source=ig_embed&#038;utm_campaign=loading" target="_blank"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div>View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-ESNIFIQ8l/?utm_source=ig_embed&#038;utm_campaign=loading" target="_blank">A post shared by Simone Biles (@simonebiles)</a></p></div></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The gag didn’t escape former Olympic gymnast and <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/mckayla-maroney-is-not-impressed">beloved meme</a>, McKayla Maroney, who unfortunately shares a version of Skinner’s first name.&nbsp;She commented, “It doesn’t get more iconic than this. She f’d around n found out fr. Feels like I need to apologize just to redeem my first name.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Skinner, who also happens to be the mom behind the viral <a href="https://www.distractify.com/p/baby-harmer-gender-reveal">“Baby Harmer”</a> gender reveal, previously disavowed the video in a July 3 Instagram story, saying it “wasn’t always necessarily about the current team, because I love and support all the girls that made it and I’m so proud of them.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biles, who indicated she has since <a href="https://x.com/Simone_Biles/status/1818684539431981149">been blocked by Skinner</a>, last posted some pics of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-GcmeitktJ/?img_index=1">getting a well-earned rest</a>, before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/01/world/olympics-gymnastics-simone-biles?campaign_id=190&amp;emc=edit_ufn_20240801&amp;instance_id=130442&amp;nl=from-the-times&amp;regi_id=76220551&amp;segment_id=173847&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=182f712f716eea2570dff279c1743e9e">winning her second all-around gold on Thursday</a>.&nbsp;<em>—Meredith Haggerty, senior editor, culture</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Winner: Sharpshooters who have never looked cooler</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Apologies to my boyfriend, but I’m in love with two sharpshooters: South Korea’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/31/style/kim-yeji-pistol-shooter-paris-olympics-intl-hnk/index.html">Kim Yeji</a> and Turkey’s <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/01/nx-s1-5060078/turkey-shooter-olympics-glasses-gear-silver">Yusuf Dikec</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Photos of the two have gone viral for completely opposite reasons. After she won silver in the 10-meter pistol event, a previous photo of Kim made the rounds on the internet. Dripped out in black athletic wear, futuristic eyeglasses customized for the sport, a backward hat, and boasting an ice-cold stance, Kim looked like someone had teleported her out of <em>Blade Runner.</em> </p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is this the hottest and coolest anyone has ever looked in history?

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dikec, on the other hand, wasn’t in any particular gear. The 51-year-old, who’s been competing at the Olympics since 2008, showed up in a T-shirt, jeans, and no shooting glasses. He nonchalantly pointed his gun and got to the podium with a silver medal.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The 51-year-old Turkish athlete Yusuf Dikeç makes a statement about going viral for competing at the Olympics without specialized equipment and winning a silver medal. <br><br>“I did not need special equipment.

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Can’t say that the US is bringing either style or skill when it comes to sharpshooting — deeply ironic that we have zero medals despite our gun culture — but I digress. It rules to see people stand on business. <em>—Izzie Ramirez, deputy editor of Future Perfect</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Loser: Paris’s eco-friendly approaches</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are a lot of studies that indicate that “nudging” people toward certain behavioral choices works. If oat milk is the automatic choice for an iced latte, <a href="https://www.theclimatechangereview.com/post/oat-milk-defaults-as-corporate-climate-action">more people would default to oat milk</a>. That’s better for health and environment — and I’m inclined to agree in <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-of-meat">most cases</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But perhaps the one place where I wouldn’t do that is the Olympics, where routine is everything. Athletes — elite and amateur alike — are notorious for sticking to what they know during a competition: nothing new. The night before a big race isn’t the time to try lentils — or Impossible Meat or even normal chicken! — if you’ve never had them before. Naturally, athletes have been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/30/paris-olympics-food-athletes-protein-meat/">complaining that they’re hungry</a> and that they can’t sleep because Paris <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/06/06/paris-olympics-no-air-conditioning-village-2024/">opted for no AC</a> and <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2024/07/31/not-anti-sex-but-backbreaking-olympic-athletes-review-eco-friendly-cardboard-beds">cardboard beds</a> as part of <a href="https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/our-commitments/the-environment/organising-more-responsible-games">its commitment to a more sustainable Games</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a vacuum, plant-based foods, lower electricity, and less waste are good things. We should value that. But when athletes need peak performance for this one moment, and when some countries can entirely ignore the nudges (Team USA brought window-unit ACs!), it creates a divide in performance, opens the door to anti-green backlash that could have been avoided, and leaves a bad taste. <em>—IR</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some people collect coins or stamps. For a time, I collected debit cards. Not stolen ones! Each one of them had my name on them, right below the logo of the latest banking app I’d decided to try out: Venmo, Cash App, Chime, Varo, Current, Acorns.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the better part of a decade, I did all my banking through these apps, enjoying their slick user experience and lack of fees. The problem with every one of them, however, is that they’re not chartered banks. If the company behind the app went bankrupt, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) would not necessarily come to my rescue.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This disaster scenario was a hypothetical worry when I eventually settled for Chase and its FDIC insurance. For millions of others, it became a reality earlier this year when a company called <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-synapse-bankruptcy-has-the-fintech-world-on-edge-f83cbe6d">collapsed and froze them out of their accounts</a>. Users of Yotta, a popular savings app with a built-in lottery, and other apps that relied on Synapse to help manage their accounts couldn’t access their money for months. Now, as hundreds of thousands of Synapse customers’ dollars <a href="https://fintechbusinessweekly.substack.com/p/sen-elizabeth-warren-calls-for-regulators">remain in limbo</a>, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/warren_van_hollen_letter_to_prudential_regulators_on_baas_oversight_91124.pdf">are calling for banking reforms</a>, and the FDIC is <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2024/fdic-proposes-deposit-insurance-recordkeeping-rule-banks-third-party">proposing changes</a> to its rules.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/fintechs-a-new-paradigm-of-growth">a growing number of people</a> are embracing these financial technology, or fintech, services. More than <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronshevlin/2023/07/05/the-checking-account-war-is-over-and-the-fintechs-have-won/">a third of Gen Z and millennials</a> used a fintech app or a digital bank as their primary checking account, according to a 2023 Cornerstone Advisors study.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So some questions are worth asking: Is it a bad idea to use an app like Venmo as your main bank? Are digital banks like Chime trustworthy enough?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The answer to both questions is yes. Venmo is not a bank, and using it as your primary checking account comes with some risks. Some fintech companies, like Chime, are just as big as traditional banks and offer some nice perks. Again, because they’re nontraditional, there are risks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“You&#8217;re not going to go back to a world where everybody works with a small bank and walks into a branch,” Shamir Karkal, co-founder of Simple, one of the first digital banks. “The future is just going to be more fintech, and I think we all just need to get better at it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To get better at all of this, it helps to know what’s going on behind the scenes.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Neobanks and money transmitters, briefly explained</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The term fintech can refer to a lot of things, but when you’re talking about everyday services for everyday people, it typically refers to either neobanks or money transmitters. Chime is a neobank. Venmo is a money transmitter. They’re regulated in different ways, but because most of these companies issue debit cards, many people treat them like checking accounts. Fintech apps are not the same thing as FDIC-insured banks.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Neobanks are fintech companies that offer services like checking accounts in partnership with chartered banks, which are FDIC-insured. Neobanks sometimes enlist intermediaries known as banking-as-a-service, or BaaS, companies, which are not FDIC-insured. Still, you will often see the FDIC logo on neobank websites, just like you see it stuck to the glass doors of many brick-and-mortar banks. That logo instills trust, and thanks to their partnerships, neobanks can claim some FDIC protections. But because they do not have bank charters, these neobanks and BaaS companies are not directly FDIC-insured. Instead, neobank customers can be eligible for something called <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/financial-institution-employees-guide-deposit-insurance/pass-through-deposit-insurance-coverage">pass-through deposit insurance coverage</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pass-through insurance is a simple concept <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/issue-spotlight-analysis-of-deposit-insurance-coverage-on-funds-stored-through-payment-apps/full-report/">that’s deceivingly complex in practice</a>. Essentially, if you deposit money into an account with a neobank, like Chime, the funds get routed to a chartered bank that is FDIC-insured. Other fintech apps, however, sometimes route your money through one of those BaaS intermediaries. If the chartered bank fails, no problem: FDIC insurance kicks in, and you can recoup up to $250,000 of your deposits. If the intermediary fails or the neobank itself fails, you might be eligible for pass-through insurance — but you might not. In its explainer about when or if you’ll get your money back in these kinds of situations, the FDIC literally says, “<a href="https://www.fdic.gov/consumer-resource-center/2024-06/banking-third-party-apps">It depends</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“American consumers see the FDIC logo, and they interpret that as meaning: My money is safe and I will get it back,” said Jason Mikula, who runs the popular <a href="https://fintechbusinessweekly.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=substack_profile">Fintech Business Weekly newsletter</a>. “That&#8217;s just not what FDIC does exactly.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Money transmitters, also known as money services businesses, are even further removed from the perceived safety of the FDIC. Put bluntly, if you’re keeping all your money in a Venmo or Cash App account, you don’t qualify for FDIC insurance. Money transmitters are not neobanks or banks at all but rather completely <a href="https://stripe.com/resources/more/what-is-a-money-transmitter#introduction">different legal entities</a> that are regulated by individual states as well as the Department of the Treasury. There are certain protections provided by these agencies, but FDIC insurance is not one of them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So when an app like <a href="https://www.withyotta.com/security">Yotta</a> or <a href="https://www.chime.com/">Chime</a> says on its website that it’s FDIC insured, it’s not a lie, but it’s not necessarily true either.&nbsp;To borrow the FDIC’s phrase, it depends — namely on how well records are kept. Poor record-keeping leads to confusion over whose money is where, and that could affect who qualifies for FDIC insurance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s a big range in how fintech companies operate. Yotta uses multiple intermediaries between its consumer-facing app and partner banks, which led to confusion when one of them, Synapse, went bankrupt. Chime, however, has a direct relationship with its FDIC-insured partner banks, the Bancorp Bank and Stride Bank. In <a href="https://www.chime.com/newsroom/news/chime-submits-comment-to-joint-banking-regulators-request-for-information-on-bank-fintech-partnerships/">a recent letter to regulators</a> that outlined its record-keeping practices, the company wrote, “Chime members are always a customer of an FDIC-insured bank.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Venmo, to its credit, admits in the fine print of its homepage that its parent company PayPal “is not a bank” and “is not FDIC insured.” To confuse you even more, however, certain PayPal services that enlist a chartered bank partner, like a PayPal Mastercard or savings account, <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/program-banks-tnc">might qualify for FDIC insurance</a>. Again, it depends.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The perils and perks of banking with an app</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fintech companies take careful steps to make banking with them feel safe. They include the FDIC logo on the website to provide customers with some peace of mind, even though the fine print on those protections is more complicated. They issue debit cards with the Visa or Mastercard logo to suggest that these cards play by the same rules as any big bank’s debit card. These logos can act as a stamp of approval, an assurance that your money is in good hands.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is actually the heart of the problem, as far as is concerned. This month, she and Van Hollen <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/warren_van_hollen_letter_to_prudential_regulators_on_baas_oversight_91124.pdf">asked regulators</a> to ban neobanks and fintech companies from using the FDIC name and logo if they were only offering pass-through insurance. They also called for greater supervision of these companies under the Bank Service Company Act.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The average consumer shouldn’t be expected to understand the intricacies of FDIC insurance in order to comfortably and safely save or invest their money,” Warren’s letter says. “Consumers must feel confident that they are dealing with a regulated and insured entity when they see the FDIC logo.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That doesn’t necessarily mean that all neobanks and fintech companies are untrustworthy. In some cases, the sheer size and track record of fintech companies can instill quite a bit of trust. Chime, the largest digital bank <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronshevlin/2024/03/24/is-chime-ready-for-an-ipo-it-has-more-primary-customers-than-chase/">with roughly 22 million customers</a>, scored a $25 billion valuation in its latest round of funding and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-22/chime-financial-is-said-to-target-public-listing-in-us-in-2025?sref=qYiz2hd0">is planning to go public next year</a>. PayPal is widely <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/digital-payments/2023/60percent-of-consumers-trust-paypal-over-their-bank-with-stored-payment-credentials/">considered safe and trustworthy</a>. And don’t expect Block, the $42 billion company that owns Cash App <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-financial-services-begins-banking-operations">as well as its own chartered bank</a>, to fail any time soon.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The truth is, even if there is some false sense of security, fintech apps offer certain customers features that big banks can’t or won’t. One thing that’s made Chime and many other neobanks so popular, for instance, is that they don’t charge so many fees. That’s a huge boon to young people <a href="https://www.vox.com/22367985/paypal-venmo-financial-inequality-unbanked-underbanked">as well as people without bank accounts</a>. If a fintech app is your only option, then you might not care so much about FDIC insurance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If you&#8217;re poor in America and you&#8217;re banking at Chase or Wells Fargo, you&#8217;re going to get overdraft fees, minimum balance fees,” Mikula said. “So there is a real need that [fintech] companies fulfill as a result of your establishment banks essentially not wanting to bank poor people because it&#8217;s difficult to do profitably.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As many as 6 percent of Americans <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/02/23percent-of-low-income-americans-are-living-without-a-bank-account.html">were living without a bank account</a> in 2023, according to Federal Reserve data. That share grows to 23 percent for those making less than $23,000 a year. The unbanked population, which disproportionately comprises Black, Hispanic, and undocumented people, is at a greater risk of falling victim to predatory lending practices, including payday loans. Some fintech companies also offer short-term loans, though they’ve been criticized <a href="https://apnews.com/article/earned-wage-access-costs-payday-loans-9679d1bd09546d12074e0f27e23f0632">for being predatory as well</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fraud alert</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Payment apps like Venmo are popular with scammers. Using a Venmo-branded debit card <a href="https://venmo.com/purchaseprotection/">comes with some purchase protection</a>. If you happen to fall for a scam, however, there’s a good chance the app will not pay you back.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://help.venmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/209681208-I-accidentally-paid-a-stranger-on-Venmo">Venmo</a>, <a href="https://cash.app/help/6544-avoiding-common-scams-with-cash-app">Cash App</a>, and <a href="https://www.zellepay.com/safety-education/fraud-scams-overview">Zelle</a> are all clear about issuing refunds for payments to other individuals: They don’t do it. Or at least they can’t guarantee it. You should treat these peer-to-peer payments like cash.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Here are some tips for spotting and avoiding scams on <a href="https://help.venmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048404533-Common-Scams-on-Venmo">Venmo</a>, <a href="https://cash.app/help/6544-avoiding-common-scams-with-cash-app#">Cash App</a>, and <a href="https://www.zellepay.com/safety-education/fraud-scams-overview">Zelle</a>. But if you’re more of a motivated-by-fear person, read <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/zelle-fraud-scam-swimming-pool-online-payment-apps-mobile-banking-2023-10">this story</a> about a guy who wanted a deal on a swimming pool and got “a $31,000 lesson in the downside of payment apps” instead.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, fintech companies offer the unbanked <a href="https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/12/17/three-barriers-unbanked-citizens-face-and-how-fintech-overcomes-them/">the ability to save money and build credit</a>. For someone who can’t open a traditional bank account, Venmo can be a lifeline, since they can add funds to their Venmo balance and then pay bills using their Venmo debit card without needing a traditional checking account. If they have access to a smartphone, getting basic banking services is simple these days.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As I learned firsthand when testing out many of these services over the years, it’s easy to sign up for and easy to deposit money into a fintech app. If you have a problem, however, help can be hard to find. Many fintech companies and neobanks, including Chime, lack brick-and-mortar locations, which means you can’t walk into a branch to get an issue resolved. In fact, poor customer service <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/neobanks-customer-service-growing-client-base">is a common complaint</a> for these companies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That means you should always research a company before giving money to it. Read the reviews and study the fine print. Obvious red flags include hidden fee structures and reports of customers not being able to withdraw their money. You should also consider trying services out with small sums rather than your life savings. And, as always, <a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/mobile-payment-apps-how-avoid-scam-when-you-use-one">watch out for scams and frauds</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What is true in the real world is even more true in the app world: Beware of deals that look too good to be true. Only gamble with what you’d be willing to lose.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Clarification, November 25, 5 pm ET: </strong>This story, originally published September 28, has been updated with additional details about how pass-through FDIC insurance works.</p>

	<figcaption>Activists demonstrate for climate finance for the Global South at the COP29 Climate Conference on November 21, 2024, in Baku, Azerbaijan.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The COP29 conference — the latest round of international climate change talks, held this year in Baku, Azerbaijan — pushed past its Friday deadline and ended over the weekend with a <a href="https://cop29.az/en/media-hub/news/breakthrough-in-baku-delivers-13tn-baku-finance-goal">new commitment to raise $300 billion a year</a> by 2035 to help developing countries cope with the effects of warming and transition to cleaner energy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“In a year of geopolitical fragmentation, people doubted that Azerbaijan could deliver. They doubted that everyone could agree,” said COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev during the conference. “They were wrong on both counts.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet despite the host country’s optimistic read on the summit’s conclusion, many delegates and activists were furious with what they saw as a meager investment.&nbsp; Yes, the new commitment is triple the current climate finance agreement of $100 billion per year. But wealthy countries were already <a href="https://www.climatechangenews.com/2024/05/29/rich-nations-meet-100bn-climate-finance-goal-two-years-late/">two years behind in meeting that original goal</a>, and the new target is still far short of the firm $1.3 trillion that developing countries have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/exclusive-african-governments-want-climate-finance-hit-13-trillion-by-2030-2021-10-06/">campaigned for years to secure</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It is sad that after months of negotiations, they have waited till the last official day of COP to table a dismal figure, leaving no sufficient time for deliberations amongst parties, and to make it worse, the figure is shockingly too low,” said Rohey John Manjang, environment minister for the West African nation Gambia, in a statement.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The negotiations also once again failed to reach an accord on reducing consumption of fossil fuels that are contributing to the warming of the planet.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The climate talks echoed the <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24000157/cop28-climate-conference-uae-dubai-winners-losers-fossil-fuels-methane">COP28 meeting</a> last year in the United Arab Emirates in that they were again held in a country whose economy depends on oil. Azerbaijan gets <a href="https://www.climatechangenews.com/2023/12/09/oil-reliant-azerbaijan-chosen-to-host-cop29-climate-talks/">two-thirds of its revenue from oil and gas production</a>, and a COP host was once again accused of using the proceedings to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmzvdn9e18o">forge fossil fuel export deals</a>. COP29 was also one of the most well-attended climate meetings, with 66,000 registrants, though it’s down from the record 80,000 attendees at last year’s talks. Like 2023, this year’s negotiations concluded near the end of what’s likely to be the <a href="https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/2024-track-be-hottest-year-record-warming-temporarily-hits-15degc">hottest year on record</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">COP29 faced additional complications. After a plateau and <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24139383/climate-change-peak-greenhouse-gas-emissions-action">hopes of a decline</a>, global <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/385183/cop29-climate-change-emissions-rising-trump-baku">greenhouse gas emissions are rising</a> again and are likely to continue climbing. To meet the target of the Paris climate agreement to limit warming this century to less than 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above pre-Industrial levels, humanity would have to cut emissions by <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/2022/04/04/ipcc-ar6-wgiii-pressrelease/">more than half by 2030</a>. According to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/08/world-scientists-climate-failure-survey-global-temperature">survey of scientists</a> who contributed to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, most now think this goal is out of reach.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With the US presidential election of Donald Trump, the world’s <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/the-carbon-brief-profile-united-states/">second-largest greenhouse gas emitter</a> is also likely to back out of the Paris agreement altogether. Trump would be <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/28/trump-paris-climate-treaty-withdrawal-again-00165903">fulfilling a campaign promise</a> after President Joe Biden brought the US back, following Trump’s withdrawal during his <a href="https://www.vox.com/21545960/paris-agreement-accord-exit-leaves-trump-biden-election-2020-climate-change">first term</a>. Trump also wants to <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/386462/trump-fossil-fuels-gas-oil">expand fossil fuel production</a> and may <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/trumps-transition-team-aims-kill-biden-ev-tax-credit-2024-11-14/">cut incentives for clean technologies</a> like electric vehicles.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Behind all this, the urgency to address climate change has only grown. 2024 has been a year of major disasters like <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/375996/extreme-heat-october-climate-change">heat waves</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/natural-disaster/374366/hurricane-helene-florida-big-bend-beryl-storms-climate">hurricanes</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24137250/coral-reefs-bleaching-climate-change">coral bleaching</a>, <a href="https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Devastating_floods_in_Spain_witnessed_by_satellites">flooding</a>, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/363880/park-fire-california-evacuations-housing-crisis">wildfires</a>, events whose raw ingredients are poised to become more powerful in a warming world.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These disasters are already having <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/377094/hurricane-milton-helene-home-insurance-flooding-damage">major economic effects</a>. And further changes to the climate are likely to have some of their most acute effects — <a href="https://press.un.org/en/2023/sc15199.doc.htm">rising sea levels</a>, more <a href="https://www.wfpusa.org/articles/countries-most-affected-by-climate-change/">extreme rainfall</a>, <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/climate-change-made-the-deadly-heatwaves-that-hit-millions-of-highly-vulnerable-people-across-asia-more-frequent-and-extreme/">extraordinary heat waves</a> — on the countries that contributed least to the problem. But as the US steps back, other countries like China are preparing to step up.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A smaller role for the US, and a bigger part for China</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The COP29 conference began after the US election, so the US negotiators were still part of Biden’s team, and they worked to nail down as much as they could before he leaves office in January. They highlighted how the US has made the single-largest clean energy investment in the world through the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/7/28/23281757/whats-in-climate-bill-inflation-reduction-act">Inflation Reduction Act</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">US negotiators noted that the US is <a href="https://www.state.gov/cop-29-update-u-s-international-public-climate-finance/">contributing $11 billion</a> to the pool of international climate financing, exceeding its share of the promised $100 billion pool funded by wealthy countries. The US also emphasized its goal of <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/biden-administration-plan-to-triple-us-nuclear-energy-capacity-by-2050/732807/#:~:text=In%20partnership%20with-,Biden%20administration%20sets%20plan%20to%20triple%20US%20nuclear%20energy%20capacity,the%20White%20House%20said%20Tuesday.">tripling its nuclear energy</a> compared to 2020 levels by 2050 and made progress in ratcheting down <a href="https://www.state.gov/highlights-from-the-cop-29-global-methane-pledge-ministerial/">emissions of methane</a>, a greenhouse gas that&#8217;s about <a href="https://www.epa.gov/gmi/importance-methane">30 times more potent</a> than carbon dioxide when it comes to trapping heat in the atmosphere.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden himself, though, didn’t attend the talks. He was instead at the <a href="https://www.g20.org/en/">G20 summit in Brazil</a>, where he visited the Amazon rainforest and pledged an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/17/president-biden-amazon-rainforest-brazil-climate-change/">additional $50 million</a> to protect it.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#039;m proud to be the first sitting U.S. President to visit the Amazon rainforest.<br><br>We must recommit to protecting our planet.<br> <br>Our world&#039;s forests are one of the most powerful solutions we have to fight climate change. <a href="https://t.co/MVEuddDQoS">pic.twitter.com/MVEuddDQoS</a></p>&mdash; President Biden (@POTUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1858310435004371015?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden acknowledged that his successor wants to undo many of his climate initiatives, but <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/11/23/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-conclusion-of-cop29-conference-in-baku-azerbaijan/">noted in a statement</a> that many cities and states will pick up the mantle on climate change, and many aspects of the transition to cleaner energy sources are unstoppable. Solar energy’s growth <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/372852/solar-power-energy-growth-record-us-climate-china">continues to defy forecasts</a>, <a href="https://www.irena.org/News/pressreleases/2023/Aug/Renewables-Competitiveness-Accelerates-Despite-Cost-Inflation">wind energy is competitive</a> with fossil fuels in some markets, and <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/electric-vehicle-sales-headed-for-record-year-but-growth-slowdown-puts-climate-targets-at-risk-according-to-bloombergnef-report/">EVs are getting more popular around the world</a>. “While some may seek to deny or delay the clean energy revolution that’s underway in America and around the world, nobody can reverse it — nobody,” Biden said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet under Biden, the US has also reached <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/372665/harris-trump-debate-energy-nationalism-climate">record high levels of oil and gas production</a> and maintained tariffs on Chinese clean energy products like solar panels and <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/2024/3/4/24087919/biden-tariff-chinese-ev-byd-battery-detroit">electric vehicles</a>. Even with the pause on new liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, the US is on track to <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24055711/lng-export-pause-biden-liquefied-natural-gas-climate-change">double LNG exports by 2030</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump wants to <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/11/25/1107224/how-trumps-tariffs-could-drive-up-the-cost-of-batteries-evs-and-more/">impose even more tariffs on China</a>, which would further raise the prices of imported EVs and make many of the essential components of clean energy systems, like batteries and steel, more expensive.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But as the US steps back from the international stage on climate change, China is gearing up to fill the void, emphasizing a <a href="https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202411/24/WS6742e163a310f1265a1cf41a.html">willingness to work with other countries</a>. China sent nearly <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-which-countries-have-sent-the-most-delegates-to-cop29/">1,000 delegates to COP29</a>. It already reigns supreme in <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/372852/solar-power-energy-growth-record-us-climate-china">solar energy</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/china-coal-generation-share-record-low-may-renewables-hit-new-highs-analysis-2024-07-11/">wind power</a>, <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/china-already-makes-as-many-batteries-as-the-entire-world-wants/">batteries</a>, and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ev-electric-cars-charging-china-us-competition/">electric vehicles</a>, both for its domestic consumption and for exports, and it’s hungry for new customers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">China, the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, will likely see a <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/have-china-s-carbon-emissions-peaked-answer-critical-limiting-global-warming">drop in carbon dioxide output this year</a>, but it’s not clear whether this trend will continue. Like the US, China is experiencing growing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/09/24/ai-power-grid-china-competition/">energy demands from its tech sector</a>, particularly from technologies like artificial intelligence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The next round of climate talks is scheduled for 2025 in Belém, Brazil, where countries are supposed to come to the table with <a href="https://unfccc.int/news/building-support-for-more-ambitious-national-climate-action-plans">even more ambitious goals</a> for curbing their greenhouse gases. But setting even tougher targets doesn’t mean much if countries are breaking their existing promises and emissions continue to rise.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I had hoped for a more ambitious outcome — on both finance and mitigation — to meet the great challenge we face,” said UN Secretary-General António Guterres in a statement. “I appeal to governments to see this agreement as a foundation — and build on it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>On the Money is a monthly advice column. If you want advice on spending, saving, or investing — or any of the complicated emotions that may come up as you prepare to make big financial decisions — you can&nbsp;</em><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScXuTsmpi2VQ6ZoRVEeHrgBSpkPkWSRWDH4zeY_TMBtPAhc4w/viewform"><em><strong>submit your question on this form</strong></em></a><em>. Here, we answer two questions asked by Vox readers, which have been edited and condensed.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I have a personal adviser that I pay to manage my investment portfolio — but I’m not sure whether I should continue paying this adviser. My investments are with Vanguard because of its low ETF fees. I have a total of four ETFs: VTI, VXUS, BND and BNDX. These ETFs are spread out between three accounts. My wife and I each have a Roth IRA, and we also have a taxable brokerage account. Two of the ETFs are in each account. Should I continue paying my Vanguard advisor to manage this portfolio?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dear Advised,</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The portfolio your adviser created for you is extremely well balanced. It’s also extremely diversified, in the sense that it includes an enormous variety of individual investments within four larger categories. You and your wife are currently invested in four exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that are designed to track broad segments of the market:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>VTI</strong>: the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ETF</li>



<li><strong>VXUS</strong>: the Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund ETF</li>



<li><strong>BND</strong>: the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund ETF</li>



<li><strong>BNDX</strong>: the Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund ETF</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In other words, you are invested in four ETFs that are made up of many, many smaller investments within the indices listed above — total stock, total international stock, total bond, and total international bond. Since you’re effectively invested in everything, your portfolio is likely to increase in value as long as the market itself doesn’t crash.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This kind of investment strategy is designed to get you through the <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/365271/stocks-dow-nasdaq-recession-us-economy-fed">ups and downs of the market</a> without a lot of risk, especially because I’m assuming your adviser is gradually adjusting the ratio of stocks to bonds as you and your wife approach retirement. Stocks offer greater growth potential than bonds but come with greater volatility, so a good investment adviser will slowly shift more of your investments over to bonds as you age. (Since bonds are less volatile, a bond-heavy portfolio should lose less of its value if the market drops before or during your retirement years.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, a <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/2023/8/10/23824235/how-to-invest-money-stock-market-investing-retirement-advice">target-date retirement fund</a> does exactly the same thing, and you don’t need to pay an adviser for that.&nbsp;</p>

</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vanguard personal advisers offer additional services beyond portfolio rebalancing, including guidance on how to withdraw money during retirement and strategies on how to manage the taxes associated with investments, so you may have the opportunity to get more out of your advisor than you would out of a target-date fund.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also worth noting that your typical target-date retirement fund is likely to come with a higher expense ratio than a Vanguard ETF, costing you more money over time. VFIFX, for example, which is Vanguard’s target-date retirement fund for people planning to retire between 2048 and 2052, has an expense ratio of 0.08 percent. Your VTI ETF only has an expense ratio of 0.03 percent, which means that less of your money goes towards administering the fund.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’m not suggesting that you drop your adviser and transfer all of your investments into a target-date retirement fund. I’m not a professional investment advisor myself, which means I cannot provide specific investment advice — plus, I have an extremely limited knowledge of your situation. However, I can suggest that you talk to your adviser about the full range of services they offer and ask yourself whether you are interested in taking advantage of those services.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you decide you’d rather manage your investments on your own, you could always keep your current portfolio as-is and rebalance it yourself, adjusting the percentage of stocks to bonds every few years.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you are planning to retire in 2050, for example, you can take a look at <a href="https://institutional.vanguard.com/investments/product-details/fund/0699">Vanguard’s VFIFX glidepath</a> and literally replicate it with your own ETFs. At age 40, for example, VFIFX puts roughly 55 percent of your investments in stocks, 35 percent in international stocks, 8 percent in bonds, and 2 percent in international bonds. By the time you reach age 65, VFIFX has adjusted your investments to include 30 percent stocks, 20 percent international stocks, 25 percent bonds, 15 percent international bonds, and the remaining 10 percent in short-term TIPS, which are inflation-protected securities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If that sounds too confusing, or if you aren’t sure whether you have enough time to schedule and track regular portfolio reallocations, you may want to just stick with your current adviser.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also worth noting that a good investment adviser may be able to keep you from making impulsive decisions, such as <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/377119/how-to-start-investing-stock-market-budget-save">selling during a temporary downturn</a> — and may also be able to advise you on other financial issues such as how much to withdraw during retirement. They may even be able to help you with estate planning, if that’s important to you and your wife. Feel free to ask your advisor what you can expect over the next few decades, and use that response to help you decide whether or not to maintain the relationship.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No matter what you decide to do next, your current portfolio puts you in a great place to get started.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the past few years, the public has stopped treating movie press tours like marketing fluff and started treating them like reality shows. These often tedious stretches of talk-show appearances, red carpets, and press junkets that have been part of the Hollywood grind for decades are suddenly getting as much attention on social media as the films themselves, with the stars&#8217; interactions being picked apart by fans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2022/9/6/23339631/dont-worry-darling-wilde-pugh-feud-explained">social media frenzy surrounding the 2022 film <em>Don’t Worry Darling</em></a>, press tours have become sites of intense speculation often translating to full-blown scandals, from affair speculation from <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23700956/sydney-sweeney-glen-powell-dating-anyone-but-you-drama"><em>Anyone but You</em></a> fans to the persistent rumors of everyone versus Justin Baldoni on the set of <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/366523/blake-lively-drama-justin-baldoni-it-ends-with-us-hoover-movie-feud"><em>It Ends With Us</em></a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not surprising that this trend has struck the most anticipated (or unavoidable) movie of the year, <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/386247/wicked-2024-movie-novel-ending-explained-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo"><em>Wicked</em></a>. From its stars’ character-inspired outfits to the extremely sappy nature of their press junkets — including a <a href="https://x.com/MashaParty/status/1859618868194341249">now-heavily memed “holding space”</a> moment — all eyes are on the <em>Wicked </em>cast. However, this attention has manifested in a more uncomfortable way than rumors about Harry Styles’s spit. Both Erivo and Grande have become subjects of rampant online theories and scrutiny regarding their red carpet appearances, adding an icky element to an otherwise wholesome movie rollout.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of this press tour nonsense speaks to the free-for-all nature of the internet, particularly in the TikTok age. In its worst cases, this insatiable desire for controversy can override ethical or productive conversations. Inevitably, these narratives become seen as absolute truths.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Wicked</em></strong><strong>’s press tour got the internet’s attention, for better or worse</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The promotion for <em>Wicked</em> dates all the way back to March when Erivo and Grande <a href="https://people.com/oscars-2024-wicked-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo-present-together-8604687">presented at the Academy Awards</a> together wearing green and pink gowns representing their respective roles as Elphaba and Glinda. Since then, themed dressing, <a href="https://time.com/6293686/margot-robbie-barbie-inspired-press-tour-looks/">a la Margot Robbie for <em>Barbie</em>,</a> has been a significant feature of the press tour. The two have also been keen on highlighting their close friendship, one of the overarching themes of the musical. They often hold hands on red carpets and in interviews, in addition to complimenting one another’s talents in interviews. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP_Veq-nXeo">now-viral interview</a> with reporter Jake Hamilton, they were asked how they’ve been changed by one another, causing Grande to well up. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Both actresses’ tendency to cry and be overly sentimental while discussing a film about witches and talking goats has become <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqnB6LzUV2s">a bit of a joke</a> on social media. One interview in particular became a source of mockery and a <a href="https://x.com/verysmallriver/status/1860414912373100716">viral </a><a href="https://x.com/barbzforbernie/status/1859721156703682685">meme</a> over the past week. During an interview with Out, writer Tracy E. Gilchrist tells Erivo and Grande about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/bbM6B4qFz3Q">impact of the musical’s signature number “Defying Gravity”</a> in the days following the reelection of Donald Trump, using popular <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/between-the-generations/202305/what-does-it-mean-to-hold-space">therapy language</a> to explain that fans are “holding space” for the lyrics. Gilchrist seems to be saying that the emotions in the song are resonating with fans after the election, but frankly her meaning is a little unclear. A solemn instrumental of the songs plays as Erivo responds meditatively, “That’s really powerful; that’s what I wanted.” Grande, welling up again, grabs her castmate’s finger for emotional support. </p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, not all the attention Erivo and Grande are receiving on the press tour is as light-hearted. Even separate from the press tour, Grande’s appearance was already being put under a microscope on social media. In April 2023, the singer posted a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@arianagrande/video/7220884832472026414?refer=embed">video on TikTok</a> urging fans to stop speculating about her body weight after Redditors and other social media users <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/ariana-grande-reminds-us-to-stop-being-weird-about-celebrities-bodies/?utm_source=pocket_shared">expressed concern about her thinness</a>. Grande told social media users to be “gentler and less comfortable” discussing people’s bodies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her response did little to quell those public chatter. In fact, the speculation around a potential eating disorder has torpedoed into a weeks-long discussion among both fans and detractors on social media in the months since <em>Wicked</em>’s press tour began. Social media users have claimed <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2024/11/21/ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo-wicked-bodies/76463422007/">Erivo also looks markedly</a> thinner. Some have even accused the pair of costars of having <a href="https://x.com/teenykittyluvr/status/1857133914789457936">competitive</a> <a href="https://x.com/waitstopwhat/status/1857209224511590531">eating</a> <a href="https://x.com/tayrussellsbtch/status/1857824622021947667">disorders</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, others have expressed concern about the effects over Erivo and Grande being so hypervisible at their current state. Some even suggested the two are promoting <a href="https://x.com/HopeRehak/status/1858228447622930736">eating disorders</a>, if not inadvertently triggering people who have them. Others have put the responsibility on their teams for not intervening. In an op-ed for the Standard, India Block writes that the <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/wicked-ariana-grande-cynthia-eviro-thin-b1193895.html">conversation around their appearance</a> is more so “an indictment of Grande and Erivo’s management, the <em>Wicked</em> team, and the entertainment industry as a whole.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the wake of an <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24001338/ozempic-bodies-barbie-botox-corporate-feminism">Ozempic fad that’s taken over Hollywood</a> and the concerns it’s raised, it’s not exactly a shock that we got here. Still, it’s unclear how this very public conjecture will benefit anyone. Maybe Grande and Erivo’s well-being was never really the point of the conversation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>How press tours became bigger than the movies</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Considering the point of press tours is to generate press attention, <em>Wicked</em>’s was a massive success, despite the controversies that dogged the film along the way. Compared to the laundry list of other movies from the past few years whose press tours eclipsed the impact of the film itself, <em>Wicked</em>’s mess was positively tame.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the discourse around the <em>Barbie</em> press tour, perhaps the most famous in recent history, seemed solely focused on star Margot Robbie’s hyper-coordinated fashion moments and director Greta Gerwig’s techniques to bring Barbieland to life, there was juicier drama behind the scenes of other films. When Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney were busy promoting <em>Anyone but You, </em>their palpable <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23700956/sydney-sweeney-glen-powell-dating-anyone-but-you-drama">chemistry didn’t go unnoticed</a>. Both had partners going into filming, but Powell left single, after his girlfriend unfollowed Sweeney on Instagram and posted a cryptic breakup message (a source claimed they never hooked up).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This, of course, is what press tours are designed to do: Make audiences believe that the heat between its leads isn’t just an act, that it’s real — and if there are real-world repercussions, welp, that’s showbiz, baby. (Who could forget Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper’s <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/11/lady-gaga-oprah-interview-a-star-is-born.html">year-long lovefest</a> to promote <em>A Star Is Born</em>?). There are some cases where the on-set chemistry is, in fact, real — whenever Zendaya and Tom Holland get to promote a <em>Spider-Man</em> movie together, the internet collectively squeals — and some cases where it’s so real that people’s lives get blown apart (like when Kristen Stewart, then dating Robert Pattinson, had an affair with Rupert Sanders, the married director of <em>Snow White and the Huntsman</em>).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the most compelling version of press tour drama is when the cast seems to absolutely hate each other. That’s what thirsty fans were treated to in advance of this fall’s <em>It Ends With Us, </em>in which star Blake Lively clashed with director and co-star Justin Baldoni. Though details were murky and mostly seemed to center on a difference in creative vision between the two (not exactly the stuff of soap operas), it snowballed into fodder for all kinds of other discussions on the controversial themes of the film, which dealt with domestic violence, Baldoni’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/366523/blake-lively-drama-justin-baldoni-it-ends-with-us-hoover-movie-feud">previous life as a self-identified “male feminist”</a> voice online, and Lively’s husband Ryan Reynolds, who people tend to have strong opinions about.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2022/9/6/23339631/dont-worry-darling-wilde-pugh-feud-explained">2022’s <em>Don’t Worry Darling</em> had both love and hate</a> — buzz about an affair between director and star Olivia Wilde and her lead actor, pop megastar Harry Styles, and rumors of tension between everyone from Wilde and actress Florence Pugh, Pugh and one-time co-star Shia LaBeouf, and, potentially, Styles and co-star Chris Pine, with whom he was alleged to have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UryoAepZqOM">spit on at the premiere</a>. (The spitting was roundly denied.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of these films have been major box office successes, begging the question of how much the off-screen drama convinced people to buy tickets. This isn’t always the case; when Joaquin Phoenix caused controversy for his behavior on the 2008 press tour for <em>Two Lovers,</em> which he later described as &#8220;performance art,” it didn’t translate to tons of sales.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps that’s because audiences’ relationship to press tours is extremely different than it was 16 years ago. Thanks to social media, people now have unprecedented access into the lives of celebrities and industry insiders to the point where they’re absorbing the jargon of the business and speculating on the career trajectories of their favorites. Normal fans now regularly <a href="https://x.com/guyfierisuprfan/status/1848372521604673770">discuss whether a certain star</a> is sufficiently “media trained,” congratulating those who are able to sidestep uncomfortable questions and seem unflappable. You’d think it’s counterintuitive — don’t people <em>want</em> their celebrities to be unfiltered and entertaining rather than “brand-safe”? Instead, they cheer on the <a href="https://x.com/guyfierisuprfan/status/1848372521604673770">performance of celebrity</a> rather than the celebrity herself.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In other words, press tours aren’t for the press anymore. They’re for the general public, which has, in turn, become the press — or at least the press that matters. What would once involve a trip to a couple late night talk shows and a glossy magazine cover now mandates appearances on a laundry list of shows, many of them online-only, whether that means shoving down chicken wings on <em>Hot Ones</em>, flirting with Amelia Dimoldenberg on <em>Chicken Shop Date</em>, taking a Vanity Fair lie detector test, or gabbing about your must-have products with GQ. Footage from these shows and red carpet interviews are then clipped and optimized to go viral on social media and become inescapable whether you’re interested in seeing the film or not.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because so much of press tours now take place online, it’s even easier to feel like what you’re seeing is an authentic portrayal of actors’ lives. It seems less manufactured (though of course the celebrities are there to work). It’s easy to believe that Grande and Erivo really do share Glinda and Elphaba’s complex best friendship — or even, perhaps, that you’re their friend, too. A dramatic or intense off-camera dynamic among a cast now might be exactly what convinces audiences to shell out for movie tickets, because it feels like the stakes are immediate. Wait too long to see it, and you might have missed out on your chance to join in the discourse while it’s still fresh.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the case of <em>Wicked,</em> it’ll be interesting to see how Part One compares to next year’s promotional tour. How many more times can we see Erivo and Grande in theatrical green and pink gowns crying over how much they love each other? How much more — and please excuse the <em>Wicked</em> pun — popular could it even get?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/food-and-drug-administration-v-wages-and-white-lion-investments-llc/"><em>FDA v. Wages and White Lion Investments</em></a>, which the Supreme Court will hear on the first Monday in December, is a significant case in its own right. It involves the Food and Drug Administration’s long-delayed attempt to regulate flavored nicotine vapes and to prevent children from becoming addicted to nicotine because they are enticed by vapes with fruit or candy flavors.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the case is also significant for another reason. Seven federal appeals courts <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-1038/323413/20240826164114741_23-1038tsFDA.pdf">unanimously rejected</a> legal challenges to the FDA’s decision not to authorize certain flavored vapes and e-cigarettes. Only one outlier court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, took a position that is unusually favorable to tobacco companies, which led us to this Supreme Court case.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Fifth Circuit is the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/12/27/23496264/supreme-court-fifth-circuit-trump-court-immigration-housing-sexual-harrassment">most right-wing appeals court in the federal system</a> — and is notorious for its contrarian decisions. Post 2024 election, it is a particularly important court to watch, as it is also considered a breeding ground for potential Trump nominees to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of its judges, Andrew Oldham, is the author of the Fifth Circuit’s decision in <em>White Lion</em>. Oldham is widely considered a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-will-name-conservative-judges-may-even-pick-majority-supreme-cou-rcna179130">strong contender for a Supreme Court nomination</a> if an opening arises in the incoming Trump administration, especially if his former boss, Justice Samuel Alito, retires. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In his <em>White Lion </em>opinion, Oldham claims that the FDA botched its decision to effectively pull several fruit- and candy-flavored nicotine vapes from the market, and must run through its decision process again. If it were to do so, the agency could reach a different result on flavored vapes: It will have new leadership in the Trump administration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are two things to know about Oldham’s opinion. One, it appears to have been written not just to sabotage the FDA’s regulation of vaping but to drastically undercut the federal government’s ability to perform all sorts of routine and uncontroversial actions. If the Supreme Court accepted his arguments, they’d greatly undermine the federal government’s ability to regulate businesses and communicate with the public.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Two, Oldham’s opinion is very sloppy: It takes significant liberties with the law and is riddled with very basic factual errors. In fact, shortly after it was handed down, one of the tobacco companies that prevailed in Oldham’s court filed a brief motion pointing out one of these factual errors and asking the court to “<a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca5.204569/gov.uscourts.ca5.204569.362.0.pdf">amend, modify, or otherwise clarify</a>” Oldham’s opinion to remove this misstatement of fact (the court <a href="https://ecf.ca5.uscourts.gov/n/beam/servlet/TransportRoom?servlet=ShowDocMulti&amp;incPdfHeader=Y&amp;pacer=t&amp;CSRF=csrf_4851528641319406030&amp;incPdfHeaderDisp=Y&amp;caseId=204569&amp;recapDocNum=367&amp;recapCaseNum=21-60766&amp;outputType=doc&amp;d=10315025&amp;outputForm=view&amp;incPdfFooter=&amp;dls=7093534%252C7093539">refused to do so</a>).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of that means <em>White Lion</em> is significant for three reasons. It is likely to reveal whether the Supreme Court will allow judges to sabotage attempts to regulate tobacco that are authorized by federal law. It shines a light on a prominent Trump judge who may soon become one of the most powerful people in the United States. And it places the justices in the awkward position of reviewing some truly shoddy work by someone who could soon become one of their colleagues.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though the Supreme Court is very conservative, with a 6-3 Republican supermajority, it is likely that even this Court will reverse Oldham’s <em>White Lion</em> decision. Neither the Fifth Circuit, <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358326/supreme-court-netchoice-moody-paxton-first-amendment">nor Oldham in particular</a>, have a particularly strong record when their decisions are reviewed by the Supreme Court. Additionally, seven federal appeals courts other than the Fifth Circuit have considered the same legal question presented in <em>White Lion</em>, and every single judge that heard those cases rejected Oldham’s reasoning.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, it’s important to remember that this is the same Supreme Court that recently held that Trump is allowed to <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship">use the powers of the presidency to commit crimes</a>, so there’s no guarantee that a majority of the justices will follow existing law in <em>White Lion</em>, no matter how clear that law may be.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So what are the rules governing flavored vapes?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>White Lion</em> arises out of the FDA’s effort to rein in youth vaping long after, as Trump’s own FDA commissioner said in 2019, the US saw an “<a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/statement-fda-commissioner-scott-gottlieb-md-advancing-new-policies-aimed-preventing-youth-access">epidemic-level rise in youth e-cigarette use</a>.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Congress did not pass a law permitting the FDA to regulate tobacco <a href="https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/rules-regulations-and-guidance-related-tobacco-products/family-smoking-prevention-and-tobacco-control-act-overview">until 2009</a>, and the FDA didn’t finalize its regulations allowing it to regulate vapes <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/10/2016-10685/deeming-tobacco-products-to-be-subject-to-the-federal-food-drug-and-cosmetic-act-as-amended-by-the">until 2016</a>. Those regulations, moreover, only gradually rolled out enforcement of the new restrictions on vapes, and litigation delayed matters even further.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the end, companies that wished to sell vaping products were required to <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3197171505574771345&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr">seek FDA approval of those products by September 9, 2020</a>, or else those products were to be removed from the market. Companies that met this application deadline were given an additional grace period when they could still market their product in the US while the FDA considered their application.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The result is that flavored vapes are now everywhere, and the FDA is stuck playing catch up. The <em>White Lion </em>case involves the FDA’s decision not to allow two companies to sell vapes with flavors that seem designed to appeal to children and teens, such as <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-1038/323413/20240826164114741_23-1038tsFDA.pdf">“Chewy Clouds Sour Grape,” “Killer Kustard,” and “Suicide Bunny Mother’s Milk and Cookies.”</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite the law’s slow rollout, it <a href="https://casetext.com/statute/united-states-code/title-21-food-and-drugs/chapter-9-federal-food-drug-and-cosmetic-act/subchapter-ix-tobacco-products/section-387j-application-for-review-of-certain-tobacco-products">imposes strict regulations on “new” tobacco products</a>, which it defines as any such product “that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007,” or any modification to a tobacco product marketed after this date. Flavored vapes count as such a “new” product.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Under the law, the FDA “<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/387j">shall deny an application</a>” seeking to market such a product unless it determines that permitting a particular vape to remain on the market is “appropriate for the protection of the public health.” To make this determination, the FDA must weigh whether permitting a particular vaping device to be sold would cause more existing smokers to “stop using such products” than it would cause “those who do not use tobacco products” to “start using such products.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Armed with this statutory mandate, the FDA has approved vaping products that it believes are likely to convert tobacco smokers into vapers, on the theory that vaping is less dangerous than smoking. But it has rejected products that it believes are likely to encourage people who do not currently use nicotine — and especially children and teens who do not vape — to take up the habit.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Specifically, the FDA <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-1038/323413/20240826164114741_23-1038tsFDA.pdf">approved several vaping products that taste similar to cigarettes</a>, believing that adult smokers may prefer these less-dangerous products over smoking. Most of the FDA-approved flavored vapes are tobacco flavored, but the FDA also recently approved a handful of menthol-flavored vapes as well (menthol is a common flavor in cigarettes).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, the FDA has thus far rejected applications to market fruit-flavored, candy-flavored, or other sweet-tasting vapes, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-1038/323413/20240826164114741_23-1038tsFDA.pdf">pointing to data</a> showing that these products are especially likely to appeal to children and teens. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of this said, the FDA has not issued a blanket rule forbidding fruit-flavored vapes or approving tobacco-flavored ones. Instead, anyone who wishes to sell a vaping product in the United States must submit an individualized application to the FDA, which must lay out the evidence that their product is likely to convert adult smokers into vapers without encouraging new people to take up vaping. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So it is at least theoretically possible that someone could develop a cherry-flavored vape that is unusually unattractive to teens and earn FDA approval.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So how did Andy Oldham wind up getting involved?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After the FDA started denying applications to sell flavored vapes, lawsuits abounded. For the moment, however, every single judge who does not sit in the Fifth Circuit rejected Oldham’s arguments that the FDA broke the law when it denied these applications. (The one possible exception is the Eleventh Circuit, which ruled in favor of a vaping company in <a href="https://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/202113340.pdf"><em>Bidi Vapor v. FDA</em></a> (2022). <em>Bidi Vapor</em>, however, was a narrow opinion that turned on facts specific to that case.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Oldham and his court, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-1038/323413/20240826164114741_23-1038tsFDA.pdf">claim to have found <em>five</em> separate legal flaws</a> in the FDA’s decision to reject flavored vapes that every other judge this issue came before missed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Oldham devotes the bulk of his opinion to a single argument: He claims that the FDA broke the law because it told vaping companies to submit one kind of evidence when they applied for FDA approval of their products, and then the FDA did a “<a href="https://casetext.com/case/wages-white-lion-invs-v-food-drug-admin-2">regulatory switcheroo</a>” and denied those applications for failing to present a different kind of evidence. However, in reaching this conclusion, Oldham misstates the law and makes factual errors that undermine the entire premise of his opinion.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Oldham’s primary argument, for example, is that the FDA engaged in a “switcheroo” because it previously told vaping companies that it “does not expect that applicants will have to conduct long-term studies to support an application,” then later decided to impose “<a href="https://casetext.com/case/wages-white-lion-invs-v-food-drug-admin-2">two requirements—randomized controlled trials and longitudinal cohort studies</a>.” (A “longitudinal cohort study” is one that <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/longitudinal-cohort-study">follows a large group of test subjects over a long time</a>.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But this claim is obviously false. Here’s <a href="https://casetext.com/case/wages-white-lion-invs-v-food-drug-admin-2">what the FDA actually said</a> when it denied the applications at issue in <em>White Lion</em>:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">In light of the known risks to youth of marketing flavored [vaping products], robust and reliable evidence is needed regarding the magnitude of the potential benefit to adult smokers. This evidence could have been provided using a randomized controlled trial and/or longitudinal cohort study that demonstrated the benefit of your flavored [vaping] products over an appropriate comparator tobacco-flavored [product]. Alternatively, FDA would consider other evidence<strong> </strong>but only if it reliably and robustly evaluated the impact of the new flavored vs. Tobacco-flavored products on adult smokers&#8217; switching or cigarette reduction over time<strong>.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The FDA, in other words, very clearly did not say that applicants must submit “randomized controlled trials and longitudinal cohort studies,” as Oldham claims. It said that applicants “could have provided” these kinds of studies. But the FDA also “would consider other evidence.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Elsewhere in his opinion, Oldham tries to impose a new legal obligation on federal agencies that would severely undermine their ability to function and communicate with the public.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During the period between 2016, when the FDA issued its initial rule announcing that it would regulate vapes, and when the agency actually started to grant or deny applications to sell certain vaping products, the agency also released several nonbinding “guidance” documents. These documents provided vaping companies with some information on the agency’s thinking on the product approval process, and offered them advice on how to assemble a successful application.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These sorts of guidance documents do not have the force of law, but agencies of all kinds frequently release them to advise the public about the agency’s internal thinking, and to help companies anticipate what sort of actions could get them in trouble with the federal government.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Oldham claims that the vaping companies should prevail because these documents “could be read in good faith” to support those companies’ position, even though these documents are nonbinding and the agency itself rejects the companies’ interpretation of these documents. As Oldham writes, “for FDA to prevail, not only must its understanding of the [guidance documents] be reasonable, but the manufacturers&#8217; understanding of those [documents] <a href="https://casetext.com/case/wages-white-lion-invs-v-food-drug-admin-2">also must be <em>unreasonable</em></a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Oldham, in other words, would permit regulated businesses to comb through every nonbinding statement an agency has ever made, looking for phrases that could plausibly be interpreted to undermine the agency, and then insist that such a contested interpretation of a nonbinding document must bind the agency. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As the Justice Department points out in its brief, Oldham’s rule would create a perverse incentive for agencies that would hurt regulated businesses in the long run. Right now, agencies routinely release guidance documents in order to “furnish private parties with useful advice about how the agency interprets the law and how it plans to exercise its discretion.” But if those documents can be weaponized against the agency in the way Oldham suggests, that “<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-1038/323413/20240826164114741_23-1038tsFDA.pdf">discourages agencies from providing guidance in the first place</a>—an outcome that, in the long run, harms rather than helps regulated parties.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you want to read a more comprehensive catalog of Oldham’s many missteps, I encourage you to <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-1038/323413/20240826164114741_23-1038tsFDA.pdf">read the Justice Department’s brief</a>. It exposes an opinion riddled with errors of all kinds, many of which are obvious to anyone familiar with the facts of this case.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The poorly reasoned <em>White Lion</em> opinion is typical of Oldham’s work</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Everyone, including federal judges, has bad days at the office. So if <em>White Lion</em> were an isolated example of Oldham releasing a shoddy opinion, it could probably be overlooked. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But <em>White Lion </em>is by no means an isolated case. It is, in fact, quite typical of Oldham’s work.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Shortly before the election, for example, Oldham handed down an opinion in <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25252882/rnc-ballots-case.pdf"><em>Republican National Committee v. Wetzel</em></a>, which claims that an 1872 law setting the date when federal elections take place forbids states from counting mailed ballots that arrive after Election Day — and that somehow no one noticed this fact for the last 152 years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ordinarily, after mentioning a judge’s opinion, I would attempt to summarize its reasoning, but it is hard to even say what Oldham’s argument is. As I wrote shortly after the decision was handed down, he appears to have <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/380481/republican-wetzel-fifth-circuit-supreme-court-ballots-mail">simply made up some of his conclusions</a> — and he cites no legal authority whatsoever to support key contentions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Or take Oldham’s opinion in <a href="https://casetext.com/case/netchoice-llc-v-paxton-2"><em>NetChoice v. Paxton</em></a> (2022), where Oldham upheld a state law that would have <a href="https://casetext.com/case/netchoice-llc-v-paxton-2">placed the Texas government in charge of content moderation</a> at the major social media outlets. This law is obviously unconstitutional — the First Amendment does not permit the government to seize control of the media’s editorial decisions — and the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358326/supreme-court-netchoice-moody-paxton-first-amendment">rejected Oldham’s approach in a 6-3 decision</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Oldham also joined two opinions threatening the continued existence of two entire federal agencies, the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/6/24/22547545/supreme-court-collins-yellen-124-billion-housing-unitary-executive-samuel-alito-neil-gorsuch">Federal Housing Finance Agency</a> and the <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/24158216/supreme-court-cfpb-clarence-thomas-community-financial">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a>. If the Supreme Court had adopted Oldham’s position in either case, it would have so <a href="https://www.vox.com/22106497/supreme-court-collins-mnuchin-124-billion-fannie-mae-freddie-mac-unitary-executive-housing">severely disrupted the US housing market</a> that it could have triggered the <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/9/23/23864355/supreme-court-cfpb-unconstitutional-consumer-financial-fifth-circuit-great-depression">worst economic catastrophe</a> since the Great Depression. Fortunately, the justices rejected Oldham’s position in each case, and by a lopsided margin.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At least on the surface, Oldham appears conventionally qualified for the Supreme Court. He graduated from Harvard Law School, clerked for Alito, and is a sitting US Court of Appeals judge. But his record on the bench reveals someone who is reckless with power, often not even really bothering to explain the reasoning behind his opinions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, by all outward signs, he is a strong contender for the high Court in the incoming Trump administration. Among other things, the Federalist Society, which played an <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/9/20962980/trump-supreme-court-federal-judges">enormous role in selecting Trump’s judicial nominees</a> during his first term, just <a href="https://fedsoc.org/conferences/2024-national-lawyers-convention#agenda-item-2024-nlc-welcome">made Oldham the opening speaker at its annual lawyers convention</a>. That’s a plum speaking gig for any judge campaigning for higher office.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If he does achieve such office, Oldham’s uniquely careless approach to legal analysis could shape US law for a very long time. Oldham is in his mid-40s, so he could potentially serve on the Supreme Court for several decades if appointed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk have become an inseparable duo. Since Trump’s reelection, the richest man in the world — and one of Trump’s top campaign donors — has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/musk-trump-transition-mar-a-lago.html">been a shadow</a> <a href="https://x.com/cspan/status/1857244757795234212">trailing</a> him at his Florida residence. The tech billionaire has taken center stage in the incoming administration, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/musk-and-ramaswamy-the-doge-plan-to-reform-government-supreme-court-guidance-end-executive-power-grab-fa51c020?mod=hp_opin_pos_0">promising to slash $2 trillion</a> from the federal government’s budget.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A whirlwind relationship developing between a politician — in this case, the president-elect — and a financial backer isn’t unusual. What stands out is how much the donor himself is in the spotlight. Tim Walz’s <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/23/tim-walz-takes-jab-at-elon-musk-calling-him-trumps-running-mate/75806046007/">joke</a> that Musk, not JD Vance, was Trump’s running mate, rings more true every day. “We’ve never really seen anyone be that directly connected with a campaign unless they were the candidate,” says Jason Seawright, a political science professor at Northwestern University and co-author of <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/B/bo29143391.html"><em>Billionaires and Stealth Politics</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It makes Musk an oddity among his billionaire class, who almost always use their influence quietly.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He’s showing other members of the ultra-wealthy a bold alternative to stealth politics, urged on by a president-elect who has embraced giving <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelatindera/2019/07/25/the-definitive-net-worth-of-donald-trumps-cabinet/">billionaires a seat at the table</a>. A private citizen can grab power in full view of the public — as long as they’re rich enough, and have enough fans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We are in an era that I call ‘in-your-face oligarchy,’” says Jeffrey A. Winters, a professor at Northwestern who researches oligarchs and inequality. Twenty years ago, it was a challenge to get his students to understand that there were oligarchs in the US. Now, he says, “I have a very hard time getting students to accept the idea that there’s democracy.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Buying political power is nothing new – but Musk’s brazenness is different</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">American politics has always been dominated by its most well-heeled citizens, whether by holding office themselves, using their money to get their preferred candidates into office, or helping shape policies. Benefactors are often <a href="https://gould.usc.edu/why/students/orgs/ilj/assets/docs/31-3-Scofield.pdf">well-rewarded</a> with access to the levers of government, whether it’s receiving a <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2004/07/bushs-baseball-ambassadors/">cushy ambassadorship</a> or even cabinet position, getting generous <a href="https://publicintegrity.org/politics/obama-rewards-big-bundlers-with-jobs-commissions-stimulus-money-government-contracts-and-more/">government contracts</a>, acting as <a href="https://www.techtransparencyproject.org/articles/eric-schmidt-obamas-chief-corporate-ally">informal advisers</a>, steering <a href="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2022/10/07/new-book-highlights-how-campaign-money-influences-us-foreign-policy/">controversial foreign policy decisions,</a> or taking on a more <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/11/05/erik-prince-trump-ukraine-china/">shadowy but</a> <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/ike-perlmutter-bruce-moskowitz-marc-sherman-shadow-rulers-of-the-va">no less influential role</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While both Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris enjoyed an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kylemullins/2024/11/04/the-billions-behind-the-2024-presidential-election/">abundance of ultra-rich supporters</a>, just <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2024/11/big-money-big-stakes-5-things-everyone-should-know-about-money-in-2024-election/">10 billionaires gave 44 percent</a> of all the money supporting Trump. It’s part of why the word “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/11/trumpist-oligarchy-big-tech-takeover-musk-bezos/680503/">oligarchy</a>” is being <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/11/20/business/trump-musk-white-house-oligarchy/">thrown</a> <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/188467/trumps-musk-oligarchy-corruption">around</a>, although not for the first time. “Going back more than 2,000 years in history, oligarch has always referred to people who are empowered by tremendous wealth,” explains Winters. “That’s always a small part of the population, but they’re able to convert their wealth into political influence.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Musk donated some $130 million to help elect Trump and other Republicans, and he doesn&#8217;t have an official appointment in the Trump administration at this point — instead, he’ll be leading the Department of Government Efficiency (<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1856523237208797221">DOGE for short</a>) alongside fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy. The twin heads of the efficiency commission aim to chop at least <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/384904/trumps-department-of-government-efficiency-sounds-like-a-joke-it-isnt">$2 trillion</a> in <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1856935591696289889">government waste</a> — such as the budgets of pesky regulatory agencies that slow down <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1856823028027625589">building</a> and <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1842250303762051263">launching</a> rockets. (It’s worth noting that there’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-11-14/musk-s-department-of-government-efficiency-is-highly-inefficient">already an agency</a> tasked with trying to ensure the federal government runs efficiently.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Barbara A. Perry, co-chair of the Presidential Oral History Program at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center, tells Vox that she can’t think of another example in American history quite like Musk. “It just seems that Musk is taking a much larger role than any other person who would have come close to playing his role,” she says. Musk doesn’t have previous experience in a similar political appointment, nor is he stepping down from any of his companies despite potentially wielding a lot of sway over agencies that regulate his firms.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Back in 2016, the big Trump donor drawing scrutiny was hedge fund manager Robert Mercer. The Mercer family gave over $15 million to support Trump’s run, and their considerable investment in the right-wing news site Breitbart was influential in <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/03/14/520087884/researchers-examine-breitbart-s-influence-on-misleading-information">promoting Trump’s presidential candidacy</a>. The parallels to Musk are striking, given his ownership of social media site X and the role it played in spreading <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/elon-musk-conspiracy-theory-immigration-terror-rcna141827">right-wing</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/misinformation/elon-musk-x-boosts-election-conspiracy-theories-ai-trends-twitter-rcna176941">conspiracies</a> <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/elon-musk-twitter-misinformation-timeline-1235076786/">and misinformation</a> to voters, as well as the owner’s explicit Trump endorsements.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Mercer’s contributions came behind the scenes. He’s hardly ever given interviews, and little is known about his personal life. That’s the case for the vast majority of wealthy donors — it’s Elon Musk, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/technology/elon-musk-x-election.html">posting incessantly on X</a> about how he sees the world, who’s the outlier.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Musk could be a sign of how billionaire political strategy is changing</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/B/bo29143391.html"><em>Billionaires and Stealth Politics</em></a>, published in 2018 in the aftermath of the first Trump election, Seawright and fellow Northwestern researchers Matthew J. Lacombe and Benjamin I. Page studied how this tiny subset of the super-rich engaged in political activity. What they found is that while most never speak publicly about their views, conservative billionaires tended to spend more money while speaking less; liberal billionaires spent less, but they were more likely to speak up.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Take Mark Cuban, who became one of the most visible billionaire boosters of Harris this year but made a point to say he <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4955829-mark-cuban-kamala-harris-campaign-funding/">didn’t donate at all</a> to her campaign. On the flip side, while Musk got all the attention as a Republican megadonor this cycle, the actual <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2024/08/heir-to-andrew-mellons-fortune-spends-over-165-million-to-support-trumps-reelection/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2024/08/heir-to-andrew-mellons-fortune-spends-over-165-million-to-support-trumps-reelection/">top donor</a> was a man you might have never heard of: <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/11/09/timothy-mellon-net-worth-top-donor-trump-campaign-elon-musk/">Timothy Mellon</a>, a banking heir who the public knows little about.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Stealth has pretty much been the modus operandi for as long as rich Americans have been putting their fingers on the scale of democracy — until Musk came along.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Musk isn’t the only vocally partisan conservative billionaire donor today, though — there are also figures like hedge fund manager <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/billionaire-bill-ackman-endorses-trump-us-presidential-race-2024-07-14/">Bill Ackman</a> and crypto investors <a href="https://x.com/tyler/status/1853839083069436058">Tyler</a> and <a href="https://x.com/cameron/status/1853849885310628292">Cameron Winklevoss</a> who have no qualms about sharing their politics online — but he is the most emblematic of this shift. Musk isn’t just Trump’s financial backer and the media mogul behind an increasingly instrumental arm of right-wing messaging — he’s an influencer with a following that most politicians running for office probably wish they commanded.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Corporate executives today are more than bosses. They’re thought leaders who publish memoirs offering <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23699172/self-help-ceo-money-advice-billionaires">broad lessons on how to succeed in life</a> and are often propped up as idols.  Musk is the prime example. Though he has now lost some of his <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2022/10/28/23426922/elon-musk-army-fandom-former-fans-twitter-ceo">original admirers</a>, his word is still gospel to a horde of mostly young men who think Musk will fight back against the liberal establishment. It’s spurred on by an ecosystem of social media <a href="https://x.com/teslaownersSV">fan accounts</a> circulating his <a href="https://x.com/muskqu0tes?lang=en">wisest quotes</a>, idyllic AI-generated images of him <a href="https://www.404media.co/absurd-ai-slop-about-how-elon-musk-will-fix-america-is-megaviral-on-facebook/">achieving fake heroic feats</a>, and above all, by Musk’s own words as he holds forth on his personal X account. On X, Musk currently has over 200 million followers; at a Trump town hall that Musk hosted in October in Pennsylvania, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/us/elections/elon-musk-town-hall-pennsylvania.html">it was clear</a> that at least part of the crowd had come to get a glimpse of the famous billionaire.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The nature of Musk’s public persona is important, too: Like Trump, he portrays himself as a populist who <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1834157436737126488">understands</a> <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1842121187461042217">your</a> <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1855560954534416627">frustrations</a>. Musk’s acquisition of Twitter was framed as a remedy to “fake news” pushed by legacy media outlets, purporting to create a town square that boosts all voices. According to Musk, even the budget-cut ideas for DOGE will be crowdsourced (with the aid of volunteers willing to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/elon-musk-doge-trump-jobs-department-government-administration-rcna180210">work 80-plus hours</a> a week for free) and <a href="https://x.com/VivekGRamaswamy/status/1857409631548486045">broadcast</a> on X. The richest person in the world presents as a man of the people.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some might argue that Musk is “no different than the kind of oligarch that we see in many other countries,” says Benjamin Soskis, a historian and senior research associate at the Urban Institute’s Center on Nonprofits and Philanthropy. “What I think is different about it is that Musk is doing this in the full glare of public regard, and with a kind of presumed democratic legitimacy to it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For his fans, in other words, Musk’s position as the incoming president’s right-hand man isn’t the dirty maneuvering of a billionaire using money to access power. It reads almost as a “philanthropic commitment” and an example of “do-gooding,” says Soskis. (Musk has famously <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/10/us/elon-musk-charity.html">not been very philanthropic</a>.) If the noblesse oblige of billionaires in the past manifested in founding libraries and hospitals, Musk shows it by claiming to be a voice for the people — a megaphone for their anger and resentment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When asked why a billionaire like Musk might be so comfortable announcing their political worldview, Seawright offers one theory: Maybe there are thresholds of wealth where the consequences — like public backlash or losing a few billion dollars —&nbsp; just don’t matter that much.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If so, that has worrying implications for the trajectory of American society. Our billionaires are certainly enjoying never-before-seen heights of wealth. Tesla’s stock has soared since Election Day, with Musk’s personal net worth now hovering around $300 billion. But it’s worth noting that the birth of the centibillionaire is very recent; Musk, along with <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2022/9/29/23377578/tech-billionaires-pandemic-wealth-2022">many other tech leaders</a>, saw his fortune balloon during the pandemic. In 2019, he was worth a comparatively paltry <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk/">$22 billion</a> — which is about half of what he paid to buy Twitter in 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Musk is unprecedented simply for the fact that there has never been a political donor, adviser, and celebrity all rolled into one with the gravitational pull of a $300 billion fortune. While wealth has always bought you access in America, Musk is one of the most unsubtle examples we’ve ever seen. And for all the worry one might feel upon witnessing him waltz into the White House, there’s something instructive about it, too. It lays bare the mechanism of power in American democracy in the starkest terms.</p>

<p>Over Thanksgiving, in between mouthfuls of turkey and sweet potato pie, many of us will be asking ourselves: What are we grateful for?</p>

<p>Taking a moment to practice gratitude like this isn’t an empty holiday tradition. It’s good for our <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_gratitude_changes_you_and_your_brain">mental</a> and <a href="https://insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00006842-201607000-00005">physical</a> health. And here’s another thing:<strong> </strong>It can actually change our brains in ways that make us more altruistic — just in time for <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/11/26/18098840/when-is-giving-tuesday">Giving Tuesday</a>.</p>

<p>The past two decades have seen a flurry of research on gratitude, beginning in the early 2000s with a series of landmark papers by Robert Emmons, Michael McCullough, and other psychologists. In recent years, we’ve learned through <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00599/full">several</a> <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_gratitude_changes_you_and_your_brain">scientific</a> <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288932385_The_effects_of_gratitude_expression_on_neural_activity">studies</a> that there’s a deep neural connection between gratitude and giving — they share a pathway in the brain —&nbsp;and that when we’re grateful, our brains become more charitable.</p>

<p>Christina Karns, a neuroscientist at the University of Oregon, is one of the leading researchers in this field. In 2017, she wondered what happens in the brain when you receive a gift versus when you give one —&nbsp;and whether the neural response differs depending on your character. So she placed study participants in a brain scanner and had them watch as a computer moved real money into their own account or gave it to a food bank instead.</p>

<p>Karns <a href="https://theconversation.com/when-youre-grateful-your-brain-becomes-more-charitable-105606">described</a> what she learned:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>It turns out that the neural connection between gratitude and giving is very deep, both literally and figuratively. A region deep in the frontal lobe of the brain, called the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, is key to supporting both. Anatomically, this region is wired up to be a hub for processing the value of risk and reward; it’s richly connected to even deeper brain regions that provide a kick of pleasurable neurochemicals in the right circumstances.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The participants I’d identified as more grateful and more altruistic via a questionnaire [showed] a stronger response in these reward regions of the brain when they saw the charity gaining money. It felt good for them to see the food bank do well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Next, Karns wanted to know whether, by changing how much gratitude people felt, she could change the way the brain reacts to giving and getting. So she split participants into two groups. Over three weeks, one group journaled about the things they were grateful for, while the other group journaled about other (non-gratitude-specific) happenings in their lives.</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Vox guide to giving</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">The holiday season is giving season. This year, Vox is exploring every element of charitable giving — from making the case for donating 10 percent of your income, to recommending specific charities for specific causes, to explaining what you can do to make a difference beyond donations. <a href="https://www.vox.com/charitable-giving">You can find all of our giving guide stories here</a>.</p>
</div>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading"></h1>

<p>The people in the gratitude-journaling contingent reported experiencing more thankfulness. What’s more, the reward regions of their brain started responding more to charitable giving than to gaining money for themselves. As Karns writes:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Practicing gratitude shifted the value of giving in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. It changed the exchange rate in the brain. Giving to charity became more valuable than receiving money yourself. After the brain calculates the exchange rate, you get paid in the neural currency of reward, the delivery of neurotransmitters that signal pleasure and goal attainment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are striking (though likely not permanent) effects. Of course, we still need<strong> </strong>more research to fully understand the brain mechanisms underlying gratitude, giving, and how they relate. But for those of us who don’t always find resonant the old adage that “giving is better than receiving,” Karns’s results,<strong> </strong>if true, offer a useful amendment: Giving really can be better — if you make it so. You can proactively choose to retrain your brain so it gets more pleasure out of giving.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Here are some effective ways to cultivate gratitude</h2>

<p>If increasing people’s gratitude is an effective way to increase their charitableness, then maybe it’s worth nudging people to cultivate more gratitude.</p>

<p>For now, we’ve got at least one such nudge built into our calendar: Thanksgiving. Many religious traditions also include daily practices meant to foster gratitude, and scientific studies have shown that some — like <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232522538_Can_Prayer_Increase_Gratitude">prayer</a> —&nbsp;really do have that effect.</p>

<p>If practicing gratitude isn’t yet part of your daily routine and you’d like to cultivate it throughout the year and not only on Thanksgiving, here are a few practices that researchers have found to be effective in boosting thankfulness.</p>

<p><strong>Gratitude journaling: </strong>This simple practice — jotting down things you’re grateful for&nbsp;—&nbsp;has gained popularity over the past few years. But studies show there are <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/tips_for_keeping_a_gratitude_journal">more and less effective ways to do it</a>. Researchers say it’s better to write in detail about one particular thing, really savoring it, than to dash off a superficial list of things. They recommend that you try to focus on people you’re grateful to, because that’s more impactful than focusing on things, and that you focus on events that surprised you, because they generally elicit stronger feelings of thankfulness.</p>

<p>Researchers also note that writing in a gratitude journal once or twice a week is better for your well-being than doing it every day. In one study, people who wrote once a week for six weeks reported increased happiness afterward; people who wrote three times a week didn’t. That’s because our brains have an annoying habit called hedonic adaptation. “We adapt to positive events quickly, especially if we constantly focus on them,” Emmons <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/tips_for_keeping_a_gratitude_journal">explains</a>. “It seems counterintuitive, but it is how the mind works.”</p>

<p><strong>Gratitude letters and visits:</strong> Another practice is to write a letter of gratitude to someone. Research shows it significantly increases your levels of gratitude, even if you never actually send the letter. And the effects on the brain can last for months. In one <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26746580">study</a>, subjects who participated in gratitude letter writing expressed more thankfulness and showed more activity in their pregenual anterior cingulate cortex — an area involved in predicting the outcomes of our actions — three months later.</p>

<p>Some psychologists, like Martin Seligman, Sonja&nbsp;Lyubomirsky, and Jeffrey Froh,<strong> </strong>have studied a variation on the gratitude letter practice by having participants write a letter to someone they’ve never properly thanked, then visit the person and read the letter aloud to them. A&nbsp;<a href="http://people.hofstra.edu/jeffrey_j_froh/fall%202009%20web/froh%20article%20PDF_JOPP%20final%20proof-1.pdf">2009 study led by Froh</a>&nbsp;found that teens experienced a big increase in positive emotions after doing a gratitude visit —&nbsp;even two months later.</p>

<p><strong>Experiential consumption:</strong> There’s another way to foster gratitude and thwart hedonic adaptation that seems especially relevant to the upcoming gift-buying season: <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/11/13/20951937/money-experiences-buy-happiness-happy-how-to-spend">Spend your money on experiences</a>, not things. The Greater Good Science Center at UC Berkeley <a href="https://ggsc.berkeley.edu/images/uploads/GGSC-JTF_White_Paper-Gratitude-FINAL.pdf?_ga=2.266174863.1800487513.1574786384-585000017.1571342301">summarizes</a> a major study on experiential consumption like this:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Across six experiments, this study found that people felt and expressed more gratitude following a purchase of an experience (e.g., concert tickets or meals out) than a purchase of a material good (e.g., clothing or jewelry). According to the researchers, these experiments suggest that “as a naturalistic behavior that is relatively resistant to adaptation, experiential consumption may be an especially easy way to encourage the experience of gratitude.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, if you’re going to buy something special this holiday season, consider making it an experience. The resultant gratitude is more likely to stick around in the brain — and where gratitude abounds, altruism may follow.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A chief campaign promise from President-elect Donald Trump — which has also been echoed by his secretary of defense pick <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/12/defense-world-reacts-to-trump-pick-pete-hegseth-00189221">Pete Hegseth</a> — centers on getting rid of military generals who they deem as too “woke.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I would fire them. You can’t have woke military,” Trump said in a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-vows-fire-generals-push-wokeness-cant-woke-military">Fox News interview in June</a> summing up his views.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Any general that was involved — general, admiral, whatever — that was involved in any of the DEI woke shit, it’s got to go,” Hegseth <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoN5ovwB8s4">said in a podcast interview</a> released in November that was conducted prior to his nomination.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They claim the military has been so distracted by efforts to promote diversity in its ranks that it’s negatively affected the body’s readiness for conflicts as well as its ability to recruit new soldiers. <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2023/03/30/pentagon-critics-blame-diversity-policies-and-fitness-standards-recruiting-woes.html">Pentagon officials have refuted these statements</a>, <a href="https://www.armyupress.army.mil/Journals/Military-Review/English-Edition-Archives/May-June-2021/Garrett-Military-Diversity/">however.</a> And a <a href="https://www.rand.org/news/press/2022/08/24.html">2022 RAND Corporation report</a> laid out key ways that leveraging diversity could be beneficial to the military and its ability to develop new technology and <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2022/09/diversity-in-the-high-brass?lang=en">build stronger teams.</a> <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/opinions/2024/11/21/military-diversity-not-problem.html">According to many national security experts</a>, there’s scant evidence to support Trump and Hegseth’s claims.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, if Trump wants to fire generals once he takes office, he can.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The president has unilateral authority to fire general officers,” says Katherine Kuzminski, the director of the military, veterans, and society program at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank specializing in national security. Under the wide-ranging powers presidents are given by the Constitution as the country’s commander-in-chief, they can remove generals at will over a loss of confidence in their leadership.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/trump-draft-executive-order-would-create-board-to-purge-generals-7ebaa606">Wall Street Journal report</a>, the incoming administration is already laying the groundwork for such firings. Per a draft executive order the publication obtained, the Trump White House is considering establishing a “warrior board” of former generals and military officials who will be dedicated to reviewing current military leaders. Following their review, the panel will reportedly determine which officers they’d like to remove, with the aim of retiring them at their existing rank within 20 days.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has only spoken in sweeping terms about changes to military leadership, so it’s unclear exactly how many high-ranking troops might be fired. However, were the president-elect to follow through on his promises — particularly at a larger scale —&nbsp; they could have a disruptive effect on military operations.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A mass firing would need to be followed with the elevation of lots of new leaders, some of whom might lack the experience of their predecessors. Several national security experts also told Vox they worry about the message a mass firing would send — including the idea that military officials have to express political views in line with Trump’s in order to hold onto their jobs.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Trump has avenues to “fire” generals</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are two ways Trump could get rid of top generals.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first is to issue an explicit call to resign. The second is the removal of a military leader’s assignment. For example, three- and four-star generals, the highest levels an officer can achieve, attain that rank because they’re given an assignment — like being named chief of staff of a military branch — and have responsibilities related to it. If that assignment was revoked, they’d revert to two-star rank. Typically, leaders who lose assignments retire, military experts note.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s because individuals maintain their title and benefits upon retirement. Those who retire at a higher rank stand to receive thousands more in retirement pay than those who revert to a lower rank. So, a three-star general about to lose their assignment would likely retire in order to hold onto better retirement benefits than a two-star one.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If you have the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff or another senior military leader holding a particular position of command or responsibility, the president can relieve them pretty much on a very vague notion that he&#8217;s lost confidence in their ability to lead,” Victor Hansen, a New England Law school professor and former judge advocate general in the Army, tells Vox.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s little recourse for generals to appeal a decision to remove them from their assignments, experts tell Vox. And since military officers serve at what’s often described as “<a href="https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2017/october/know-what-officer-commission-means">the pleasure of the president</a>,” there’s not much Congress can do to intervene beyond holding hearings to raise awareness about potential staffing changes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the less likely scenario that a general chooses not to retire from the military —&nbsp;and chooses to go back to a lower rank —&nbsp;the president could also try to kick them out of the armed services completely, if he wanted them fully out of the military. The process for doing so is more complicated, however.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/wm-ushistory1/chapter/the-reconstruction-acts-and-johnsons-impeachment/" data-type="link" data-id="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/wm-ushistory1/chapter/the-reconstruction-acts-and-johnsons-impeachment/">In the 186os</a>, Congress approved legislation that limits a president’s ability to entirely dismiss someone from the military. <a href="https://sites.duke.edu/lawfire/2016/09/15/can-presidents-fire-senior-military-officers-generally-yesbut-its-complicated/">Under this policy,</a> the individual in question needs to either face a sentence from a court-martial to be removed, have a court-martial sentence commuted, or be dismissed during a time of war by the president. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because the policy is relatively vague — including in what it defines as a “time of war” — the president still has significant leeway to terminate individuals, but any attempt to do so could face court challenges.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Trump does remove senior military leaders, he also wouldn’t be able to replace them on his own. Nomination of new generals of three- and four-star status requires Senate confirmation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Any attempt to follow through on these promises would set a disturbing new precedent</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are past examples of presidents firing generals, though there isn’t a precedent of the type of wholesale purge Trump has alluded to.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Previously, President Harry Truman <a href="https://www.trumanlibrary.gov/education/presidential-inquiries/firing-macarthur">fired Gen. Douglas MacArthur</a> due to disagreements they had over the handling of the Korean War. President Barack Obama also <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/10395402">fired Gen. Stanley McChrystal</a> after he made disparaging comments about Obama’s approach to the war in Afghanistan and criticized other members of the White House. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s plans would be unique because they aren’t founded upon a general’s specific approach to a military conflict and would be tied more to their perceived political ideology, given Republicans tend to have a far more <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/11/19/views-of-dei-have-become-slightly-more-negative-among-us-workers/">negative view of diversity, equity, and inclusion</a> initiatives than Democrats. The scope of potential firings could also make his approach different.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some military experts warn that a mass firing could create the very problem Trump’s allies say they are trying to solve: that removing lots of leaders at once could hurt readiness.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It would be very disruptive,” Hansen told Vox. “There’s ongoing operational combatant commanders. They’re in the thick of it all over the world now.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And other national security experts told Vox that forcing military leaders to ascribe to a certain views on diversity could be seen as a personal loyalty test for Trump, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/11/22/rip-dei-donald-trump-president/76116276007/">given his stated positions</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There&#8217;s the fear that these processes will be perverted by an administration that&#8217;s bent on revenge, retaliation, and on vetting officers based on loyalty tests to the president versus loyalty to the Constitution,” says Rachel VanLandingham, a professor at Southwestern Law School and a former active duty judge advocate in the Air Force. “That&#8217;s how we become an authoritarian state when you have the most powerful military in the world that&#8217;s swearing an oath… not to their Constitution and to the American people, but to a person.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2023, around <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/24-07-2024-hunger-numbers-stubbornly-high-for-three-consecutive-years-as-global-crises-deepen--un-report#:~:text=The%20report%20highlights%20that%20access,moderately%20or%20severely%20food%20insecure.">2.3 billion people globally</a> faced moderate or severe food insecurity, often going without food for an entire day or more. On the frontlines of this crisis are food banks. While the Global Food Banking Network provided <a href="https://www.foodbanking.org/blogs/food-banks-provided-vital-services-to-meet-high-demand/">1.7 billion meals to over 40 million people</a> in 2023, more progress is needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, what role should food and beverage companies play?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“A lot of food banks need staples like long-life milk and fresh produce,” explains Rashna Shroff, Community Programs and Partnerships Manager at Nestlé Australia. “But often food bank organizations which rely on donations can struggle to meet demand and often look for institutional support,” she adds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To support food banks in their efforts to combat food insecurity, companies like Nestlé are taking action. In 2023, Nestlé donated over <a href="https://www.nestle.com/sustainability/people-communities/community-giving">140 million food servings globally</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Along with donating stock, a company like Nestlé can do so much,” Shroff shares. “Our brands have intentionally fostered partnerships with food banks, our employees volunteer their time to pack food boxes or sort donations, and we also fund programs like nutrition education initiatives.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s how that’s playing out globally. In Indonesia, children face high rates of stunting  <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11110397/">due to chronic malnutrition</a>. Nestlé Indonesia is collaborating with local partner Edufarmers on their ZeroStunting program to focus on <a href="https://www.edufarmers.org/zerostunting-the-familys-frontline-to-reduce-stunting-rates-a-synergy-between-edufarmers-and-nestle-indonesia-">nutrition issues and bolster communities.</a> This includes product donations and educational programs to improve nutrition awareness. And it’s working, one program they collaborated on <a href="https://www.edufarmers.org/zerostunting-the-familys-frontline-to-reduce-stunting-rates-a-synergy-between-edufarmers-and-nestle-indonesia-">lowered severe stunting rates by 28%</a> over the course of 100 days.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the United States, <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/ag-and-food-statistics-charting-the-essentials/food-security-and-nutrition-assistance/#:~:text=In%202023%2C%2013.5%20percent%20of,were%20affected%20by%20food%20insecurity">one in eight people</a> struggle with hunger. Nestlé USA has partnered with <a href="https://www.nestleusa.com/communities">Feeding America</a>, the nation’s largest hunger relief organization, and local food access groups like <a href="https://ridall.org/">Rid-All</a>, an urban farm in Cleveland, Ohio, to strengthen urban farming initiatives and community food systems.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Down under, Nestlé Australia has partnered with<a href="https://www.nestle.com.au/en/sustainability/people-communities/foodbank"> Foodbank Australia</a> to mitigate a common challenge faced by food relief organizations: inconsistent food donations. Food banks often receive a random assortment of items, making it difficult for families to prepare balanced, nutritious meals. To alleviate this, Nestlé Australia worked with several industry partners to develop the <a href="https://www.foodbank.org.au/collaborative-supply-program/maggi/?state=au">Maggi Hearty One Pot Casserole</a>, a recipe base that is designed to create delicious and nutritious meals with the food found in relief packages. This is the first ever designed-for-Foodbank product, and since its creation in 2021 has helped to make more than <a href="https://www.foodbank.org.au/collaborative-supply-program/maggi/?state=au">1.2 million meals a year</a>. “Our number one goal is to help feed more people,” says Rashna Shroff.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By leveraging resources like staff, inventory, and supply chains, companies can empower food banks. Successful partnerships built on strong relationships, local needs assessments, and sustainable systems, can create a lasting impact on the billions of people that need food each year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With the GOP regaining control of Congress, Republicans are looking to slash health care spending, specifically <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/health/medicaid-cuts-republican-congress.html">eyeing Medicaid cuts</a> and work requirements. While those fights are almost certainly going to garner a lot of coverage, it’s important to also pay attention to some of the less splashy policies also on the chopping block.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These might not be major programs. You might not have even heard of some of them. But America’s social safety net relies on a patchwork of many different, sometimes low-profile, subsidies that many of us take for granted. Some of these programs might only appear in spending bills as a small line item that few people notice, and that makes it just that much easier for lawmakers to slowly but surely dismantle our social safety net.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s one example: For millions of families, a spike in health care costs might be around the corner because crucial subsidies are set to expire at the end of next year. Some families will see their premiums rise by thousands of dollars; others might lose their insurance altogether.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2021, President Joe Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act, which included a provision that enhanced the premium tax credit — a piece of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that subsidized the cost of premiums for some lower- and middle-income families. The Biden-era enhancements, which <a href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/issue-brief/inflation-reduction-act-health-insurance-subsidies-what-is-their-impact-and-what-would-happen-if-they-expire/">essentially expanded the number of people</a> who qualify for the tax credit, were originally set to expire at the end of 2022, but Congress <a href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/issue-brief/inflation-reduction-act-health-insurance-subsidies-what-is-their-impact-and-what-would-happen-if-they-expire/">extended them through 2025</a> when it passed the Inflation Reduction Act. (For families at or slightly above the poverty line, the enhanced tax credit subsidizes the full premium. For people making more than 400 percent of the poverty line — people who were previously ineligible for this subsidy — it <a href="https://www.kff.org/interactive/how-much-more-would-people-pay-in-premiums-if-the-acas-enhanced-subsidies-expired/">caps their premiums to 8.5 percent</a> of their income.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The enhanced premium tax credits contributed to a record number of insured people in the United States. In February 2021, before Congress expanded the premium tax credits, 11.2 million people were enrolled in health coverage through ACA marketplaces. By 2024, that number <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/premium-tax-credit-improvements-must-be-extended-to-prevent-steep-rise-in-health">shot up to 20.8 million people</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are many reasons for the dramatic increase in marketplace coverage — including the fact that <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/press-release/as-medicaid-unwinding-concludes-in-most-states-kff-finds-25-million-lost-medicaid-coverage-but-enrollment-is-10-million-higher-than-pre-pandemic-levels/">millions of people were disenrolled</a> from Medicaid coverage after Covid emergency measures lapsed and had to turn to other forms of insurance, including the marketplace — but the enhanced premium tax credit played a critical role. Its expansion was the main reason so many more people were able to enroll in health care coverage from the ACA marketplace, <a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/another-year-of-record-aca-marketplace-signups-driven-in-part-by-medicaid-unwinding-and-enhanced-subsidies/">according to the Kaiser Family Foundation</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Congress allows the enhanced premium tax credits to expire, millions of people will see a noticeable rise in out-of-pocket expenses. Many will likely lose their coverage, and that’s without considering how much more will be at stake if Medicaid gets slashed as well. For low-income families, particularly those who live just above the poverty line, that could be a nightmare.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Who’s at risk of seeing higher costs?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The enhanced tax credits didn’t overhaul the health care system, and you probably don’t remember hearing candidates talk about them much, if at all, during the election. But they proved to be a crucial, if small, improvement to the system already in place, and had immediate and tangible results when it came to getting more people insured. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The premium tax credit improvements really led to huge pocket savings for people — $700 [per year] on average,” said Gideon Lukens, a senior fellow and director of research and data analysis at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP). “They were really the primary reason that marketplace enrollment increased … and the uninsured rate fell to an all-time low.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As of now, around <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/premium-tax-credit-improvements-must-be-extended-to-prevent-steep-rise-in-health">93 percent of people</a> enrolled through the ACA marketplace receive a premium tax credit. But if these tax credit expansions aren’t extended or made permanent, <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2024-06/60437-Arrington-Smith-Letter.pdf">3.4 million people</a> could lose their insurance, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The Urban Institute similarly estimates that <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/four-million-people-will-lose-health-insurance-if-premium-tax-credit-enhancements-expire">4 million people could lose their insurance</a> if Congress doesn’t act in time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/premium-tax-credit-improvements-must-be-extended-to-prevent-steep-rise-in-health">According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</a>, Black and Latino people benefited most from the enhanced premium tax credit,&nbsp;so they will likely be disproportionately affected by cuts. Marketplace enrollment among Black people, for example, grew by 186 percent after the enhanced premium tax credit went into effect, and for Latino people, it grew by 158 percent. By contrast, marketplace enrollment for other racial groups grew by 63 percent during the same period.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More than 19 million people will likely see higher premiums without the enhanced tax credit. Many families could see costs go up significantly, especially if they have moderate incomes or have older members, who already have to pay higher premiums. A 60-year-old couple making $82,000 a year, for example, could see their monthly premiums triple, which means they would owe an additional $18,400 out of pocket, according to the <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/premium-tax-credit-improvements-must-be-extended-to-prevent-steep-rise-in-health#_ftn14">CBPP report</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Looking ahead</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The GOP will be responsible for deciding whether the enhanced premium tax credits should expire or be extended. Given the success of the tax credits — leading to a record-high enrollment rate — it would be a mistake to let the enhancements lapse.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the GOP might not necessarily be so eager to expand social programs — it tried and failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act during Donald Trump’s first term — the benefits of the enhanced premium tax credit are extremely tangible, and if they’re gone, millions of Americans will quickly notice. That could give Democrats room to put pressure on Republicans to strike a deal that, ideally, would make these enhancements permanent. So while lawmakers should fight tooth and nail to minimize or avoid cuts to major programs like Medicare or Medicaid, they should also remember that these small adjustments are worth fighting for as well, including things like the enhanced premium tax credit or, say, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/11/18/gop-targets-medicaid-food-stamps/">what people can buy with food stamps</a>, these provisions still lower the cost of living for millions of families.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Republicans regain control of Congress and the White House, it’s easy to lose hope that any meaningful antipoverty efforts will happen at the federal level. But while elections have consequences, they also aren’t permanent. That’s why, over the coming months, I’ll be focusing on what antipoverty policies states across the country are experimenting with — experiments that could one day be replicated at the federal level when it’s more politically feasible. Have you benefited from state or local programs that you think would be a good model for the rest of the country? If so, I’d love to hear from you. Please email me at abdallah.fayyad@vox.com.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the past year, <a href="https://www.sonnyangel.com/en/">Sonny Angel</a> — a biblically inaccurate, 3-inch-tall cherub figurine with peculiar headgear — has taken over the hearts, minds, phones, display shelves, and nightstands of collectors across the world. The plastic dolls, wearing helmets ranging in form from pancakes to sunflowers, are garnering millions of views on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@itsjakeflemm/video/7261751179980426539?q=sonny%20angel%20unbox&amp;t=1719405935742">TikTok and Instagram</a>, popping up in supermodel <a href="https://www.nylon.com/life/how-sonny-angel-became-gen-z-darling">Bella Hadid</a>’s social media posts and on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SonnyAngel/comments/1cf4bah/not_victoria_beckham_being_into_sonny_angels_too/">Victoria Beckham’s phone</a>, and the subject of an entire sketch on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFTvWtHVA8E"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Like any phenomenon where someone is buying tons of a thing that you may not be, the obvious question arises: Why is everyone so obsessed with these tiny winged boys?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The simplest answer is the official <a href="https://sonnyangelusa.com/pages/about">Sonny Angel</a> slogan: “<a href="https://www.sonnyangel.com/en/about/">He may bring you happiness</a>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s a tantalizing promise. Money can’t buy you happiness, allegedly. But it can buy you a Sonny Angel. At the retail price of $10 per doll, that’s a deal many have already taken, some collectors dozens of times over.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A more fascinating answer is that maybe Sonny Angels, like anything people love, give us a better understanding of what happiness is. What if you could find it in a tiny doll who wears a cute hat?&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are Sonny Angels?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite that, canonically, they are toddlers, Sonny Angels are 20 years old, created in 2004 by a manufacturer named Toru “Sonny” Soeya. Soeya was inspired by the cuteness of the <a href="https://www.tastingtable.com/1094436/why-kewpie-mayo-has-a-baby-on-its-logo/">Kewpie mayo baby</a> and his creations share many of their predecessor’s traits — in particular, their amiable roundness. They also have similar circular eyes, always looking up and to the side instead of straight on, like they’re either slightly embarrassed or flattered.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to Dreams, the Sonny Angel distribution company in the US, Soeya made these dolls to assuage the stresses of young working women in Japan. Around the time of Sonny Angels’ creation, Japan was going through <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB111076614439978347">a mild recession</a> and would get hit hard again <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/spn/2009/spn0905.pdf">four years later in 2008</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/IMG_5251-2.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,22.388453552521,100,55.223092894957" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="The highly coveted lop-eared rabbit Sonny Angel. | A. Abad-Santos/Vox" data-portal-copyright="A. Abad-Santos/Vox" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">“He referred to them as a ‘pocket boyfriend’ which I think may have gotten lost in translation a little bit,” Jackie Bonheim, the director of marketing at Dreams, the US Sonny Angel distributor, tells me. Bonheim explains that the Sonny Angel appeal is platonic, silly comfort — rather than a supportive romantic boyfriend, they’re more like an adorable baby you don’t have to care for. That cuteness is central to their appeal.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://c-research.chuo-u.ac.jp/html/100003324_en.html">Joshua Paul Dale</a> is a professor at Chuo University in Tokyo and the author of<em> Irresistible: How Cuteness Wired Our Brains and Conquered the World </em>in 2023, about how kawaii culture and aesthetic went mainstream. He explains that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3260535/#:~:text=Ethologist%20Konrad%20Lorenz%20proposed%20that,function%20of%20enhancing%20offspring%20survival.">time</a> and <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/research/how-cute-things-hijack-our-brains-and-drive-behaviour">time</a> again, research has shown that humans respond to creatures with baby-like features — round eyes, big foreheads, teeny tiny short limbs, globular cheeks. The term is called baby schema or kindchenschema, which both Kewpies and Sonnys embody.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When those features appear in human babies, or puppies, or even juvenile octopi, they trigger a primal, evolutionary response that makes us want to protect that cute thing, likely too young and weak to care for itself.&nbsp; Sonny Angels, with their positively absurd forehead to eyeball ratio and stout limbs, trigger that same instinct.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This protective instinct is made stress-free by design touches that signal Sonny Angels’ (slight) autonomy. They stand straight up on their own. They all have headgear, which they seem to have figured out how to put on themselves. A Sonny Angel can seemingly take care of himself, and more importantly, can make you feel better. Like a tiny friend would.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sonny Angels may bring you happiness&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bowen Yang doesn’t talk about Sonny Angels; he gushes. “You can’t help but smile when you look at one,” the actor, comedian, and <em>Saturday Night Live</em> writer and cast member tells me. On the slogan — “He may bring you happiness” — Yang says, “there’s no ‘may’ involved. It’s an assured thing that a Sonny Angel will make you feel happy.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yang, who co-wrote a sweet and slightly sinister, <em>Challengers</em>-themed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFTvWtHVA8E">sketch</a> wherein Dua Lipa turns her boyfriends into Sonnys with fellow writer/Sonny aficionado Celeste Yim, explains that he stumbled upon the dolls in 2018. It was Yang’s first month or so at <em>SNL</em>, and he says that he’d walk around Bryant Park to clear his head whenever he needed a break. One day he dipped into Kinokuniya, a small Japanese gift store, and found a Sonny Angel display toward the back of the shop.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I bought one on a cosmic whim and have been collecting them ever since,” he tells me, noting that his collection is now around 30, scattered around his apartment, writing office, and dressing room. “My first Sonny Angel ever was Apple.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What Yang refers to as Apple is a doll from the Sonny Angel Fruit Series who wears <a href="https://www.sonnyangel.com/renewal/wp-content/uploads/cache/2018/11/old_apple_01/2754354942.jpg">red apple-themed headgear</a> with a little leaf coming out of it. All Sonny Angels wear some kind of accessory on their heads; maybe a hat, maybe a helmet, maybe both. (One thing is for sure: They’re decorations, and not natural head growths, as the <a href="https://www.sonnyangel.com/en/about/">official website</a> makes clear.) These cranial ornamentations range from sea creatures like manta rays to alliums like onions and garlic to pets like French bulldogs and Shiba Inus.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These helmets differentiate each Sonny Angel, but raise a plethora of questions.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/IMG_5260.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,22.47485964363,100,55.050280712741" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A Sonny Angel with garlic on his head (left) next to a head of garlic. | A. Abad-Santos/Vox" data-portal-copyright="A. Abad-Santos/Vox" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Are Sonny Angels one guy trying on multiple pieces of thematic headgear based on his mood? Or are they different-but-identical-looking guys who have chosen specific helmets that reflect their personalities? What compels a little human to put an onion on his head? Is it a fashion statement or does he really like onions? More than that: Are Sonny Angels wearing these curious crowns because <em>they</em> like them or are they wearing them to make <em>us</em> feel better? And why don’t they have pants?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is the aspect of Sonny Angels’s allure that’s difficult to capture — the imagination that these little dolls spur in a person. Each Sonny’s uniqueness ignites storytelling, a narrative we create to reconcile our feelings with the weird cuteness at hand: where it came from, what spurred it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yang tells me about his favorite Sonny Angel: Snake, who has an albino serpent coiled on his head like a turban. “He knows he’s different, and he’s not afraid to be,” Yang tells me. “A diva. He’s not like the other girls. And that’s what we should all aspire to.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For some of their biggest fans, Sonny Angels represent a curiosity and an appreciation for the world around us, and are themselves a reminder that there’s wonder in self expression.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The craze over Sonny Angels, explained</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After their cuteness and ability to inspire, the most important thing to understand about Sonny Angels is that you never know which one you’re going to get.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sonny Angels are part of a bigger toy collector trend known as “blind boxes.” Each doll is individually sealed and packaged, and while buyers can choose a series — e.g., <a href="https://www.sonnyangel.com/en/products/">Fruits, Vegetables, Marine</a>, etc. — they can’t choose a specific Sonny to buy in-store. Barring X-ray glasses or some clever shaking (some buyers believe you tell which Sonnys are by what they weigh and how much they vibrate) there is no guaranteeing what Sonny you’ll get. It’s like opening a pack of trading cards.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dreams also shuffles rare Sonny Angels, known as “secrets,” into the fold as well as special figurines called Robbys. Robby Angel, according to Sonny <a href="https://okinawa.sonnyangel.com/en/aboutsa-2">lore</a>, is Sonny’s “close friend,” but it’s hard to tell whether Robbys are dogs or mice. I asked Dreams’s Bonheim, and she simply responded, “Robbys are animals,” providing no further clarification.&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to Bonheim and Dreams, there’s a 1 in 144 chance of pulling a secret or a Robby from a regular Sonny Angel series.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This makes buying Sonny Angels feel a bit like gambling. There’s an incentive to buy more than one box to raise your chances of getting the Sonny you want. At roughly $10 a pop, they’re priced low enough that just one more might not break the bank, even if the odds aren’t in your favor.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This randomness — and the addictive dopamine rush of opening a Sonny Angel — is tailor-made for <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/Sonny-angel?lang=en">TikTok</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sonnydijon?igsh=M2VlM2Z5bnFlZzFi&amp;utm_source=qr">Instagram</a>. The drama, suspense, reveal, joy, and even disappointment in any Sonny Angel unboxing increases the potential for virality. According to Bonheim, Sonny Angels’ popularity on these platforms has driven real-life sales.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bonheim did not specify the exact figures Dreams was making, but did say that sales “spiked” over the past three years with 2023 and 2024 being the strongest in the US. Store owners I spoke to were more specific, having witnessed the boom first hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why I wrote this</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">I will always remember the first Sonny Angel I ever saw: Shark from the <a href="https://sonnyangelusa.com/products/minifigure-marine-series-2019">Marine Series</a>. It was November 2023 and I was at a friend’s house, and on his coffee table, staring right back at me, was this little boy figurine with a sea animal hat on his head. His adorable, round little face was right in the great white’s jaws. I was mostly enamored, a bit mystified, and a little creeped out by that little baby. Later that week, I found myself wanting one of these little weirdos in my own home.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">That was much easier said than done. Everywhere I looked, they were sold out. Apparently you can find everything in New York City — except for Sonny Angels. When I finally procured a Sonny Angel, I decided he needed a friend (or two). Again, easier said than done.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">The Sonny Angel shortage, outsize demand, and my need to know exactly why I had to have this little guy in my life sent me on a hunt for Sonny Angels and spurred this piece.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">That, and my editor spotted my collection in the background of our Google Meet and kept asking me if it had grown. (It had.)</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Obviously it’s TikTok,” says Annie Chung, the co-owner of <a href="https://anmeshop.com/collections/sonny-angel">An.mé</a>, a New York toy store and authorized Sonny Angel retailer. “If you look back on the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/anmeshop/?hl=en">videos</a> we have on social media, you can see the growth.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Chung has been collecting Sonny Angels since 2004, and selling them since 2014. It wasn’t till post-pandemic lockdowns, around 2021, that she noticed the sales begin to build. At the same time, encouraged by shoppers,&nbsp; An.mé began hosting Sonny Angel meetups and trading events and posting on social media.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“By the third event, all the spots were booked within 30 minutes and over 50 people showed up,” Chung tells me. Chung’s meetups grew each time, eventually moving out of the tight stores, and one 2023 Washington Square Park meet-up brought in over 500 people. “The park ranger thought they were gonna do bad things. But they were all here for Sonny Angels,” Chung says.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, Chung says she sells between 500 to 1,000 Sonny Angels per week, depending on her inventory. When there’s a new release, the line can snake around the block, with fans lining up hours in advance. Chung’s biggest sellers are “<a href="https://sonnyangelusa.com/products/sonny-angel-hippers">Hippers</a>,” Sonny Angels that you can attach to your phone or any object edge (laptops, iPads, Tesla navigation consoles, etc.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kimberly Bach, co-owner of <a href="https://www.clubhousekidandcraft.com/">Clubhouse Kid &amp; Craft</a>, a toy store and art space in Decatur, Georgia, saw a similar rise in popularity at the end of 2021 and into 2022. Then in 2023 came the moment that she knew changed everything.&nbsp; “The series that started it all was the <a href="https://www.sonnyangelstore.com/en/products/catlife">Cat Life series</a>,” Bach tells me, laughing, of the series that featured the Sonny Angel dude in several cat costumes — Calico, Silver Tabby, Tuxedo, Siamese, et al. — doing “regular” cat things like drinking from a bottle of milk. “It was just like, all of a sudden, it was just a flood of people either coming into the store or buying them online.” Her stock of 140 Sonny Angels sold out in four days.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bach tells me that she sells roughly 12 Sonny Angels per day, an extremely successful figure given the size and location of her store.&nbsp;She has a set of regular customers near Auburn, Alabama, who drive almost three hours to her store weekly, along with many other customers without a local Sonny Angel retailer. “If they don’t have one where they live, they come to us,” she says.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Bach and Chung note, shopkeepers can’t keep Sonny Angels on their shelves. If they have them in stock, they’re selling them. But their inventories aren’t always stocked, and scarcity makes the demand even stronger.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I would say it’s an unintentional part of the appeal; it’s not something we’re doing on purpose,” Bonheim, the Dreams marketing director, tells me.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bonheim explains that a rigid production schedule and a desire to maintain the quality of their figurines means that Dreams makes and distributes a finite amount of Sonny Angels. The company also, intentionally, refrains from selling at big toy retailers, opting instead for smaller specialty toy stores and independent bookstores — a strategy they see as maintaining the spirit of the Sonny Angel as a collectible.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Add in to that the roughly two-year design process and resources needed to create a special series like the recently released 20th anniversary Looking Back Hippers series, and there’s no way for Dreams, at their current production rate, to keep up with Sonny Angels’s booming popularity.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The resell market and radical price gouging for Sonny Angels</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The shortage has created a secondary Sonny Angel market where fans can trade or sell Sonnys in their collection. On forums like Reddit or platforms like Discord, Sonny Angel fans have employed collector language (ISO = in search of, DISO = desperately in search of, bf luck = boyfriend luck or the belief that boyfriends will pull better Sonny Angels, UFT = up for trade, and UFS = up for sale) to navigate bartering of Sonnys. The exchange system has created a robust social community, with Sonny Angel fans sending figurines across the US and internationally alongside cute notes, candies, and stickers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s somewhat of a hierarchy here, experts tell me. Among regular Sonny Angels, the Rabbit Sonny Angels, both regular- and lop-eared, and the Strawberry are the most popular. Bok Choy, Frog, Cow, and Garlic are considered honorary all-star Sonny Angels. Secret figures and Robbys are sought after, and collectors will go after the limited series Sonny Angels because they’re usually one and done. After Dreams sells through a special series, it’s not likely you’ll see them on shelves again for a few years, if at all.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/IMG_5526.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,8.5085742767578,100,82.982851446484" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Some “secret” Sonny Angels along with their Robbys. | A. Abad-Santos/Vox" data-portal-copyright="A. Abad-Santos/Vox" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Obviously though, this voracity for Sonnys doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Resellers have noticed, which is why you’ll see Sonnys marked for outrageous values on sites like Amazon and eBay. For example, the “secret” figure in the 2023 Cat Life series that wears a pink cat costume and holds a gold-tinted fish goes for <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/225693611532?chn=ps&amp;var=524814323197&amp;norover=1&amp;mkevt=1&amp;mkrid=711-166974-028196-7&amp;mkcid=2&amp;mkscid=101&amp;itemid=524814323197_225693611532&amp;targetid=2275367127251&amp;device=c&amp;mktype=pla&amp;googleloc=9060351&amp;poi=&amp;campaignid=21093328230&amp;mkgroupid=163238665671&amp;rlsatarget=pla-2275367127251&amp;abcId=9393327&amp;merchantid=782358246&amp;geoid=9060351&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw1emzBhB8EiwAHwZZxRutnOXBCe8LXa3gYy9svr7AvO5uQqv3BjUzYrSlURFRCPOoeAXikRoCRjYQAvD_BwE">$250 on eBay.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Resellers have become such a pain that Chung and Bach, the store owners, put limits on the number of Sonnys that are available to purchase online. Chung checks each order by hand, making sure no one’s cheating the system. If she didn’t, she says, resellers would vaporize her stock and sell them for triple the price on Amazon.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It doesn&#8217;t make us happy to see people paying that much,” Bonheim tells me, noting that Dreams is aware of resale sellers and also limits the number of Sonnys a buyer can purchase and monitors orders for funny business. They don’t want “someone opening a Sonny Angel and asking how much money they can make.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After all, she points out, a Sonny Angel’s job is to make you happy — if you’re lucky enough to get your hands on one. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jenn Tran, a physician assistant student from Miami, Florida, will debut as <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24109178/asian-bachelorette-rachel-nance-jenn-tran-joey-graziadei#:~:text=Jenn%20Tran%2C%20a%20physician%20assistant,been%20named%20the%20new%20Bachelorette.&amp;text=Li%20Zhou%20is%20a%20politics,editorial%20fellow%20at%20the%20Atlantic.">the first Asian American Bachelorette</a> in the show’s 21st season premiere this week. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s a notable milestone, and it’s also one that sends a significant message about power — and who’s allowed to have it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Historically, Asian women have been portrayed in US pop culture <a href="https://www.vox.com/22338807/asian-fetish-racism-atlanta-shooting">as hypersexualized and objects of desire</a>, rather than fully realized human beings with their own wants, interests, and demands. While one <em>Bachelorette</em> casting is far from sufficient to resolve these deep-seated tropes — and just how much the show rejects them will depend on how it’s edited — choosing Tran as the lead is a small step that pushes back against past stereotypes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s an opportunity to have Jenn Tran be a voice, in terms of being able to have agency in her own desires about love and intimacy,” says Stephanie Young, a communication studies professor at the University of Southern Indiana, who examines the intersection of race and pop culture. “We get to hear <em>her</em> speak, and these men are going to be competing for <em>her</em> affection and attention.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Namely, by centering Tran as the star and key decision-maker, she’s framed as an empowered participant on the show who is driving relationships forward. As a lead, Tran will choose the men that she prefers each episode and dole out roses, which allow contestants to move on in the competition. And while there’s always producer intervention to contend with, Tran will be involved in calling the shots, a position that flips the script on how Asian women have broadly been depicted in relationships.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Past tropes have disempowered Asian women — with devastating consequences</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Disempowering tropes of Asian women go as far back as the 1800s, when the Page Act of 1875 barred the entry of immigrants coming to the US for “immoral purposes” including prostitution. Though the text of the law doesn’t specifically call out Chinese women, politicians — <a href="https://www.socialstudies.org/system/files/2022-04/SE-86022273.pdf">including the bill’s architect</a>, California Rep. Horace Page — did. In remarks at that time, Page explicitly said the bill was meant to “end the danger of cheap Chinese labor and immoral Chinese women,” echoing a racist viewpoint <a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/ulysses-s-grant-chinese-immigration-and-the-page-act-of-1875.htm">popular among lawmakers of that era</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In approving this law, the US government effectively solidified the idea that Asian women were a threat to the country because of their sexuality.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since then, countless films and television shows have reaffirmed this idea. Works created throughout the 19th and 20th centuries like <em>Madame Butterfly</em>, <em>Memoirs of a Geisha</em>,<em> </em>and <em>Miss Saigon </em>all featured Asian female characters who were diminutive, self-sacrificing, and objectified.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Collectively, they helped calcify the most prevalent tropes now assigned to Asian women, including the “lotus blossom,” which portrays them as submissive and eager to please, and the “dragon lady,” which portrays them as cunning figures who weaponize their sexuality. “In both cases [Asian women are] the sex object,” filmmaker Renee Tajima-Peña previously <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2021/03/26/asian-women-hollywood-portrayals/">told the Washington Post</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These stereotypes were further entrenched following the US military’s occupation of parts of Asia including Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Japan. In many of these places, sex work was one of the only means that some women had to make a living. US soldiers’ interactions with sex workers — and the Hollywood depictions they spawned — fueled the perceptions of Asian women as vehicles for white male sexual gratification.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Me so horny. Me love you long time,” a Vietnamese sex worker infamously says to a group of US soldiers in Stanley Kubrick’s 1987 film <em>Full Metal Jacket</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think these images tend to proliferate, especially in the aftermath of World War II and the Cold War,” says <a href="https://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile.cfm?faculty_id=6123">Judy Tzu-Chun Wu</a>, a UC Irvine professor of Asian American Studies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In these depictions, Asian women are frequently robbed of their agency in the romantic relationships they’re in. They’re dependent on the choices of the men they encounter, and they’re shown as catering to them rather than centering their own needs. In <em>Miss Saigon</em>, for example, the Vietnamese lead waits for years for a white American soldier to return for her, and ultimately kills herself so her son is able to go to the United States.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such objectification of Asian women has had real — and devastating — consequences.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Specifically, it has contributed directly to violence against Asian women, a problem that was thrown into stark relief during the pandemic when six Asian women <a href="https://www.vox.com/22335666/asian-spa-shooting-atlanta">were killed</a> by a shooter in Atlanta, Georgia. At the time the shooter said he felt compelled to kill the victims because he wanted to eliminate the sexual temptation they represented. Recent instances of <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/second-us-soldier-japan-charged-sexual-assault-okinawa/#">rape</a> by US servicemen stationed in Okinawa, Japan, have put this problem in the spotlight as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Asian women are “objectified in ways that dehumanize,” says Young. “If there’s any type of violence, it’s justified because they’re not seen as human.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s also evident in data from the <a href="https://nnedv.org/latest_update/stereotypes-asian-women/">National Network to End Domestic Violence</a> (NNEDV). According to the NNEDV, “41 to 61 percent of Asian women report experiencing physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner during their lifetime,” a rate that “is significantly higher than any other ethnic group.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We’re seen as vulnerable,” Helen Zia, an Asian American <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/us/racism-sexism-atlanta-spa-shooting.html">activist previously told the New York Times</a>. “You know — the object that won’t fight back.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>How much can this season of <em>The Bachelorette</em> help?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Casting an Asian person as a reality show lead is not a panacea for these issues, and any alterations <em>The Bachelorette </em>can make to existing, racist narratives will hinge heavily on how producers treat this season, and how they portray Tran.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the past, after all, <em>The Bachelor</em> franchise has faced heavy criticism for failing its leads of color and engaging in problematic storylines that harp on racial stereotypes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For instance, Rachel Lindsay, the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/bachelorette-rachel-lindsay-criticizes-editing-her-finale-1132842/">first Black Bachelorette</a>, has called the show out for how it edited her season and has said she felt like she was presented as an “angry Black female.” Previously, the franchise was also <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/bachelor-matt-james-uncomfortable-with-episode-featuring-his-father-says-rachel-lindsay-4145878/">criticized by audience members</a> for an absentee father storyline it emphasized during Matt James’s season, when he was the first Black Bachelor.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This season, some concerns have already emerged. Tran’s rollout was seen as <a href="https://www.tvguide.com/news/jenn-tran-first-asian-american-bachelorette-announcement-historic-finale-editing-failed/">anticlimactic by some fans</a>, who felt the announcement of her as lead was overshadowed by the focus on other contestants. Every season, the franchise typically announces its next lead during the finale. In that episode, <em>The Bachelor </em>seemed to invest far more screen time with other contenders, like Daisy Kent, one of last season’s finalists. Fans critical of the choice felt it made Tran’s <a href="https://www.tvguide.com/news/jenn-tran-first-asian-american-bachelorette-announcement-historic-finale-editing-failed/">debut feel like an afterthought</a>, and that it had them questioning whether the show was setting another lead of color up for failure.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Viewer speculation that Tran was a third-choice pick for the show — <a href="https://m.imdb.com/news/ni64667157/?ref_=nm_nwr_1">which she’s pushed back on</a> — has only added to these concerns. As has the noticeable <a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/jenn-tran-made-some-points-about-the-lack-of-asian-men-on-the-bachelorette">dearth of Asian American men</a> cast this season, something many viewers considered a missed opportunity.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The franchise’s historical failure to explicitly call out racism among its fan base, and its contenders, has been scrutinized, too. Last season, Rachel Nance, an ICU nurse of Black and Filipino descent, <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/bachelors-rachel-nance-details-racism-from-the-shows-viewers/">described the vehement racism</a> she faced from some fans after she was chosen to advance in the competition over another popular white contestant. While Nance brought up fans’ comments during the airing of the “Women Tell All” episode that season, host Jesse Palmer quickly pivoted to ask more broadly about “hate” different women experienced rather than dealing with her specific challenges.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tran’s casting is one effort that could help change the narratives around Asian women by featuring her as the main character on the show and not someone who is there to simply acquiesce to another person’s desires.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Bachelorette, Tran will make decisions that reflect her own interests and preferences. She’ll determine who gets time with her, who gets sent home, and who could ultimately be a serious partner outside the show. Since she’s the star, the show is set to be oriented around her story — and not anyone else’s.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although it’s still uncertain how the franchise will navigate her time in the role, Tran’s casting as <em>The Bachelorette</em>, in and of itself, marks some progress.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In his <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/abc-news-anchor-george-stephanopoulos-exclusive-interview-biden/story?id=111695695">first interview</a> since last week’s disastrous debate, President Joe Biden appeared too frail to defeat former President Donald Trump and too delusional to end his campaign.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Far from easing anxieties about his candidacy, the president’s sit-down with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News should further alarm Democratic leaders. Biden’s remarks indicated that his party may be heading toward a worst-case scenario, one in which the president is largely incompetent as a campaigner but not so consistently and flagrantly inept that his incapacity to win reelection becomes undeniable, even to himself.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Had Biden seemed every bit as ill and confused as he did at last week’s debate, it would be easier to persuade him to drop out — or at least for Democrats to unify behind a concerted push for his exit. If the president had somehow appeared to grow a decade younger over the past eight days, then he could conceivably have rescued his campaign. Instead, he did better, but still awful. Which means that salvaging the Democratic Party’s chances will require a wise and courageous show of defiance from its congressional leadership. It is not clear that one is in the offing. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Sunday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries assembled his caucus for a phone call to discuss Biden’s candidacy. According to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/four-democrats-congress-call-biden-step-2024-race-rcna160625">NBC News</a>, there was “an overwhelming sense among lawmakers that Vice President Kamala Harris would be a better nominee than Biden.” And yet, only four Democratic representatives publicly called on Biden to step aside in the meeting’s wake — Adam Smith, Jerry Nadler, Mark Takano, and Joe Morelle. All four hold top positions on major Democratic committees. Altogether, nearly a dozen House Democrats had called for Biden’s exit as of Sunday evening. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But other congressional Democrats have rallied to Biden’s defense. Sen. Mark Warner <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/05/mark-warner-joe-biden-exit-race-democratic-senators/">has sought</a> to build consensus among his colleagues for Biden’s replacement as their party’s nominee. But various <a href="https://x.com/josephzeballos/status/1810047383000240604">Democratic senators</a> — among them Maggie Hassan, Tim Kaine, Alex Padilla, John Fetterman, and Bob Casey — all reiterated their support for the president in recent days.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The president’s aim in Friday’s interview was clear: to establish that all the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357788/biden-trump-debate-winners-losers">disquieting features</a> of his debate performance — the incoherence, shaky voice, and vacant facial expressions — were all one-off aberrations brought on by a cold and poor preparation rather than symptoms of cognitive decline. There probably wasn’t any plausible way of making this case. (By the time the interview aired, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/05/biden-aging-recent-months/#">Washington Post</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/02/us/politics/biden-lapses.html">New York Times</a>, and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/democrats-say-bidens-debate-performance-wasnt-anomaly-rcna160151">NBC News</a> had all published stories indicating that Biden had repeatedly suffered similar mental lapses behind closed doors in recent months.) Biden’s attempt to sell the idea that his debate performance was a total anomaly verged on self-parody.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Stephanopoulos asked Biden whether he had gone back and watched the debate after it happened. The president replied with an odd uncertainty, saying, “I don’t think I did, no.” The ABC anchor asked whether he knew how badly the debate was going in the moment.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden then attempted to articulate one of the White House’s primary talking points about the debate: that he had prepared for it as though it were a meeting with a foreign leader, digging deep into complex policy details, which only served to distract him from communicating his big-picture case to the American people. But the president lost his grip on this thought before he could complete it, and then slid clumsily into two totally different talking points (that his polling isn’t that bad, that Trump distracted him with a parade of lies), both of which he failed to express coherently.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">The whole way I prepared, nobody’s fault, mine. Nobody’s fault but mine. I, uh — I prepared what I usually would do sitting down as I did come back with foreign leaders or National Security Council for explicit detail. And I realized — about partway through that, you know, all — I get quoted, the New York Times had me down, at 10 points before the debate, nine now, or whatever the hell it is. The fact of the matter is, what I looked at is that he also lied 28 times. I couldn’t — I mean, the way the debate ran, not — my fault, no one else’s fault, no one else’s fault.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden grew more coherent as the interview continued, but he also became more detached from reality. The president denied the validity of all unfavorable poll results, including surveys showing that Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/03/us/politics/poll-debate-biden-trump.html">expanded his national lead</a> since the debate while Biden’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/">approval rating slid to an all-time low</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most concerningly for Democrats, Biden suggested that no information could possibly dent his belief that he is his party’s best hope for defeating Trump. At this point, that idea lacks all credibility. Biden has long trailed his Republican rival nationally and in every major swing state. In recent surveys, more than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/03/us/politics/poll-debate-biden-trump.html">70 percent</a> of the public considers him too old to serve. Myriad Democrats have now gone on record saying that he should not be running for president and/or that their interactions with him made them fear for his cognitive well-being.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No interview or stump speech can erase these revelations. The news media will not stop scrutinizing the copious evidence of Biden’s senescence. The Trump campaign will not forget that it now possesses a treasure trove of humiliating clips of Biden’s brain freezes and devastating quotes from the president’s allies. Given this climate and the candidate’s limitations, it is not plausible that Biden can surge in the polls between now and November.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet the president appeared prepared to write all of this off.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I remember them telling me the same thing in 2020,” Biden said. “‘I can’t win, the polls show I can’t win.’ Remember the ‘red wave’? Before the vote, I said, ‘That’s not going to happen. We’re going to win.’ We did better in an off year than almost any incumbent president has ever done.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here, Biden was referring to predictions that the Republican Party would win a landslide in the 2022 midterm elections. And it is true that Democrats greatly outperformed expectations, dominating many of that year’s most hotly contested races. But the polls in 2022 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/12/us/elections/2022-poll-accuracy.html#:~:text=Similarly%2C%20in%202022%2C%20weighting%20by,bias%20toward%20Democrats%20or%20Republicans.">were also quite accurate by historical standards</a>, and Republicans did win both the national popular vote and control of the House of Representatives. Nevertheless, Biden argued to ABC News that polling is not as accurate as it used to be.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unwilling to reconsider his candidacy, Biden also proved averse to proving his mental fitness empirically, refusing to commit to taking cognitive and neurological tests and then sharing the results with the public.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, the president ended the interview with a Trumpian bout of self-flattery, one that also served as an implicit rebuke of his vice president’s readiness to manage foreign affairs. “Who’s gonna be able to hold NATO together like me?” he asked rhetorically. “Who’s gonna be able to be in a position where I’m able to keep the Pacific Basin in a position where we’re — we’re at least checkmating China now? Who’s gonna — who’s gonna do that? Who has that reach?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Biden who spoke with ABC News Friday night was enfeebled, ineloquent, egotistical, and intransigent. He was a man who appeared both ready and willing to lead his party into the wilderness. Asked how he would feel if he stayed in the race and Trump were elected, Biden replied, “I’ll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did the good as job as I know I can do, that’s what this is about.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is not the president’s best self.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What this moment asks of Biden is no small thing: to forfeit immense personal power so as to give his party its best possible shot of keeping an authoritarian reactionary out of office. Many statesmen would not be capable of summoning the humility and selflessness necessary for doing so. I still hold out hope that the president’s commitments to liberal democracy and the Democratic Party are in earnest and that he can find his way to such heroic self-knowledge and sacrifice.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After Friday night, however, it is clear that he needs his trusted friends in the Democratic leadership to show him the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Update, July 7, 8;45 pm: </strong>This story, originally published July 5, has been updated to include news about more Democratic lawmakers calling on Biden to withdraw from the presidential race</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you were to write the history of modern American conservatism, where would you start? Maybe somewhere in the 1930s just before WW2? Or maybe you begin with the Cold War and anti-communism?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cases can be made for both of those entry points, but the early 1990s offer another fascinating moment in this history. While this wasn’t the beginning of any grand conservative movement, the period is, in retrospect, a revealing flashpoint. And if you’re looking for a precursor to the weird, scrambled politics of the present, it’s an excellent candidate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">John Ganz is the writer of the newsletter <em><a href="https://www.unpopularfront.news/">Unpopular Front</a> </em>and the author of a new book called <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374605445/whentheclockbroke"><em>When the Clock Broke: Con Men, Conspiracists, and How America Cracked Up in the Early 1990s</em></a>. There’s no Rosetta stone for understanding Trump, and it’s not quite right to call this book a pre-history of Trumpism, but it does something better than any other work I’ve encountered, which is to give some kind of shape to the sense of despair that defines our current politics.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ganz focuses on the year 1992 — when the first presidential election of the decade was held — and gives a snapshot of the culture and the politics at that moment. Bill Clinton, Rodney King, Ross Perot, Rush Limbaugh, Pat Buchanan, John Gotti — they’re all there. And it all looks and sounds a lot like today.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So I invited Ganz on <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> to talk about what cracked up in the ’90s and how it laid the groundwork for what followed. This excerpt focuses more on where we’re at today, but, as always, there’s <em>much</em> more in the full podcast, so listen and follow <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/id1081584611">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6NOJ6IkTb2GWMj1RpmtnxP">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://www.pandora.com/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/PC:30793?source=stitcher-sunset">Pandora</a>, or wherever you find podcasts.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Sean Illing</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So much of this conversation about the 1990s is really about the slow but steady transition of the GOP from the party of Reagan to the party of Trump. There’s a not terribly well-known writer you discuss in the book — Sam Francis — who you argue did as much as anyone to accelerate this transition. Who was he and what did he see in the electorate that other conservatives at the time didn’t?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>John Ganz</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sam Francis was a Republican staffer. He comes out of the South. He works for the Heritage Foundation, a think tank created to create a policy infrastructure for the conservative movement. He works as a Senate staffer.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To say he’s part of the conservative movement is right nominally, but he doesn’t consider himself a conservative. He considers himself a man of the radical right. He believes, essentially, that there’s nothing left to conserve, that the institutions are too corrupted, they’re too overtaken by liberalism, and that they must be overthrown. A new order must be established that is a reactionary social agenda, but does not preserve much of the old ways of doing things, which he thinks are hopelessly liberal.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Sean Illing</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One thing he recognized — and this holds today — is how much a lot of regular people around the country really, truly despised cultural and political elites and that there was immense political energy to be channeled with the right figure or movement.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>John Ganz</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Absolutely. I think what differentiates what I’m talking about from the conservatism that came before is that along with that rejection of elites is also the rejection of the ideologies associated with those elites — that there were impersonal institutions that would provide a fair break or opportunities for people.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the left, we’re basically talking about the features of social democracy: the welfare state, what was left of it after Reagan, trying to create more egalitarian parts of economic life, access to education, access to health care, those things. On the right, it’s a belief in the market and the belief that if we let the market do what it needs to do, everyone will have a crack. People will find their niche, and unchained market forces will have almost utopian outcomes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, none of that happens. Society remains highly competitive, people’s lives are very precarious. They fall through the cracks. They fear social decline, they experience social decline. So these stories, these ideologies about the rules of society that will permit people to have prosperous lives if you just obey them and follow these norms, don’t appear convincing to people. And then [the new populist right figures like Francis] come along and say, “Well, I’m not going to sell you any of that bullshit. We, the nation, the family, the race, whatever, some bounded or smaller group, need to face the fact that society’s unfair, and we’re going to take an unfair advantage and we’re going to band together to get ours, and we’re going to make sure that you, if you’re with us, get the spoils.”</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Sean Illing</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You wrote something <a href="https://www.unpopularfront.news/p/the-shadow-of-the-mob">in your newsletter</a> the other day that feels relevant. It’s a long passage but I’ll read it anyway: </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">Even if society is not experienced as a daily war of all against all, it can still be lonely and alienating, where atomized subjects seek out small advantages and find little in the way of warmth or solidarity. With the failure of impersonal social agencies, people want to return to personal rule. Trumpism offers the appearance of a solution. Rackets don’t just take care of the material well-being of the insiders, they are always also sources of recognition and belonging. You’re part of the clan, the crew, the family. The fuck you of Trumpism, its shock to the system might appear to be purely anti-social, a rejection of the reciprocal norms that make cooperative social life possible, but it’s actually pre-social. It speaks to the longing to return to something earlier.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>John Ganz</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yeah. I think that what the right-wing populist or mafia populism acknowledges about society is that there are intrinsic tensions, and we’re just going to fight and win, not try to negotiate. Trump comes from a business background where you’re not winning unless you’re screwing somebody, right? And that seems to almost run counter to one’s own self-interest. Why not just make a deal where everybody’s happy? But the perception is that if we don’t assert strength, then they’ll take advantage of us next time. So I think that that’s the mentality of the movement.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Basically, racism is one way of thinking about a competitive capitalist society and offering a kind of pseudo-solution to it. It says, “Yeah, sure, there’s an intrinsic social struggle we have to fight and win” but it creates a kind of spurious false form of solidarity, which is you should work in the favor of you and your other white people and seek solidarity with them. Don’t seek solidarity, say, as workers. So there are two sides of the coin here. It has the frank acceptance of a very nasty form of social competition and even war, and also it offers a form of solidarity.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Sean Illing</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is rather amazing that we just kind of memory-holed the fact that Trump lunged into national politics with birtherism. That was his thing. That was his opening gambit, and you could argue it was the most deliberate move he’s made as a politician. Again, this is partly what makes the incessant revisionism of “Never Trump” conservatives so silly. It’s like, “Hey, fellas, I get that you want conservatism to have a serious intellectual foundation, but this guy staked his whole political identity on a conspiracy about our first Black president being born in Kenya.” This isn’t a footnote.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>John Ganz</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No, I totally agree, and I think that that really says it all. I’ve always said that there’s one single myth underlying the ideal of Trumpism, which is that certain Americans aren’t really Americans. It was first articulated in birtherism. He knew more than other Republican elites that that’s what the message of the Tea Party really was. Other conservative and Republican elites said, “Oh, it’s about taxes, it’s about entitlement reform,” all this BS. He said, “No, no, no. Obama is not the president. He’s not a citizen. Some people aren’t citizens. People who don’t look like us, act, think like us, etc<em>.</em>”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And then that takes on a different manifestation in the stolen election myth. What does that say? Well, roughly the same thing. Certain people aren’t really Americans. Their votes don’t count. You, the real citizenry, are being disenfranchised and dispossessed. The actual facts of the matter don’t matter that much. What is being peddled here is a myth. It’s a way of conceiving of a certain social vision, not a statement about facts. It’s something more primal. Trump is that myth incarnate.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Sean Illing</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’ve never identified as a Marxist, but the basic materialist conception of history always seemed true enough to me. And there’s a case in the book that the disorder we’re dealing with now is downstream of all these material and social shifts that exploded in the ’80s under Reagan. There’s always this debate about how the material world interacts with the world of ideas, and I’d be a famous philosopher if I had an answer to that, but I do wonder what the country would look like if we waved a magic wand and radically improved everyone’s material conditions so that there really wasn’t a material basis for economic or racial grievances and there was some modicum of community and solidarity, how much would it really matter? Would politics be all that different today or would we just keep spinning the same tracks, the same basic arguments, in an increasingly mediated environment where our technologies shape our perceptions of the world? I have to believe it would be different, but I’m not so sure it would be nearly as different as we think.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>John Ganz</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think the material basis of society and the way we have these mediated relationships with each other are not separate. We are entering a world where what it means to be a person is quite different from what it meant in the 20th century, and our forms of society and association are changing in radical ways that are frankly traumatic for people.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think that we don’t really realize it, but we’re in touch with each other’s thoughts in ways that were inconceivable. We are approaching communal life in ways that were unimaginable. We’re constantly in touch. You can in a moment hear what other people are thinking and get a sense of what the whole crowd and the whole world is thinking through social media. The effects that that’s having on the human psyche and the human self, we have an inkling of what that’s doing to change us and what a radical change that is, but I don’t think we’ve quite come to terms with it. And it’s frightening, and it’s creating disruptions on both the personal and the national and the international level. I think that the way we are turned into beings that produce and consume, that’s always going to create tensions in society.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Sean Illing</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So where do you think American politics is heading? And to be clear, I’m not asking the banal “Are you optimistic or pessimistic?” question. I’m thinking more about where these currents are taking us. The right is obviously what it is right now, and I think the left is adrift in its own way, but what’s your sense of where we’re going in the short- to medium-term?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>John Ganz</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’m very concerned that across the world, this kind of nationalism is ascendant in a way that’s very difficult to stop. We’ve seen the surge of right-wing nationalism in Europe, and where that’s heading could be very frightening. We’ve seen Trump not losing popularity after his manifest criminality and his attempt to overthrow the government. What I’m concerned about is that this increasing fragmentation of the world into these antagonistic groups is setting the groundwork for a global war.&nbsp;We already see the hints of that in Ukraine and Israel and Palestine, where these nationalist wars are taking place. What I am very concerned about now is that that tendency will intensify and increase. I’m not saying we’re heading toward a third world war necessarily, but I would say my big worry is the direction of the world.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Sean Illing</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think both of us believe the American right recognized something deep and true about the country after the Cold War. They had this Schmittian sense of the need for a new political enemy and the left, perhaps because this is just the nature of the left, didn’t or couldn’t do that, which was fine at the time. But from our perch in 2024, do you think the left missed an opportunity to redefine themselves and the country during this time, or is this something the left just isn’t equipped to do?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>John Ganz</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I don’t know. They were so defeated by Reagan, and also, the end of the Cold War seemed to really discredit socialism. I think it was just such a time when the left was not able to articulate a vision of the future, and I think it’s still struggling to do that. I think it’s pretty weak, and I think that’s why we have ascendant nationalism. The left is supposed to be the side giving the story of collectivism and solidarity, and nationalism provides a story about that that’s a lot more appealing to a lot of people than anything the left has had to offer, and that’s unfortunate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I don’t know how to solve that problem. The left has to take nationalism as seriously as it once did. Liberals are concerned about the rise of nationalism. I think it’s the most destructive ideology that man has ever come up with, and when it turns into racial versions, it’s unspeakable in what it can do.<br><br>&nbsp;<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/1992-the-year-politics-broke/id1081584611?i=1000660773219"><em>Listen to the rest of the conversation</em></a><em> and be sure to follow </em><a href="https://www.vox.com/thegrayarea">The Gray Area</a><em> on </em><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/id1081584611"><em>Apple Podcasts</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6NOJ6IkTb2GWMj1RpmtnxP"><em>Spotify</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.pandora.com/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/PC:30793"><em>Pandora</em></a><em>, or wherever you listen to podcasts.</em></p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">A starry night evokes magic, a sense of wonder or romance. But what about a starry sea? There are almost 2,000 species of sea stars or “starfish” worldwide, found across a range of habitats from tide pools to thousands of meters underwater. About a decade ago, the still-mysterious sea star wasting disease (SSW) had devastating impacts on sea star populations along the West Coast of North America. One of the hardest hit was the sunflower star, known as the cheetah of the intertidal zone for its speed and hunting prowess.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ten years ago, the sunflower sea star population collapsed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This loss has been detrimental to kelp forests because sunflower stars are voracious sea urchin predators. When more than <a href="https://www.reef.org/sites/default/files/pycnopodia_helianthoides_published_supplement.pdf">90 percent of the Pycno population disappeared</a> following a wasting disease outbreak that began in 2013, the sea urchin population exploded. Now, these prickly grazers are mowing down the kelp en masse and creating extensive <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/1980/">urchin barrens</a> where there were once dense, flourishing kelp forests.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/adler-1111.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" /><img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/adler-3045.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">“The magnitude of [sea star wasting] — the geographic scale from Mexico all the way up into Alaska, and with over 20 species affected — there has never been anything (that we have any data on) that’s happened like that with sea stars before,” says Drew Harvell, a marine ecologist at Cornell University and Friday Harbor Labs who has been studying the outbreak from day one. Harvell published <a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520382985/ocean-outbreak"><em>Ocean Outbreak</em></a> in 2019, a book that details several ocean pandemics including the one that decimated sea stars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This isn’t the first documented wasting event in sea stars — there have been large die-offs in the past, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.216.4549.989">including one in the 1970s</a> that impacted Heliaster kubiniji, but these events typically affected a single species over a smaller geographic extent.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“People who didn’t live through that 2013 to 2015 onslaught of the magnitude of that mortality really don’t fully comprehend it. &#8230; It was horrible,” says Harvell. “Having 10 different species of stars washed up on your beach suddenly was really dramatic.” It’s important “to preserve the enormity of that event,” she says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2019, marine biologist Jason Hodin at the University of Washington’s Friday Harbor Labs was the first to try raising and studying sunflower stars (Pycnopodia helianthoides) in captivity. The Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium in Omaha followed suit, and now several other aquariums throughout California are raising the stars.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Jason’s success with the captive breeding of the Pycnos really provided the fire that lit the whole Pycnopodia recovery program, because it showed a positive way forward and a real opportunity,” says Harvell.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Scientists and aquarists banded behind the sunflower star during the wasting event and put together the <a href="https://www.nature.org/content/dam/tnc/nature/en/documents/tnc_Roadmap_to_Recovery_for_the_Sunflower_Sea_Star_Nov2022.pdf">Roadmap to Recovery for the Sunflower Sea Star</a>. Through an effort led by ecologist Sarah Gravem, the sunflower star was the first marine invertebrate listed as <a href="https://www.reef.org/sites/default/files/pycnopodia_helianthoides_published_supplement.pdf">critically endangered on the IUCN Red List</a> in August 2020.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But now, thanks to endeavors in the star’s historic home along the West Coast and beyond, the sea star may one day return to the ocean. It’s the beginning of a long restoration effort, but “there’s clearly an understanding or a passion [for Pycnos],” says Ashley Kidd, conservation aquaculture program manager at the Sunflower Star Laboratory.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Association of Zoos and Aquariums now has a <a href="https://www.aza.org/connect-stories/stories/aza-members-and-sunflower-star-lab-partner-to-help-sunflower-sea-stars">SAFE (Saving Animals From Extinction) sunflower star program</a> aimed at saving these endemic —&nbsp;meaning they are found nowhere else in the world — stars.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>To save a star&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/adler-2336.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,32.539267015707,100,34.921465968586" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A sunflower sea star specimen in the Harvard collection. The star was collected in Monterey, California, in July 1936." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">After two years and hundreds of dives in California, the first adult sunflower star I ever laid eyes on was in a Boston basement. Four levels below ground in Harvard’s Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ), invertebrate collection manager Adam Baldinger opened white metal collection drawers to reveal almost two dozen dried Pycnos, ranging from button-sized to extra-large-pizza-sized stars, their dried arms curled at the tips.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are more Pycnos in this Boston basement than there are living in aquariums in the state of California, where only five individuals remain.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gazing upon a sunflower sea star is a strange experience. The genus name “Pycnopodia” literally translates to “dense feet” and the species name “helianthoides” means “sunflower-like.” They can have dozens of arms (and an uncanny ability to regenerate these arms) and grow to reach up to 3 feet wide. They seem like something out of a science fiction novel. Jen Burney, an aquarist at Aquarium of the Pacific, describes visitors as having a “fearful fascination” with the stars — they often don’t know what exactly they’re looking at.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“You really do need to think outside the box with starfish,” says Chris Mah, a research associate at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History. “You kind of have to think about them as aliens. &#8230; They’re pentameral things that have been around since the Paleozoic. &#8230; They move in a different time frame, they have a different metabolism, they eat differently,” says Mah. He studies all echinoderms but says Pycnos were one of the reasons he got into the subject in the first place. “People who study echinoderms do so because we revel in their weirdness.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Baldinger gently unwraps the stars from plastic bags and arranges them on the table for me to photograph. Each star has a paper tag with neat cursive writing noting the specimen number, collector, and where and when it was collected. Some from Puget Sound date back to 1907.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One star stands out, both because it floats in a jar of ethanol and because the label notes it was collected in Monterey, California, a few miles from where I live, where sunflower sea stars are now functionally extinct.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The quest to bring sunflower sea stars back to California’s coast</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Heal the Bay Aquarium is small and tucked under the Santa Monica pier. Most people are here to ride the Pacific Park Ferris wheel, sip a milkshake, or buy a shell necklace from the famous pier that attracts 10 million visitors a year. But hidden below the pier is an aquarium filled with local species from the bay, including a small sunflower star that has been in their touch tank for almost 10 years.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Laura Rink, associate director of operations for <a href="https://healthebay.org/aquarium/">Heal the Bay Aquarium</a>, greets me with a friendly smile and ushers me inside, past undersea murals and aquaria housing moon jellies, sharks, and moray eels. It feels like stepping back into the ’90s in the most heartwarming way. In the back corner, near a tank of tiny California skates that look like grinning raviolis, is a pile of orange, purple, pink, and brown sea stars in a long aquarium with an open top. Above it is a colorful banner that reads “Touch Tanks.” Squished in the corner is a petite Pycno.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/adler-8049.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Before I can fully take in my first live sunflower star, the air is filled with excited shrieks as a group of local elementary school kids flow through the doors like a school of sardines. They are decked out in matching blue Superman T-shirts. Heal the Bay hosts about 15,000 Title I students every year, and for many of them, the beach and ocean are not familiar places. Some of the kids shy away from the stars, weirded out by their tube feet, funny texture, or the fact that they’re supposed to feed the stars chunks of dead fish with tweezers. Other kids dive right in, running between touch tanks with the excitement of seagulls surrounding a fresh catch of fish.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/adler-8356.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">When the craziness subsides and I gently touch the petite Pycno, it feels like goo. It’s less calcified than many stars — instead of feeling leathery and tough like an ochre or bat star, it’s squishy. With its papulae, translucent white “skin gills,” out, it takes on an almost fluffy appearance, too. The Pycno in the tank glides up the glass. I place my finger next to one of its 19 arms and a few little tube feet reach out to investigate. I imagine these same stars scattered across the bottom of California’s kelp forest before wasting hit and they literally <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJpR3TnTZ_w">melted before our eyes</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As part of efforts to bring back the species from functional extinction in California, scientists and aquarists <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/21/science/sunflower-sea-star-spawns.html">successfully spawned</a> three Pycnos at Birch Aquarium in February this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“When the females started spawning, that was two years of work for all of us and we were all together,” says Jen Burney, codirector of the <a href="https://www.aza.org/safe-species#sunflowerseastar">SAFE sunflower sea star program</a>. “I didn’t want to cry in front of all my colleagues, but I think all of us were feeling very emotional about it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The sunflower star is only the second invertebrate to have SAFE designation; <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24137250/coral-reefs-bleaching-climate-change">coral reefs</a> were the first. The SAFE group is co-led by Burney and Ben Morrow from Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s our first year and we’re really hitting the ground running,” says Morrow. They’re now in the process of adding several more aquariums, including Georgia Aquarium, Oregon Zoo, Monterey Bay Aquarium, and others.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Following the February spawn in San Diego and a hand-off of endangered sunflower star embryos in plastic bags in a Burger King parking lot in Los Banos, California, stars are also now growing at California Academy of Sciences, Moss Landing Marine Labs (MLML), the Sunflower Star Laboratory, and Aquarium of the Pacific.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Andrew Kim, a researcher at MLML and a board member of the <a href="https://www.sunflowerstarlab.org/">Sunflower Star Laboratory</a>, has taken care of the sea star babies since the Burger King parking lot hand-off. But “babies” isn’t quite the right word – they really start as larvae, which look like tiny floating spaceships with waving arms. Sea stars metamorphose, kind of like a butterfly. In fact, most aquatic invertebrates and all echinoderms (sea stars, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, and sand dollars) start life as planktonic larvae before growing into the adult form we’re used to seeing.</p>
<div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://volume.vox-cdn.com/embed/5e2af4324?player_type=youtube&#038;loop=1&#038;placement=article&#038;tracking=article:rss" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" allow=""></iframe></div>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Kim shows us the setup at MLML, and it’s hard not to get distracted as we wind through the wet lab filled with space-shuttle-like vats growing algae illuminated with pink and blue lights, aquaria full of abalone, tumble cultures of bull kelp, and tiny sea urchins. He leads us to the back, where he stops at a sky-blue saltwater tank big enough for a two-person cold plunge. It looks empty.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But as we stare into the tub, I slowly begin to make out millions of tiny dots. These little pink spots are the larvae’s stomachs, full of red algae from their morning meal.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kim pipettes a few onto a slide so we can get a better look. Just like it’s hard to imagine a caterpillar becoming a butterfly, these clear, dancing larvae look nothing like sea stars, yet this is how every star will spend a few weeks of its life before settling.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When we return a couple weeks later, some of the larvae have metamorphosed. The settled stars look lace-lined, like snowflakes with an orange center. Under the microscope, their tiny tube feet suction to a single drop of water on the glass slide as they cruise around on their newly formed feet. They have five little nubs for arms, which will eventually elongate as they add upward of 20 arms.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For now, the hope is to share settled stars with other labs and aquaria outside of the four that got larvae from the recent spawn. Burney says another goal for this cohort is “to make sure technique-wise, we figure out what worked, what didn’t, and that in the future everyone is able to replicate this process.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This initial cohort of stars won’t be released into the wild, but the long-term goal is to eventually put sunflower stars back into the ocean. “The big goal would be to outplant animals into the wild — that’s the pie-in-the-sky goal,” says Burney.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What raising future stars can teach us about saving other threatened species</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The die-off happened so quickly that scientists have few pre-wasting Pycnos to study and also very few to use for breeding in California.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We are limited in terms of historic California samples because there just weren’t that many [Pycnos] collected,” says Lauren Schiebelhut, an evolutionary ecologist at UC Merced. “They used to be super abundant, and nobody was worried about them until they totally disappeared and disrupted the kelp forest ecosystem.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Schiebelhut recently published <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37738158/">the reference genome for Pycnos</a>. She and Mike Dawson, also at the University of California Merced, are trying to tease out a genetic component of SSW. They haven’t yet found a genetic marker for SSW but they did potentially find a way to determine the Pycno’s sex by looking at its chromosomes. It turns out the petite Pycno at Heal the Bay is a female, which is helpful for breeding since cryopreservation of sperm has been very successful and eggs from females are the limiting factor.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Schiebelhut adds that Pycnos are “a great model for thinking about other species in the future. &#8230; The diverse knowledge and experience that people bring to the table to tackle this problem has been really refreshing to see, and I think we’re going to need more of that in the biodiversity crisis.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And there’s still hope for breeding Pycnos because inbreeding and genetic bottlenecks are not a problem yet. And sea stars can spawn. A lot.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“When you typically hear about an endangered species, it took a while to get there,” says Schiebelhut. “There may have been inbreeding before you’re all the way down to the last individuals. Sea stars are a totally different story. When they were hit in 2013, there were really large, successful population sizes with lots of genetic diversity, so the vast majority of that diversity is going to be contained in just a handful of stars.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because the wasting is relatively recent, the diversity hasn’t dramatically declined — yet, she says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, scientists at Friday Harbor Labs in Washington and Hakai Institute in Canada are working to identify what exactly causes wasting so that they can test stars before releasing them into the wild or transporting them across state lines.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"><img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/adler-0704.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />

<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/adler-0555_9721d6.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.765679560227,100,78.468640879546" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" /></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We have three years of intensive experiments from Marrowstone Point’s fish virus lab [in Washington] — we don’t have the answer yet, but the consistency of the experiments gives us a great deal of hope that we’re going to be able to solve it,” says Harvell.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And this is a great sign for invertebrate conservation moving forward. This is the first conservation project for an invertebrate on the West Coast besides abalone, says Burney. “Invertebrates don’t get a lot of love when it comes to conservation, but that’s changing now, which is awesome because we’re finding it’s not just about the sunflower star, it’s about kelp forests. As we look at things a little more holistically, we’ll start to see more attention given to these other species that maybe aren’t the cutest but do play a really big role in their environment.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As the sun disappeared into the fog at Moss Landing on the summer solstice, we visited the Sunflower Star Laboratory one more time to see the settled stars. They cruised around their clear containers, tube feet akin to clown feet, outsized for their tiny bodies, now sporting eight arms. It’s hard to imagine these tiny stars will grow up to be apex predators. Maybe someday, these stars, or their offspring, will again glide across the ocean floor and bring balance back to the kelp forests.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I enjoy plenty of government services (my library, my bus, the mail) but if I had to pick an absolute favorite thing the US government does, it might be “fund Gavi.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.gavi.org/">Gavi</a> is the international body, funded by rich governments and philanthropies, that bankrolls and organizes the distribution of life-saving vaccines in the Global South. Countries become eligible if their <a href="https://www.gavi.org/types-support/sustainability/eligibility">gross national income per capita is under $1,810</a>. That’s lower than you might think — a lot of countries that we consider quite poor, like Bangladesh or Kenya, are <a href="https://www.gavi.org/sites/default/files/programmes-impact/support/GNI-per-capita.pdf">too rich</a> to qualify for Gavi support. Those who get aid are the poorest of the poor: Haiti, Liberia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and so on.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You might have heard of Gavi when it was co-leading Covax, the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22872438/covax-omicron-covid-19-vaccine-global-inequity">less than fully successful</a> international effort to make sure poor countries got access to Covid-19 vaccines. But its bread and butter is funding the kind of routine vaccines <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html">given to infants in rich countries</a> as a matter of course, like the polio vaccine or the measles and rubella vaccines. Its work has saved millions of lives.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gavi, like many international organizations, is funded on “replenishment cycles,” in which every few years the group asks rich countries to pledge to fund it for a set period (usually about three to five years). It is currently asking rich country donors for $9 billion to cover its budget from 2026 to 2030. A huge chunk of that, <a href="https://www.gavi.org/sites/default/files/investing/funding/resource-mobilisation/Gavi-Investment-Opportunity-2026-2030.pdf#page=20">over $1.1 billion</a>, is set to fund purchases of <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23755531/malaria-vaccines-progress-logistics-challenges-africa">newly approved vaccines</a> against malaria, a disease that <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/malaria-introduction#:~:text=In%20the%20worst%20cases%20malaria,than%20the%20treatment%20%E2%80%93%20of%20disease.">kills over a thousand children a day</a>, most of whom are in some of the world’s poorest countries. Such vaccines have <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22307700/malaria-rna-vaccines-covid-19">only become available in the last couple years</a>, and their existence makes the case for generous funding of Gavi that much stronger.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, raising $9 billion is never easy, and Gavi has the misfortune of asking for funding during what experts are calling the <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/blog/2024-2025-replenishment-traffic-jam-are-we-headed-pileup">“replenishment pileup.”</a> A huge number of international humanitarian groups — the World Bank; the World Health Organization; the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/1/13/23544865/congress-hiv-malaria-global-fund-replenishment">Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria</a>; the <a href="https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/issue-brief/the-new-pandemic-fund-overview-and-key-issues-for-the-u-s/">Pandemic Fund</a>; the climate-oriented <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/what-you-need-know-about-cop27-loss-and-damage-fund">Loss and Damage Fund</a> — are all asking for donor funds at roughly the same time. That has fueled fears that donor fatigue and tight budgets will mean some, many, or all of these groups will fall short of their goals.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Luckily, Gavi seems likely to avoid that fate. The US has already <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/news/jun-21-2024-gavi-vaccine-alliance-replenishment">pledged $1.58 billion</a> of the $9 billion the group requested. And there’s bipartisan support in Congress — yes, the same Congress that can’t seem to agree on anything — for going even higher than that.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The case for Gavi</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We know that vaccines in general are an <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24138291/do-vaccines-work-explained-study-efficacy-evidence">incredibly effective way of saving tens of millions of lives</a>, but Gavi in particular seems to be an effective way of buying and distributing them. For one thing, because it <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2749793">purchases so many vaccines in bulk</a>, it can bid down the price, enabling more people to get immunized for less.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It has also played an unusual role in pushing the development of new vaccines. When the alliance started in 2000, the only available pneumococcal vaccine (preventing pneumonia, meningitis, and other diseases caused by the pneumococcus bacterium) targeted variants of the bacterium prevalent in the rich world, not in Gavi countries, where the disease is <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/pneumococcal-disease-streptococcus-pneumoniae">more common and more deadly</a>. By setting up what’s called an <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/impacts-and-influence/advance-market-commitments-vaccines">advance market commitment</a> promising to purchase en masse a vaccine that proved effective in poor countries, Gavi <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w26775">spurred the development of three effective new vaccines</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://gh.bmj.com/content/4/6/e001789">One recent paper</a> studying Gavi&#8217;s initial rollout from its founding through 2016 estimated that it saved about 9 million lives, at a cost of $118 each. <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4182652">Another paper</a> using a different empirical strategy put the cost per life saved higher (between $4,265 and $17,059) but still very low in the scheme of things. Expanding Medicaid in the US, for instance, <a href="https://harris.uchicago.edu/files/inline-files/Wyse_CensusMedicaid.pdf">saves a life for about $5.4 million</a>, or at least 300 times more than Gavi vaccinations.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Distributing vaccines in a cost-effective way isn’t always straightforward. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304387819305309">A study by a team at the Center for Global Development</a> found that Gavi funding for countries like Ukraine or the Philippines that were near its income cutoff often paid for vaccines the country would’ve paid for on its own anyway — but the authors are clear to emphasize that <a href="https://x.com/JustinSandefur/status/1130876177143488512">Gavi might have had a significant impact on vaccine coverage</a> in very poor countries not near the cutoff and that, even for less poor countries, the aid might have helped them adopt newer, more cutting-edge vaccines and freed up government funds for other worthwhile social services.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This track record has resulted in “a long history of bipartisan support in Congress for Gavi,” per Adam Wexler, director of the global health budget project at the research group KFF. Through the Obama and Trump years, Congress consistently either met or exceeded the president’s pledged support for the group. In 2011, the <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(11)60945-8/fulltext">US pledged $450 million</a> in funding through 2015; Congress actually <a href="https://www.gavi.org/news/document-library/annual-contributions-and-proceeds-31-december-2023">appropriated $733 million</a>. In 2020, the Trump administration <a href="https://www.gavi.org/news/media-room/united-states-endorses-gavi-recommendation-us-116-billion-four-year-commitment">pledged $1.16 billion</a> over four years, which Congress <a href="https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-u-s-government-gavi-the-vaccine-alliance/#datawrapper-chart-2HePN">matched</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That continues today. Bipartisan resolutions have been introduced in the <a href="https://kean.house.gov/media/press-releases/kean-amo-salazar-and-jacobs-introduce-resolution-safeguard-vaccine-and">House</a> and <a href="https://www.foreign.senate.gov/press/dem/release/cardin-wicker-lead-resolution-supporting-us-program-to-protect-vaccines-and-immunizations-in-low-income-countries-through-gavi-the-vaccine-alliance">Senate</a> this spring supporting high funding levels for Gavi, as have bipartisan <a href="https://results.org/wp-content/uploads/FY25-House-MCH-Gavi-and-Nutrition-Dear-Colleague-Final.pdf">“Dear Colleague”</a> <a href="https://results.org/wp-content/uploads/FY25-Senate-MCH-Gavi-and-Nutrition-Dear-Colleague-Final.pdf">letters</a> calling for $340 million in annual funding for the group. That implies $1.7 billion in funding over five years, or substantially more than the Biden administration’s $1.58 billion pledge. When <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/news/jun-21-2024-gavi-vaccine-alliance-replenishment">announcing the pledge</a>, the administration was careful to call for “at least $1.58 billion,” leaving the door open for Congress to exceed that amount.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The House Appropriations Committee recently <a href="https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/fact-sheet/house-appropriations-committee-approves-the-fy-2025-state-and-foreign-operations-sfops-appropriations-bill/">passed a funding bill</a> on a <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/AP/AP00/20240612/117434/HMKP-118-AP00-20240612-SD006.pdf#page=4">party-line vote</a> including some serious cuts, like zeroing out support for the World Health Organization entirely. But even the Republican-backed package included $300 million for Gavi — not the full $340 million advocates wanted, but consistent with the Biden pledge. Colin Puzo Smith, director of global policy at the pro-aid advocacy group Results, told me that the $1.58 billion is meant to be distributed as $300 million in the first year and $320 million in the subsequent four, meaning the House bill keeps things on track.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The funding isn’t finalized yet, and the House and Senate appropriators will surely clash over other components of the package. But so far, at least $300 million in Gavi funding in 2025 looks like a sure thing.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Funding the new malaria vaccine</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’m sufficiently jaded by American politics that whenever I see that both parties want to give serious funding to a good program, that’s enough to get me excited. But there’s a real case that appropriators should be aiming much higher.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Recall that there are not one but two new vaccines available for malaria. RTS,S, which has been in development for decades, is quite expensive to produce, but R21, the second approved vaccine, is not. RTS,S currently costs <a href="https://www.unicef.org/supply/media/21901/file/Malaria-vaccine-Q-A-May-2024-update.pdf#page=4">around $10 per dose</a>, while R21 costs $3.90 per dose. Once manufacturing has ramped up, GlaxoSmithKline, which makes RTS,S, estimates it can produce 15 million doses of it a year; the Serum Institute, which makes R21, estimates that it can currently make <a href="https://www.seruminstitute.com/press_release_sii_200524.php">as many as 100 million doses</a> a year. Both because it’s less than half the price and because it can be produced in much greater quantities, R21 is the vaccine to watch here.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A full course of either vaccine requires four doses, meaning that we could theoretically produce enough to vaccinate about 29 million children a year. That’s not enough to cover every child at risk of the disease, but it’s a huge number. And right now, the Gavi budget isn’t sufficient to reach that target. It projects immunizing 50 million children from 2026 to 2030, or 10 million a year. That’s less than half the number that could theoretically be vaccinated if Serum and GSK’s total production capacity were reached.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the nearer term, the situation is bleaker. The advocacy group 1DaySooner has been pushing a goal of <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6065d7e291d5fd2332b4bc74/t/6682c4794c22a5685b83144a/1719846009636/R21+Malaria+Vaccine+Deployment+Talking+Points+_Rolling+Public+Comment_+July+24.pdf">vaccinating 50 million children</a> this year and the next (2024 and 2025). That takes 200 million doses, which Serum claims it can produce. But Gavi only projects a total of only 2 million immunized children from 2021 and 2025, or 25 times fewer children than theoretically could be vaccinated with more funding.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rollout of R21 has faced <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f6300b31-72e8-49c7-a878-82ce017ef1ad">resistance</a> from some quarters in public health in a way I find frankly baffling. It is not, to be clear, sufficient to wipe out malaria, the way the smallpox vaccine eventually wiped out that disease. The largest study I’ve seen estimates that it’s <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02511-4/fulltext">68-75 percent effective</a> in the first year, which is very good but not as high as some vaccines, like that for <a href="https://www.cochrane.org/news/cochrane-review-confirms-effectiveness-mmr-vaccines">measles</a>. It’s better to think of it as one tool among several, and a tool that can be replaced if we develop yet-more-effective malaria vaccines, as I think we will. (If you live near Baltimore, you can help and <a href="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/cvd/trials/malaria-mrna-vaccine-trial/">join a trial of one candidate</a> right now!).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The R21 vaccine is still an incredibly cost-effective way to prevent malaria infection and death. One <a href="https://www.1daysooner.org/how-cost-effective-is-the-new-r21-vaccine-compared-to-existing-malaria-interventions/">recent analysis</a> found that distributing R21 saves a year of a child’s life for about $39. Anti-malaria bednets save a year of life for about $38. Bednets are among the most cost-effective public health interventions known to mankind, so being roughly as cost-effective as them is hitting a very, very high bar. If Gavi were able to buy it in much greater quantity and bargain down the price, it would be more cost-effective than bednets, and even more of a no-brainer.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So while the bipartisan support for Gavi is a great thing, I think there’s a strong case that donors like the US should be pledging a significantly higher amount to make sure every single dose of RTS,S and R21 that can be bought and used to prevent malaria is. Funding the standard vaccines is great. But every 100,000 kids vaccinated with R21 means <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309923008162?ssrnid=4597985&amp;dgcid=SSRN_redirect_SD#tbl2">629 fewer kids dead</a> from malaria. The 48 million kid gap between 1DaySooner&#8217;s vaccination goal and Gavi&#8217;s current plans for this year and next, then, represents about 300,000 additional dead kids. Those are lives we can save with sufficient investment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Jacob Trefethen, a funder of global health research at Open Philanthropy, <a href="https://blog.jacobtrefethen.com/10-policy-ideas/">recently asked</a>, “Are we, as a country, as a world, really going to let money be the blocker to kids getting a malaria vaccine?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The history of philosophy is mostly the history of various schools arguing with each other about what’s good or true. The Epicureans, the Empiricists, the Stoics, the Skeptics, the Positivists, the Pragmatists — you get the point.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’m not an official member of any of these clubs, but if you asked me to pick one, I’d go with the Existentialists. For me, existentialism was the last great philosophical movement. Part of the reason for that is purely historical. Existentialism emerged in the early- to mid-20th century, against the backdrop of two devastating world wars, and many of the existentialists were responding to that.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another reason for the movement’s appeal is that its leading proponents didn’t just write arcane academic treatises; they wrote novels and plays and popular essays, and their ideas crossed over into the culture. They also engaged with concrete questions about freedom and responsibility and authenticity, and those ideas will always resonate because the human condition hasn’t really changed. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But every historical moment is unique and so the question is always how does this tradition address the world we inhabit today?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nathalie Etoke is a professor at the CUNY Graduate Center and the author of the book <a href="https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781538157060/Black-Existential-Freedom"><em>Black Existential Freedom</em></a>. It’s an exploration of Black existence through the lens of existentialist thought, and it ultimately makes a case for something like tragic optimism. It’s both a critique of “Afro-pessimism” — more on this idea below — and an affirmation of political realism, and that makes it a distinctive contribution to the discourse.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I invited Etoke on <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> to talk about the book and the unique perspective she brings to this conversation. As always, there’s much more in the full podcast, so listen and follow <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/id1081584611">Apple Podcasts</a>,<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6NOJ6IkTb2GWMj1RpmtnxP"> Spotify</a>,<a href="https://www.pandora.com/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/PC:30793?source=stitcher-sunset"> Pandora</a>, or wherever you find podcasts.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before we get to the story you want to tell in this book, I&#8217;d like to do just a little philosophical table-setting for the audience. What does existentialism mean to you? How do you approach this tradition of thought?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Nathalie Etoke</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, I come from a Francophone schooling background, so I was exposed to philosophy in high school. Right away, I found the questions that philosophers were asking very interesting.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I read Jean-Paul Sartre, <em>Being and Nothingness.</em> I read some Kierkegaard; I read Camus. Questions of existence were always part of my thinking process, but there&#8217;s something about existing as a Black person in the context of white supremacist capitalist society and the whole idea of the dehumanization of Black people, which thinkers like Du Bois, Fanon, Ralph Ellison also helped me think about. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So you have the traditional existentialist school when you think about the white thinkers, but honestly when you think about African writers and diasporic African writers who did not present themselves as philosophers, you continuously have them engaging the question of existing as a Black person. Those writers don&#8217;t have to label themselves existentialists.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Is there something about the historical Black experience that informs or expands existentialist philosophy?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Nathalie Etoke</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes. The question that I ask is: What does it mean to be human when you&#8217;ve been historically dehumanized? And regardless of where you find yourself on this globe, you will see that people with darker skin are at the bottom. So there&#8217;s something about this legacy of dehumanization that creates an existential tension. Of course, it manifests differently depending on where you find yourself.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I was born in Paris, France, but I was raised in Cameroon, Central Africa, and I grew up there. I never thought of myself as being non-human or as being Black.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But once you move to a space where the majority population is white and the interactions you have with people make you realize that you are “the other,” although you never really see yourself as being “the other,” you realize that although race is a construct, it&#8217;s a lived experience. For whatever reason, even in this country, citizenship is not enough to be part of the nation. Once you&#8217;ve been defined as non-human, what can you tell those who think that they&#8217;re human what it means to be human? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because what they don&#8217;t realize is that they too have done something to their humanity. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/12/06/frantz-fanons-enduring-legacy">[Frantz] Fanon</a> wrote about it, the question of dehumanization/being human is still at the core of Black existential thought.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When I first started your book, I was thinking, because existentialism is about the universal human experience,&nbsp; what does it even mean to say Black existentialism?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But then your book very quickly drives home the reminder that we have this tradition of Western thought, and part of the history of that tradition is the devaluing of Black humanity, and that dehumanization is part of the historical Black experience, that sense of exile is part of the experience in the West, and so there&#8217;s just no way to engage with a tradition like this one without also dealing with that history.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Nathalie Etoke</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Exactly. Even in the African context, we are conditioned to think about the question of the human and racism only in racial terms. Cameroon, the way we spell it today came from “camaroes” because the Portuguese were the first to show up there, and they saw a lot of big shrimps. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To me, that&#8217;s the beginning of dehumanization: People claim a land and they act as if the people they find on that land are of no value. They rename the place, they balkanize it, and we are still trying to make sense of those spaces. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There&#8217;s a term you use in the book: “Afro-pessimism.” What does that refer to? And is the argument you&#8217;re making in this book opposed to this, or is the relationship more complicated?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Nathalie Etoke</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Afro-pessimism says that there is a continuous and ongoing process of dehumanization that people of African descent go through. And in many ways, there&#8217;s no way we can be fully human because we make everybody else human. In other words, it’s the dehumanization of people of African descent that makes other people human.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I focus on the ongoing struggle for freedom. I&#8217;m not dismissing the reality of white supremacy. I&#8217;m not dismissing the reality of the dehumanization of Black people. I&#8217;m not dismissing the material conditions of our lives. But I&#8217;m looking at it from the perspective of those who, for a very long time, had to fight in order to exist.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the very beginning of the book, you say explicitly that Blackness is not synonymous with victimhood. Why was it important to state that so clearly?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Nathalie Etoke</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, because I think historically, people of African descent have been victimized, so they&#8217;re victims. But at the same time, the other side of the story is that they always try to find a way to free themselves. I cannot separate the two, so that&#8217;s where I draw the line between being historically victimized and being a victim and the state of victimhood. And it&#8217;s not even just in the US or in France. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Sub-Saharan Africa, the dictatorships and the many ways in which neocolonialism and the setting up of a power structure that still oppresses Africans is happening at the moment. People are still trying to be free. And to me, I&#8217;m not being pessimistic. It&#8217;s just the facts of Black life. It&#8217;s how you deal with it and how continuously you’re still trying to improve the conditions of your lives. Whereas the Afro-pessimists will say that there&#8217;s no point talking about the struggle because why should you even be struggling in the first place?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is a certain pessimism, to just stick with that word, that I feel in so much of the race discourse in America, and I just don&#8217;t know what to do with it. So I&#8217;m a white guy who grew up in the deep South. That&#8217;s just a fact about me. And I&#8217;m not saying that in some performative way. I&#8217;m just acknowledging that that&#8217;s my experience.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I also believe in the universality of the human condition and the power of language and ideas to bridge differences. And when the pessimism goes too far or when we become trapped in our given identities, we sacrifice our agency on some level. We sacrifice our ability to define ourselves in the here and now and project ourselves into a better future. But at the same time, we are products of material and historical forces. How do we accept the all too real constraints imposed on us by history without, at the same time, reducing ourselves to historical props?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Nathalie Etoke</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I always go back to the lived experience because African people or people of African descent are not concepts. I honestly believe that every day when someone wakes up, they try to figure out what they have to do, how to go about it. It is not an academic matter. It&#8217;s very concrete. It doesn&#8217;t mean that you&#8217;re not going to be facing difficulties, challenges, problems, but you still go about your life because that&#8217;s the life you were given to live. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But I also think, to paraphrase Gramsci, that you need to strike a balance between the pessimism of the intellect and the optimism of the will. You need to be able to deal with reality; otherwise it&#8217;s a flight from responsibility. Once you&#8217;re able to look at a situation for what it is and you don&#8217;t lie to yourself, you are able to deal with it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And this is not some grandiose philosophical statement. I see that every time I go back to Cameroon. Coming from a perspective of somebody who has lived most of her life overseas, you can come and be like, &#8220;Oh my God, these people are suffering. They don&#8217;t have this. They don&#8217;t have that.&#8221; You can look at their daily lives from a perspective of lack and deficiency, but that is not how they&#8217;re living their lives. They&#8217;re still trying to work whatever job they can do. They&#8217;re still having children, they&#8217;re still having a certain kind of joy. Horrible things happen to them, but they don&#8217;t sit in a state of pessimism and paralysis.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I cannot afford to be pessimistic because all the people who came before me had to endure and fight when it seemed like everything was dark and there was no hope. Had those people not believed, and had they not fought, where would I be today? So that&#8217;s where I also find a certain hope.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of this gets at the ambivalence I felt reading someone like Ta-Nehisi Coates, who writes beautifully and in a way that helped me understand his experience. What I wrestled with was the philosophy of hopelessness that seemed to undergird his work. I think it yields too much to the forces of oppression. Do you think I&#8217;m misunderstanding the point there?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Nathalie Etoke</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, yes and no. Remember that people of African descent in the United States, and — I&#8217;m paraphrasing Baldwin here — they&#8217;re the only people who never wanted to come here. So they didn&#8217;t come here because they had a dream or they tried to improve their living conditions. They&#8217;ve been through hell and they&#8217;re still going through hell. We are talking about at least 250 years of free labor. We are talking about Jim Crow laws. We&#8217;re talking about lynching. So I cannot say that Ta-Nehisi Coates is a preacher of hopelessness per se, because in the United States, there&#8217;s also this obsession with hope and happy endings, which I do not have because I come from a French background.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That&#8217;s why I love the blues, because the blues is an African-American art form that helps you deal with the dissonance of your existence. And you cannot be in denial of your reality, but you have to be responsible about it. You can be humorous about it. You can have a sense of irony. And when you listen to some blue songs, you can see that the lyrics can be sad or tragic, but the melody is upbeat. What is the blues singer expressing? Joy, happiness, hope? He&#8217;s expressing an existential struggle.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I wonder what you think is the principal struggle today, and where freedom is to be found in that, for Black people in this country?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Nathalie Etoke</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When you think about the ’60s and the ’70s, the Black struggle was not just for Black people. It was universal. Most of those Black leaders were Marxist or leftist. They were also anti-capitalist. It wasn&#8217;t just anti-racism. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think the difficulty today is not necessarily just a question of freedom, it&#8217;s the fact that leftist politics is divided. You have the cultural left and then you have the left that focuses on class, but also there is this neoliberalization of identity discourse.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The question I have is, are we framing freedom in terms of becoming part of a system, which by definition will produce inequality? If that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re claiming, you&#8217;re going to create a minority elite class and then they will be part of this world as it is. Or do you want to create a world that is difficult to actually create because we all have to lose and risk everything, and that includes the Black bourgeois?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Earlier this year, a brand-new child care center opened up in San Diego, serving about 25 families.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The center charges parents 50 percent less than market rate, and child care workers are paid 15 percent above the going local average. Its hours of operation are flexible. It stays open from 5:30 am to 7 pm every day, longer than most child care centers, and can accommodate emergencies like unexpected work shifts. There’s only one catch: To send your child, you have to work for the San Diego Police Department.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">San Diego’s law enforcement child care center, funded through both public and private money, is the first of its kind in the country, but plans for several others across the US are already underway. A <a href="https://scottpeters.house.gov/2023/4/rep-peters-introduces-the-providing-child-care-for-police-officers-act">bipartisan bill</a> in Congress would expand the model further.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Supporters call law enforcement child care a win-win-win — a way to help diversify policing by making it more accessible to women, a recruiting tool at a time when police <a href="https://www.policeforum.org/staffing2023">resignations and retirements are up</a>, and <a href="https://www.theiacp.org/sites/default/files/239416_IACP_RecruitmentBR_HR_0.pdf">applications are down</a>. And, frankly, they hope that an innovative model for child care will give a PR boost to a profession that has taken severe blows to its reputation over the last decade.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it also raises a basic question: Why just police? What about subsidizing other professions, including other first responders like firefighters and nurses?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“My response is those other professions haven’t been demonized like law enforcement has,” said Jim Mackay, a retired police detective and the founder of the National Law Enforcement Foundation, which has advocated for these child care centers and worked with police departments to build them. “My philosophy is if you have a healthy law enforcement then everything else kind of prospers out from that, and we have to treat the problems with law enforcement first.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s no data yet on if this employer-centric model will pay off, but advocates argue that the child care investment is a smart bet. The estimated annual operating cost for each center is $2 million, while the average cost to recruit and train a single police officer is $200,000. In other words, if this helps keep even just ten officers in the ranks, it will have been worth it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tanya Meisenholder, the director of gender equity at <a href="https://www.policingproject.org/our-mission">the Policing Project</a> at NYU School of Law, says child care is one of the job barriers she hears about most often from female cops and those considering entering the profession. Women make up only 12 percent of sworn officers and 3 percent of police leadership in the US, though there’s <a href="https://30x30initiative.org/about-30x30/">a national campaign underway</a> to increase those numbers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Child care is the one thing that’s been brought up over and over not only as a barrier to entry but a barrier to promotion,” Meisenholder said. “Police child care would show the agencies value their employees and are listening to their concerns. It has the potential to be somewhat transformative.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The idea is spreading quickly</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Angelie Hoxie, a state police detective in Idaho, heard about the San Diego child care idea and wanted to see if she could build a similar model for Treasure Valley, which covers the greater Boise region.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Idaho police agencies have struggled with recruitment and retention, and many families are on year-long child care waitlists. The Idaho Association for the Education of Young Children said over 90 percent of child care facilities cite staffing as their top challenge.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In early 2022 Hoxie helped launch the Treasure Valley Law Enforcement Coalition and within a year they were lobbying state and federal officials and partnering with a local university and local philanthropy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By winter 2023, Republican Gov. Brad Little was recommending funding for Idaho police child care programs in his workforce development budget, and by March, a bill to support the effort passed out of both chambers of the Idaho legislature. Republican Rep. Mike Simpson then <a href="https://simpson.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=400336">successfully earmarked $2.65 million</a> from the federal budget to help finance the new child care center. Construction is set to launch this summer with the program to be operational for police families by 2025.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">St. Louis County in Missouri is another region set to open a law enforcement child care center next year, following the same model as San Diego: longer hours of service, subsidized rates for parents, and higher wages for workers. Their goal now is to care for up to 75 kids at a time, and by operating for 18 hours a day, upwards of 150 families could be served.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The push was prompted by a rank-and-file woman officer during the pandemic who struggled to find care for her 1-year-old while balancing her new 12-hour shifts. Twelve-hour shifts have since become the norm for the department, even after Covid-19.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We’re absolutely hoping it helps with both recruitment and retention,” said Tracy Panus, a spokesperson for St. Louis County police.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democratic Rep. Scott Peters, whose congressional district includes San Diego, <a href="https://scottpeters.house.gov/_cache/files/3/b/3bfde226-2530-49b3-a818-892d38477fc0/FA4109B1906F8D9E9437A3D44538351F.peteca-008-xml.pdf">introduced a police child care bill</a> last year to authorize $24 million annually in funding under the federal Child Care Development Grant program. The bill would also allow Health and Human Services to provide grants of up to $3 million for new police child care centers. In December the Congressional Problem Solvers Caucus <a href="https://scottpeters.house.gov/2023/12/rep-peters-announces-key-support-for-his-providing-child-care-for-police-officers-act">endorsed the legislation</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There’s no question that [child care] is a priority—it has come up in every single focus group we’ve done,” said Kym Craven, the executive director of the National Association of Women Law Enforcement Executives.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Taking some cues from the US military</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That police might take on leadership in child care is less surprising when one looks to the Department of Defense, which sponsors the nation’s only federally run universal child care program.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The military child care program, which serves roughly 200,000 children, is known for being affordable and high-quality, and its 23,000 child care workers are paid higher wages than their private sector counterparts. Members of Congress and former military leaders have been in discussions over the last few years about how to expand and improve upon this child care program to boost army recruitment even further.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, expanding public subsidies for police child care is not popular with everyone, including those who want <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/6/26/21303849/what-defund-the-police-really-means">less public money subsidizing police departments</a>, and those who want to see public dollars prioritizing child care for low-income families.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Others have raised concerns with the idea of employer-sponsored child care more broadly. In one <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/better-life-lab/reports/questioning-the-promise-of-employer-sponsored-child-care-benefits/">report published this past winter</a>, Elliot Haspel, author of <em>Crawling Behind: America’s Childcare Crisis and How to Fix It</em>, argued that employer-sponsored child care “does nothing to address the fundamental challenges within the child care system, nor does it promote a pluralistic system of choice.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He compared the model to painkillers for cancer. “They can ease the pain for a while, but the body gets sicker, and the temptation to overly rely on painkillers only grows,” he wrote.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, advocates for police child care say the public safety needs are too urgent, and the possible benefits to communities and agencies too great to pass up. They hope in five years they will have firmer data showing their investments have worked.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“In this new generation not too many people want to become law enforcement officers,” said Mackay. “We’re really trying to stem that tide.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fourteen years of Conservative rule in the United Kingdom ended with a bang, not a whimper, on Thursday as the party suffered a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cn09xn9je7lt">landslide defeat</a> at the polls, winning just 121 seats while the opposition Labour Party took 412.<strong> </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The last of the five prime ministers of this period, Rishi Sunak, who moved into 10 Downing Street less than two years ago, will step down, saying in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/05/rishi-sunak-to-resign-as-tory-leader-as-well-as-pm-after-election-defeat">post-election speech</a>, ““To the country I would like to say first and foremost, I am sorry.” Labour&#8217;s Keir Starmer will now take over as prime minister with a significant mandate</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“&#8217;The work of change begins immediately,” Starmer said in his first speech as prime minister, acknowledging this would not be as as simple as &#8220;flicking a switch&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sunak also stepped down as leader of the Conservative party and the Tories are likely<strong> </strong>in for a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-general-election-conservative-party-tories-rishi-sunak-successor/">brutal internal</a> battle over their future, with some right wingers calling for a merger with Trumpian gadfly Nigel Farage’s right-wing Reform UK party, which won four seats but came in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/05/nigel-farages-reform-uk-party-shocks-with-significant-gains-expected.html">third in terms of vote share with 14 percent </a>of the  national vote. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Conservatives ended up suffering a historic loss the way Hemingway described going bankrupt: Gradually, and then suddenly. The Tories had been underwater in the polls <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/united-kingdom/">since late 2021</a>, but Sunak only <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/22/uk/uk-early-elections-sunak-conservatives-intl/index.html">called this election in late May</a>, likely sensing his party’s prospects were not likely to improve any time soon. It was a swift, though not exactly painless, end to a political era that radically changed a country and its place in the world. The consensus view is that it has not changed for the better.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/conservative-effect-20102024/29642F14C9265B69EEC9283AFD3FF9E6">just-released book</a>, <em>The Conservative Effect, 2010–2024: 14 Wasted Years?</em>, co-edited by Anthony Seldon, a veteran chronicler and biographer of contemporary British prime ministers, attempts to take stock of the legacy of this period. Seldon is unsparing in his concluding essay, writing, “By 2024, Britain’s standing in the world was lower [compared to 2010], the union was less strong, the country less equal, the population less well protected, growth more sluggish with the outlook poor.” He concludes: “Overall, it is hard to find a comparable period in history of the Conservatives which achieved so little, or which left the country at its conclusion in a more troubling state.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So how, exactly, did we get here?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">14 years, five prime ministers, one Brexit</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This 14 year period of Conservative rule was <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6e670e62-57a0-404b-a0a1-66cc5b98ee57">really two different periods</a>: pre- and post-Brexit.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first period began in 2010, when Prime Minister David Cameron, leading a coalition government consisting of the Conservatives and the centrist Liberal Democrats, moved into 10 Downing Street, ending 13 years of Labour rule under Tony Blair and his dour successor Gordon Brown. Relatively youthful at 44, Cameron, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/dec/18/conservatives.interviews">self-described “liberal conservative,”</a> distinguished himself from previous generations of conservatives with stances like his support for <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-22605011">gay marriage</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/may/14/cameron-wants-greenest-government-ever">calls for action on climate change</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But his&nbsp; economic policies were anything but moderate. Cameron’s government came into office in the wake of the global financial <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/cameron-uk-deficit-even-worse-than-we-thought">crisis facing a budget deficit</a> of some $225 billion. In response, the government <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/04/01/what-have-fourteen-years-of-conservative-rule-done-to-britain">carried out a program</a> of fiscal consolidation and budget cuts that the UK budget office has described as “one of the biggest deficit reduction programs seen in any advanced economy since World War II.” Public spending fell from around 41 percent of GDP to 35 percent, with deep cuts to social programs, infrastructure and international diplomacy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Heading into the 2015 election, Cameron was also coming under pressure from the insurgent UK Independence Party, led by Farage, and from his own party’s right-flank, to hold a referendum on whether the UK should remain a member of the European Union. Though Cameron personally opposed withdrawing from the EU, in part to respond to dissidents from his right <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-21148282">he vowed</a> that if he won, he would attempt to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with the EU and then hold an “in/out referendum” on whether Britain should stay.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a short-term political move, it worked out great. The Conservatives won an overall majority in 2015, ending the coalition era. But <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/03/brexit-european-union-chaos-brief-guide-how.html">Cameron was less successful</a> in convincing Brussels to give Britain “special status” within the EU. Cameron won only minor concessions on sovereignty and immigration. There has always been an undercurrent of Euro-skepticism in British politics, but it grew stronger in the 2000s and 2010s. The financial crisis of 2008 and the eurozone debt crisis that followed undermined the appeal of the EU as an economic union. The unprecedented number of migrants who attempted to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/4/21/8462219/europe-migrant-mediterranean-drowning">reach Europe in 2015</a> reduced support for the EU’s open border policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In retrospect, it was a perfect storm for Brexit, but it was still stunning when the country voted 52 to 48 percent in 2016 to leave the EU. Cameron, who had campaigned for the “Remain” side, resigned as prime minister. He was replaced by Theresa May, previously the home secretary and a fellow Remainer, who had the unenviable task of negotiating Britain’s withdrawal from the EU while simultaneously presiding over a <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/03/brexit-european-union-chaos-brief-guide-how.html">civil war within her own party</a> over how exactly Brexit should be implemented.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Moderates wanted a “soft Brexit” that would preserve Britain’s access to Europe’s common market. Hardliners wanted a “hard Brexit” that would prioritize ditching EU regulations and controlling immigration. European negotiators in Brussels were not going to let the Brits have both. Further complicating the process was an issue that few anticipated before the referendum: the economic and political status of Northern Ireland — the only part of the UK with a land border with the EU. Finding a way to avoid a hard border across the island of Ireland — a key pillar of the Northern Irish peace process — while also removing the UK as a whole from the EU turned out to be excruciatingly difficult.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">May stepped down in 2019, and after an internal party leadership election, was replaced by former London mayor and omnipresent media figure Boris Johnson. Johnson is not exactly known for holding consistent views.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2014/11/boris-johnson-london-s-mayor-on-why-he-wrote-a-book-about-winston-churchill.html">2014 interview for Slate</a>, two years before the Brexit vote, he told me that when it came to the EU, “We may want to change our relationship a bit, but fundamentally we will remain within the European common market.” Just a few years later, he would be one of the most visible and enthusiastic campaigners for “Leave.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A few months after taking office, Johnson called a national election, campaigning on a pledge to “get Brexit done” — and won a landslide victory. It didn’t hurt that Labour at the time was led by the veteran left-winger Jeremy Corbyn, who had both failed to take a strong stance on Brexit and was beset by <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45030552">accusations of anti-semitism</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Armed with his new large majority, Johnson did something unusual for him: He did what he said he would do, and indeed got Brexit done. Britain formally left the EU on January 31, 2020. Just two years later, however, Johnson left as well, forced to resign over a scandal over allegations that he misled parliament <a href="https://apnews.com/article/boris-johnson-resignation-60da3c4b29a4e9c93c7db9f53034ad0e">over parties held in his office</a> during Covid-19 lockdowns.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That was followed by the 50-day reign of Prime Minister Liz Truss, which was the shortest in British history — so short, in fact, that she was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/19/world/europe/liz-truss-lettuce-stream.html">famously outlasted by a head of lettuce</a>.&nbsp; Truss is <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66897881">mainly remembered</a> for a proposed set of tax cuts so extreme it triggered weeks of panic in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66897881">global bond markets</a> and the kind of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63051702">upbraiding from the IMF</a> normally reserved for failed states.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Truss was then replaced by Sunak, who made history as the first prime minister of Asian descent, as well as <a href="https://www.oldest.org/politics/youngest-prime-ministers/">the youngest one since William Pitt</a> (the Younger, of course) in 1783. Under Sunak, the lingering effects of the pandemic and the shock to energy markets caused by the war in Ukraine have contributed to a cost-of-living crisis that has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/uk-energy-prices-warm-hubs-84dc6878fd3c5b91837f8d3558c1f672">disproportionately impacted the poorest Britons</a>. Sunak has tried to make the case that the UK economy is turning the corner — and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/19/inflation-rishi-sunak-analysis">indeed inflation is now starting to ease</a> — but it’s almost certainly too little too late.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">The aftermath</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To some extent, Sunak’s biggest crime was simply to be in office during a widespread anti-incumbent trend throughout the Western democratic world. He was deeply unpopular, but <a href="https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval">not significantly more so</a> than G7 counterparts like France’s Emmanuel Macron and Germany’s Olaf Scholz.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Defenders of the Conservatives’ time in office will point to the external shocks the party had to contend with, including the legacy of the 2008 financial crisis, the Covid pandemic, and the economic impact of the war in Ukraine. But every major economy had to deal with those shocks. Only one country — and one party — chose Brexit.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Disentangling the effects of the withdrawal from other post-2020 shocks isn’t easy, but a recent study from Britain’s National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR), an independent think tank, <a href="https://www.niesr.ac.uk/publications/revisiting-effect-brexit?type=global-economic-outlook-topical-feature">estimated</a> that the UK’s real GDP is about 2 to 3 percent lower today, compared to a scenario where it stayed in the union. Real income is about 8 to 9 percent lower.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to the <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn02784/">government’s own figures</a>, Britain’s GDP today is only about 1.7 percent higher than it was pre-pandemic, compared to 3.7 percent for the Eurozone and 8.7 percent for the United States.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ironically, Brexit didn’t even accomplish the goal that motivated many of its supporters to vote for it: Net migration to the UK <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/three-years-after-britain-left-eu-net-migration-never-been-higher-brexit/">has actually increased</a> since the withdrawal. Much of the debate around immigration policy has focused on the government’s bizarre and inhumane plan to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-61782866">fly asylum seekers to Rwanda</a> to have their claims processed, as a means of deterring them from trying. But asylum seekers are <a href="https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN01403/SN01403.pdf">only about 11 percent of the UK’s immigrants</a>, and half of those are Ukrainians who entered under a specially tailored system and significantly more public support.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The real driver of migration is economic — including the economic needs of Britain itself. As migration researcher Hein de Haas <a href="https://www.bigissue.com/opinion/brexit-net-migration-rishi-sunak-uk-immigration/">has written</a>, while “Brexit successfully curtailed free inflows of EU workers, it did not eliminate labor shortages that had been driving increasing migration to the UK ever since the 1990s.” Some jobs staffing Britain’s stores and its much-beloved National Health Service have been filled by non-EU migrants instead of European ones; some European migrants who previously traveled back and forth between the UK and the continent have stayed put.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Brexit’s advocates had argued that the benefits of trade with Europe could be offset by a free trade agreement that a new “global Britain,” unshackled from the EU, could pursue. But other than new deals with Australia and New Zealand, <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9314/">progress has been slow on that front</a>. Johnson and Truss both promised a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/sep/21/britains-hopes-of-early-post-brexit-trade-deal-with-us-appear-dashed">new free trade deal</a> with the United States as a benefit of Brexit, but badly <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8f229e15-9842-46ce-a828-19647a48f6d6">misjudged the changing mood in Washington</a>, where both the Republicans and Democrats have taken a turn toward protectionism.&nbsp;(Credit where it’s due: Johnson did get the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-58654045">US to lift a ban</a> on the imports of British lamb.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More than 60 percent of British voters, including more than a third of “Leave” voters, now say Brexit has been <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/45733-most-britons-say-brexit-has-been-more-failure">more of a failure than a success</a>. But the damage is done.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Not-so-global Britain</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The reality is that far from broadening Britain’s horizons, Brexit has forced it to confront what it really is: a mid-sized country with a mid-sized economy that has a mid-sized influence on the world.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Asked what role foreign policy and national security have played in this election, Nick Witney, a former British diplomat and defense official now with the European Council on Foreign Relations, told Vox, “Not much, because&nbsp; we don&#8217;t have much of a foreign or defense policy at the moment. And there&#8217;s going to be no money available to buy ourselves one for a number of years under new government.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, for all Johnson’s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3de0d68a-9df9-11e7-8cd4-932067fbf946">talk</a> of a “global Britain” recovering its “buccaneering” spirit, the UK cuts a more modest profile on the world stage today than it did when Conservatives took over. London has cut funding to the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/the-incredible-shrinking-global-britain/">foreign office</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/10/25/boris-johnson-likes-tout-global-britain-he-may-be-its-biggest-enemy/">foreign aid</a>, and one of the country’s most significant soft power assets: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/dec/03/rishi-sunak-says-bbc-cuts-welcome-cost-of-living-crisis">the BBC</a>. Defense spending<a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2024/04/the-uk-is-boosting-defence-spending-but-will-it-boost.html"> has increased</a> since Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine but the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/british-army-armed-forces-ukraine-b2482059.html">size of the military in terms of manpower</a> has shrunk. A last-ditch <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/355547/soldiers-shortage-demographics-population-conscription">campaign proposal by Sunak</a> to mandate national service for 18-year-olds did not go over well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“No one talks about ‘global Britain’ anymore,” said Witney. “It’s extraordinary how our horizons have shrunk. If you go back 20 years, there was practically not a sparrow that fell anywhere around the globe where the British didn&#8217;t feel they would have something to say about it. Nowadays, we are an impoverished and ultimately less ambitious country.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One very notable exception has been the war in Ukraine, where the UK has been a significant provider of military aid, training, and economic support — often taking a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-us-and-uk-are-split-on-the-ukraine-war-weapons-russia-oligarchs-churchill-8540ef60">more aggressive stance</a> than the US on providing new weapons systems and capabilities to the Ukrainians. Johnson may be persona non grata in British politics right now, but there are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-town-names-street-after-boris-johnson-2022-5">streets named after him in Ukraine</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s next?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Probably due in part to the fact that the result wasn&#8217;t in doubt, the election itself was heavily dominated by gaffes and scandals, including Sunak’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/07/rishi-sunak-d-day-blunder-uk-election#:~:text=Britain's%20clearly%20wounded%20prime%20minister,at%20the%20American%20cemetery%20off">ill-advised decision</a> to leave D-Day commemorations in France early and the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/6/27/why-are-uk-politicians-in-trouble-for-placing-bets-on-election-date">revelations</a> that candidates in both parties have been betting on the election.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also true that compared to figures like Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair, or even David Cameron — all of whom came into power in landscape-shifting change elections — Starmer isn’t exactly promising radical change. Starmer has managed to stabilize his party after the politically disastrous Corbyn years, and — perhaps not surprisingly given that he entered the race with a huge lead — he ran on a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyxx1lq50nlo">relatively modest policy platform</a>. It’s too modest for some allies, who accuse of him of “<a href="https://news.sky.com/story/keir-starmers-labour-has-been-too-timid-and-must-not-settle-for-limping-into-no-10-says-unites-sharon-graham-12979396">limping into No. 10</a>,”&nbsp; while the party also <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/uk-election-starmer-labour-party-accused-purging-left-wing-candidates-rcna154624">angered progressives</a> by barring several left-wing candidates, including two women of color, in the run-up to the election.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It would be a stretch to say voters seemed inspired by Labour&#8217;s message. The party won a lower share of the national vote than they did in 2017, when Theresa May defeated Jeremy Corbyn, but benefited from the UK&#8217;s &#8220;first-past-the-post&#8221; election system and Tory defections to other parties. The Conservatives lost this election more than Labour won it. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though the party opposed Brexit during the referendum, Labour <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/266d8501-1c60-4afa-963b-c82757b5e3da">does not plan to try to rejoin the European Union</a>. Ahmet Kaya, an economist with the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, told Vox that wouldn’t really be practical in the near term anyway, and that the focus should be on negotiations with Europe aimed at “reducing the barriers on trade and facilitating some of the free movement of people,” particularly students. Steps like these, he said, could “reduce the overall negative impact of Brexit.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There won’t be a huge shift on foreign policy either. Unlike in the US, support for Ukraine is pretty bipartisan in the UK. In the wake of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_of_Sergei_and_Yulia_Skripal">poisoning of a former Russian spy</a> and his daughter on British soil in 2018 as well a flurry of coverage of how Russian oligarchs have <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-62410715">manipulated the British financial system</a>, there’s little pro-Russian sympathy in the UK, though Farage recently <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c722pn07w99o">caused a media uproar</a> with remarks suggesting NATO was partly to blame for the invasion of Ukraine. Starmer has also <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67213191">taken some criticism</a> from Muslim Labour supporters over being slow to call for a ceasefire in Gaza. This hasn’t mattered much for his election chances, but his choices on this and other contentious issues are going to get a lot tougher when he’s actually in power.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Above all else, Starmer will face the challenge of overcoming the perceptions built up during the past decade. “Brexit has kind of defined how the UK is perceived internationally by many of our partners,” Evie Aspinall, director of the British Foreign Policy Group, told Vox. “We’re seen as a more isolated nation than we were prior to Brexit.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are some parallels here with the Biden administration, which came into office promising allies that “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/02/04/remarks-by-president-biden-on-americas-place-in-the-world/">America is back</a>” following the isolation of the Trump years. As with the Democrats in 2020, Labour has gone with a broadly popular — if somewhat dull — candidate, whose promise is that he can turn down the political temperature after a period of chaos and upheaval. It may not be enough to get them another 13 or 14 year stint in power, but it was enough for this week.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The United Kingdom’s left-leaning Labour Party won —&nbsp;and won big —&nbsp;in the country’s national elections on Thursday, returning to power after 14 years of Conservative Party leadership.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Labour made many promises in the party’s quest to win the race, and keeping them will be a gargantuan task that will require tackling Britain’s biggest issues including the cost of living, immigration, and rebuilding the country’s services like the health and transportation systems. A mixture of poor policy and world events outside the government’s control has left the UK’s&nbsp;economy struggling, translating to wage stagnation and lack of investment in state services.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The party’s exact approach to those issues is still coalescing as the party gets a sense of how it will wield its newfound power.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After a truly chaotic spin through three Conservative prime ministers in just under four months, Labour’s message of stability has resonated with the electorate as they voted in Labour members for a majority of the 650 House of Commons seats, making its leader, Keir Starmer, prime minister.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Starmer is a bit of a cypher, his platform this campaign has often been vague or unexciting, and the British public is decidedly <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/uk-general-election-keir-starmer-labour-party-prime-minister-sunak-rcna157473">lukewarm</a> on him as a figure. But he’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/03/general-election-labour-winning-keir-starmer-historic-victory-opposition-leader">successfully rehabilitated</a> the Labour Party’s image with more moderate voters, and, above all, what he has going for him is that he isn’t a Conservative.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“[Conservatives are] suffering from having been in power for 14 years,” <a href="https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/people/profiles/ben-ansell/">Ben Ansell</a>, professor of comparative democratic institutions at Nuffield College, Oxford, told Vox. “And it’s very, very hard at that point to win another election anywhere.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Labour’s campaign slogan is simple: “Change.” But now it won’t be enough to simply be the alternative to the Conservatives; Labour must actually deliver on the main policy issues people are concerned about in order to create the stable government it needs to stay in power.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Britain’s big issues and how Labour plans to address them</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Britain’s multiple overlapping crises developed over years, and they won’t be instantly solved just by a change in leadership.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Take the UK’s battered public services. When the Conservatives (also known as the Tories) came to power in 2010 under current Foreign Minister David Cameron, the world was reeling from the 2008 financial crisis. The UK was particularly hard-hit, with much of its economy based in the financial sector.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To dig the country out of dire financial straits, Cameron’s government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/10/how-austerity-and-ideology-broke-britain">decided to disinvest in social services</a> like the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/05/austerity-has-led-to-nhs-quality-of-care-deteriorating-across-the-board-study-finds#:~:text=11%20months%20old-,Austerity%20has%20led%20to%20NHS%20quality%20of,in%20key%20areas%2C%20study%20finds&amp;text=The%20quality%20of%20care%20that,more%20common%2C%20research%20has%20found.">national health service</a> (NHS), education, and transit, particularly the railways. That choice still reverberates today, and has meant long waits to see doctors, crumbling public schools, wage stagnation in the care and state services sectors and, accordingly, labor strikes to protest working conditions and pay.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And though the economic and cost of living crisis is not unique to the UK, some Tory decisions have made its situation uniquely challenging. The choice to leave the European Union, first decided in a referendum in 2016 and pushed through by Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson in 2019, has had detrimental effects to trade, employment, and the cost of living. <a href="https://www.niesr.ac.uk/publications/revisiting-effect-brexit?type=global-economic-outlook-topical-feature">One independent analysis estimated</a> that the UK’s real GDP is about 2 to 3 percent lower today than it would be if it had stayed in the EU. The <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/overview/survey-results/daily/2024/06/12/69919/1">decision to leave the EU is now deeply unpopular</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Tories have overseen “singularly the worst economic performance of any decade in Britain since the Napoleonic era,” Ansell said, making Labour’s promised change —&nbsp;ambiguous though it is — attractive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Scandals and policy flip-flops didn’t help Conservatives either. <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/7/7/23198063/boris-johnson-prime-minister-resigns">Johnson fell from grace</a> following a series of scandals known as Partygate, in which he allowed or participated in social gatherings during the Covid-19 pandemic, while the rest of the country was in lockdown. Following his <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/6/10/23756380/boris-johnson-resign-tory-party-sunak-next-dorries-adams">2022 ouster</a>, Liz Truss — Johnson’s foreign secretary — won leadership of the party and the country. She lasted all of 44 days following her proposal to cut taxes on corporations and the ultra-wealthy that was so disastrous it threw <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66897881">global bond markets into panic</a> for weeks. Current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak followed her, positioning himself as the adult in the room who could set things straight.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But his signature policy position has been to “stop the boats,” referring to the surge in irregular migration via small boats crossing the English Channel from Europe. To do that, his government has pursued a policy to detain and deport irregular migrants to Rwanda. In addition to effectively violating the right to asylum, the plan has been ineffective; no one has been sent to Rwanda, although some migrants have been detained under the scheme, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/sep/19/cost-housing-asylum-seekers-hotels-rise-home-office">costing the government an estimated 8 million pounds per day</a>. It’s also worth noting: migrants seeking asylum make up <a href="https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN01403/SN01403.pdf">only about 11 percent of Britain’s migrant</a> population.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And though migration overall <a href="https://www.brunel.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/articles/Post-Brexit-UK-migration-trends-and-the-all-time-highs#:~:text=Contrary%20to%20expectations%2C%20the%20new,double%20this%20amount%2C%20totalling%20333%2C000.">was at an all-time high in 2022</a>, much of the electorate doesn’t actually see migration <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/society/trackers/the-most-important-issues-facing-the-country-full">as one of their top three issues</a> —&nbsp;and people’s feelings about migration are <a href="https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/uk-public-opinion-toward-immigration-overall-attitudes-and-level-of-concern/#:~:text=Public%20opinion%20on%20migration%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20is%20divided&amp;text=In%20April%202023%2C%2032%25%20thought,lot)%20(Figure%201).">highly fractured</a>. In a sense, the Tory government suffered from a crisis of its own making with the Rwanda policy and the Illegal Migration Act —&nbsp;instituting draconian policies that haven’t been successful and that voters see as costly.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of this dysfunction culminated in the Tories’ defeat. (Heading into the election, <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/06/27/keir-starmer-should-be-britains-next-prime-minister">the Economist even endorsed Labour for the first time in almost two decades</a>.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Labour’s signature achievements in the post-World War II era have been forming the NHS and instituting a national minimum wage. Now, the party has to tackle three overlapping marquee issues: the economy and cost of living; struggling government services; and migration policy. But, as outlined in its <a href="https://labour.org.uk/updates/stories/labour-manifesto-2024-sign-up/">election manifesto</a>, Labour’s policy suggestions aren’t terribly specific or fleshed out in most cases. In the short term, the party is likely to focus on trying to create a stable government to prove it should maintain power.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the short term Starmer and Labour have promised to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68984778">undo the Rwanda policy immediately</a> on gaining power, focusing on the human smuggling groups that operate and profit from the dangerous boat crossings. Labour says the government <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2q0rvgv25xo">will again allow irregular migrants to apply for asylum</a>, and has promised to sort through the backlog of asylum cases which have not been processed due to the Illegal Migration Act.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As for the economy, Labour has promised to <a href="https://labour.org.uk/change/kickstart-economic-growth/#industrial-strategy">invest in industry and create a pro-business environment,</a> without outlining what that means specifically. In terms of managing the cost of living crisis, Labour could increase the minimum wage or encourage cities to adopt “living wages,” <a href="https://www.oxford.gov.uk/fairer-economy/oxford-living-wage#:~:text=Oxford%20Living%20Wage%20Overview,by%20the%20Living%20Wage%20Foundation.">as Oxford has</a>, a localized norm that recognizes the different cost of living in different areas.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Labour will opt to “improve the UK’s trade and investment relationship with the EU, by tearing down unnecessary barriers to trade,” though it will not rejoin the EU or the common market. Negotiating agreements about agriculture and livestock aim to bring down food costs, and professional services agreements will help UK professionals work in EU countries.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Labour has also promised to “<a href="https://labour.org.uk/change/build-an-nhs-fit-for-the-future/">save the NHS</a>” and build a health service for the future. But that will require public investment, as Starmer’s party has promised the service will always be publicly funded. That means money from somewhere, and raising individual taxes right now isn’t an appealing option given the economic challenges facing many voters. In the short term, Labour promises to reduce wait times, enlist the private sector to help deal with high volume, and improve relations with the health care unions.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">But can Labour deliver —&nbsp;and maintain power?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How exactly Labour plans to accomplish their goals is an open question. Labour doesn’t really have a strong, bold new policy regarding the economy; there isn’t a big, splashy ideological framework.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And on one of the major factors dragging Britain’s economy down — Brexit — Labour plans to negotiate agreements about agriculture and livestock with the EU to bring down food costs, and hopes to make professional services agreements that will help UK professionals work in EU countries. Still, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/jun/22/starmer-growth-plan-doomed-access-eu-markets-economists">many of the economic pains of Brexit may remain</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And on migration, other than scrapping the Rwanda plan, there’s not too much daylight between Labour and the Tories.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The current government already has quite a large focus on enforcement,” <a href="https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/about/people/ben-brindle/">Ben Brindle</a>, a researcher at the Oxford Migration Observatory, told Vox. Labour’s approach is “still doing many of the things which the current enforcement operation is already doing” to deter irregular migration. And when it comes to migration for students and skilled labor, net migration is likely to go down anyway due to policies already in place, rather than anything Labour is actually doing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Labour does have <a href="https://labour.org.uk/change/kickstart-economic-growth/#get-britain-building-again">proposals on hand to address the housing</a> and transit crises —&nbsp;including by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-20/starmer-s-labour-eyes-blitz-of-uk-planning-reforms-within-weeks?sref=qYiz2hd0">loosening up building restrictions</a> in the immediate term&nbsp;so that new housing, infrastructure, and transit services can actually be built, which could help stimulate the economy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We’re using a planning regime that was created in 1948, that is incredibly stringent, and means that we’re just not building things anywhere,” Ansell said. “We have a housing crisis. We have a transportation crisis, and we have a public infrastructure crisis and an energy crisis — it’s all because we can’t build stuff. That gives [Labour] a narrative. It also gives businesses the expectation that actually there’s going to be loads and loads of infrastructure or investment and probably over quite a period of time.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, though, Labour sees building a stable government, especially after the years of uncertainty post-Brexit, as a useful framing — but potentially a part of its mandate. The party’s manifesto is built around the idea that it “can stop the chaos” which has helped exacerbate external problems into national crises when it is in power.</p>

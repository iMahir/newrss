<p class="has-text-align-none">Kamala Harris lost the presidential election and Democrats lost control of the Senate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But when you zoom in on the details of that result, there’s a striking pattern: Democratic Senate candidates are outperforming Harris. Or, put another way, Republican Senate candidates are doing worse than Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent years, the outcome of a state’s US Senate race has increasingly matched the outcome of its simultaneous presidential race. <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/17/13666192/voting-congress-presidency">Ticket-splitting</a> has decreased in our era of polarization and partisanship. The vast majority of people voting for a presidential candidate also vote for their party’s Senate candidate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But not everyone does that. And there’s still some variation in how much better or worse Senate candidates do compared to the top of the ticket. Looking at that variation can provide clues about what sorts of candidates overperform (even if they don’t actually win).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It can also help shape our understanding of national trends. Was there a nationwide backlash against all Democrats? Or was the backlash mostly limited to the presidential candidate?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2020, Republican Senate candidates overperformed Trump in <a href="https://x.com/awprokop/status/1324406190533738497">most swing states</a>, suggesting that Trump was a drag on the GOP. This year, Democratic Senate candidates overperformed Harris in almost every key race — though often it wasn’t by enough for Democrats to win.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s how the Senate candidates in key races performed compared to Harris. The counts aren’t yet finalized so the margins are subject to change, but this is <a href="https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2024/">how things looked</a> as of early Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nebraska</strong>: Independent Dan Osborn’s vote share is about 7 points higher than Harris, but he lost.</li>



<li><strong>Montana</strong>: Sen. Jon Tester’s vote share is also about 7 points higher than Harris. He also lost.</li>



<li><strong>Ohio:</strong> Sen. Sherrod Brown’s vote share is about 4 points higher than Harris. He lost.</li>



<li><strong>Arizona</strong>: Rep. Ruben Gallego’s vote share is about 4 points higher than Harris and he’s currently leading even though Harris seems on track to lose there.</li>



<li><strong>Texas</strong>: Rep. Colin Allred’s vote share is about 3 points higher than Harris, but he failed to unseat Sen. Ted Cruz.</li>



<li><strong>Nevada</strong>: Sen. Jacky Rosen’s vote share was about 2 points higher than Harris. Her race is too close to call.</li>



<li><strong>Wisconsin: </strong>Sen. Tammy Baldwin’s vote share was less than 1 point higher than Harris’s, but Baldwin defeated her challenger, Eric Hovde, while Harris lost the state.</li>



<li><strong>Michigan and Pennsylvania</strong>: Both Democratic Senate candidates in these states (Rep. Elissa Slotkin and incumbent Sen. Bob Casey) have vote shares about 1 point higher than Harris’s. Neither race has been called.</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The pattern was also evident in less competitive races like Minnesota, New Mexico, New Jersey, and Virginia, where Democratic Senate candidates outperformed Harris.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One notable exception to Tuesday’s down-ballot overperformance trend was Florida, where Debbie Mucarsel-Powell did about the same as Harris (and lost). There’s also Maryland, where Angela Alsobrooks won but did significantly worse than Harris — but that has an obvious explanation in that the state’s popular former governor, Larry Hogan, was the Republican Senate nominee (though his popularity wasn’t enough to power him to a win in an otherwise blue state).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So why were there so many voters casting their ballots for Trump and Democratic Senate candidates?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some might argue for racism or sexism explaining Harris’s struggles, but I’d note that several of the Democratic candidates who overperformed Harris were nonwhite or female. Others might argue that she was a uniquely flawed candidate or campaigner, but President Joe Biden was on track to do much worse if he’d stayed in the race.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">My suspicion is that Harris’s electoral struggles were more about Biden’s unpopularity and her association with his administration than any newfound love of the American public for the Republican Party generally. (This is also reflected in the House of Representatives contest currently looking <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-house.html">somewhat close</a> and in Democratic success at the state level in <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/raleigh/2024/11/06/nc-democrats-break-gop-legislative-supermajority">places like North Carolina</a>.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Call them the “I don’t like Republicans much, but the economy was better under Trump” voters. Biden lost them, and Harris failed to get them back.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 1992, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/11/2/17983746/year-of-the-woman-1992">voters sent a record number of women to Congress</a>, leading the media and political scientists to call it the “Year of the Woman.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When the final votes are counted in the 2024 election, we might have a new way of referring to the 2024 election: The Year of the Man.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President-elect Donald Trump <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/exit-polls-2024-men-women-voting-key-swing/story?id=115529817" data-type="link" data-id="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/exit-polls-2024-men-women-voting-key-swing/story?id=115529817">won men by 10 points this year</a>, according to early exit polls, a result that could change once the final votes are tallied. Vice President Kamala Harris, meanwhile, seemed to win women by 10 points — but if the exit polls are correct, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/politics/2020-2016-exit-polls-2024-dg/">she lost ground with women compared to Biden’s 2020 results</a>. The exit polls also suggest a rightward shift for <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/election/2024/exit-polls/national-results/general/president/20">Latino men</a>. In marshaling men’s votes, and holding on to a slim majority of white women, Trump was able to overcome his weaknesses with the broader swath of female voters and build a dominant lead, allowing him to decisively capture the presidency. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Exit polls are notoriously unreliable, and it will likely be days before we have a clear sense of how Trump won. But there’s no denying that Trump tailored his campaign to appeal to men. Trump spent the months leading up to Election Day engaging in <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/09/trump-bro-vote-hawk-tuah-girl-00183129">intense outreach to male voters,</a> appearing on podcasts and doing interviews with influential media figures like <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/380008/harris-trump-podcast-interviews-appearances-joe-rogan-shannon-sharpe-theo-von-call-her-daddy-flagrant">Joe Rogan</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/380008/harris-trump-podcast-interviews-appearances-joe-rogan-shannon-sharpe-theo-von-call-her-daddy-flagrant">Logan Paul,</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/368563/theo-von-trump-interview-podcast">Theo Von</a>. He portrayed himself as a strong leader capable of restoring the nation’s lost glory — returning it, in other words, to a time when men were undisputedly at the top of the social hierarchy. After a man <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/371981/trump-shooting-ryan-wesley-routh-golf-club">attempted to assassinate</a> the former president at a rally this summer in Pennsylvania, Trump stood defiantly with blood on his face and his fist raised in the air, projecting an air of strength that was praised as <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/360711/trump-fist-pump-photo-explained-expert-media-savvy-politics">iconic</a>. Throughout the campaign, Trump demonstrated the aggressiveness that has defined his life in the public arena, relentlessly attacking his Democratic opposition, the media, and anyone he deemed insufficiently supportive. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump specifically sought to get <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/us/politics/donald-trump-young-men.html">young men of all races</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/30/opinion/gender-education-gap.html">men without a college education</a> to the polls. It was a risky strategy because the voters Trump was seeking have historically been among the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-hunts-elusive-2024-election-prize-infrequent-voters-2024-09-09/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-hunts-elusive-2024-election-prize-infrequent-voters-2024-09-09/">most difficult to mobilize</a>. But in appealing to them, Trump hoped to pull off another win <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/upshot/why-trump-won-working-class-whites.html">similar to that of 2016</a>, when he won men by 11 points. In 2020, Biden was able to defeat Trump in part by erasing his large advantage with <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/">male voters.</a> This year, it seems, Trump won men back.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are many reasons why male voters have been dissatisfied in recent years and might have been receptive to his messaging. Inflation has made the cost of living <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/09/why-more-americans-are-struggling-even-as-inflation-cools.html">painful for millions of people</a> post-pandemic. Men are <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/boys-left-behind-education-gender-gaps-across-the-us/">falling behind women in education</a>. Their wages are<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/11/04/1133586707/boys-men-labor-force-jobs-gender-gap-workforce"> stagnating</a> or declining as women’s wages grow, and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/21/why-more-men-are-dropping-out-of-the-workforce.html">fewer of them</a> are working. They are struggling with an <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/01/01/why-men-are-lonelier-in-america-than-elsewhere?utm_medium=cpc.adword.pd&amp;utm_source=google&amp;ppccampaignID=18151738051&amp;ppcadID=&amp;utm_campaign=a.22brand_pmax&amp;utm_content=conversion.direct-response.anonymous&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAxKy5BhBbEiwAYiW--1KIlPZ7kQLGxTAZAqP3a1sDZF_CIJWjBZE4KG4Xq77D2MihvaaOaBoCKWcQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">epidemic of loneliness</a> that doesn’t seem to be affecting women the same way. Feminism has gone mainstream, making some men feel like they aren’t as valued.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What lessons should women take from this election? The polls leading up to the election showed a <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380132/gender-gap-election-harris-trump">massive gender gap</a>, with women preferring Kamala Harris by double digits and men preferring Donald Trump by the same. Since 1980, female voters have preferred Democrats, and in general, <a href="https://cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/voters/gender-differences-voter-turnout">they have registered and voted in greater numbers than men</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s struggles with women were largely of his own creation. As a candidate in 2016, he was <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/11/3/21544482/trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations">accused by multiple women of sexual assault</a>, and was <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/10/7/13205842/trump-secret-recording-women">caught on tape</a> bragging about sexual assault. It wasn’t enough to dissuade voters from electing him. As president, he appointed the Supreme Court justices who helped <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-was-able-kill-roe-v-wade-rcna84897">overturn federally protected abortion rights</a>. Now, there are abortion bans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/abortion-laws-roe-v-wade.html">in more than 20</a> US states, including some that don’t make an exception for victims of rape and incest. Last year, Trump was found <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-rape-carroll-trial-fe68259a4b98bb3947d42af9ec83d7db" data-type="link" data-id="https://apnews.com/article/trump-rape-carroll-trial-fe68259a4b98bb3947d42af9ec83d7db">legally liable </a><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/07/19/trump-carroll-judge-rape/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/07/19/trump-carroll-judge-rape/">for rape.</a> He has repeatedly criticized women he doesn’t like, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/trump-nancy-pelosi-liz-cheney-women.html">including Kamala Harris and Rep. Nancy Pelosi</a>, in crude, sexist, and vulgar terms. In the days leading up to the election, recordings of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/382550/jeffrey-epstein-tapes-donald-trump-friendship">convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein calling Trump his closest friend</a> became public.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of it was enough to convince voters not to give him another shot at the most important job in the country. It seems that his winning coalition included white women, a majority of whom voted for Donald Trump in 2024, according to exit polls, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/">just as they did four years ago</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For a very real moment, it looked as though female voters, as a broader, multiracial group, might help send a Democrat to the White House, like they did in 2020.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the end, it wasn’t enough. American voters have now twice chosen Trump over eminently qualified women.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The last time Trump won, women took to the streets in a historic protest. In the next election cycle, the United States <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/7/18024742/midterm-results-record-women-win">elected more women to Congress than ever before</a>. That helped pave the way for a new generation of women leaders, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/us/elections/female-candidates-president.html">the six women who ran for president as Democrats</a> in 2020. It’s possible that will happen again.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, it will take several more days to tally the final votes, and figure out what they mean. But one conclusion seems obvious. Donald Trump ran a campaign geared toward dissatisfied men. It worked.&nbsp;</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">President-elect Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 election was powered by a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382807/trump-leading-harris-2024-electoral-college">remarkably consistent nationwide trend</a> of voters turning against the Democratic ticket. Vice President Kamala Harris performed worse than President Joe Biden did in 2020 nearly everywhere: in big cities and rural areas, in blue states and red ones.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most of the conventional explanations for why a campaign fails —&nbsp;things like messaging choices, or whether candidates campaigned enough in the right places — <a href="https://goodauthority.org/news/where-to-start-to-explain-trumps-win/">cannot account for such a sweeping shift</a>. Such factors matter on the margins and among specific demographic groups, but Harris received a decisive, across-the-board rebuke.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To explain what truly happened, we need to look at global trends as a point of comparison. And when we do, a clear picture emerges: What happened on Tuesday is part of a worldwide wave of anti-incumbent sentiment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">2024 was the largest year of elections in global history; more people voted this year than ever before. And across the world, voters told the party in power —&nbsp;regardless of their ideology or history — that it was time for a change.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We saw this anti-incumbent wave in elections in the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/359363/uk-french-election-results-2024-britain-england-france-biden">United Kingdom</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/botswanas-ruling-party-loses-its-majority-this-weeks-election-mmegi-newspaper-2024-11-01/">Botswana</a>; in <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/353785/india-election-2024-modi-bjp">India</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/north-macedonia-parliament-approves-new-nationalist-dominated-government-2024-06-23/">North Macedonia</a>; and in <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/south-koreas-2024-general-election-results-and-implications">South Korea</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/355328/south-africa-apartheid-cyril-ramaphosa-anc-jacob-zuma-mk-elecitons-parliament">South Africa</a>. It continued a global trend begun in the previous year, when voters in <a href="https://protectdemocracy.org/work/poland-democracy-wins/">Poland</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/12/17/24003970/argentina-president-javier-milei">Argentina</a> opted to move on from current leadership. The handful of 2024 exceptions to this general rule look like true outliers: The incumbent party’s victory in Mexico, for example, came after <a href="https://apnews.com/article/global-elections-2024-democracy-polarization-unhappy-719d47908aca0b421ff3b9bef33e350c">20 straight defeats for incumbents across Latin America</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given Trump’s victory, we can confidently say the United States is not exceptional. Three different <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/2024-exit-polls-fears-american-democracy-economic-discontent/story?id=115529546">exit polls</a> found that at least <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/exit-poll-results-72-americans-unhappy-way-us-going-1980904">70 percent</a> of Americans were <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/05/us-news/election-exit-poll-seven-in-10-voters-say-us-going-in-wrong-direction/">dissatisfied</a> with the country’s current direction, and they took it out on the current ruling party. (While exit polls are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/exit-polls-election.html?unlocked_article_code=1.X04.ZwKX.5orIonRhVE1e&amp;smid=url-share">based on preliminary, rather than comprehensive, data</a> sets, it is notable that so many polls appear to be picking up on the same trend.) Trump registered as the change candidate despite being a former president himself, and the voters rewarded him accordingly.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Once we start thinking about the US election result as part of a global trend, rather than an isolated event, we can start to make a little more sense of what just happened here.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why you can’t understand Trump’s victory without the global trend</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Reading the American press today, you see a lot of focus on granular campaign choices. Did Harris lose because she <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14048557/Democratic-Party-blame-game-Kamala-Harris-election-loss-Joe-Biden-Tim-Walz.html">picked the wrong vice president</a>? Emphasized <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380750/harris-trump-closing-message-fascism-democracy-authoritarianism">the wrong issues</a>? Targeted <a href="https://jacobin.com/2024/11/harris-trump-election-messaging-populism-elites">the wrong kinds of voters</a>? Appeared on <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/kamala-harris-election-loss-joe-rogan-podcast/">the wrong kind of media</a>?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps one of these theories will prove to have merit. We don’t have enough data yet to be sure. But if the story were fundamentally about messaging or targeting, you’d expect her to improve on Biden’s total in some places and do worse in others. The problem is that none of them on their own can explain a truly uniform shift across the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can’t explain Harris’s defeat in terms of losses with the white working class when she also seems to have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ap-votecast-trump-harris-election-president-voters-86225516e8424431ab1d19e57a74f198">done worse than Biden with nonwhite workers and college graduates based on early data</a>. You can&#8217;t focus primarily on her stance on Gaza alienating Arab and Muslim voters when her margin of defeat was far larger than the defections in that group. Ditto with Latinos, and every other subgroup that postmortems are beginning to focus on.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Uniform swings call for uniform explanations. And the most plausible one, given global context, is anti-incumbency.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The central plot lines of the [2024 election] are already clear, and not that dissimilar from four years ago,” the political scientist <a href="https://goodauthority.org/news/where-to-start-to-explain-trumps-win/">John Sides writes at Good Authority</a>. “In 2020, an unpopular incumbent lost reelection. In 2024, an unpopular incumbent’s party lost reelection.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such an explanation makes more sense than a pure focus on ideology. In fact, the global context suggests that a Republican president likely would have also performed poorly if they were in office. While some right-wing insurgents have performed well in the past two years, most notably Javier Milei in Argentina, right-wing incumbents have often underperformed —&nbsp;with ruling conservative parties in Britain, India, and Poland all suffering notable setbacks.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If we are indeed seeing America fall in line with the global pattern, it clarifies some of what just happened. But it also raises a new, difficult question: Why are people so<em> </em>dissatisfied with their governments at this particular point in time?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One credible answer is inflation. Countries around the world experienced rising prices after the Covid-19 pandemic and attendant global supply chain disruptions, and <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2024/06/two-studies-explore-americans-perception-of-inflation/">voters hate inflation</a>. Even though the inflation rate has gone down in quite a few places, including the United States, prices remain much higher than they were prior to the pandemic. People remember the low prices they’ve lost, and they are hurting —&nbsp;hurting enough that they see <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/11/3-reasons-bidens-strong-economy-is-unpopular.html">an otherwise-booming economy as a failure</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As much sense as the inflation story makes, it remains an unproven one. We’ll need a lot more evidence, including detailed data on the US election that isn’t available yet, to be sure whether it’s right.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But we can be fairly confident, given reams of polling data showing Americans were dissatisfied with the country’s direction, that a desire for a change in leadership played at least some role in Trump’s return to power — part of a global trend away from stability and toward upheaval, however chaotic or even dangerous it will prove to be.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now that it is clear Donald Trump will become president again and will have a Republican Senate and almost certainly a Republican House to back him, it’s important to ask: What will he do with these majorities? And given <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/presidents-2021-budget-would-cut-food-assistance-for-millions-and-radically-restructure">his track record last time</a>, what will it mean for poor Americans and the programs they rely on?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The last time Trump won the presidency, in 2016, I <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/22/13641654/paul-ryan-trump-poverty-safety-net">wrote a piece predicting</a> a huge rollback of the safety net. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), with its massive expansion of Medicaid and patient protections, would be repealed; Medicaid itself would see its funding slashed and its guarantee of coverage to poor people eliminated; food stamps would be cut deep and maybe turned over to the states, much as <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/6/20/11789988/clintons-welfare-reform">welfare for single parents was in 1996</a>, largely destroying that program.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I was wrong. Trump, and especially then-House Speaker Paul Ryan, did try to <a href="https://www.crfb.org/papers/president-trumps-full-fy-2018-budget">do all of that</a>, but in the end <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/31/16055960/why-obamacare-repeal-failed">enough Republicans realized</a> repealing the ACA wasn’t viable. Medicaid and food stamps survived more or less intact. A Democratic House after the 2018 midterms and, more importantly, a global pandemic, meant that by 2020, the safety net was <a href="https://www.vox.com/22348364/united-states-stimulus-covid-coronavirus">significantly stronger</a> than in 2016.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I do not know that the same scenario will play out in 2025, and I certainly hope the pandemic part does not repeat. But despite the devastating electoral blow to Democrats, there are reasons for safety net supporters to be optimistic.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Senate is solidly Republican but not a total blowout, and four defections would be enough for a bill to fail. With Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, who <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/28/16054700/senate-obamacare-repeal-john-mccain-susan-collins-lisa-murkowski">opposed Obamacare repeal in 2017</a>, still in the chamber, it’s not difficult to imagine them and two allies blocking serious changes again.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The House results will not be known exactly for weeks but look, if anything, closer. And while House Speaker Mike Johnson <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/speaker-johnson-criticizes-obamacare-promises-massive-reform-trump-win-rcna177853">surely wants to slash the safety net</a>, he is not Ryan. Shrinking government is not his all-consuming passion the way it was for 2017’s House speaker, who once famously said he <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/3/17/14960358/paul-ryan-medicaid-keg">dreamed of cutting Medicaid while drinking out of kegs</a> as a college student.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s what Republicans might attempt to do to safety net programs, and why achieving it might be difficult.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Health care programs will shrink, but serious cuts will be challenging to pass</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On health care, Republicans have one victory that’s more or less baked in. As part of the 2021 stimulus package, Joe Biden and the Democratic Congress adopted <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22360870/american-rescue-plan-act-premium-tax-credit-health-insurance">expanded subsidies for the ACA’s marketplaces</a>. If you were an individual or small business buying private insurance, the tax credits you received to offset premiums were larger. Subsidies were no longer cut off for people making over 400 percent of the poverty line (about <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines">$125,000 for a family of four</a>), and subsidies for people below that were made more generous. These provisions were later extended through the end of 2025 as part of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/7/28/23282217/climate-bill-health-care-drugs-inflation-reduction-act">Inflation Reduction Act</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s hard to imagine a Republican Congress voting to extend these measures past next year, though insurance companies will certainly <a href="https://www.ahip.org/news/press-releases/extending-individual-market-subsidies-will-provide-much-needed-relief-for-hardworking-american-families">lobby</a> for it. Trump’s past budgets have also <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55958#:~:text=repeal%20subsidies%20for%20health%20insurance%20coverage%20purchased%20through%20the%20marketplaces%20established%20by%20the%20ACA">zeroed out</a> subsidies for private health insurance entirely, which would be a much larger shift.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But subsidies for private insurance are a relatively small part of federal spending on health care. <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/topics/health-care#:~:text=PROJECTIONS%20FOR%20MAJOR%20HEALTH%20CARE%20PROGRAMS%20FOR%20FY%202024">This fiscal year</a>, they amount to $125 billion —&nbsp;very significant, but piddling next to $858 billion on Medicare and $607 billion on Medicaid.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/aug/07/kamala-harris/kamala-harris-says-donald-trump-intends-to-cut-med/#:~:text=%22fight%20for%20and%20protect%20Social%20Security%20and%20Medicare%20with%20no%20cuts.%22">promised not to cut Medicare</a>, much as he did in <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/25/14376014/trump-social-security-medicare-mulvaney">2016</a>, and while his budgets as president did envision spending reductions, they were <a href="https://www.crfb.org/blogs/q-did-trump-propose-deep-medicare-cuts-no">mostly minor</a> and came from cutting provider payments rather than limiting eligibility.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He did, repeatedly and explicitly, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/trump-administration-budgets-and-programs-for-people-of-limited-means/#medicaid-aca">propose cutting Medicaid</a>. The most recent Trump budget to explicitly lay out its plans, for fiscal year 2020, entailed at least $1.1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and the ACA over a decade, per the <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55958#:~:text=Reduce%20Federal%20Spending%20for%20Health%20Care">Congressional Budget Office</a> (CBO). At that time, the agency was <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2019-05/55151-budget_update_0.pdf#page=16">projecting</a> $6.2 trillion in 10-year spending on non-Medicare health programs, meaning Trump was calling for a cut of over 17 percent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump waffled on how clear he wanted to be in calling for Medicaid cuts. His 2021 budget was <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56301#:~:text=Finally%2C%20some%20of,care%20system.4">too vague</a> for the CBO to even model. But when he was clear, the proposals had three steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Repeal the ACA&#8217;s Medicaid coverage expansion and replace it with a “block grant” for states to spend how they like on health programs.</li>



<li>Place a “per capita cap” on the rest of Medicaid, meaning states would only be granted a set amount per covered person by the federal government, regardless of what health care they actually received.</li>



<li>Impose a work requirement, specifically to “require able-bodied, working-age individuals to find employment, train for work, or volunteer” in order to receive Medicaid.</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What unites these proposals, especially the per-capita cap and block grant, is that they mean Congress and the White House don’t have to make granular decisions about who specifically is covered and for what. They can simply cut spending and pass decisions on how to spend what’s left to the states.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Without knowing the exact cap and block grant amounts for the future, it&#8217;s hard to say exactly how big these cuts would be, but the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities&#8217; Gideon Lukens and Allison Orris analyzed <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/changing-medicaids-funding-structure-to-a-per-capita-cap-would-shift-costs-to">how Medicaid would&#8217;ve been cut if per-capita caps had been put in place</a> in 2018. By 2020, most states would&#8217;ve had to slash spending on disabled enrollees (by 12 percent in Pennsylvania and 13 percent in Kentucky); seniors would have seen cuts in 21 states, including cuts of around 17 percent in California; children would have seen cuts in 28 states.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The point here is not the specific numbers but that the idea can, in practice, amount to significant reductions in resources for the program.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is not much room to cut Medicaid without reducing access to the program. Physicians are already paid <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00611">about 28 percent less by Medicaid than by Medicare</a>, and Medicare in turn pays <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2022-01/57422-medical-prices.pdf#page=10">roughly 22 percent less</a> than private insurers. Medicaid, in other words, pays maybe half of what private insurance pays. Further cuts to prices paid to providers would almost certainly reduce the number who accept the program, making it that much harder for poor people to find care. More likely, states would respond to federal cuts by restricting eligibility and kicking people off the program.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether Trump can make these plans a reality depends strongly on what moderate Republicans (like Murkowski and Collins in the Senate and Don Bacon and David Valadao in the House) feel about them. While we don’t know margins for sure right now, it’s looking like <a href="https://polymarket.com/event/of-republican-senate-seats-after-election?tid=1730906142830">Republicans will have 53 Senate seats</a> and <a href="https://polymarket.com/event/of-republican-house-seats-after-election?tid=1730906160388">fewer than 225 House seats</a> (they need 218 to pass a bill there). That means that even a small number of defections would be enough to defeat legislation, even legislation that is advanced through the budget reconciliation process and thus needs only 50 Senate votes plus Vice President-elect JD Vance’s tie-breaker.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Murkowski and Collins alone wouldn’t be able to sink a Medicaid cuts bill, but they would only need two other defections to help them. Remember that in 2017, the bill that Sen. John McCain famously killed with them by making a thumbs-down motion on the Senate floor was the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/28/16054700/senate-obamacare-repeal-john-mccain-susan-collins-lisa-murkowski">so-called “skinny repeal,”</a> which would have only repealed the individual mandate and a few other provisions. The idea was that this bill could then go to a conference committee with the House’s Obamacare repeal bill, where they’d hash out a compromise measure.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some Republicans who voted for the skinny repeal, like Lindsey Graham and Ron Johnson, did so only after being promised that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/us/politics/obamacare-partial-repeal-senate-republicans-revolt.html">House’s bill, which included deep Medicaid cuts, would never become law</a>. There was rather deep opposition to passing sweeping cuts, even outside the three Republicans who blocked the Senate bill. As West Virginia Republican Shelley Moore Capito <a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/7/18/15988388/shelley-moore-capito-obamacare-repeal">said that summer</a>, “I did not come to Washington to hurt people.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All this suggests to me that getting 50 votes for sweeping Medicaid cuts in the Senate will be rather difficult. More difficult still might be the House, where Republicans will have to defend a number of seats where Kamala Harris won and where candidates will not want to enter 2026 midterms with votes to shred Medicaid hanging on them like albatrosses.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Food stamps face brutal cuts</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), colloquially called food stamps, is perhaps the most important safety net program for people who are very poor. <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/research/snap/characteristics-fy22">Seventy-five percent of recipients are at or below the poverty line</a>, and over 1 in 5 report having no other source of income besides food stamps. The share of single parents living on less than $2 a day is nearly 10 percent before you include SNAP benefits. Food stamps <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/6/5/18650492/2019-poverty-2-dollar-a-day-edin-shaefer-meyer">take the number below 3 percent</a>, slashing it by over two-thirds.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because the program <a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/books/breadlines-knee-deep-in-wheat/paper">grew out of efforts to prop up crop prices</a> by redirecting “surplus” crops to poor people, it is the province of the Department of Agriculture, and is renewed every five years in a “farm bill” controlled by the House and Senate Agriculture Committees. The last farm bill, from 2018, <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12233">expired on September 30</a>, meaning that writing a new farm bill will be one of Congress’s main priorities early next year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Glenn Thompson, the Republican chair of the House Ag Committee, released <a href="https://agriculture.house.gov/farmbill/">his proposed farm bill</a> in May. Its most striking provision would <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/press/statements/house-agriculture-committee-farm-bills-30-billion-cut-to-future-snap-benefits-and">limit the ability of the Department of Agriculture to update its Thrifty Food Plan</a>, upon which SNAP benefit levels are based. This would amount to a $30 billion cut over a decade, and is a response to the Biden administration updating the Thrifty Food Plan, which resulted in a nearly 30 percent hike in benefit levels.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump&#8217;s past budgets have <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/presidents-2021-budget-would-cut-food-assistance-for-millions-and-radically-restructure">envisioned much more sweeping cuts</a>. His last one proposed a nearly 30 percent cut to the program, including new work requirements on top of those already in the program and a plan to shift a big share of the program into a &#8220;Harvest Box,&#8221; a plan in which households would not get to choose the food they buy but instead be sent a monthly box of shelf-stable foods that the government picks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Realistically, I suspect the Harvest Box plan in particular will struggle to get traction, in part because major retailers like <a href="https://www.supermarketnews.com/foodservice-retail/walmart-dominates-the-retail-field-in-snap-grocery-market-share">Walmart and Kroger</a> rely on revenue from customers using food stamps and will fight efforts to redirect funds from them to government provision of food. What’s more, farm bills usually go through regular order, meaning that they’re subject to the filibuster and will need Democratic support in the Senate, which will not be forthcoming for sweeping cuts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, Trump has been consistent about wanting to restrict SNAP as a program and will have Ag Committee chairs in both houses who are broadly on his side. The potential for sharp cuts is definitely present.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The 2021 child tax credit is gone, but the credit might improve all the same</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">An area where Trump is unlikely to sign sweeping cuts and might even oversee modest expansions is the child tax credit.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/370753/taxes-debate-trump-harris-irs-tariffs-child-tax-credit">ran on reviving the 2021 version of the child tax credit</a>, which expanded it from $2,000 to as much as $3,600 per child and for the first time made it fully refundable, so poor Americans could benefit even if they were out of work. She also <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/15/nx-s1-5077776/kamala-harris-child-tax-credit-housing">proposed a “baby bonus” of $6,000</a> to families with newborns.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those dreams are dead for at least the next four years. But with the 2017 Trump tax cuts expiring next year, including their doubling of the child credit from $1,000 to $2,000, changes are likely coming to the credit all the same. While returning to 2021 is impossible, it’s likely that the end result will direct more money to poor Americans than the credit does under current law.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Republicans have been insistent that any credit include a “phase-in,” or a provision stating that families must have some earnings to receive the child tax credit. But within that framework, they’ve expressed openness to increasing the amount working families receive.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance notably <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jd-vance-child-tax-credit-5000-what-to-know/">called for a $5,000 baby bonus</a>, only to be one-upped by Harris’s $6,000 bid. This past year, Republican Jason Smith, the chair of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, cut a deal with Democrat Ron Wyden, the outgoing chair of the Senate Finance Committee, to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/1/16/24035922/child-tax-credit-wyden-smith-deal">expand the child credit</a> by altering the way it phases in. Smith will still be the head tax-writer in 2025 and is likely to push for this provision to stay in.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The complication is that Republicans face a wide array of expiring tax provisions next year, and while some, like <a href="https://rollcall.com/2024/09/18/chief-senate-gop-tax-writer-floats-alternative-cost-estimate-for-2025-package/">incoming Senate Finance Committee chair Mike Crapo</a>, suggest they don’t want to pay for extending those provisions, the reality of higher interest rates (meaning government deficits are now more costly to run) suggests that they probably can’t pass everything they want. Given a wish list that runs from extending those cuts to <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/366680/no-tax-on-tips-trump-harris-subminimum-wage">exempting tips</a> and <a href="https://www.crfb.org/blogs/what-would-trump-campaign-plans-mean-social-security">Social Security income</a> from taxation to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/trump-says-hell-make-interest-car-loans-tax-deductible-if-domestically-built-2024-10-22/">letting people deduct interest on car loans</a>, that means that expensive provisions like child tax credit expansions will likely get squeezed. It’s hard to say what exactly will make it into the final package.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the least-trumpeted changes of the past half-century is the steady growth of America’s safety net. <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59510">In 1979</a>, the average lower-income American got $5,300 from government programs aimed at poor people. In 2019, that number was $15,800. America&#8217;s commitment to poor people more than tripled, and the result was a <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/3/10/23632910/poverty-official-supplemental-relative-absolute-measure-desmond">marked reduction in poverty</a>. Trump’s reelection threatens that trend. But his first term, and those of Presidents Bush and Reagan before him, were not enough to reverse it. There are reasons to think it could continue even through the next four years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President-elect Donald Trump was <a href="https://www.vox.com/trump-investigations/2023/8/17/23832734/trump-indictment-democracy-paradox">indicted four times</a> — including two indictments arising out of his failed attempt to steal the 2020 election. One of these indictments <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/352465/trump-convicted-felon-elections">even yielded a conviction</a>, albeit on 34 relatively minor charges of falsifying business records.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the extraordinary protections the American system gives to sitting presidents will ensure that Trump won’t be going to prison. He’s going to the White House instead.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The federal charges against Trump are doomed</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Two of the indictments against Trump are federal, and two were brought by state prosecutors in New York and Georgia. The federal indictments (one about Trump’s role in <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/8/1/23810131/trump-indictment-charges-jan-6-jack-smith-supreme-court">fomenting the January 6 insurrection</a>, and the other about his <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360735/trump-classified-documents-case-cannon-dismissed-indictment">handling of classified documents</a>) are the most immediately vulnerable. Once Trump becomes president, he will have full command and control over the US Department of Justice, and can simply order it to drop all the federal charges against him. Once he does, those cases will simply go away.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The White House does have a <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/restoring-integrity-independence-u-s-justice-department/">longstanding norm of non-interference with criminal prosecutions</a>, but this norm is nothing more than that — a voluntary limit that past presidents placed on their own exercise of power in order to prevent politicization of the criminal justice system. As president, Trump is under no constitutional obligation to obey this norm. He nominates the attorney general, and he can fire the head of the Justice Department at any time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, Trump is reportedly considering Aileen Cannon, a judge who has consistently tried to sabotage one of the Justice Department’s prosecutions of Trump, to be <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/judge-tossed-trumps-classified-docs-case-list-proposed/story?id=114997807">the US attorney general</a>. Cannon, who oversees Trump’s federal classified documents’ trial, even tried to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/6/13/23757893/aileen-cannon-donald-trump-jack-smith-indictment-mar-a-lago-maga">disrupt the Justice Department’s investigation into Trump</a> before he was indicted. There’s no indication that her apparent loyalty to Trump would diminish if she becomes the nation’s top prosecutor.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The fate of the state charges is a little more uncertain, but they are unlikely to amount to anything either</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The fate of the state charges against Trump is a little more uncertain, in large part because there’s never been a state indictment of a sitting president before, so there are no legal precedents governing what happens if a state attempts such a prosecution (or, in the case of New York, to impose a serious sentence on a president who was already convicted).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is highly unlikely that the state prosecutions can move forward, however, at least until Trump leaves office. On the federal level, the Department of Justice has long maintained that <a href="https://www.justice.gov/file/146241-0/dl?inline">it cannot indict a sitting president for a variety of practical reasons</a>: The burden of defending against criminal charges would diminish the president’s ability to do their job, as would the “public stigma and opprobrium occasioned by the initiation of criminal proceedings.” Additionally, if the president were incarcerated, that would make it “physically impossible for the president to carry out his duties.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s little doubt that the current Supreme Court, which recently held that Trump is <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf">immune to prosecution for many crimes he committed while in office</a>, would embrace the Justice Department’s reasoning. The Court’s decision in <em>Trump v. United States</em>, the immunity case, rested on the Republican justices’ belief that, if a president could be indicted for official actions taken in office, he “would be chilled from taking the ‘bold and unhesitating action’ required of an independent Executive.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The kind of justices who favor such “bold and unhesitating action” over ensuring presidential accountability to the law are unlikely to tolerate a prosecution of a sitting president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These same practical considerations would apply with equal force to a state prosecution of a president, and there’s also one other reason why a constitutional limit on state indictments of the president makes sense. Without such a limit, a state led by the president’s political enemies could potentially bring frivolous criminal charges against that president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This argument may not seem particularly compelling when applied to a convicted criminal like Donald Trump. But imagine if, say, Ron DeSantis’s Florida had attempted to indict, try, and imprison President Joe Biden. Or if the state of Mississippi had indicted President Lyndon Johnson to punish him for signing civil rights legislation that ended Jim Crow.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In constitutional law, the same rule that applies to liberal democratic presidents like Biden or Johnson must also apply to an anti-democratic president like Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One open question is whether Trump could be incarcerated during the lame-duck period before he is sworn into office. The only state that could conceivably do this is New York, the only place where Trump has been convicted. Trump is currently <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/06/politics/judge-delays-trumps-sentencing/index.html">scheduled for a sentencing hearing on November 26 in that case</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The question of whether an already-convicted president-elect can be incarcerated is unique — this situation has thankfully never arisen before in US history, so there’s no definitive law on this subject. But it’s worth noting that neither the New York prosecutors nor the judge overseeing this case have pushed for a quick sentencing process. Judge Juan Merchan chose to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/06/politics/judge-delays-trumps-sentencing/index.html">delay sentencing until after the election</a>, and the prosecution did not oppose this move. Merchan may decide to delay matters even further now that Trump has won the election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And even if the sentencing does move forward, the charges against Trump in New York are relatively minor, and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/06/politics/judge-delays-trumps-sentencing/index.html">could only result in him being fined or sentenced to probation</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Again, there’s never been a state prosecution of a sitting president before, so there are no precedents to rely on here. It’s possible that, once Trump leaves office, New York or Georgia (the other state with an open case against Trump) may try to resume its long-pending prosecutions against him — although that assumes that the 78-year-old Trump survives his second term in office, and that these states still have the will to prosecute him four years from now.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The bottom line is that these prosecutions are likely dead. And they are almost certainly going nowhere for the next four years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ranked choice is an electoral reform that felt like a pipe dream only a few years ago, but has been becoming mainstream over the past decade or so. <a href="https://www.elections.alaska.gov/election-information/#RankedChoice">Alaska</a>, <a href="https://fairvote.org/hawaii_passes_ranked_choice_voting_legislation/">Hawaii</a>, and <a href="https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/upcoming/rankedchoicefaq.html">Maine</a>, have adopted it for some elections to Congress or statewide office. While a small handful of municipalities like <a href="https://www.sf.gov/ranked-choice-voting">San Francisco</a> and <a href="https://vote.minneapolismn.gov/ranked-choice-voting/details/">Minneapolis</a> have used it for decades, they were recently joined by <a href="https://vote.nyc/page/ranked-choice-voting">New York City</a>, <a href="https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/elections/ranked-choice-voting-in-seattle">Seattle</a>, and <a href="https://www.portland.gov/transition/portland-transition-election-code/ranked-choice-voting-election-code">Portland, Oregon</a>. Alongside DC, the states of <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Colorado_Proposition_131,_Top-Four_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Initiative_(2024)">Colorado</a>, <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Idaho_Proposition_1,_Top-Four_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Initiative_(2024)">Idaho</a>, <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Nevada_Question_3,_Top-Five_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Initiative_(2024)">Nevada</a>, and <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Oregon_Measure_117,_Ranked-Choice_Voting_for_Federal_and_State_Elections_Measure_(2024)">Oregon</a> all voted Tuesday on adopting the system, and <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Alaska_Ballot_Measure_2,_Repeal_Top-Four_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Initiative_(2024)">Alaska</a> voted on whether to keep it. Interestingly, only in DC did the system pass.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Full disclosure: I voted yes on the DC initiative. I think it probably does more good than harm in the context of our city. First-past-the-post voting clearly has deep flaws, which is why so many places are jumping on the RCV bandwagon. But I also think RCV’s benefits have been oversold and that we should experiment with other ways to make our elections more proportional.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ranked choice voting, explained</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In ranked choice voting (also called “instant runoff”), voters rank candidates in order. All the first-choice ballots are counted. If no candidate has a majority of first-choice votes, then the candidate with the smallest share is eliminated; their votes are then redistributed based on who their supporters ranked second. This continues until a candidate has an outright majority.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I first encountered the idea after the 2000 election. In Florida, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_United_States_presidential_election_in_Florida#Results">97,488 people voted for Ralph Nader</a>; of whom only 537 would have had to vote for Al Gore to give him the win in the state and thus the presidency. What if those Nader voters — who were overwhelmingly liberal — had been able to rank Gore second? Then this would&#8217;ve happened naturally, and the failure of left-of-center voters to coordinate wouldn’t have resulted in George W. Bush’s presidency, the war in Iraq, etc.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This rationale is also why I support the idea in DC. Here, like a lot of coastal cities, almost all the political competition occurs in the Democratic primary, which is often incredibly crowded. Every four years, good-government folks here try to unseat <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/04/27/anita-bonds-dc-council/">Anita Bonds</a>, our notoriously <a href="https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/645055/anita-bonds-new-bill-threatens-to-scramble-the-councils-already-inadequate-response-to-the-john-falcicchio-scandal/">ineffective</a> <a href="https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/177365/atlarge-councilmember-anita-bonds-outed-a-whistleblower-during-a-public-hearing/">and</a> <a href="https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/553561/anita-bonds-says-shes-never-heard-of-d-c-s-massive-housing-voucher-waitlist/">incompetent</a> at-large city councilor, and every time, multiple challengers wind up dividing the anti-Bonds vote. <a href="https://electionresults.dcboe.org/election_results/2022-Primary-Election">Two years ago</a>, she won renomination with 36 percent of the vote, while two challengers each got 28 percent. RCV would make it harder for unpopular incumbents to get renominated by dividing the opposition.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a narrow tool to avoid spoiler effects, RCV works quite well. But its supporters also have grander ambitions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Katherine Gehl, a wealthy former CEO who has <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23412858/nevada-question-3-final-five-voting-katherine-gehl">bankrolled many recent RCV initiatives</a>, argues that her particular version (called “final five” voting) will almost single-handedly make politicians work together again. <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2022/11/02/katherine-gehl-alaska-has-a-voting-solution-for-a-nation-torn-apart/">Gehl wrote two years ago</a>: </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">Barriers to cooperation fall. Senators and representatives are liberated from the constraints of negative partisanship. They are free to enact solutions to complex problems by reaching across the aisle, innovating and negotiating.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The theory is elegant. In <a href="https://finalfiveelections.org/">final five voting</a>, all candidates&nbsp;— regardless of party — participate in a primary. The top five contenders are then placed on the general election ballot, where voters can rank them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The hope is that this eliminates the dynamic where partisan primaries push party nominees to ideological extremes, and where fear of such a primary prevents incumbents from compromising or defying their party (see the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/with-cheneys-loss-just-2-house-republicans-who-voted-to-impeach-trump-are-on-the-ballot-in-november/">of whom four lost renomination</a> when challenged by a pro-Trump Republican). Then, ranked-choice voting in the general election means candidates compete for No. 2 and No. 3 votes, reducing the incentive to negatively campaign.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The case(s) against RCV</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sounds great! So why would someone oppose RCV?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One possible reason is the finding by political scientist Nolan McCarty that under RCV, <a href="https://electionconfidence.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/FINAL-RCV-study-1-10-24.pdf">precincts with more ethnic minorities see more “ballot exhaustion”</a> (failing to rank as many candidates as one is allowed to). That means, McCarty has argued, that the <a href="https://electionconfidence.org/2024/01/11/ranked-choice-voting-hurts-minorities-study/">reform tends to “reduce the electoral influence</a> of racial and ethnic minority communities.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Work by Lindsey Cormack, an associate professor at Stevens Institute of Technology, has similarly found that “<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1532673X231220640">overvoting</a>” (using the same ranking more than once, which means ballots can’t be counted accurately) is more common in minority communities, while University of Pennsylvania’s <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4670677">Stephen Pettigrew and Dylan Radley</a> have found that ballot errors in general are much more common in ranked choice than traditional elections.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Anything that raises the specter of reducing electoral influence for minority communities in the US is worth worrying about. That said, I’m not sure this case is disqualifying either. Ranked choice is a significant change that takes time for an electorate to understand and adjust to. I’m not sure that higher error rates for a newly adopted approach to voting indicate these error rates will persist as the practice becomes normalized.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To me the more compelling counterargument is that RCV seems unlikely to do anything to reduce partisanship and encourage cross-party compromise. The reason why has to do with the classic case against instant-runoff voting, which you might have heard if you’re friends with <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/social-choice/">social choice theory</a> nerds (as, alas, I am).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One thing you’d want a voting system to do is elect the person who would win in a one-on-one race against every other candidate. This is called the “<a href="https://electowiki.org/wiki/Condorcet_winner_criterion">Condorcet winner</a>,” and while there isn’t always one in an election, when there <em>is</em> one, it seems like a good election system should give them the win, as the person the electorate prefers to all alternatives.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ranked choice voting does not always pick the Condorcet winner, and we’ve now seen multiple real-world elections in which the Condorcet winner (which you can figure out from ranked-choice ballot records) lost. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2303.00108v2">Alaska’s US House special election in 2022</a>, which used ranked choice, the Condorcet winner was Republican Nick Begich, but Democrat Mary Peltola won. Something similar happened in the <a href="http://vermontdailybriefing.com/?p=1213">2009 Burlington, Vermont, mayoral race</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Importantly, in both cases the Condorcet winner was the most moderate of the three main candidates. Begich was to the right of Peltola, but to the left of Sarah Palin (!), the third candidate. In Burlington, the left-wing Progressive Party nominee beat both the Democratic and Republican nominees, though the Democrat (a centrist in Burlington terms) was the Condorcet winner.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">RCV advocates note that these are two cases out of thousands of RCV elections, and that <a href="https://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4874&amp;context=wlulr">in practice, Condorcet failures are rare</a>. I’m not so sure about that.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Research from <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4411173">Nathan Atkinson, Edward Foley, and Scott Ganz</a> used a national ranked choice survey of American voters to simulate what elections would look like under the system nationwide. For each state, they simulate 100,000 elections with four candidates. They find that in 40 percent of cases, the Condorcet winner loses, which suggests that the rarity of Condorcet failures in practice may just be an artifact of RCV being relatively new, and that such outcomes would become more common in time as the method spreads.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Worse, the simulation paper finds that the system results in much more extreme winners (that is, winners who are farther away from the median voter) than one that picks the Condorcet winner. Indeed, &#8220;the states where [the system] performs worst (including Arizona, Nevada, and Georgia) are among the most polarized, whereas the states where [it] performs the best (including Massachusetts, North Dakota, and Vermont) are among the least polarized.&#8221; The system seems to actually encourage polarization, not avoid it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">DC aside, voters themselves on Tuesday mostly opposed RCV. In <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2024/11/05/colorado-proposition-131-results/" data-type="link" data-id="https://coloradosun.com/2024/11/05/colorado-proposition-131-results/">Colorado</a>, <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/11/06/election-2024-idaho-proposition-1-ballot-initiative-trailing-in-early-unofficial-election-results/" data-type="link" data-id="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/11/06/election-2024-idaho-proposition-1-ballot-initiative-trailing-in-early-unofficial-election-results/">Idaho</a>, <a href="https://nevadacurrent.com/2024/11/05/nevada-voters-reject-open-primaries-ranked-choice/" data-type="link" data-id="https://nevadacurrent.com/2024/11/05/nevada-voters-reject-open-primaries-ranked-choice/">Nevada</a>, and <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2024/11/05/oregon-ballot-measure-117-ranked-choice-voting/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.opb.org/article/2024/11/05/oregon-ballot-measure-117-ranked-choice-voting/">Oregon</a>, electorates all voted down ballot initiatives that would have introduced some form of RCV. In <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2024/11/05/preliminary-2024-alaska-general-election-results/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.adn.com/politics/2024/11/05/preliminary-2024-alaska-general-election-results/">Alaska</a>, a ballot initiative to repeal that state’s RCV is currently slightly ahead. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">New America political scientist Lee Drutman was once such a great fan of RCV that he <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/breaking-the-two-party-doom-loop-9780190913854?cc=us&amp;lang=en">wrote a book</a> calling for it, but has in recent years come to think it&#8217;s <a href="https://leedrutman.substack.com/p/how-i-updated-my-views-on-ranked">hardly the cure for polarization and dysfunction</a> he once viewed it as, in part due to findings like Atkinson, et al. A better solution, he argues, is to <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/political-reform/reports/more-parties-better-parties/">strengthen parties</a> and encourage more of them to form.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">States should allow “fusion voting,” in which candidates can run on multiple parties’ lines (New York already does this), and for legislatures, seats should be allocated proportionally: If there are 100 seats, and Democrats and Republicans each get 45 percent of the vote and Greens and Libertarians each get 5, then they should get 45, 45, 5, and 5 seats, respectively.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is a much more radical change than ranked choice voting, and requires a real rethinking by politicians. It’s hard to imagine a DC with multiple functional political parties, or where anyone important isn’t a Democrat. But it’s worth trying it and experimenting. We have learned a lot from trying RCV, and we can learn even more.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Support independent journalism that matters —&nbsp;</em></strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/support-now"><strong><em>become a Vox Member today</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Following a heated presidential contest, political coverage and commentary can feel unavoidable. Kids are not immune — they might be picking up information about the election results from the adults in their lives, at recess, or on social media. As much as parents may think their children are oblivious, research shows kids, including very young ones, are paying attention. One study found that nearly all of the surveyed kids between the ages of 5 and 11<a href="https://news.ku.edu/news/article/2019/08/06/researchers-find-youths-knowledgeable-about-politics-call-even-better-early-political"> could name the candidates</a> running for president in 2016. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Kids as young as kindergarten and first grade can name candidates when they see their pictures,” says <a href="https://www.whitman.edu/academics/majors-and-programs/psychology/faculty-and-staff/erin-pahlke">Erin Pahlke</a>, an associate professor of psychology at Whitman College and a co-author of the study, “and they have a sense of what the candidates believe.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You don’t have to have an in-depth discussion with your child every time they encounter a political topic. When it comes to political conversations with kids, experts say you should answer their questions and quell any fears they may have — but avoid telling them how to think.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When kids are young, teach them about civic engagement</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since children as young as 5 are shown to already have a basic understanding of presidents and elections, you can use this early exposure to guide and inform their knowledge. Kids of all ages can learn about civic engagement through activities like mock elections in school or accompanying their parents to the polls on Election Day, says clinical psychologist <a href="https://melissagoldbergmintz.com/">Melissa Goldberg Mintz</a>, author of<em> </em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Has-Your-Child-Been-Traumatized/dp/1462547494"><em>Has Your Child </em></a><em><a href="https://www.guilford.com/books/Has-Your-Child-Been-Traumatized/Melissa-Goldberg-Mintz/9781462547494?srsltid=AfmBOopzU8cgP9dUWxCAgcx6boSaYPYd55-fu1OnB0NLCoFBcjd1EPcy">Been</a></em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Has-Your-Child-Been-Traumatized/dp/1462547494"><em> Traumatized? How to Know and What to Do to Promote Healing and Recovery</em></a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can use this experience to teach kids how elections work. Children as young as 5 can grasp that voters are choosing between two major candidates from opposite parties and for laws that affect where they live, Pahlke says. If an elementary school-aged child has particular interests — maybe they love trains and buses — you could explain how proposed legislation would impact transportation in your city or town, Goldberg Mintz says. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But don’t get too in the weeds or too prescriptive. “Something we would not want to do,” she says, “is talk about ‘With global climate change and increasing natural disasters, our city is doomed if we don&#8217;t have these protective flood measures.’”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Allow kids to lead the dialogue</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although children are exposed to more political information than their parents realize, their understanding or the conclusions they draw is sometimes incorrect, Pahlke says. Parents have a responsibility to clear up these misunderstandings, she continues, so ask your kids what they know about certain topics. Watching or reading the news together can be an effective way to start a conversation, says <a href="https://www.american.edu/cas/faculty/caporino.cfm">Nicole Caporino</a>, an associate professor of psychology at American University. If any stories trigger fear or confusion, you can discuss the likelihood that their fears will materialize, point out hopeful news stories, and assure them the family will cope with any potential challenges together, Caporino says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Caporino’s research has suggested that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32100153/">most children and adolescents were worried</a> about political issues. Don’t downplay their concerns, Goldberg Mintz says. Do your best to give them an honest answer, but try not to give into fear or negativity, even if you are feeling scared. You might say, “I hear that you’re worried about that, and I have some concerns too. But we’ll figure out ways to get through it if that happens.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Parents should open the door to these conversations, because chances are children might already be thinking about these topics, Pahlke says. However, you shouldn’t offer up too many details if your child isn’t interested. For example, if you ask your elementary-aged kid, “The presidential election is coming up. Have you heard anything?” and they don’t have a strong opinion or say they haven’t talked about it with their friends, you can leave it at that.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We don&#8217;t ever want to volunteer bloody details or gory information that kids don&#8217;t already know about,” Goldberg Mintz says. “We want to be a trustworthy source for them. And if we don&#8217;t know the answer, we want to show them how to get to a trustworthy source.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Teens who are closer to voting age can handle discussions about specific policies, Pahlke says, and parents can explain various perspectives and potential outcomes. Parents can also talk with their teens about the importance of voting, Goldberg Mintz says.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Encourage them to fact-check what they see on social media</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Teens are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/learning/teenagers-tell-us-about-their-relationship-with-news.html">increasingly turning to social media</a> to stay informed, with one 2022 survey finding that half of Gen Z adolescents <a href="https://deloitte.wsj.com/cmo/digital-social-media-power-gen-z-teens-news-consumption-01655136478">source their news from online platforms</a>. If your kid asks you a question about something they’ve seen on social media (or sounds as if it originated there), use this as an opportunity to fact-check those claims with them. Check sources like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/learning/teenagers-tell-us-about-their-relationship-with-news.html">AP </a><a href="https://apnews.com/ap-fact-check">Fact</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/learning/teenagers-tell-us-about-their-relationship-with-news.html"> Check</a>, <a href="https://www.politifact.com/">Politifact</a>, and <a href="https://www.snopes.com/">Snopes</a> and show them where they can find trusted reporting. To <a href="https://newslit.org/educators/resources/is-it-legit/">determine a source’s credibility</a>, the News Literacy Project recommends quickly researching the source of your news, determining if the organization has ethical standards, and assessing the quality of the outlet’s other coverage.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“We don&#8217;t ever want to volunteer bloody details or gory information that kids don&#8217;t already know about.”</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If your teen doesn’t come to you directly with what they’ve been watching online, you might need to gently broach the conversation. In the case of viral disinformation campaigns, you can ask your child, “Did you see people talking about this on social media?” This way you can glean information about what your kid is seeing online and correct any inaccuracies.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Let them come to their own conclusions</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">High schoolers will have more nuanced understandings about certain current events and policies and it’s appropriate to discuss these topics with them, Pahlke says. But rather than paint various candidates or points of view as “good” or “bad,” help them consider different perspectives. Explain why people with various experiences would have different opinions on a topic. It’s fine if they align with a particular candidate or policy, but they should also be able to see where the other side is coming from. Perspective-taking can help them in other relationships, too, Pahlke says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Teens may also have a clear understanding of their personal values and can reflect on how certain candidates or policies reflect these values and goals, Goldberg Mintz says. You can show your teen where to find <a href="https://newslit.org/educators/resources/is-it-legit/">credible information</a> from <a href="https://libguides.rutgers.edu/fake_news">trusted news sources</a> on specific candidates and policies and let them make up their minds. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Rather than trying to get in the weeds about ‘This is the candidate that our family can support, and it&#8217;s because XYZ’ is trying to define a kid&#8217;s beliefs for them,” Goldberg Mintz says. “We let our kids come to their own decisions.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the pandemic prompted a spike in crime, politicians from both parties have been running <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/356269/falling-crime-trends-public-perception-voter-concerns">fearmongering, law-and-order campaigns</a>. And it’s becoming clear that many Americans, including liberal voters, are shifting rightward when it comes to their views on criminal justice, despite the fact that crime rates <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/30/politics/us-crime-statistics-fbi-2024/index.html">have actually been falling</a> since <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/violent-crime-falling-nationwide-heres-how-we-know">2021</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://lao.ca.gov/ballot/2024/prop36-110524.pdf">Proposition 36</a>, a ballot measure in California, asked voters if they wanted to toughen penalties for drug- and theft-related crimes. And on Tuesday, voters said yes by an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-california-proposition-36-increase-sentences-for-drug-and-theft-crimes.html">overwhelming margin</a>. (With more than half of the votes counted, the yes campaign had won more than 70 percent of the vote.) That Californians — some of the country’s most reliable Democratic voters, who previously <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/11/california-prop-47-mass-incarceration/382372/">passed a ballot measure</a> to reduce penalties for low-level offenses — passed a tough-on-crime measure is sure to lead people to believe that Americans more broadly are looking to roll back some of the progressive reforms that many states have passed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The result didn’t come as a surprise. Polls showed that an overwhelming majority of voters <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/24/california-prop-36-crime-initiative-00185192">supported </a>Prop 36, and various Democratic and Republican politicians <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/03/californians-crime-initiative-00186862">had endorsed it</a>. And while California Gov. Gavin Newsom opposed it, he also <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article292749819.html">wasn’t particularly vocal</a> about doing so, and Vice President Kamala Harris, who’s registered to vote in the state, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/03/kamala-harris-proposition-36-drug-theft-crimes">declined to say</a> how she was voting on the measure.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It goes to show that there is a real disparity between what is right as a matter of policy and then where the temperature is as a matter of politics,” said Insha Rahman, the director of Vera Action, a criminal justice reform advocacy group.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not just California. Another ballot measure, which would <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2024/10/13/vg-2024-proposition-128-longer-minimum-prison-time-for-violent-crimes-explainer/">require some people to serve more time</a> in prison before they qualify for parole, <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2024/11/05/proposition-128-results-colorado/">passed by a comfortable margin</a> in Colorado, a reliably blue state, on Tuesday as well.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All are further signs that the criminal justice reform era — that is, the movement that successfully pushed for a more forgiving criminal justice system and for policies to decrease the US prison population — is facing a stubborn and serious backlash. At least for now. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why voters aren’t moved by falling crime rates</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The way people feel about crime doesn’t tend to match up with actual stats. Before the pandemic, crime had been steadily declining across the country <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/04/24/what-the-data-says-about-crime-in-the-us/">for almost 30 years</a>. (Violent crime and shoplifting briefly rose during the pandemic, but overall crime rates have continued to trend downward since.) But almost every year during that period, the majority of Americans <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alNHhdWDfsY">thought crime was getting worse</a>, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/544442/americans-crime-problem-serious.aspx">according to Gallup</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The last few years have been no different. In 2023, the same poll showed that <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/356269/falling-crime-trends-public-perception-voter-concerns">77 percent of Americans</a> believed that crime was increasing despite <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/30/politics/us-crime-statistics-fbi-2024/index.html">FBI data showing</a> the opposite. In 2023, murders were down <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/us/murder-crime-rate-fbi.html">by nearly 12 percent</a>, and in the first half of this year, murders <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/30/politics/us-crime-statistics-fbi-2024/index.html">declined by another 23 percent</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/356269/falling-crime-trends-public-perception-voter-concerns">I wrote earlier this year</a>, there are two main reasons Americans tend to overestimate the extent to which crime happens: Media coverage of crime can often overstate trends and sometimes <a href="https://apnews.com/article/laken-riley-university-georgia-death-nursing-student-a88e92600ab4dcce1a88e121b7b9c722">sensationalizes incidents</a> that grab people’s attention. And law-and-order campaigns — the kind of campaigns that Trump ran, for example — are a mainstay of American politics and appear in virtually every election cycle in local, state, and national races. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the decade before the pandemic, however, criminal justice reform advocates succeeded in highlighting racial disparities in the prison system and the many injustices in various sentencing laws. As the prison population boomed after the tough-on-crime era of the 1990s — and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9540942/#:~:text=The%20United%20States%20experienced%20unprecedented,100%20adults%2C%20were%20behind%20bars.">peaked</a> around 2008 — Americans became more open to having a more forgiving criminal justice system, and law-and-order campaigns saw fewer successes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many progressive reforms aimed at reducing the prison population — including lowering penalties, legalizing drugs, and declining to prosecute petty crimes — passed. States across the country, both <a href="https://www.wdsu.com/article/despite-reforms-louisianas-incarceration-rate-leads-the-nation/34467334">Republican</a> and <a href="https://www.ppic.org/publication/crime-after-proposition-47-and-the-pandemic/#:~:text=One%20critical%20reform%2C%20Proposition%2047,reclassified%20from%20felonies%20to%20misdemeanors.">Democrat</a>, implemented laws that aimed to reduce their overall prison populations. California was a part of that push, and in 2014, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/11/california-prop-47-mass-incarceration/382372/">voters passed a ballot measure</a> to reduce penalties for low-level offenses.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The crime spike in 2020, however, put a stop to that momentum, and Americans started to look at a few of those reforms with some regret. California and Colorado voters aren’t alone. Oregon, for example, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/oregon-governor-signs-a-bill-recriminalizing-drug-possession#:~:text=SALEM%2C%20Ore.,was%20hobbled%20by%20implementation%20issues.">recriminalized drugs</a> after decriminalizing them in 2020, and Louisiana <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/03/09/louisiana-georgia-kentucky-tough-on-crime">passed a slew of laws</a> that reduced parole eligibility and imposed harsher sentences. Progressive prosecutors who championed lowering penalties and loosening enforcement of petty crimes have been <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/23/progressive-da-west-coast-00159559">voted out of office.</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That doesn’t necessarily mean that Americans are irrational: The United States is, after all, a relatively violent country and has <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1374211/g7-country-homicide-rate/">a higher homicide rate</a> than its peers. But while crime is a problem, lawmakers tend to <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/24139552/crime-rates-falling-tough-laws-mass-incarceration">react too quickly to crime trends</a>, often by passing shortsighted tough-on-crime laws that bolster the perception of public safety by, say, putting more cops on the streets, but end up exacerbating the existing flaws of the criminal justice system, including <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/americas-broken-criminal-legal-system-contributes-to-wealth-inequality/">sending poorer</a> and <a href="https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/one-in-five-racial-disparity-in-imprisonment-causes-and-remedies/">more marginalized people</a> to prison.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In California’s case, voters have really been pushing for tougher law enforcement. Earlier this year, San Francisco voters <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-03-09/san-francisco-welfare-drug-screening-police-crime-vote">passed a ballot measure</a> that would subject welfare recipients to drug tests and expanded police surveillance. Now, the rest of the state showed that the appetite for tough-on-crime laws isn’t going away. And the ballot measure in Colorado showed that other parts of the country are probably feeling the same way.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Prop 36 means for California — and the rest of the country</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The new California law would <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/california-proposition-36-increase-penalties-drug-theft-crimes-2024-election/">roll back some previous reforms</a> from the 2014 ballot measure that reduced penalties for low-level crimes. Specifically, it <a href="https://www.kqed.org/voterguide/california/proposition-36">would turn some thefts that are currently classified as misdemeanors into a felony charge</a> if someone has already been convicted of theft at least twice — no matter the value of stolen goods. It would also turn certain drug possession charges that were previously a misdemeanor into a “<a href="https://lao.ca.gov/BallotAnalysis/Proposition?number=36&amp;year=2024">treatment-mandated felony</a>.” That means that people caught with certain amounts of hard drugs would be required to seek treatment, but if they fail to complete it, they could end up serving up to three years in prison.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the last two decades, California’s prison population <a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/graphs/jails2024/CA_prison_jail_populations_1978-2022.html">has significantly declined</a>. But laws like Prop 36 will likely reverse some of that progress. “It is likely that jail and prison admissions will go up in the state of California,” Rahman, of Vera Action, said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More than that, the ballot measure’s success will likely encourage other states to enact tougher laws. If even California’s liberal voters supported the measure, then wouldn’t other constituencies across the country want something similar, if not even tougher? “It will absolutely put wind in the sales of opponents of [criminal justice] reform,” Rahman said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Colorado voters will add to that sentiment. Under Proposition 128, which also passed by a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-colorado-proposition-128-delay-parole-eligibility-for-violent-offenders.html">wide margin</a>, people convicted of violent crimes — including second-degree murder, sexual assault, and aggravated robberies — will have to <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2024/11/05/proposition-128-results-colorado/">serve at least 85 percent</a> of their prison sentence before becoming eligible for parole, <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2024/10/13/vg-2024-proposition-128-longer-minimum-prison-time-for-violent-crimes-explainer/">up from 75 percent</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, these ballot measures don’t necessarily provide the full picture. Rahman, for example, highlights lower-profile battles that criminal justice reform advocates have recently won, including some drug <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2021/03/15/magic-mushrooms-are-decriminalized-in-dc-as-of-today/">decriminalization</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-marijuana-8b91194279bf42c9bc01cbabdab0c015">legalization efforts</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For now, though, there’s one lesson for criminal justice reform advocates: “The big story here is to say that just because we had one high-profile prominent loss, doesn&#8217;t mean the momentum for criminal justice reform is dead,” Rahman said, referring to Prop 36. “Reform is still happening, but it&#8217;s in the shadows, and it&#8217;s on us to pay as much attention to those wins as it is to the one big loss.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Donald Trump left his first term as president amid a raging global pandemic. Now he will return to the White House with public health authorities on high alert for another disease threat.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Public health preparedness is not usually <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/651719/economy-important-issue-2024-presidential-vote.aspx">a top question</a> for voters and neither Donald Trump nor Vice President Kamala Harris were meaningfully pressed on the issue during the 2024 campaign. But they should have been. During Trump’s first term, we saw the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21366624/trump-covid-coronavirus-pandemic-failure">damaging consequences</a> of a leader who is disinterested in science and unwilling to tell uncomfortable truths to his political base. The Covid-19 pandemic would have challenged any president, but evidence <a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/political-party-affiliation-linked-excess-covid-deaths">suggests</a> that Trump’s leadership contributed to unnecessary deaths: As many as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/10/us-coronavirus-response-donald-trump-health-policy">40 percent of American lives lost</a> in the first year of the pandemic, according to one estimate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now we are <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/10/16/bird-flu-pandemic-overall-risk-low-continued-h5n1-outbreak-dairy-cattle-worrisome/">staring down the threat of H5N1</a>, or bird flu, which <a href="https://www.vox.com/health/24118152/explain-it-to-me-bird-flu-human-case-texas-chickens-cows-animal-agriculture">continues</a> to <a href="https://news.cuanschutz.edu/news-stories/avian-flu-has-infected-dairy-cows-in-more-than-a-dozen-states-a-microbiologist-explains-how-the-virus-is-spreading">spread through America’s dairy herds</a> and infect an increasing number of <a href="https://x.com/HelenBranswell/status/1850939370603270311">humans</a>. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-detects-h5n1-bird-flu-swine-first-time-2024-10-30/">announced</a> Wednesday that the virus had been detected in a pig at an Oregon farm; scientists have long worried about the virus crossing into pigs, as they resemble humans genetically more than dairy cows or chickens do. That could increase the risk that H5N1 will evolve in a way that makes it more transmissible among humans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If bird flu were to spiral into a pandemic, we would look back at this as a critical time to prepare. But while the Biden-Harris administration’s response has <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/06/26/bird-flu-outbreak-avian-flu-containment-h5n1-eradication-in-cattle/">certainly been lax in some respects</a>, Trump was on the campaign trail <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter/366472/2024-election-donald-trump-vaccines-schools">threatening to defund schools</a> that require their students to be vaccinated and pledging to install anti-public health establishment crusaders into senior roles in his White House.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the worst comes to pass again, would the sequel be any better?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Probably not, experts told me. I started reporting this story with a smidge of optimism: While Trump had clearly been a <a href="https://www.vox.com/coronavirus-covid19/21497221/donald-trump-covid-19-coronavirus-news-misinformation-study">problematic communicator during Covid-19</a>, his administration was responsible for <a href="https://www.vox.com/coronavirus-covid19/2020/10/7/21504134/trump-covid-19-vaccine-operation-warp-speed-debate">Operation Warp Speed</a>, which delivered effective vaccines in record-setting time and likely saved <a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/report-covid-19-vaccines-saved-us-115-trillion-3-million-lives">hundreds of thousands of lives</a>. That was a major, unexpected accomplishment for which the Trump administration deserves credit.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But rather than lay claim to such a big, beautiful success, Trump has mostly shunned it. Instead, he has embraced America’s most notorious vaccine skeptic, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/6/22/23768539/rogan-rfk-hotez-debate-vaccine-deniers-better">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a>, and promised him a prominent place in the White House. (Republican Sen. Marco Rubio <a href="https://x.com/amconmag/status/1854157641011892447" data-type="link" data-id="https://x.com/amconmag/status/1854157641011892447">told CNN</a> on November 6 that he expects the Senate would be open to confirming Kennedy to a high-level position should Trump decide to put him forward.) That is probably a better signal of what would happen in Trump’s next term.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a future emergency, Trump “would make a political calculation, and not one based on what needed to be done,” Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told me before the election. “Infectious disease in general has been completely subsumed by a tribal lens, and the tribe that is supportive of him is antagonistic to a proactive approach to public health.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What an H5N1 response might look like under Trump</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Let’s establish a couple of things. First, while there has been sustained concern among infectious disease experts this year about H5N1 due to a <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/370804/bird-flu-h5n1-missouri-human-cows-raw-milk">steady drip of human infections</a>, the virus has not yet ignited a pandemic. Maybe it never will. H5N1 has been infecting humans off and on for more than 20 years.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether it’s bird flu or something else, new diseases have been emerging <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8957694/">more often</a> in the 20th and 21st centuries, and many <a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/new-study-suggests-risk-extreme-pandemics-covid-19-could-increase-threefold-coming">scientists expect the frequency of pandemics</a> to only increase as climate change and globalization create more opportunities for diseases to cross over in humans and spread among them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s inevitable that we’ll face another pandemic. The question is only what will cause the next one, and when. For now, H5N1 is the suspect drawing the most attention.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Second, the Biden administration’s response to H5N1 has been <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24140017/milk-bird-flu-safe-dairy-usda-fda">very flawed</a>. Vanity Fair recently<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/inside-the-bungled-bird-flu-response"> investigated the inaction of the USDA</a>, which has taken primary responsibility for the H5N1 response so far because most of the cases have been in livestock animals: chickens, turkeys, and now dairy cows.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">This story was first featured in the <a href="https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup">Future Perfect newsletter</a>.</h2>

</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Experts say the federal agency has been overly accommodating of agricultural industry interests, which has allowed the virus to continue escaping containment and tear through dairy farms across the country. The USDA has largely deferred to states to take the lead on H5N1, and state agricultural officials, especially in big farm states, are typically even more deferential to agribusiness than the federal government.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Missouri, state officials have been <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/09/12/h5-bird-flu-human-infection-missouri-cause-remains-unknown/">slow to act</a> after the discovery of a human case with no obvious connection to farm animals. “They are overtly evading the fact that dairy cattle in Missouri are infected. They don’t want to find them,” Adalja told me.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Adalja said Trump, after he takes over, could actively weaken the federal government’s ability to respond to a pandemic threat.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has said he would <a href="https://time.com/6972022/donald-trump-transcript-2024-election/">“probably” shutter the White House pandemic office</a>, tasked with coordinating a response across the government in a future crisis. He has <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter/366472/2024-election-donald-trump-vaccines-schools">threatened</a> to cut off federal funding for schools that institute vaccine or mask mandates. He has also pledged to slash the government budget and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-cut-cdcs-budget-democrats-claim-analysis/story?id=69233170">singled out</a> the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a candidate for cuts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And while the bird flu response under Biden has been dysfunctional, there has at least been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-provide-nearly-200-million-contain-bird-flu-spread-dairy-farms-2024-05-10/">some attempt to centralize a response</a>. The administration has offered <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/10/health/bird-flu-government-farm-incentives/index.html">nearly $100 million for dairy farms</a> to take preventive measures and has also signed a deal with Moderna to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/02/health/moderna-mrna-bird-flu-vaccine/index.html">develop a new H5N1 vaccine</a>, while <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/us-loading-up-on-bird-flu-vaccine/#:~:text=In%20the%20past%2C%20H5N1%20has,Sanofi%2C%20will%20double%20that%20number.">adding to the stockpiles</a> of existing flu vaccine prototypes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But in another Trump presidency, states could be empowered to take an even more relaxed approach to public health, and leaders in Republican-controlled states would be motivated by the same public health skepticism as their conservative voters. The political environment would be ripe for a free-for-all in state-level responses, amplifying <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02343-4">the divergences we saw during Covid-19</a>, when some states allowed businesses and schools to reopen months before others did and even banned cities from setting mask or vaccine requirements.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A second Trump administration will likely also be staffed by people who are even more skeptical of public health interventions than we saw in his first term. In 2020, Trump still had credible infectious disease experts on his team, like Anthony Fauci, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Deborah Birx, who served as the White House Covid response coordinator, even if he frequently undermined them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Next time, it’s unlikely there would be any such voices in the room. The internal deliberations would instead be dominated by the likes of RFK Jr. or <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/23682263/ron-desantis-covid-19-vaccines-joseph-ladapo">Florida Surgeon General Joseph Lapado</a>, another vaccine skeptic who has been <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/09/trump-anti-vaccine-mandates-00162360">floated</a> as a possible Trump appointee. To lead the USDA, Trump is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/11/trump-eyes-top-texas-maga-disciple-for-usda-chief-00151797">reportedly eyeing</a> Texas agriculture commissioner Sid Miller, who told Vanity Fair that <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/inside-the-bungled-bird-flu-response">bird flu is “not a big deal. It’s not even a little deal.”</a> He has refused to cooperate with the CDC on testing farm workers in his state.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Those types of people are all that’s left” to serve in a Trump administration, Adalja said. “People with expertise are not going to want to be part of it or be selected.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a frightening scenario to contemplate, and it illustrates our collective difficulty planning for unlikely but potentially catastrophic events. We all just lived through an experiment in what happens when the government struggles to respond to a health crisis. Yet even at the beginning of Covid, I heard from public health experts who worried we would not internalize the pandemic’s lessons, that public health would be shunted to the side after the urgency had passed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They’ve mostly been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/11/opinion/covid-pandemic-emergency-lessons.html">proven right</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To be clear, the failure to learn from the example of Covid and prepare now for future pandemics with smart policies — many of which you can read about in Future Perfect’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/23001426/pandemic-proof">Pandemic-Proof package</a> — is bipartisan. There was a stark absence of public health plans from the 2024 campaign, even having endured a pandemic so recently and staring down the possibility of another one so soon. We may end up worse off as a result.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Editor’s note, November 6, 6 am ET: </em></strong><em>Donald Trump <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has won the 2024 presidential election</a>.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Republicans have won a majority in the Senate, flipping the body after four years of Democratic control.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This was the <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings">predicted outcome</a> given how vulnerable Democrats were this cycle: While they were defending nine battleground seats, Republicans were defending only three. The GOP successfully flipped key states<strong>, </strong>including Montana, Ohio, and West Virginia, while holding off unexpectedly competitive challenges in places like <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380855/nebraska-dan-osborn-deb-fischer-senate">Nebraska</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/380707/texas-senate-race-allred-cruz-2024-election">Texas</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The new Republican Senate majority will have a chance to govern with a Republican in the White House, after former President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy">won a second term</a> early on Wednesday morning, defeating Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In their campaigns, Republican Senate candidates leaned heavily on critiques of Democrats’ economic policies as many voters continued to grapple with inflation and high costs of living. They also kept up fear-mongering on immigration, arguing that only they could offer solutions to <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24153132/us-border-crisis-mexico-migrant-immigration-asylum">border crossing surges</a>, like the one in 2023. Overall, because they weren’t in control of the Senate, Republican candidates were able to capitalize on anti-incumbent sentiment — and current discontent — as they campaigned to take back certain seats.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Republicans’ gains will have major implications for the incoming Trump administration. A Republican Senate will offer him a nearly blank check on appointments, and allow him to resume stacking the courts with his judges. Depending on the outcome of House races, a GOP Senate could also enable the second Trump administration to pursue policy priorities like rolling back the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/31/politics/aca-trump-repeal-affordable-care-act/index.html">Affordable Care Act</a> (ACA) and renewing <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/370753/taxes-debate-trump-harris-irs-tariffs-child-tax-credit">corporate tax cuts</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Republican Senate control will mean</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first Trump presidency was a showcase for what happens when both the White House and Senate are held by Republicans — and a preview of what’s to come.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In his first term, Trump was able to advance his judges at a rapid pace, reshaping the Circuit Court and Supreme Court with conservative picks. In total, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-judicial-nominations-judge-appointments/">Trump was able to get 234 judges confirmed</a>, including the three who now sit on the Supreme Court who proved integral to overturning <em>Roe v. Wade.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similarly, Trump faced little backlash or accountability for his rhetoric or policy decisions throughout his term, including attempts to implement <a href="https://time.com/5322856/trump-travel-ban-republicans/">a Muslim travel ban</a> or to shut down the government as leverage for funding for a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/senate-republicans-all-but-surrender-to-trump-on-wall-despite-shutdowns-toll/2019/01/20/dc3efb96-1b56-11e9-a804-c35766b9f234_story.html">wall along the US-Mexico border</a>. Although some Republican senators spoke out, few truly vocalized their opposition to Trump or scrutinized his actions. When Trump was <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/1/13/22227519/house-second-impeachment-trump-incitement-insurrection">impeached for his role in fomenting the January 6 insurrection</a>, for example, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/2/13/22280838/senate-acquits-donald-trump-impeachment-vote">only seven Republicans voted to convict</a> him — the rest voted to acquit, and only three of those votes to convict will return in the new Congress.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Republicans maintain control of the House, a unified GOP Congress could also help Trump advance his legislative agenda.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has focused more on executive actions he’d like to take (such as <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/374102/trump-harris-tariffs-congress">tariffs</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies">immigration</a>, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382679/trump-foreign-policy-america-first-tariffs-nato-alliance">international relations</a>) than on a congressional agenda. However, Republicans have long expressed an interest in curbing access to the ACA. One issue lawmakers will weigh in the next year is the expiration of ACA premium subsidies, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/06/election-2024-republican-senate-health-care-policy/">Stat reports</a>. House Speaker Mike Johnson has emphasized already that he’s interested in major “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/us/republican-congress-trump-johnson.html">reform</a>” to the health care act as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/us/republican-congress-trump-johnson.html">tax cuts that Republicans passed in 2017</a> are also up for renewal, and will be another issue lawmakers in the next Congress will need to tackle. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kamala-harris-trump-tax-cuts-election-2024-what-to-know/">Trump has suggested cutting</a> the corporate tax rate and has floated some income tax cuts too. Regardless of whether they take the House, Senate Republicans will likely advocate for those cuts. And Republicans could push, too, for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/climate/republicans-climate-change-fossil-fuels.html">expanded oil and gas drilling leases</a> that Democrats had previously curbed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many of those priorities will depend on the outcome of the race to control the House — but with Trump in the White House, the upper chamber will have a significant role to play no matter what.</p>

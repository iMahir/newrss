<p class="has-text-align-none">President-elect Donald Trump was <a href="https://www.vox.com/trump-investigations/2023/8/17/23832734/trump-indictment-democracy-paradox">indicted four times</a> — including two indictments arising out of his failed attempt to steal the 2020 election. One of these indictments <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/352465/trump-convicted-felon-elections">even yielded a conviction</a>, albeit on 34 relatively minor charges of falsifying business records.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the extraordinary protections the American system gives to sitting presidents will ensure that Trump won’t be going to prison. He’s going to the White House instead.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The federal charges against Trump are doomed</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Two of the indictments against Trump are federal, and two were brought by state prosecutors in New York and Georgia. The federal indictments (one about Trump’s role in <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/8/1/23810131/trump-indictment-charges-jan-6-jack-smith-supreme-court">fomenting the January 6 insurrection</a>, and the other about his <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360735/trump-classified-documents-case-cannon-dismissed-indictment">handling of classified documents</a>) are the most immediately vulnerable. Once Donald Trump becomes president, he will have full command and control over the US Department of Justice, and can simply order it to drop all the federal charges against him. Once he does, those cases will simply go away.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The White House does have a <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/restoring-integrity-independence-u-s-justice-department/">longstanding norm of non-interference with criminal prosecutions</a>, but this norm is nothing more than that — a voluntary limit that past presidents placed on their own exercise of power in order to prevent politicization of the criminal justice system. As president, Trump is under no constitutional obligation to obey this norm. He nominates the attorney general, and he can fire the head of the Justice Department at any time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, Trump is reportedly considering Judge Aileen Cannon, a judge who has consistently tried to sabotage one of the Justice Department’s prosecutions of Trump, to be <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/judge-tossed-trumps-classified-docs-case-list-proposed/story?id=114997807">the next US attorney general</a>. Cannon, who oversees Trump’s federal classified documents’ trial, even tried to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/6/13/23757893/aileen-cannon-donald-trump-jack-smith-indictment-mar-a-lago-maga">disrupt the Justice Department’s investigation into Trump</a> before he was indicted. There’s no indication that her apparent loyalty to Trump would diminish if she becomes the nation’s top prosecutor.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The fate of the state charges is a little more uncertain, but they are unlikely to amount to anything either</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The fate of the state charges against Trump is a little more uncertain, in large part because there’s never been a state indictment of a sitting president before, so there are no legal precedents governing what happens if a state attempts such a prosecution (or, in the case of New York, to impose a serious sentence on a president who was already convicted).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is highly unlikely that the state prosecutions can move forward, however, at least until Trump leaves office. On the federal level, the Department of Justice has long maintained that <a href="https://www.justice.gov/file/146241-0/dl?inline">it cannot indict a sitting president for a variety of practical reasons</a>: The burden of defending against criminal charges would diminish the president’s ability to do their job, as would the “public stigma and opprobrium occasioned by the initiation of criminal proceedings.” Additionally, if the president were incarcerated, that would make it “physically impossible for the president to carry out his duties.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s little doubt that the current Supreme Court, which recently held that Trump is <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf">immune to prosecution for many crimes he committed while in office</a>, would embrace the Justice Department’s reasoning. The Court’s decision in <em>Trump v. United States</em>, the immunity case, rested on the Republican justices’ belief that, if a president could be indicted for official actions taken in office, he “would be chilled from taking the ‘bold and unhesitating action’ required of an independent Executive.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The kind of justices who favor such “bold and unhesitating action” over ensuring presidential accountability to the law are unlikely to tolerate a prosecution of a sitting president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These same practical considerations would apply with equal force to a state prosecution of a president, and there’s also one other reason why a constitutional limit on state indictments of the president makes sense. Without such a limit, a state led by the president’s political enemies could potentially bring frivolous criminal charges against that president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This argument may not seem particularly compelling when applied to a convicted criminal like Donald Trump. But imagine if, say, Ron DeSantis’s Florida had attempted to indict, try, and imprison President Joe Biden. Or if the state of Mississippi had indicted President Lyndon Johnson to punish him for signing civil rights legislation that ended Jim Crow.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In constitutional law, the same rule that applies to liberal democratic presidents like Biden or Johnson must also apply to an anti-democratic president like Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One open question is whether Trump could be incarcerated during the lame-duck period before he is sworn into office. The only state that could conceivably do this is New York, as that is the only place where Trump has been convicted. Trump is currently <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/06/politics/judge-delays-trumps-sentencing/index.html">scheduled for a sentencing hearing on November 26 in that case</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The question of whether an already-convicted president-elect can be incarcerated is unique — this situation has thankfully never arisen before in US history, so there’s no definitive law on this subject. But it’s worth noting that neither the New York prosecutors nor the judge overseeing this case have pushed for a quick sentencing process. Judge Juan Merchan chose to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/06/politics/judge-delays-trumps-sentencing/index.html">delay sentencing until after the election</a>, and the prosecution did not oppose this move. Merchan may decide to delay matters even further now that Trump has won the election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And even if the sentencing does move forward, the charges against Trump in New York are relatively minor, and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/06/politics/judge-delays-trumps-sentencing/index.html">could only result in him being fined or sentenced to probation</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Again, there’s never been a state prosecution of a sitting president before, so there are no precedents to rely on here. It’s possible that, once Trump leaves office, New York or Georgia (the other state with an open case against Trump) may try to resume its long-pending prosecutions against him — although that assumes that the 78-year-old Trump survives his second term in office, and that these states still have the will to prosecute him four years from now.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The bottom line is that these prosecutions are likely dead. And they are almost certainly going nowhere for the next four years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The ballot included <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Washington,_D.C.,_Initiative_83,_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Initiative_(November_2024)">Initiative 83</a>, a measure adopting ranked choice voting (RCV); it <a href="https://wtop.com/dc-election/2024/11/dc-voters-decide-council-seats-changes-to-voting-process-on-2024-ballot/">passed overwhelmingly</a>.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ranked choice is an electoral reform that felt like a pipe dream only a few years ago, but has been becoming mainstream over the past decade or so. <a href="https://www.elections.alaska.gov/election-information/#RankedChoice">Alaska</a>, <a href="https://fairvote.org/hawaii_passes_ranked_choice_voting_legislation/">Hawaii</a>, and <a href="https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/upcoming/rankedchoicefaq.html">Maine</a>, have adopted it for some elections to Congress or statewide office. While a small handful of municipalities like <a href="https://www.sf.gov/ranked-choice-voting">San Francisco</a> and <a href="https://vote.minneapolismn.gov/ranked-choice-voting/details/">Minneapolis</a> have used it for decades, they were recently joined by <a href="https://vote.nyc/page/ranked-choice-voting">New York City</a>, <a href="https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/elections/ranked-choice-voting-in-seattle">Seattle</a>, and <a href="https://www.portland.gov/transition/portland-transition-election-code/ranked-choice-voting-election-code">Portland, Oregon</a>. Alongside DC, the states of <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Colorado_Proposition_131,_Top-Four_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Initiative_(2024)">Colorado</a>, <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Idaho_Proposition_1,_Top-Four_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Initiative_(2024)">Idaho</a>, <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Nevada_Question_3,_Top-Five_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Initiative_(2024)">Nevada</a>, and <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Oregon_Measure_117,_Ranked-Choice_Voting_for_Federal_and_State_Elections_Measure_(2024)">Oregon</a> all voted Tuesday on adopting the system, and <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Alaska_Ballot_Measure_2,_Repeal_Top-Four_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Initiative_(2024)">Alaska</a> voted on whether to keep it. Interestingly, only in DC did the system pass.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Full disclosure: I voted yes on the DC initiative. I think it probably does more good than harm in the context of our city. First-past-the-post voting clearly has deep flaws, which is why so many places are jumping on the RCV bandwagon. But I also think RCV’s benefits have been oversold and that we should experiment with other ways to make our elections more proportional.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ranked choice voting, explained</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In ranked choice voting (also called “instant runoff”), voters rank candidates in order. All the first-choice ballots are counted. If no candidate has a majority of first-choice votes, then the candidate with the smallest share is eliminated; their votes are then redistributed based on who their supporters ranked second. This continues until a candidate has an outright majority.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I first encountered the idea after the 2000 election. In Florida, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_United_States_presidential_election_in_Florida#Results">97,488 people voted for Ralph Nader</a>; of whom only 537 would have had to vote for Al Gore to give him the win in the state and thus the presidency. What if those Nader voters — who were overwhelmingly liberal — had been able to rank Gore second? Then this would&#8217;ve happened naturally, and the failure of left-of-center voters to coordinate wouldn’t have resulted in George W. Bush’s presidency, the war in Iraq, etc.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This rationale is also why I support the idea in DC. Here, like a lot of coastal cities, almost all the political competition occurs in the Democratic primary, which is often incredibly crowded. Every four years, good-government folks here try to unseat <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/04/27/anita-bonds-dc-council/">Anita Bonds</a>, our notoriously <a href="https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/645055/anita-bonds-new-bill-threatens-to-scramble-the-councils-already-inadequate-response-to-the-john-falcicchio-scandal/">ineffective</a> <a href="https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/177365/atlarge-councilmember-anita-bonds-outed-a-whistleblower-during-a-public-hearing/">and</a> <a href="https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/553561/anita-bonds-says-shes-never-heard-of-d-c-s-massive-housing-voucher-waitlist/">incompetent</a> at-large city councilor, and every time, multiple challengers wind up dividing the anti-Bonds vote. <a href="https://electionresults.dcboe.org/election_results/2022-Primary-Election">Two years ago</a>, she won renomination with 36 percent of the vote, while two challengers each got 28 percent. RCV would make it harder for unpopular incumbents to get renominated by dividing the opposition.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a narrow tool to avoid spoiler effects, RCV works quite well. But its supporters also have grander ambitions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Katherine Gehl, a wealthy former CEO who has <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23412858/nevada-question-3-final-five-voting-katherine-gehl">bankrolled many recent RCV initiatives</a>, argues that her particular version (called “final five” voting) will almost single-handedly make politicians work together again. <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2022/11/02/katherine-gehl-alaska-has-a-voting-solution-for-a-nation-torn-apart/">Gehl wrote two years ago</a>: </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">Barriers to cooperation fall. Senators and representatives are liberated from the constraints of negative partisanship. They are free to enact solutions to complex problems by reaching across the aisle, innovating and negotiating.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The theory is elegant. In <a href="https://finalfiveelections.org/">final five voting</a>, all candidates&nbsp;— regardless of party — participate in a primary. The top five contenders are then placed on the general election ballot, where voters can rank them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The hope is that this eliminates the dynamic where partisan primaries push party nominees to ideological extremes, and where fear of such a primary prevents incumbents from compromising or defying their party (see the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/with-cheneys-loss-just-2-house-republicans-who-voted-to-impeach-trump-are-on-the-ballot-in-november/">of whom four lost renomination</a> when challenged by a pro-Trump Republican). Then, ranked-choice voting in the general election means candidates compete for No. 2 and No. 3 votes, reducing the incentive to negatively campaign.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The case(s) against RCV</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sounds great! So why would someone oppose RCV?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One possible reason is the finding by political scientist Nolan McCarty that under RCV, <a href="https://electionconfidence.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/FINAL-RCV-study-1-10-24.pdf">precincts with more ethnic minorities see more “ballot exhaustion”</a> (failing to rank as many candidates as one is allowed to). That means, McCarty has argued, that the <a href="https://electionconfidence.org/2024/01/11/ranked-choice-voting-hurts-minorities-study/">reform tends to “reduce the electoral influence</a> of racial and ethnic minority communities.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Work by Lindsey Cormack, an associate professor at Stevens Institute of Technology, has similarly found that “<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1532673X231220640">overvoting</a>” (using the same ranking more than once, which means ballots can’t be counted accurately) is more common in minority communities, while University of Pennsylvania’s <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4670677">Stephen Pettigrew and Dylan Radley</a> have found that ballot errors in general are much more common in ranked choice than traditional elections.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Anything that raises the specter of reducing electoral influence for minority communities in the US is worth worrying about. That said, I’m not sure this case is disqualifying either. Ranked choice is a significant change that takes time for an electorate to understand and adjust to. I’m not sure that higher error rates for a newly adopted approach to voting indicate these error rates will persist as the practice becomes normalized.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To me the more compelling counterargument is that RCV seems unlikely to do anything to reduce partisanship and encourage cross-party compromise. The reason why has to do with the classic case against instant-runoff voting, which you might have heard if you’re friends with <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/social-choice/">social choice theory</a> nerds (as, alas, I am).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One thing you’d want a voting system to do is elect the person who would win in a one-on-one race against every other candidate. This is called the “<a href="https://electowiki.org/wiki/Condorcet_winner_criterion">Condorcet winner</a>,” and while there isn’t always one in an election, when there <em>is</em> one, it seems like a good election system should give them the win, as the person the electorate prefers to all alternatives.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ranked choice voting does not always pick the Condorcet winner, and we’ve now seen multiple real-world elections in which the Condorcet winner (which you can figure out from ranked-choice ballot records) lost. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2303.00108v2">Alaska’s US House special election in 2022</a>, which used ranked choice, the Condorcet winner was Republican Nick Begich, but Democrat Mary Peltola won. Something similar happened in the <a href="http://vermontdailybriefing.com/?p=1213">2009 Burlington, Vermont, mayoral race</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Importantly, in both cases the Condorcet winner was the most moderate of the three main candidates. Begich was to the right of Peltola, but to the left of Sarah Palin (!), the third candidate. In Burlington, the left-wing Progressive Party nominee beat both the Democratic and Republican nominees, though the Democrat (a centrist in Burlington terms) was the Condorcet winner.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">RCV advocates note that these are two cases out of thousands of RCV elections, and that <a href="https://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4874&amp;context=wlulr">in practice, Condorcet failures are rare</a>. I’m not so sure about that.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Research from <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4411173">Nathan Atkinson, Edward Foley, and Scott Ganz</a> used a national ranked choice survey of American voters to simulate what elections would look like under the system nationwide. For each state, they simulate 100,000 elections with four candidates. They find that in 40 percent of cases, the Condorcet winner loses, which suggests that the rarity of Condorcet failures in practice may just be an artifact of RCV being relatively new, and that such outcomes would become more common in time as the method spreads.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Worse, the simulation paper finds that the system results in much more extreme winners (that is, winners who are farther away from the median voter) than one that picks the Condorcet winner. Indeed, &#8220;the states where [the system] performs worst (including Arizona, Nevada, and Georgia) are among the most polarized, whereas the states where [it] performs the best (including Massachusetts, North Dakota, and Vermont) are among the least polarized.&#8221; The system seems to actually encourage polarization, not avoid it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">DC aside, voters themselves on Tuesday mostly opposed RCV.

In <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2024/11/05/preliminary-2024-alaska-general-election-results/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.adn.com/politics/2024/11/05/preliminary-2024-alaska-general-election-results/">Alaska</a>, a ballot initiative to repeal that state’s RCV is currently slightly ahead. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">New America political scientist Lee Drutman was once such a great fan of RCV that he <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/breaking-the-two-party-doom-loop-9780190913854?cc=us&amp;lang=en">wrote a book</a> calling for it, but has in recent years come to think it&#8217;s <a href="https://leedrutman.substack.com/p/how-i-updated-my-views-on-ranked">hardly the cure for polarization and dysfunction</a> he once viewed it as, in part due to findings like Atkinson, et al. A better solution, he argues, is to <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/political-reform/reports/more-parties-better-parties/">strengthen parties</a> and encourage more of them to form.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">States should allow “fusion voting,” in which candidates can run on multiple parties’ lines (New York already does this), and for legislatures, seats should be allocated proportionally: If there are 100 seats, and Democrats and Republicans each get 45 percent of the vote and Greens and Libertarians each get 5, then they should get 45, 45, 5, and 5 seats, respectively.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is a much more radical change than ranked choice voting, and requires a real rethinking by politicians. It’s hard to imagine a DC with multiple functional political parties, or where anyone important isn’t a Democrat. But it’s worth trying it and experimenting. We have learned a lot from trying RCV, and we can learn even more.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Support independent journalism that matters —&nbsp;</em></strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/support-now"><strong><em>become a Vox Member today</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Following a heated presidential contest, political coverage and commentary can feel unavoidable. Kids are not immune — they might be picking up information about the election results from the adults in their lives, at recess, or on social media. As much as parents may think their children are oblivious, research shows kids, including very young ones, are paying attention. One study found that nearly all of the surveyed kids between the ages of 5 and 11<a href="https://news.ku.edu/news/article/2019/08/06/researchers-find-youths-knowledgeable-about-politics-call-even-better-early-political"> could name the candidates</a> running for president in 2016. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Kids as young as kindergarten and first grade can name candidates when they see their pictures,” says <a href="https://www.whitman.edu/academics/majors-and-programs/psychology/faculty-and-staff/erin-pahlke">Erin Pahlke</a>, an associate professor of psychology at Whitman College and a co-author of the study, “and they have a sense of what the candidates believe.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You don’t have to have an in-depth discussion with your child every time they encounter a political topic. When it comes to political conversations with kids, experts say you should answer their questions and quell any fears they may have — but avoid telling them how to think.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When kids are young, teach them about civic engagement</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since children as young as 5 are shown to already have a basic understanding of presidents and elections, you can use this early exposure to guide and inform their knowledge. Kids of all ages can learn about civic engagement through activities like mock elections in school or accompanying their parents to the polls on Election Day, says clinical psychologist <a href="https://melissagoldbergmintz.com/">Melissa Goldberg Mintz</a>, author of<em> </em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Has-Your-Child-Been-Traumatized/dp/1462547494"><em>Has Your Child </em></a><em><a href="https://www.guilford.com/books/Has-Your-Child-Been-Traumatized/Melissa-Goldberg-Mintz/9781462547494?srsltid=AfmBOopzU8cgP9dUWxCAgcx6boSaYPYd55-fu1OnB0NLCoFBcjd1EPcy">Been</a></em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Has-Your-Child-Been-Traumatized/dp/1462547494"><em> Traumatized? How to Know and What to Do to Promote Healing and Recovery</em></a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can use this experience to teach kids how elections work. Children as young as 5 can grasp that voters are choosing between two major candidates from opposite parties and for laws that affect where they live, Pahlke says. If an elementary school-aged child has particular interests — maybe they love trains and buses — you could explain how proposed legislation would impact transportation in your city or town, Goldberg Mintz says. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But don’t get too in the weeds or too prescriptive. “Something we would not want to do,” she says, “is talk about ‘With global climate change and increasing natural disasters, our city is doomed if we don&#8217;t have these protective flood measures.’”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Allow kids to lead the dialogue</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although children are exposed to more political information than their parents realize, their understanding or the conclusions they draw is sometimes incorrect, Pahlke says. Parents have a responsibility to clear up these misunderstandings, she continues, so ask your kids what they know about certain topics. Watching or reading the news together can be an effective way to start a conversation, says <a href="https://www.american.edu/cas/faculty/caporino.cfm">Nicole Caporino</a>, an associate professor of psychology at American University. If any stories trigger fear or confusion, you can discuss the likelihood that their fears will materialize, point out hopeful news stories, and assure them the family will cope with any potential challenges together, Caporino says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Caporino’s research has suggested that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32100153/">most children and adolescents were worried</a> about political issues. Don’t downplay their concerns, Goldberg Mintz says. Do your best to give them an honest answer, but try not to give into fear or negativity, even if you are feeling scared. You might say, “I hear that you’re worried about that, and I have some concerns too. But we’ll figure out ways to get through it if that happens.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Parents should open the door to these conversations, because chances are children might already be thinking about these topics, Pahlke says. However, you shouldn’t offer up too many details if your child isn’t interested. For example, if you ask your elementary-aged kid, “The presidential election is coming up. Have you heard anything?” and they don’t have a strong opinion or say they haven’t talked about it with their friends, you can leave it at that.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We don&#8217;t ever want to volunteer bloody details or gory information that kids don&#8217;t already know about,” Goldberg Mintz says. “We want to be a trustworthy source for them. And if we don&#8217;t know the answer, we want to show them how to get to a trustworthy source.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Teens who are closer to voting age can handle discussions about specific policies, Pahlke says, and parents can explain various perspectives and potential outcomes. Parents can also talk with their teens about the importance of voting, Goldberg Mintz says.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Encourage them to fact-check what they see on social media</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Teens are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/learning/teenagers-tell-us-about-their-relationship-with-news.html">increasingly turning to social media</a> to stay informed, with one 2022 survey finding that half of Gen Z adolescents <a href="https://deloitte.wsj.com/cmo/digital-social-media-power-gen-z-teens-news-consumption-01655136478">source their news from online platforms</a>. If your kid asks you a question about something they’ve seen on social media (or sounds as if it originated there), use this as an opportunity to fact-check those claims with them. Check sources like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/learning/teenagers-tell-us-about-their-relationship-with-news.html">AP </a><a href="https://apnews.com/ap-fact-check">Fact</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/learning/teenagers-tell-us-about-their-relationship-with-news.html"> Check</a>, <a href="https://www.politifact.com/">Politifact</a>, and <a href="https://www.snopes.com/">Snopes</a> and show them where they can find trusted reporting. To <a href="https://newslit.org/educators/resources/is-it-legit/">determine a source’s credibility</a>, the News Literacy Project recommends quickly researching the source of your news, determining if the organization has ethical standards, and assessing the quality of the outlet’s other coverage.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“We don&#8217;t ever want to volunteer bloody details or gory information that kids don&#8217;t already know about.”</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If your teen doesn’t come to you directly with what they’ve been watching online, you might need to gently broach the conversation. In the case of viral disinformation campaigns, you can ask your child, “Did you see people talking about this on social media?” This way you can glean information about what your kid is seeing online and correct any inaccuracies.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Let them come to their own conclusions</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">High schoolers will have more nuanced understandings about certain current events and policies and it’s appropriate to discuss these topics with them, Pahlke says. But rather than paint various candidates or points of view as “good” or “bad,” help them consider different perspectives. Explain why people with various experiences would have different opinions on a topic. It’s fine if they align with a particular candidate or policy, but they should also be able to see where the other side is coming from. Perspective-taking can help them in other relationships, too, Pahlke says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Teens may also have a clear understanding of their personal values and can reflect on how certain candidates or policies reflect these values and goals, Goldberg Mintz says. You can show your teen where to find <a href="https://newslit.org/educators/resources/is-it-legit/">credible information</a> from <a href="https://libguides.rutgers.edu/fake_news">trusted news sources</a> on specific candidates and policies and let them make up their minds. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Rather than trying to get in the weeds about ‘This is the candidate that our family can support, and it&#8217;s because XYZ’ is trying to define a kid&#8217;s beliefs for them,” Goldberg Mintz says. “We let our kids come to their own decisions.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the pandemic prompted a spike in crime, politicians from both parties have been running <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/356269/falling-crime-trends-public-perception-voter-concerns">fearmongering, law-and-order campaigns</a>. And it’s becoming clear that many Americans, including liberal voters, are shifting rightward when it comes to their views on criminal justice, despite the fact that crime rates <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/30/politics/us-crime-statistics-fbi-2024/index.html">have actually been falling</a> since <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/violent-crime-falling-nationwide-heres-how-we-know">2021</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://lao.ca.gov/ballot/2024/prop36-110524.pdf">Proposition 36</a>, a ballot measure in California, asked voters if they wanted to toughen penalties for drug- and theft-related crimes. And on Tuesday, voters said yes by an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-california-proposition-36-increase-sentences-for-drug-and-theft-crimes.html">overwhelming margin</a>. (With more than half of the votes counted, the yes campaign had won more than 70 percent of the vote.) That Californians — some of the country’s most reliable Democratic voters, who previously <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/11/california-prop-47-mass-incarceration/382372/">passed a ballot measure</a> to reduce penalties for low-level offenses — passed a tough-on-crime measure is sure to lead people to believe that Americans more broadly are looking to roll back some of the progressive reforms that many states have passed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The result didn’t come as a surprise. Polls showed that an overwhelming majority of voters <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/24/california-prop-36-crime-initiative-00185192">supported </a>Prop 36, and various Democratic and Republican politicians <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/03/californians-crime-initiative-00186862">had endorsed it</a>. And while California Gov. Gavin Newsom opposed it, he also <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article292749819.html">wasn’t particularly vocal</a> about doing so, and Vice President Kamala Harris, who’s registered to vote in the state, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/03/kamala-harris-proposition-36-drug-theft-crimes">declined to say</a> how she was voting on the measure.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It goes to show that there is a real disparity between what is right as a matter of policy and then where the temperature is as a matter of politics,” said Insha Rahman, the director of Vera Action, a criminal justice reform advocacy group.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not just California. Another ballot measure, which would <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2024/10/13/vg-2024-proposition-128-longer-minimum-prison-time-for-violent-crimes-explainer/">require some people to serve more time</a> in prison before they qualify for parole, <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2024/11/05/proposition-128-results-colorado/">passed by a comfortable margin</a> in Colorado, a reliably blue state, on Tuesday as well.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All are further signs that the criminal justice reform era — that is, the movement that successfully pushed for a more forgiving criminal justice system and for policies to decrease the US prison population — is facing a stubborn and serious backlash. At least for now. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why voters aren’t moved by falling crime rates</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The way people feel about crime doesn’t tend to match up with actual stats. Before the pandemic, crime had been steadily declining across the country <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/04/24/what-the-data-says-about-crime-in-the-us/">for almost 30 years</a>. (Violent crime and shoplifting briefly rose during the pandemic, but overall crime rates have continued to trend downward since.) But almost every year during that period, the majority of Americans <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alNHhdWDfsY">thought crime was getting worse</a>, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/544442/americans-crime-problem-serious.aspx">according to Gallup</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The last few years have been no different. In 2023, the same poll showed that <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/356269/falling-crime-trends-public-perception-voter-concerns">77 percent of Americans</a> believed that crime was increasing despite <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/30/politics/us-crime-statistics-fbi-2024/index.html">FBI data showing</a> the opposite. In 2023, murders were down <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/us/murder-crime-rate-fbi.html">by nearly 12 percent</a>, and in the first half of this year, murders <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/30/politics/us-crime-statistics-fbi-2024/index.html">declined by another 23 percent</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/356269/falling-crime-trends-public-perception-voter-concerns">I wrote earlier this year</a>, there are two main reasons Americans tend to overestimate the extent to which crime happens: Media coverage of crime can often overstate trends and sometimes <a href="https://apnews.com/article/laken-riley-university-georgia-death-nursing-student-a88e92600ab4dcce1a88e121b7b9c722">sensationalizes incidents</a> that grab people’s attention. And law-and-order campaigns — the kind of campaigns that Trump ran, for example — are a mainstay of American politics and appear in virtually every election cycle in local, state, and national races. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the decade before the pandemic, however, criminal justice reform advocates succeeded in highlighting racial disparities in the prison system and the many injustices in various sentencing laws. As the prison population boomed after the tough-on-crime era of the 1990s — and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9540942/#:~:text=The%20United%20States%20experienced%20unprecedented,100%20adults%2C%20were%20behind%20bars.">peaked</a> around 2008 — Americans became more open to having a more forgiving criminal justice system, and law-and-order campaigns saw fewer successes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many progressive reforms aimed at reducing the prison population — including lowering penalties, legalizing drugs, and declining to prosecute petty crimes — passed. States across the country, both <a href="https://www.wdsu.com/article/despite-reforms-louisianas-incarceration-rate-leads-the-nation/34467334">Republican</a> and <a href="https://www.ppic.org/publication/crime-after-proposition-47-and-the-pandemic/#:~:text=One%20critical%20reform%2C%20Proposition%2047,reclassified%20from%20felonies%20to%20misdemeanors.">Democrat</a>, implemented laws that aimed to reduce their overall prison populations. California was a part of that push, and in 2014, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/11/california-prop-47-mass-incarceration/382372/">voters passed a ballot measure</a> to reduce penalties for low-level offenses.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The crime spike in 2020, however, put a stop to that momentum, and Americans started to look at a few of those reforms with some regret. California and Colorado voters aren’t alone. Oregon, for example, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/oregon-governor-signs-a-bill-recriminalizing-drug-possession#:~:text=SALEM%2C%20Ore.,was%20hobbled%20by%20implementation%20issues.">recriminalized drugs</a> after decriminalizing them in 2020, and Louisiana <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/03/09/louisiana-georgia-kentucky-tough-on-crime">passed a slew of laws</a> that reduced parole eligibility and imposed harsher sentences. Progressive prosecutors who championed lowering penalties and loosening enforcement of petty crimes have been <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/23/progressive-da-west-coast-00159559">voted out of office.</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That doesn’t necessarily mean that Americans are irrational: The United States is, after all, a relatively violent country and has <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1374211/g7-country-homicide-rate/">a higher homicide rate</a> than its peers. But while crime is a problem, lawmakers tend to <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/24139552/crime-rates-falling-tough-laws-mass-incarceration">react too quickly to crime trends</a>, often by passing shortsighted tough-on-crime laws that bolster the perception of public safety by, say, putting more cops on the streets, but end up exacerbating the existing flaws of the criminal justice system, including <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/americas-broken-criminal-legal-system-contributes-to-wealth-inequality/">sending poorer</a> and <a href="https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/one-in-five-racial-disparity-in-imprisonment-causes-and-remedies/">more marginalized people</a> to prison.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In California’s case, voters have really been pushing for tougher law enforcement. Earlier this year, San Francisco voters <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-03-09/san-francisco-welfare-drug-screening-police-crime-vote">passed a ballot measure</a> that would subject welfare recipients to drug tests and expanded police surveillance. Now, the rest of the state showed that the appetite for tough-on-crime laws isn’t going away. And the ballot measure in Colorado showed that other parts of the country are probably feeling the same way.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Prop 36 means for California — and the rest of the country</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The new California law would <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/california-proposition-36-increase-penalties-drug-theft-crimes-2024-election/">roll back some previous reforms</a> from the 2014 ballot measure that reduced penalties for low-level crimes. Specifically, it <a href="https://www.kqed.org/voterguide/california/proposition-36">would turn some thefts that are currently classified as misdemeanors into a felony charge</a> if someone has already been convicted of theft at least twice — no matter the value of stolen goods. It would also turn certain drug possession charges that were previously a misdemeanor into a “<a href="https://lao.ca.gov/BallotAnalysis/Proposition?number=36&amp;year=2024">treatment-mandated felony</a>.” That means that people caught with certain amounts of hard drugs would be required to seek treatment, but if they fail to complete it, they could end up serving up to three years in prison.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the last two decades, California’s prison population <a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/graphs/jails2024/CA_prison_jail_populations_1978-2022.html">has significantly declined</a>. But laws like Prop 36 will likely reverse some of that progress. “It is likely that jail and prison admissions will go up in the state of California,” Rahman, of Vera Action, said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More than that, the ballot measure’s success will likely encourage other states to enact tougher laws. If even California’s liberal voters supported the measure, then wouldn’t other constituencies across the country want something similar, if not even tougher? “It will absolutely put wind in the sales of opponents of [criminal justice] reform,” Rahman said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Colorado voters will add to that sentiment. Under Proposition 128, which also passed by a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-colorado-proposition-128-delay-parole-eligibility-for-violent-offenders.html">wide margin</a>, people convicted of violent crimes — including second-degree murder, sexual assault, and aggravated robberies — will have to <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2024/11/05/proposition-128-results-colorado/">serve at least 85 percent</a> of their prison sentence before becoming eligible for parole, <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2024/10/13/vg-2024-proposition-128-longer-minimum-prison-time-for-violent-crimes-explainer/">up from 75 percent</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, these ballot measures don’t necessarily provide the full picture. Rahman, for example, highlights lower-profile battles that criminal justice reform advocates have recently won, including some drug <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2021/03/15/magic-mushrooms-are-decriminalized-in-dc-as-of-today/">decriminalization</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-marijuana-8b91194279bf42c9bc01cbabdab0c015">legalization efforts</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For now, though, there’s one lesson for criminal justice reform advocates: “The big story here is to say that just because we had one high-profile prominent loss, doesn&#8217;t mean the momentum for criminal justice reform is dead,” Rahman said, referring to Prop 36. “Reform is still happening, but it&#8217;s in the shadows, and it&#8217;s on us to pay as much attention to those wins as it is to the one big loss.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Donald Trump left his first term as president amid a raging global pandemic. Now he will return to the White House with public health authorities on high alert for another disease threat.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Public health preparedness is not usually <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/651719/economy-important-issue-2024-presidential-vote.aspx">a top question</a> for voters and neither Donald Trump nor Vice President Kamala Harris were meaningfully pressed on the issue during the 2024 campaign. But they should have been. During Trump’s first term, we saw the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21366624/trump-covid-coronavirus-pandemic-failure">damaging consequences</a> of a leader who is disinterested in science and unwilling to tell uncomfortable truths to his political base. The Covid-19 pandemic would have challenged any president, but evidence <a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/political-party-affiliation-linked-excess-covid-deaths">suggests</a> that Trump’s leadership contributed to unnecessary deaths: As many as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/10/us-coronavirus-response-donald-trump-health-policy">40 percent of American lives lost</a> in the first year of the pandemic, according to one estimate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now we are <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/10/16/bird-flu-pandemic-overall-risk-low-continued-h5n1-outbreak-dairy-cattle-worrisome/">staring down the threat of H5N1</a>, or bird flu, which <a href="https://www.vox.com/health/24118152/explain-it-to-me-bird-flu-human-case-texas-chickens-cows-animal-agriculture">continues</a> to <a href="https://news.cuanschutz.edu/news-stories/avian-flu-has-infected-dairy-cows-in-more-than-a-dozen-states-a-microbiologist-explains-how-the-virus-is-spreading">spread through America’s dairy herds</a> and infect an increasing number of <a href="https://x.com/HelenBranswell/status/1850939370603270311">humans</a>. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-detects-h5n1-bird-flu-swine-first-time-2024-10-30/">announced</a> Wednesday that the virus had been detected in a pig at an Oregon farm; scientists have long worried about the virus crossing into pigs, as they resemble humans genetically more than dairy cows or chickens do. That could increase the risk that H5N1 will evolve in a way that makes it more transmissible among humans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If bird flu were to spiral into a pandemic, we would look back at this as a critical time to prepare. But while the Biden-Harris administration’s response has <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/06/26/bird-flu-outbreak-avian-flu-containment-h5n1-eradication-in-cattle/">certainly been lax in some respects</a>, Trump was on the campaign trail <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter/366472/2024-election-donald-trump-vaccines-schools">threatening to defund schools</a> that require their students to be vaccinated and pledging to install anti-public health establishment crusaders into senior roles in his White House.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the worst comes to pass again, would the sequel be any better?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Probably not, experts told me. I started reporting this story with a smidge of optimism: While Trump had clearly been a <a href="https://www.vox.com/coronavirus-covid19/21497221/donald-trump-covid-19-coronavirus-news-misinformation-study">problematic communicator during Covid-19</a>, his administration was responsible for <a href="https://www.vox.com/coronavirus-covid19/2020/10/7/21504134/trump-covid-19-vaccine-operation-warp-speed-debate">Operation Warp Speed</a>, which delivered effective vaccines in record-setting time and likely saved <a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/report-covid-19-vaccines-saved-us-115-trillion-3-million-lives">hundreds of thousands of lives</a>. That was a major, unexpected accomplishment for which the Trump administration deserves credit.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But rather than lay claim to such a big, beautiful success, Trump has mostly shunned it. Instead, he has embraced America’s most notorious vaccine skeptic, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/6/22/23768539/rogan-rfk-hotez-debate-vaccine-deniers-better">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a>, and promised him a prominent place in the White House. (Republican Sen. Marco Rubio <a href="https://x.com/amconmag/status/1854157641011892447" data-type="link" data-id="https://x.com/amconmag/status/1854157641011892447">told CNN</a> on November 6 that he expects the Senate would be open to confirming Kennedy to a high-level position should Trump decide to put him forward.) That is probably a better signal of what would happen in Trump’s next term.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a future emergency, Trump “would make a political calculation, and not one based on what needed to be done,” Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told me before the election. “Infectious disease in general has been completely subsumed by a tribal lens, and the tribe that is supportive of him is antagonistic to a proactive approach to public health.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What an H5N1 response might look like under Trump</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Let’s establish a couple of things. First, while there has been sustained concern among infectious disease experts this year about H5N1 due to a <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/370804/bird-flu-h5n1-missouri-human-cows-raw-milk">steady drip of human infections</a>, the virus has not yet ignited a pandemic. Maybe it never will. H5N1 has been infecting humans off and on for more than 20 years.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether it’s bird flu or something else, new diseases have been emerging <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8957694/">more often</a> in the 20th and 21st centuries, and many <a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/new-study-suggests-risk-extreme-pandemics-covid-19-could-increase-threefold-coming">scientists expect the frequency of pandemics</a> to only increase as climate change and globalization create more opportunities for diseases to cross over in humans and spread among them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s inevitable that we’ll face another pandemic. The question is only what will cause the next one, and when. For now, H5N1 is the suspect drawing the most attention.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Second, the Biden administration’s response to H5N1 has been <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24140017/milk-bird-flu-safe-dairy-usda-fda">very flawed</a>. Vanity Fair recently<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/inside-the-bungled-bird-flu-response"> investigated the inaction of the USDA</a>, which has taken primary responsibility for the H5N1 response so far because most of the cases have been in livestock animals: chickens, turkeys, and now dairy cows.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">This story was first featured in the <a href="https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup">Future Perfect newsletter</a>.</h2>

</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Experts say the federal agency has been overly accommodating of agricultural industry interests, which has allowed the virus to continue escaping containment and tear through dairy farms across the country. The USDA has largely deferred to states to take the lead on H5N1, and state agricultural officials, especially in big farm states, are typically even more deferential to agribusiness than the federal government.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Missouri, state officials have been <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/09/12/h5-bird-flu-human-infection-missouri-cause-remains-unknown/">slow to act</a> after the discovery of a human case with no obvious connection to farm animals. “They are overtly evading the fact that dairy cattle in Missouri are infected. They don’t want to find them,” Adalja told me.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Adalja said Trump, after he takes over, could actively weaken the federal government’s ability to respond to a pandemic threat.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has said he would <a href="https://time.com/6972022/donald-trump-transcript-2024-election/">“probably” shutter the White House pandemic office</a>, tasked with coordinating a response across the government in a future crisis. He has <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter/366472/2024-election-donald-trump-vaccines-schools">threatened</a> to cut off federal funding for schools that institute vaccine or mask mandates. He has also pledged to slash the government budget and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-cut-cdcs-budget-democrats-claim-analysis/story?id=69233170">singled out</a> the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a candidate for cuts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And while the bird flu response under Biden has been dysfunctional, there has at least been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-provide-nearly-200-million-contain-bird-flu-spread-dairy-farms-2024-05-10/">some attempt to centralize a response</a>. The administration has offered <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/10/health/bird-flu-government-farm-incentives/index.html">nearly $100 million for dairy farms</a> to take preventive measures and has also signed a deal with Moderna to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/02/health/moderna-mrna-bird-flu-vaccine/index.html">develop a new H5N1 vaccine</a>, while <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/us-loading-up-on-bird-flu-vaccine/#:~:text=In%20the%20past%2C%20H5N1%20has,Sanofi%2C%20will%20double%20that%20number.">adding to the stockpiles</a> of existing flu vaccine prototypes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But in another Trump presidency, states could be empowered to take an even more relaxed approach to public health, and leaders in Republican-controlled states would be motivated by the same public health skepticism as their conservative voters. The political environment would be ripe for a free-for-all in state-level responses, amplifying <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02343-4">the divergences we saw during Covid-19</a>, when some states allowed businesses and schools to reopen months before others did and even banned cities from setting mask or vaccine requirements.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A second Trump administration will likely also be staffed by people who are even more skeptical of public health interventions than we saw in his first term. In 2020, Trump still had credible infectious disease experts on his team, like Anthony Fauci, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Deborah Birx, who served as the White House Covid response coordinator, even if he frequently undermined them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Next time, it’s unlikely there would be any such voices in the room. The internal deliberations would instead be dominated by the likes of RFK Jr. or <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/23682263/ron-desantis-covid-19-vaccines-joseph-ladapo">Florida Surgeon General Joseph Lapado</a>, another vaccine skeptic who has been <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/09/trump-anti-vaccine-mandates-00162360">floated</a> as a possible Trump appointee. To lead the USDA, Trump is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/11/trump-eyes-top-texas-maga-disciple-for-usda-chief-00151797">reportedly eyeing</a> Texas agriculture commissioner Sid Miller, who told Vanity Fair that <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/inside-the-bungled-bird-flu-response">bird flu is “not a big deal. It’s not even a little deal.”</a> He has refused to cooperate with the CDC on testing farm workers in his state.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Those types of people are all that’s left” to serve in a Trump administration, Adalja said. “People with expertise are not going to want to be part of it or be selected.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a frightening scenario to contemplate, and it illustrates our collective difficulty planning for unlikely but potentially catastrophic events. We all just lived through an experiment in what happens when the government struggles to respond to a health crisis. Yet even at the beginning of Covid, I heard from public health experts who worried we would not internalize the pandemic’s lessons, that public health would be shunted to the side after the urgency had passed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They’ve mostly been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/11/opinion/covid-pandemic-emergency-lessons.html">proven right</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To be clear, the failure to learn from the example of Covid and prepare now for future pandemics with smart policies — many of which you can read about in Future Perfect’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/23001426/pandemic-proof">Pandemic-Proof package</a> — is bipartisan. There was a stark absence of public health plans from the 2024 campaign, even having endured a pandemic so recently and staring down the possibility of another one so soon. We may end up worse off as a result.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Editor’s note, November 6, 6 am ET: </em></strong><em>Donald Trump <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has won the 2024 presidential election</a>.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Republicans have won a majority in the Senate, flipping the body after four years of Democratic control.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This was the <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings">predicted outcome</a> given how vulnerable Democrats were this cycle: While they were defending nine battleground seats, Republicans were defending only three. The GOP successfully flipped key states<strong>, </strong>including Montana, Ohio, and West Virginia, while holding off unexpectedly competitive challenges in places like <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380855/nebraska-dan-osborn-deb-fischer-senate">Nebraska</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/380707/texas-senate-race-allred-cruz-2024-election">Texas</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The new Republican Senate majority will have a chance to govern with a Republican in the White House, after former President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy">won a second term</a> early on Wednesday morning, defeating Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In their campaigns, Republican Senate candidates leaned heavily on critiques of Democrats’ economic policies as many voters continued to grapple with inflation and high costs of living. They also kept up fear-mongering on immigration, arguing that only they could offer solutions to <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24153132/us-border-crisis-mexico-migrant-immigration-asylum">border crossing surges</a>, like the one in 2023. Overall, because they weren’t in control of the Senate, Republican candidates were able to capitalize on anti-incumbent sentiment — and current discontent — as they campaigned to take back certain seats.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Republicans’ gains will have major implications for the incoming Trump administration. A Republican Senate will offer him a nearly blank check on appointments, and allow him to resume stacking the courts with his judges. Depending on the outcome of House races, a GOP Senate could also enable the second Trump administration to pursue policy priorities like rolling back the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/31/politics/aca-trump-repeal-affordable-care-act/index.html">Affordable Care Act</a> (ACA) and renewing <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/370753/taxes-debate-trump-harris-irs-tariffs-child-tax-credit">corporate tax cuts</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Republican Senate control will mean</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first Trump presidency was a showcase for what happens when both the White House and Senate are held by Republicans — and a preview of what’s to come.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In his first term, Trump was able to advance his judges at a rapid pace, reshaping the Circuit Court and Supreme Court with conservative picks. In total, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-judicial-nominations-judge-appointments/">Trump was able to get 234 judges confirmed</a>, including the three who now sit on the Supreme Court who proved integral to overturning <em>Roe v. Wade.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similarly, Trump faced little backlash or accountability for his rhetoric or policy decisions throughout his term, including attempts to implement <a href="https://time.com/5322856/trump-travel-ban-republicans/">a Muslim travel ban</a> or to shut down the government as leverage for funding for a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/senate-republicans-all-but-surrender-to-trump-on-wall-despite-shutdowns-toll/2019/01/20/dc3efb96-1b56-11e9-a804-c35766b9f234_story.html">wall along the US-Mexico border</a>. Although some Republican senators spoke out, few truly vocalized their opposition to Trump or scrutinized his actions. When Trump was <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/1/13/22227519/house-second-impeachment-trump-incitement-insurrection">impeached for his role in fomenting the January 6 insurrection</a>, for example, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/2/13/22280838/senate-acquits-donald-trump-impeachment-vote">only seven Republicans voted to convict</a> him — the rest voted to acquit, and only three of those votes to convict will return in the new Congress.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Republicans maintain control of the House, a unified GOP Congress could also help Trump advance his legislative agenda.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has focused more on executive actions he’d like to take (such as <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/374102/trump-harris-tariffs-congress">tariffs</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies">immigration</a>, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382679/trump-foreign-policy-america-first-tariffs-nato-alliance">international relations</a>) than on a congressional agenda. However, Republicans have long expressed an interest in curbing access to the ACA. One issue lawmakers will weigh in the next year is the expiration of ACA premium subsidies, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/06/election-2024-republican-senate-health-care-policy/">Stat reports</a>. House Speaker Mike Johnson has emphasized already that he’s interested in major “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/us/republican-congress-trump-johnson.html">reform</a>” to the health care act as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/us/republican-congress-trump-johnson.html">tax cuts that Republicans passed in 2017</a> are also up for renewal, and will be another issue lawmakers in the next Congress will need to tackle. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kamala-harris-trump-tax-cuts-election-2024-what-to-know/">Trump has suggested cutting</a> the corporate tax rate and has floated some income tax cuts too. Regardless of whether they take the House, Senate Republicans will likely advocate for those cuts. And Republicans could push, too, for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/climate/republicans-climate-change-fossil-fuels.html">expanded oil and gas drilling leases</a> that Democrats had previously curbed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many of those priorities will depend on the outcome of the race to control the House — but with Trump in the White House, the upper chamber will have a significant role to play no matter what.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Americans in 10 states cast votes on ballot measures to protect or expand abortion access, and in seven, the measures for abortion rights won. That brings the total <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/11/8/23952090/ohio-election-results-issue-1-abortion-virginia-kentucky-roe-dobbs">to 14 states approving abortion rights referendums</a> since <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Wade </em>was overturned in 2022. <br><br>Ballot proposals sailed through on Tuesday not only in blue states like New York and Maryland, but also in red and purple states like<strong> </strong>Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, and Montana. Missouri, which was the first state to completely ban abortion after <em>Roe</em> fell, is <a href="https://theintercept.com/2024/10/30/missouri-abortion-amendment-3-voters/">now the first state</a> to overturn a ban. All told, the pro-abortion rights measures passed on Tuesday will expand access for millions of women of reproductive age who live in those states, as well as thousands of others traveling from more restrictive areas for care.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The biggest loss of the night was undoubtedly in Florida, where advocates had raised more than $100 million to reverse the state’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/4/5/23668272/florida-abortion-six-week-ballot-measure">near-total ban on abortion</a>. The ban, which took effect this past spring, has decimated access not only for residents living in the third most populous state but also for people across the South who had been traveling to Florida since <em>Roe </em>was overturned. While a majority of Florida voters backed the proposal, which would have restored abortion rights up to the point of fetal viability — typically between 22 and 24 weeks of a pregnancy — Florida law requires at least 60 percent of voters to approve a ballot measure to pass.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This 60 percent “supermajority” threshold is simply a high bar for any referendum, and Florida’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-florida-amendment-4-right-to-abortion.html">earned 57 percent</a>. Of all the winning abortion rights ballot measures that have passed in red or purple states since <em>Roe</em>’s overturn, none have reached that 60 percent level. In 2023, Republican lawmakers tried to raise Ohio’s ballot measure threshold to 60 percent precisely to make it harder for a pending abortion rights proposal to pass, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/8/8/23817989/issue-1-ohio-special-election-2023-results-abortion-rights">and voters rejected the move</a>. Ohio voters ultimately approved their abortion rights <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/11/8/23952090/ohio-election-results-issue-1-abortion-virginia-kentucky-roe-dobbs">measure by 57 percent</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The other losses Tuesday night were in red states, like Nebraska, where voters were confronted with two <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/377639/nebraska-abortion-ballot-measure-trimester-ban-election-reproductive-freedom">(intentionally confusing) constitutional measures</a>, and South Dakota, where reproductive rights groups <a href="https://www.vox.com/24078960/south-dakota-abortion-ballot-measure-dobbs">didn’t help campaign for a ballot measure</a> that would have overturned the state’s total ban. The ballot measure failed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ballot measures have become a powerful tool over the past 2.5 years, giving voters a direct way to challenge abortion bans and often cutting across partisan divides. Measures in red and purple states have won precisely because they’ve earned votes from individuals who otherwise cast ballots for Republicans, libertarians, or no candidate at all. On Tuesday, for example, voters in Arizona, Missouri, and Montana elected Donald Trump, but still cast their ballots in favor of abortion rights.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Anti-abortion groups were determined to end the clean winning streak of the abortion rights movement this year. The 2022 midterms were “a wake-up call that taught us we have a ton of work to do,” Kelsey Pritchard, the state public affairs director for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/19/abortion-on-the-ballot-not-if-these-republican-lawmakers-can-help-it-00087688">told Politico in</a> the spring of 2023. “We’re going to be really engaged on these ballot measures,” she promised.<strong><br></strong><br>And indeed, anti-abortion leaders did lean in much harder this cycle, leveraging a range of new tactics. In Florida, for example, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis actively attacked the proposed ballot measure for months, using his state agencies <a href="https://19thnews.org/2024/10/desantis-florida-abortion-ballot-measure/">to help</a>, including by <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/amp/US/fight-intensifies-florida-ballot-measure-guarantee-abortion-rights/story?id=115222130">threatening local television stations</a> with criminal penalties if they aired ads in support of the abortion rights measure.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Florida Governor Ron DeSantis deserves special recognition for taking the abortion industry head on and setting a new standard for what it means to be a Pro-Life Champion as a state's chief executive,” said Carol Tobias, the president of National Right to Life, in a statement<strong> </strong>after Florida’s measure failed. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, in the end, proponents for abortion rights nationwide raised nearly six times as much as their opponents, according to a recent campaign finance analysis <a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-amendment-campaign-spending-florida-arizona-539217e94f6f96200eff75e8917e525b">by the Associated Press</a>. Abortion rights advocates spent more than three times as much as anti-abortion activists on TV, streaming services, radio, and websites, according to the AP.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“While we are disappointed with the Florida ballot measure election results not<em> </em>meeting the 60% threshold, we still saw the majority of Floridians voting in support of abortion access,” said Nourbese Flint, president of the pro-abortion rights group All In Action Fund. “This outcome is a direct result of anti-democratic tactics designed to undermine the will of the people and Floridians’ access to life-saving medical care.”<br><br>While organizers for abortion rights ballot campaigns have a lot to feel proud of, even in states that have approved measures, rights will not be restored immediately, and in some cases litigation is likely to follow. In Nevada, voters will need to reapprove their measure in 2026 to formally amend their constitution. Moreover, restoring legal rights is not the same as restoring access, and even in states with favorable laws <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/374174/abortion-fundraising-reproductive-rights-election-planned-parenthood-trump-medication">many women still struggle to afford</a> their abortion care. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The abortion rights ballot measures and their results</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>1. </strong><strong>Arizona: </strong><a href="https://azsos.gov/media/308"><strong>Proposition 139</strong></a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Establish abortion as a “fundamental right” up to fetal viability, and permit abortion beyond that if a doctor deems it necessary to protect the patient’s life, physical or mental health.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>It passed.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Know more: </strong></em>Abortion is currently banned after 15 weeks in Arizona with no exceptions for rape or incest. “Next time the nation wonders how much government interference in reproductive healthcare is acceptable, or what type of arbitrary abortion ban is popular, they can look at Arizona and know the answer is 'none',” said Chris Love, a spokesperson for the YES on 139 campaign and a senior advisor to Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">2. <strong>Colorado: </strong><a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/images/2023-2024_89vbb.pdf"><strong>Amendment 79</strong></a><br>Bar any state or local government regulation from interfering with an individual’s right to an abortion, and eliminate the state’s ban on public funding for abortion.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>It passed.</strong><br><br><strong><em>Know more: </em></strong>Colorado is one of seven states without limits on when an abortion can occur. It barred state funding for abortion for 40 years. Overturning that ban means Colorado could start covering abortion for people on Medicaid and state employees.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">3<strong>. Florida: </strong><a href="https://initiativepetitions.elections.myflorida.com/InitiativeForms/Fulltext/Fulltext_2307_EN.pdf"><strong>Amendment 4</strong></a><br>Establish state constitutional protection for abortion up to fetal viability, or when necessary to protect the patient’s health, as determined by their doctor.<br><br><strong>It failed.</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Know more: </em></strong>Three executive agencies within the Ron DeSantis administration aired and distributed ads against Amendment 4. The ACLU of Florida filed a lawsuit alleging the misuse of taxpayer funds, though their case <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article293344699.html">was dismissed</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">4. <strong>Maryland: </strong><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Maryland_Question_1,_Right_to_Reproductive_Freedom_Amendment_(2024)"><strong>Question 1</strong></a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Establish an individual’s “fundamental right to reproductive freedom” including the ability to prevent or end a pregnancy.<br><br><strong>It passed.<br></strong><br><em><strong>Know more: </strong></em>Maryland has very supportive abortion rights laws, and has become a destination for pregnant patients traveling from the South, especially those from North Carolina, Texas, Florida, and Virginia. According to the Guttmacher Institute, the state experienced <a href="https://www.wmar2news.com/local/reproductive-rights-on-the-ballot-question-1-explained">a 26.7 percent increase</a> in clinician-provided abortions between 2020 and 2023.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>5. Missouri: </strong><a href="https://www.sos.mo.gov/CMSImages/Elections/Petitions/2024-086.pdf"><strong>Amendment 3</strong></a><br>Establish a right to reproductive freedom, including contraception, and abortion through fetal viability, with exceptions thereafter to protect the life or health of the patient.<br><br><strong>It passed.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Know more:</strong> </em>Missouri was a leader in restricting abortion. In 1825, it became the second state to ban abortion, after Connecticut in 1821. “All people deserve the freedom to access abortion, to access all reproductive health care, throughout our lives, on our own terms, and with dignity and respect. That’s what we proved today … And today’s win is just the beginning,” said Mallory Schwarz, the executive director of Abortion Action Missouri. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">6. <strong>Montana: </strong><a href="https://archive.legmt.gov/content/Committees/Interim/2023-2024/Senate-Select-Committee-on-Judicial-Oversight-Reform/Meetings/24061213-June-2024/1-CI-128-Ballot-Language.pdf"><strong>Constitutional Initiative-128</strong></a><a href="https://archive.legmt.gov/content/Committees/Interim/2023-2024/Senate-Select-Committee-on-Judicial-Oversight-Reform/Meetings/24061213-June-2024/1-CI-128-Ballot-Language.pdf"><strong><br></strong></a>Establish a state right to abortion through fetal viability, with exceptions to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient.<br><br><strong>It passed.</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Know more: </strong></em>After <em>Roe v. Wade</em> was overturned, Montana’s Republican-led legislature passed several bills to restrict abortion, but the courts blocked them, citing a <a href="https://www.ktvh.com/news/montana-abortion-rights-governed-by-state-law-not-scotus">state Supreme Court precedent</a> dating back to 1999. Abortion remains legal up to viability.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">7. <strong>Nebraska: <a href="https://sos.nebraska.gov/sites/default/files/doc/elections/2024/2024%20Ballot%20Measures%20Pamphlet.pdf">Initiative 434</a></strong><a href="https://sos.nebraska.gov/sites/default/files/doc/elections/2024/2024%20Ballot%20Measures%20Pamphlet.pdf"><strong><br></strong></a>Ban abortion in the second and third trimesters, with exceptions for sexual assault, incest, or medical emergencies.<br><br><strong>It passed.</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Know more: </em></strong>Abortion is already banned after 12 weeks in Nebraska, and this proposal would not prevent further restrictions. Anti-abortion activists sponsored this measure and <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2023/06/29/nebraska-gov-jim-pillen-says-he-wont-stop-on-abortion-seeks-total-ban/">have been</a> clear that they plan to keep <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHpHjqyEPcQ">pushing to entirely ban</a> the procedure in the state.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>8. Nebraska: <a href="https://sos.nebraska.gov/sites/default/files/doc/elections/2024/2024%20Ballot%20Measures%20Pamphlet.pdf">Initiative 439</a>&nbsp;<br></strong>Establish a state constitutional right to abortion up to fetal viability or when necessary to protect the “health or life” of the pregnant patient.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>It failed.</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Know more:</strong></em><strong> </strong>The two dueling ballot measures were confusing to voters, and many signed the petition for the anti-abortion measure thinking they were supporting expanding access. Over 300 Nebraskans later filed affidavits to remove their names, the most in state history.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>9. Nevada: </strong><a href="https://webfiles.clarkcountynv.gov//Election%20Department/2024/State-BallotQuests-24G.pdf"><strong>Question 6</strong></a><br>Establish a constitutional right to abortion through viability, and after when deemed medically necessary to protect the life or health of the patient.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>It passed.<br><br></strong><em><strong>Know more: </strong></em>Abortion is already legal in Nevada until 24 weeks of pregnancy, but advocates want to secure that right in the state constitution. Voters will need to approve the measure again in two years to formally make the change.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>10. New York: </strong><a href="https://elections.ny.gov/2024-statewide-ballot-proposal"><strong>Proposition 1</strong><strong><br></strong></a>Amends New York’s existing Equal Rights Amendment by adding “sex, including sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy,” to its list of protected classes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>It passed.</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Know more: </em></strong>Anti-abortion activists started running ads claiming the abortion rights measure would create "special rights for illegal immigrants" and could block local efforts from dealing with the migrant crisis.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>11. South Dakota: </strong><a href="https://sdsos.gov/elections-voting/assets/2024%20Assets/2024GeneralBQPamphlet.FINALdocx.pdf"><strong>Constitutional Amendment G</strong></a><br>Grants the right to abortion for any reason in the first trimester, allows second trimester abortion only for health reasons, and permits third trimester abortions to protect the patient's life or health.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>It failed.</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Know more:</strong> </em>Nearly all abortions are banned in South Dakota, with no exceptions for rape or incest. However, <a href="https://www.vox.com/24078960/south-dakota-abortion-ballot-measure-dobbs">as we reported earlier this year</a>, the state's measure faced criticism from both local and national reproductive rights advocates, who argued it didn’t go far enough to truly restore access.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Abortion rights looked potent, but it will take time to get a clear sense of what happened</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Going into election night, it wasn’t clear how much abortion rights would matter to voters, compared to issues like the economy and immigration and crime. While it was clear it mattered to voters in the midterms, election experts say those voters — known as “high propensity” or “frequent” voters — tend to <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24101209/abortion-reproductive-freedom-biden-2024-election">prioritize different issues</a> from those who vote only once every four years. Roughly <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/11/01/turnout-in-u-s-has-soared-in-recent-elections-but-by-some-measures-still-trails-that-of-many-other-countries/">160 million Americans</a> cast ballots in the 2020 election, or <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2021/2020-presidential-election-voting-and-registration-tables-now-available.html">67 percent</a> of the voting-eligible population. By contrast, just <a href="https://www.eac.gov/news/2023/06/29/nations-most-comprehensive-report-2022-midterm-election-administration-and-voting">112 million people</a> voted in 2022, or <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/07/12/voter-turnout-2018-2022/">46 percent</a> of those eligible. <strong> </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It was also unclear how much ticket-splitting there would be this cycle, as polarization tends to ramp up in presidential elections compared to midterms. We still don’t yet know the gender or racial breakdown for Election Day voters, although early results indicated that <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/01/women-outpacing-men-early-voting-optimism-harris/75990004007/">women were turning out</a> in higher numbers than men. Women voters make up a slight majority of the voting population, and advocates were banking on women being particularly motivated to protect abortion rights this cycle. We’ll continue to update our coverage as we get more information about how the votes broke down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The 2024 election certainly won’t end the national debate around abortion. The election of Donald Trump to the White House, and Republican control of at least the US Senate, are <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/381773/trump-win-election-abortion-ban-filibuster-dobbs">setbacks for abortion rights advocates</a>, who had hoped to restore access to care. However, the success of abortion rights ballot measures offers more hopeful signs and reaffirms the unpopularity of many state restrictions, even in states where referendums lost.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Abortion rights are winnable in pretty much any state at this point,” said Joey Teitelbaum,&nbsp;a pollster with Global Strategy Group who has worked on nine state abortion rights ballot measure campaigns over the last three years.&nbsp; “People have been very clear about what side they are on, and just because a candidate or a ballot measure loses, it does not change that fact.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Editor’s note, November 6, 6:30 am ET: </em></strong><em>Donald Trump <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy">has won the 2024 presidential election</a>. For more of our 2024 campaign coverage, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382197/trump-harris-live-results-polls-updates-analysis-explainers">click here</a>.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Donald Trump assumes the presidency again in January 2025, he will radically reshape international politics if he keeps his campaign promises.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has made very clear on the campaign trail that he believes major changes to US foreign policy are necessary. “We have been treated so badly, mostly by allies &#8230; our allies treat us actually worse than our so-called enemies,” <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/26/not-just-china-trump-2point0-could-spell-trouble-for-us-allies-as-he-doubles-down-on-tariff-talk-.html">Trump told the audience</a> in September at a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kykpqbOSjI&amp;t=568s">Wisconsin</a> campaign event. “In the military, we protect them, and then they screw us on trade. We’re not going to let it happen anymore.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those aren’t empty promises. Presidents have wide latitude on foreign policy and can enter or nix many international agreements unilaterally.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It really does vary, agreement to agreement, in terms of what the exit criteria are, but there are very few where a congressional approval for withdrawal is required,” Jennifer Kavanagh, senior fellow and director of military analysis at Defense Priorities, told Vox.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In his first term, Trump pursued what he called an “America First” foreign policy, which saw him withdraw from <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2018/5/8/17328520/iran-nuclear-deal-trump-withdraw">major international agreements</a>, launch a <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2018/7/6/17542482/china-trump-trade-war-tariffs">trade war with China</a>, verbally <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/6/28/17513972/trump-nato-russia-putin-nafta">antagonize allies</a>, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2019/2/26/18239694/trump-north-korea-kim-jong-un-vietnam-summit">attempt complex negotiations</a> with <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/7/16/17577096/trump-putin-meeting-nato">several of the US’s adversaries</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This campaign season, he has promised to continue attempts to dramatically alter or otherwise hamper international agreements, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/07/02/nato-second-trump-term-00164517">including the NATO security alliance</a>, in ways that could fundamentally weaken the US’s place in the global order.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of Trump’s stated foreign policy positions, his <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/2024/2/9/24064244/trump-economy-china-tarriffs-today-explained">planned protectionist trade policy</a> would likely be the most immediately damaging to Americans; his <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/374102/trump-harris-tariffs-congress">proposed tariff increases</a> would spark a global trade war and drive up prices for American consumers. In the longer term, his ideas about the US role in international affairs could erode US diplomacy and undermine institutions like NATO and the UN. That could have lasting effects on the geopolitical landscape, much as his first-term foreign policy decisions did.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Trump’s isolationist first administration, briefly explained</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During his first term, from 2017 to 2021, Trump withdrew the US from multiple international agreements, including the <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2018/5/8/17328520/iran-nuclear-deal-trump-withdraw">Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), often called the Iran deal</a>. That agreement, negotiated in 2015 under President Barack Obama, essentially eased US sanctions on Iran in exchange for curtailing its nuclear program and allowing greater international oversight of it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“​The Iran deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into,” Trump said when the agreement was terminated in 2018. Since then, <a href="https://armscontrolcenter.org/a-worthless-withdrawal-two-years-since-president-trump-abandoned-the-jcpoa/">Iran has built up its stockpile of enriched uranium</a> and increased its missile supply, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/investigations/no-evidence-iran-rushing-build-nuclear-weapon-cia-director-says-rcna174004">reportedly bringing the program much closer to developing nuclear capabilities</a> — despite the Trump administration’s promise that Iran would never have them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump also pulled the US out of the Paris climate agreement, which commits all signatories to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Other diplomatic casualties of the Trump administration include the <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-withdraw-united-states-intermediate-range-nuclear-forces-inf-treaty/">Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty</a> (INF), a Cold War-era pact between the US and Russia limiting the development of short- and intermediate-range nuclear weapons; the <a href="https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/openskies">Open Skies Treaty</a>, which allows signatories to conduct military reconnaissance flyovers; and two <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/trump-wants-out-of-global-migration-discussions-cities-want-in/">international migration agreements</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump also repeatedly critiqued NATO during his first term. He argued the other countries in the military alliance weren’t spending enough on defense (and they did <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360160/nato-summit-allies-trump-biden-zelenskyy-ukraine">begin to spend more</a>), questioned whether the organization was still necessary, and in 2020 <a href="https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/trumps-sudden-and-dangerous-troop-withdrawal-germany">withdrew almost 10,000 troops stationed in Germany</a>, a decision Vice President Kamala Harris’s foreign policy adviser Philip Gordon said seemed “designed to send a message about the limit of what Americans are prepared to spend to defend foreign borders and, more broadly, uphold world order.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Trump could do in a second term</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a second term, Trump has pledged to again withdraw from international agreements and organizations.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He explicitly promised to pull the US out of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQcZZbCFL2I">Paris climate accords again</a>, after the US reentered the agreement under President Joe Biden. And Trump could limit US cooperation with UN organizations that his administration was critical of, like the <a href="https://2017-2021.state.gov/update-on-u-s-withdrawal-from-the-world-health-organization/">World Health Organization</a>. He has also floated a variety of new tariffs — at times calling for new taxes as high as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/14/trump-rally-speech-north-carolina-economy-jd-vance/?itid=lk_inline_manual_30">20 percent on US trading partners</a> and recently threatening to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/11/04/trump-mexico-tariff-trade/">impose tariffs of up to 100 percent on Mexico</a>, the US’s <a href="https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/highlights/topcm.html">largest trading partner for goods in 2024</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One partnership that would be difficult for Trump to alter — at least on paper — is the US agreement with NATO. The NATO charter doesn’t have a withdrawal mechanism. As Kavanagh explained, “Recently, Congress passed a law specifically aimed at NATO that would require congressional approval for withdrawal from NATO,” in an effort to further protect the US membership in the alliance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even with that safeguard, there are ways the second Trump administration could hollow out NATO or other US military pacts, such as the one among the <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/new-horizons-korea-us-japan-trilateral-cooperation">US, South Korea, and Japan</a> meant to deter China and North Korea.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“​​Trump can decide to change US posture in any country, whether that&#8217;s Asia or in Europe, and just pull forces out, close bases, stop investing in sort of the joint infrastructure and on all the committees and logistical pieces that keep an alliance running, that keep us tied into allies and partners,” Kavanagh said. “Any president could do that.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But neglecting NATO and alienating those allies is not the only way the second<strong> </strong>Trump administration could damage US foreign policy and diplomacy, according to James Lindsay, a senior fellow in US foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“A lot is going to depend upon how he staffs his administration,” Lindsay told Vox. “We don&#8217;t have a good sense of who would be a secretary of state, secretary of defense, [or] national security adviser.” The people in those positions could have serious implications for all kinds of foreign policy decisions, from how (and if) ceasefire negotiations are conducted to which countries receive weapons transfers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the absence of a robust, experienced diplomatic apparatus, Trump may try to negotiate foreign policy largely on his own, as he has in the past. Those attempts had poor outcomes, like when his <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-at-the-us-north-korea-summit-in-hanoi/">attempt to negotiate with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/7/1/20659074/north-korea-trump-kim-jong-un-dmz">ended in 2019</a> with no guarantees on the North Korean side to stop nuclear weapons development and no fundamental change in the relationship. His talks with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/08/20/trump-peace-deal-taliban/">the Taliban</a> led to the withdrawal of US and NATO forces and the <a href="https://www.vox.com/22626240/taliban-afghanistan-baradar">collapse of the civilian government in Afghanistan</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has made big promises on the types of negotiations he’d conduct as president —&nbsp;like ending the war between <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-russia-ukraine-war-un-election-a78ecb843af452b8dda1d52d137ca893">Russia and Ukraine in 24 hours</a> —&nbsp;but as was the case in his first term, the reality is likely to be much harder and messier than he’s suggested.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No less an authority than Russian President Vladimir Putin has predicted that the coming years in global affairs will be a “<a href="https://www.gmfus.org/news/putins-revolution-and-war-historical-crossroads">revolutionary situation</a>”: a reference to a <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1915/csi/ii.htm">line of Vladimir Lenin’s from 1913</a>, just prior to World War I. Putin’s counterpart in China, Xi Jinping, <a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2024/10/13/vladimir-putins-spies-are-plotting-global-chaos">concurs</a>, foreseeing “changes the likes of which we haven’t seen for 100 years.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This doesn’t mean World War III is inevitable or even likely. But it does mean we are in an era when the decisions of major leaders in moments of crisis could have an outsize impact on global security and the lives of millions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This also is the moment, after a stunning win, when Donald Trump will return to the presidency.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The year 2016, when Trump was elected the first time, didn’t exactly feel like a very peaceful or stable moment in world history. The Syrian civil war and the US-led campaign against ISIS <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/timeline-us-policy-isis">were raging</a>. In June, one of the terror group’s sympathizers <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/06/16/482322488/orlando-shooting-what-happened-update">killed 49 people</a> at a gay nightclub in Orlando. Russian-backed forces were occupying much of Eastern Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">About a month before the election, North Korea conducted its <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/08/asia/north-korea-seismic-activity/">most powerful nuclear test</a> to date. Europe was still in the midst of an <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34131911">unprecedented influx of migrants</a> from the Middle East and Africa, which would end up having dramatic political consequences in several countries. Sen. Ted Cruz was <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/happened-ted-cruz-told-year-girl-worlds-fire/story?id=29673686">terrifying 3-year-olds</a> on the campaign trail by telling them the world was “on fire.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet, viewed from the vantage point of this year, 2016 feels like a simpler time. Wars of all types have gotten <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2024/1/25/24049551/war-increasing-ukraine-gaza-sudan-ethiopia">more common and deadlier</a> around the world in the years since, and superpower conflict — a concern that had largely receded in the post-Cold War era — is back on the agenda.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In short, the global situation Trump will inherit this time around will be far more dangerous and unpredictable. And that in turn raises the risks of his erratic and transactional approach to foreign policy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What was, eight years ago, a localized “gray zone” conflict in Eastern Ukraine is now the first major land war in Europe in decades, one in which Russia’s president has repeatedly <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/353796/us-weapons-ukraine-russia-putin-escalation-nuclear">threatened to use nuclear weapons</a>. Israel’s war in Gaza, already one of the <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/palestinians/2024-08-14/ty-article-magazine/.premium/the-death-toll-in-gaza-is-bad-even-compared-to-the-wars-in-ukraine-iraq-and-myanmar/00000191-50c6-d6a2-a7dd-d1decf340000">deadliest conflicts for civilians</a> of the 20th century, is <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/364148/haniyeh-iran-israel-hamas-hezbollah">fast spiraling into a regional conflict</a> that could involve direct combat between Israel and Iran and could yet drag in the US military.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Further east, potentially even more dangerous conflicts loom. Many North Korea watchers believe the country is <a href="https://www.38north.org/2024/01/is-kim-jong-un-preparing-for-war/">preparing for war</a>, and that the risk of all-out conflict on the Korean peninsula — which <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2018/2/7/16974772/north-korea-war-trump-kim-nuclear-weapon">could potentially kill more than a million people</a>, even if North Korea doesn’t use its nuclear arsenal — has never been higher.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then there’s Taiwan. Even putting aside a death toll on both sides that could <a href="https://authory.com/app/content/ac08ba446e8ca4c4285b79969439856a1">dwarf the war in Ukraine</a>, a war in Taiwan would be a <a href="https://rhg.com/research/taiwan-economic-disruptions/">body blow to the global economy</a>. If the US came to Taiwan’s aid, it could lose <a href="https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/230109_Cancian_FirstBattle_NextWar.pdf?VersionId=WdEUwJYWIySMPIr3ivhFolxC_gZQuSOQ">as many troops in a matter of weeks</a> as it did in 20 years of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some analysts believe China could even <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2021-02/Thomas_Shugart_Testimony.pdf">preemptively attack US bases</a> in the Pacific if it believed US intervention was inevitable, something the US military has not experienced since WWII. And the threat of nuclear weapons use would loom over the conflict: China has the world’s third-largest nuclear arsenal, <a href="http://authory.com/JoshuaKeating/Chinas-plan-to-be-the-next-nuclear-superpower-ada094a58e6db44acad90284fc2d087d4">one that is growing fast</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran — a group <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/axis-upheaval-russia-iran-north-korea-taylor-fontaine">some have dubbed</a> the “axis of upheaval” — may not have much in common in terms of ideology of overall interests, but they are increasingly collaborating: The reported presence of North Korean troops fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/us/politics/north-korea-russia-military-ukraine.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">just the latest example</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of this is to downplay the wars and security threats that existed in 2016 and continued through Trump’s first term, nor the obviously massive disruptive effect of the Covid-19 pandemic. But state versus state conflict, and even superpower versus superpower conflict, is an entirely different matter than war against terrorist groups. Gray zone conflict is a different matter than open warfare. Recent <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24107959/replicator-drones-china-taiwan-ukraine-pentagon">rapid advances in drone technology</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24151437/ai-israel-gaza-war-hamas-artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> are likely to make the wars of the future all the more unpredictable, and potentially more destructive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of which makes the idea of putting back in the Oval Office a president who <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2024/10/23/ambiguity-or-madness-where-harris-and-trump-stand-on-china">proudly calls</a> his foreign policy approach “crazy” so dangerous.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>A world on fire</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even putting aside the issues of Trump’s temperament, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/15/how-big-problem-is-mental-acuity-trump/">mental acuity</a>, or the warnings from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/politics/john-kelly-trump-fitness-character.html">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2024/10/the-generals-warning/680279/">senior</a><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/world/video/the-lead-israel-hamas-middle-east-2024-election-donald-trump-fasciscm"> national security</a> <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/mattis-told-woodward-he-agreed-trump">officials</a> from his own past administration that they believe he is dangerously unqualified for the presidency, there are several reasons to believe a new Trump presidency would amplify this “revolutionary situation” rather than moderate it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, Trump does not put much value on the idea of territorial integrity. It may sound like a wonky academic point, but we tend to take for granted that in our current era, <a href="https://authory.com/app/content/aba6c9c34b4b34f9498e48f63f97e04de">countries rarely conquer each other and borders are rarely changed by force</a>. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has obviously <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-04-06/ukraine-russia-war-return-conquest">challenged this taboo</a> against what the <a href="https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/en/content/purposes-and-principles-un-chapter-i-un-charter#:~:text=Article%202%20(4)%20of%20the,political%20independence%20of%20other%20States.">UN Charter calls </a>the “threat or use of force against the territorial integrity” of other countries.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As president, Trump <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/albertonardelli/trump-russia-crimea">reportedly told other world leaders</a> that the Crimean peninsula, which was illegally annexed from Ukraine in 2014, is rightfully Russian because everyone there speaks Russian. Figures close to the Trump campaign like <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/tucker-carlson-ukraine-war-crimea-russia-state-tv-1776696">Tucker Carlson</a> and <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1576969255031296000?lang=en">Elon Musk</a> have openly endorsed the view that Crimea is rightfully Russian.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump overturned decades of US policy and international consensus by recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/trump-says-he-made-golan-heights-decision-after-a-quick-history-lesson-idUSKCN1RJ01O/">he has described</a> as a snap decision made after a quick history lesson from his ambassador to Israel and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. He <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/12/trump-morocco-western-sahara-israel.html">did the same</a> for Morocco’s claims over the disputed region of Western Sahara, in return for Morocco recognizing Israel. (In fairness, the Biden administration hasn’t reversed either of these moves — once the taboo is broken, it’s hard to reestablish.) For Trump, the president who, after all, mused about <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-eyes-a-new-real-estate-purchase-greenland-11565904223">buying Greenland</a>, sovereignty and territorial integrity are like anything else in a deal: negotiable.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Second, Trump doesn’t value alliances. One reason Russia has not attacked any of the countries bordering Ukraine, even as weapons flow into Ukraine from those countries, is that they are members of NATO, meaning that an attack on them could bring a military response from the alliance as a whole. It’s proof of concept for the most powerful military alliance in history.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump tends to take a narrowly transactional view of alliances. His antipathy to NATO and threats to pull the US out of the alliance <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360160/nato-summit-allies-trump-biden-zelenskyy-ukraine">have been well-documented</a>, as have his comments that treat the US defense of Asian partners like <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/11/15/trump-asks-tokyo-quadruple-payments-us-troops-japan/">Japan</a>, <a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/korea/trump-usfk-sma-10162024034010.html">South Korea</a>, and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-taiwan-chips-invasion-china-910e7a94b19248fc75e5d1ab6b0a34d8">Taiwan</a> as a protection racket.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The third related point is Trump&#8217;s attitude toward nuclear weapons. Defying many predictions <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Bomb/Fred-Kaplan/9781982107307">made at the dawn of the nuclear age</a>, no nuclear weapon has been used in war since 1945, a record that likely involves both a bit of luck as well as the power of nuclear deterrence and the very justified fear these weapons cause. Trump, though, seems a bit more blasé on the topic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to former aides, Trump discussed using a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-discussed-using-nuclear-weapon-north-korea-2017-blaming-someone-rcna65120">nuclear weapon against North Korea</a> as president during the period he was publicly threatening Kim Jong Un’s regime with “fire and fury.” As president, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/us/politics/trump-open-skies-treaty-arms-control.html">withdrew</a> from, or <a href="https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2020/05/trump-administrations-aggressive-approach-arms-negotiatons-could-backfire/165334/">let lapse</a>, a number of key arms control treaties, most famously the Iran nuclear deal, instead preferring an approach where the US would <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-armscontrol/u-s-prepared-to-spend-russia-china-into-oblivion-to-win-nuclear-arms-race-u-s-envoy-idUSKBN22X2LS/">build up its own nuclear arsenal</a> to spend its rivals into oblivion. Recently on the campaign trail, he suggested that a reason presidents need legal immunity is so they could <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/trump-nuclear-president-crime/">use nuclear weapons without fear of legal repercussions</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The issue is not just Trump’s own attitude toward nuclear weapons. In a number of US allies in <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24091566/europe-nuclear-weapons-poland-germany-france-putin-trump">Europe</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/17/world/asia/south-korea-nuclear-arsenal.html">Asia</a>, there is now an active debate over whether they need nuclear deterrents of their own, driven in part by concerns over whether they could actually count on the US nuclear umbrella. Even Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recently suggested that without effective security guarantees from allies, his country might need <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/nato-nukes-volodymyr-zelenskyy-war-ukraine-aid-russia/">nuclear weapons</a> for protection.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The international community’s success at limiting the number of nuclear powers is one of the biggest reasons why the nuclear taboo has remained intact. But a world with more nuclear powers is a world where the use of nuclear weapons is more likely, and that world becomes more likely if allies don’t believe security guarantees are worth the paper they’re printed on.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>An agent of chaos in the Oval Office</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During the campaign, Trump countered that the very fact that the world has become so dangerous is the reason he should be returned to the presidency. He repeatedly made the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2024-06-27/debate-trump-foreign-policy-russia-ukraine-gaza-israel">unprovable claims</a> that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Hamas’s October 7 attacks would not have happened had he been president. He also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/13/trump-falsely-claims-no-terrorist-attacks-no-wars-during-his-presidency/">falsely claimed</a> that there were no terrorist attacks and no wars during his presidency.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those claims elide the major military escalations in Iraq, Syria, and Somalia that took place under his tenure, as well as risky actions like the assassination of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, which prompted an Iranian missile strike on US troops in Iraq. Thankfully, no one was killed in those strikes, but commanders say up to 150 troops <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2021/03/01/al-asad-missile-attack-nearly-killed-150-us-troops-destroyed-30-aircraft-report.html">could have been</a>. As president, he reportedly considered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/05/us/politics/mark-esper-book-trump.html">missile strikes</a> into Mexico and the idea of sending troops into America’s neighbor — and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenroberts/2024/02/07/2023-results-are-in-us-has-new-top-port-trade-partner-export-import">No. 1 trading partner</a> — has evolved into a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/03/us/politics/trump-mexico-cartels-republican.html">mainstream Republican position</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Trump case, essentially, is that he was able to rule the world through fear. In his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, he <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/10/nx-s1-5107967/viktor-orban-hungary-donald-trump-presidential-debate">cited</a> his ideological ally Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán: “Why is the whole world blowing up? [Orbán] said, ‘Because you need Trump back as president. They were afraid of him. China was afraid.’ And I don&#8217;t like to use the word afraid, but I&#8217;m just quoting him. &#8216;China was afraid of him. North Korea was afraid of him.&#8217; Look at what&#8217;s going on with North Korea, by the way. He said &#8216;Russia was afraid of him.’”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump also <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/donald-trump-the-bully-with-a-heart-of-gold-2024-presidential-election-dd922dd6">claimed he threatened</a> to strike Moscow if Putin attacked Ukraine, though it’s not quite clear when this was since Russian troops were in Ukrainian territory throughout the entirety of Trump’s presidency.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also not clear that US adversaries were deterred by Trump’s tough-guy posturing. Trump <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/fact-check-trump-iran-fund-terror-groups/index.html">has maintained that the punishing sanctions</a> he put on Iran after withdrawing from the nuclear deal stopped it from orchestrating attacks in the region, but he had little response after <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/trump-says-he-does-not-want-war-after-attack-on-saudi-oil-facilities-idUSKBN1W10X6/">Iran attacked Saudi oil infrastructure in 2019</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The killing of Soleimani <a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/us-iran-escalation-timeline-march-2020-update">did not stop Iran’s proxies from attacking US troops in Iraq</a>. When it comes to Taiwan, he has suggested that the island is simply too small and <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-would-the-trump-or-harris-administration-approach-taiwan/">insignificant to be worth defending</a> — the kind of rhetoric that might influence China’s calculations over a possible invasion.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Once more unto the breach</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent weeks, world affairs have seemed to be in a bit of a holding pattern, with leaders not making major decisions until they see the results of November 5. Trump may have soured a bit on his onetime good friend Benjamin Netanyahu, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/24072983/biden-trump-palestinians-israel-gaza-policy-different">but in all likelihood</a> — based on his past record — he will apply even less pressure than the Biden administration has to get Israel to reach a ceasefire in Gaza or allow in more humanitarian aid. A Trump win will likely embolden annexationists within the Israeli government, including the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/israels-once-fringe-movement-to-reoccupy-gaza-gains-momentum-9bcb6a28">once-fringe but increasingly vocal movement</a> in favor of reoccupying Gaza with Israeli settlers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Ukraine, Trump promised to end the conflict immediately. Judging by comments made by his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/us/politics/vance-trump-ukraine-russia-war.html">running mate Sen. JD Vance</a>, though, this would likely involve pressuring Ukraine to both cede territory to Russia and accept neutrality, without security guarantees — not far from Putin’s desired outcome. When it comes to China, the outlook is more unpredictable. Trump portrays himself as the ultimate China hawk, except when he believes doing so is <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/08/trump-lies-china-coronavirus-timeline.html">bad for business</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, the question is not whether Trump is a hawk or a dove. It’s what a return of the chaos and unpredictability that marked his first tenure will mean in a world where the risk of cataclysm is now so much higher.&nbsp;</p>

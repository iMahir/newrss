<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Editor’s note, July 14, 2:30 pm</strong> <strong>ET:</strong> This is a rapidly evolving news story that will be updated with new verified information. </em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Saturday, July 13, gunshots rang out as former President Donald Trump addressed a crowd at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Shortly after, Secret Service agents rushed the stage, and Trump was escorted off — his face smeared with blood.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Two people were killed, including the shooter — <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-statement-on-incident-in-butler-pennsylvania">identified by the FBI</a> as Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year old from Pennsylvania. Two other rally attendees <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/secret-service-spectator-killed-critically-injured-after-attacker-111918828">were critically injured</a>. Trump survived — he wrote afterward on Truth Social that a bullet had pierced his upper right ear, and his campaign <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-vp-vance-rubio-7c7ba6b99b5f38d2d840ed95b2fdc3e5">said</a> he was &#8220;fine.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Amid rampant rumor and speculation, here are the facts as we know them right now — and what we still need to learn to fully understand what happened at the rally.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What we know</h2>

<ul>
<li>The moment of the shooting was televised live and filmed by various people in attendance: a burst of three shots <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000009570525/trump-assassination-attempt.html">was followed by</a> a burst of five shots. Trump is seen touching his ear and then with blood on his face; he was quickly swarmed by Secret Service agents and soon escorted offstage. Here is what TV viewers saw and heard:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">BREAKING NEWS: The Secret Service confirms that Trump is &#039;safe&#039; after the former president was rushed off rally stage following reports of possible gunshots in Butler, Pennsylvania. <a href="https://t.co/JCEJ1ZhSqQ">pic.twitter.com/JCEJ1ZhSqQ</a></p>&mdash; Fox News (@FoxNews) <a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/1812269913362276613?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 13, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<ul>
<li>The shots from an <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/trump-rally-shooter-ar-15-style-rifle-secret-111918904">AR-style rifle</a> were fired at 6:15 pm from an “elevated position outside of the rally venue,” after which the Secret Service shot and killed the gunman, per <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/14/nx-s1-5039137/secret-service-investigating-how-trump-shooter-was-able-to-get-so-close">statements</a> from the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/possible-shots-fired-at-trump-rally-in-butler-pennsylvania/">agency</a>. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/13/us/politics/trump-rally-shooting-suspect-video.html">Videos show</a> what appears to be the gunman’s body on a nearby rooftop.</li>



<li>One person attending the Trump rally was killed and two others were critically injured. On Sunday afternoon, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro identified the rally attendee who was killed as Corey Comperatore, a father of two whom <a href="https://www.wpxi.com/news/local/former-fire-chief-shot-killed-trump-rally/HJXCL4CSN5AZJIPZCT6GWFQ4JE/">local news sources identified</a> as a former fire chief.</li>



<li>Trump himself was brought to a local hospital afterward to be examined, but he <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/trump-released-from-hospital-after/">was released</a> late Saturday.</li>



<li>Hours after the shooting, Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112782066045321247">posted on Truth Social</a> that he had been “shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear. I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening. GOD BLESS AMERICA!”</li>



<li>The FBI identified the shooter in <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-statement-on-incident-in-butler-pennsylvania">a statement</a> as a 20-year-old Pennsylvania man, Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old from Bethel Park, a Pennsylvania town about an hour away from the rally site. Crooks had <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/eab599d76197b932/4bf3303b-full.pdf">registered to vote as a Republican</a>, though FEC records show a $15 donation <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?202102049425405473">under his name</a> on January 20, 2021, to the Progressive Turnout Project, which supports Democratic voter turnout.</li>



<li>Multiple major news outlets have reported that Crooks was in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/07/14/us/trump-shooting-election/7cafda68-abc5-5816-9d52-a77ce07ad4af?smid=url-share">possession of explosive devices</a>, citing anonymous law enforcement sources familiar with the investigation.</li>



<li>President Joe Biden <a href="https://x.com/cspan/status/1812282482881941750/video/1">briefly addressed the nation</a> Saturday night, stating, “There’s no place in America for this kind of violence. It’s sick. … We cannot condone this.” The Biden presidential campaign <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-rally-incident/card/biden-campaign-to-pull-down-television-ads-yWBcGSbQDl4lfoGSgXOk">has temporarily pulled advertising</a> in the wake of the shooting, and Biden spoke with Trump on Saturday night, although details about that call have not been made public.</li>



<li>Biden also said Sunday afternoon that he has ordered a full Secret Service review of security plans for Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, this week. He plans to address the nation again on Sunday night from the Oval Office. </li>



<li>Although information on the shooter’s motive isn’t yet known, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/13/trump-shooting-blame-biden-democrats/">several of Trump’s political allies</a> immediately tried to blame Democrats and the media, arguing that their criticism of Trump must have spurred the violence. “This was an assassination attempt aided and abetted by the radical Left and corporate media incessantly calling Trump a threat to democracy,” <a href="https://x.com/votetimscott/status/1812290893312901259">Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) wrote</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What we don’t know</h2>

<ul>
<li>We do not know the shooter’s motive.</li>



<li>The identities of the other two injured audience members at the rally have not been released to the public.</li>



<li>The Secret Service has not yet commented on why their security measures failed to prevent the shooter from having a clear shot at the former president from a nearby rooftop.</li>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Someone just attempted to assassinate former President Donald Trump. We don’t know who, and we don’t know why, but we know they came terribly close to succeeding.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We should all be terrified about what comes next.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">American politics has <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-Were-Polarized-Ezra-Klein/dp/147670032X">recently become trapped</a> in a state of simultaneous stability and instability. It is stable in the sense that there are clearly defined and seemingly unshakeable partisan divisions. It is unstable in the sense that those divisions have grown so deep and so bitter that they threaten the basic faith in political coexistence that any democracy needs to survive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Two years ago, I asked <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22814025/democracy-trump-january-6-capitol-riot-election-violence">some of the world’s leading experts</a> on democratic breakdown about what&nbsp;comes next: How might the seeming crisis of American democracy end? Many of them warned of rising political violence. The more people hate and fear their political opponents, the more likely they are to go outside the law to try to stop them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And when someone on one side is attacked, the other becomes more likely to respond in kind. The ultimate fear is a cycle of violence akin to Italy’s “Years of Lead”: a roughly 15-year period beginning in 1969 in which extreme left and extreme right militias perpetrated a spree of bombings and assassinations.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the time, I wrote that the “most likely flashpoint” for violent escalation was “a presidential election.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Political violence tends to be emotional, perpetrated by angry people who have poor impulse control. In this country, our political emotions are never higher than during a presidential contest —&nbsp;especially when both sides believe that the fate of the republic depends on the outcome.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To be clear, we do not yet know that the shooter was motivated by political grievance. We could be in a scenario akin to John Hinckley’s shooting of Ronald Reagan, an assassination attempt motivated by a <a href="https://people.com/jodie-foster-recalls-man-brought-gun-her-college-play-after-john-hinckley-jr-attempt-8667620">clinically delusional bid</a> to capture the attention of actress Jodie Foster.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But we can say it was clear that the risk of something like this would rise during the election. As would the risk of serious, unpredictable&nbsp;consequences — up to and including further violence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In fact, the very circumstances that make political violence more likely in today’s America are the same ones that render our political system ill-equipped to handle its consequences.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Extreme polarization makes cooperation hard and suspicion natural. Some Republican members of Congress are <a href="https://x.com/MikeCollinsGA/status/1812257581655531669">already</a> <a href="https://x.com/JDVance1/status/1812280973628965109">blaming</a> Democrats for the attempt on Trump’s life. The phrase “<a href="https://x.com/search?q=%22Inside%20Job%22&amp;src=trend_click&amp;vertical=trends">inside job</a>” is currently trending on Twitter.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And it’s not like either party’s leadership is especially trustworthy at this particular moment. President Biden has clearly declined with age and is fighting to maintain his role as nominee. Trump is a victim now, but he’s still the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/11/14/23958866/trump-vermin-authoritarian-democracy">same man he was before it happened</a>. Biden is a steady leader but in a poor position to handle a crisis; Trump is a demagogue who is more likely to raise tensions rather than lower them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The United States is an extraordinary country: the wealthiest and most powerful ever to exist in human history. But it is riven by what might be its greatest internal divisions since the Civil War. The gravity of that particular comparison should underscore both the dangers here and the uncertainty.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A gunman’s bullet has just sent the country hurtling into an abyss. The only question now is how far we fall.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By all accounts, it was an accident everyone saw coming, but the questions and chaos surrounding the October 2021 death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins while filming the Alec Baldwin movie <em>Rust</em> have only grown more numerous in the years since the fatal incident. Now, thanks to a stunning act of prosecutorial misconduct that led the judge overseeing Baldwin’s trial for manslaughter to completely throw out the case, we may never know the answers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The nearly three-year saga reached an extraordinary conclusion on Friday afternoon when Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer, presiding over the trial in New Mexico, halted the trial mid-testimony and dismissed the case against Baldwin “with prejudice” — meaning he can never be retried. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The move came after the prosecution took the stand in a special hearing to admit deliberately concealing evidence from the defense. And not just any evidence — evidence pertaining to one of the central mysteries of the case: How did live rounds of ammunition make it onto the set?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The prosecution, which was headed by a special team assigned by the state to handle this case, testified not only to deliberately withholding the evidence from the defense but also to concealing it. The court heard testimony Friday afternoon that prosecutors misfiled the evidence with a different case number altogether, allegedly so that the defense wouldn&#8217;t be able to easily locate it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Judge Sommer stated in her decision that “The late discovery of this evidence during trial has impeded the effective use of evidence in such a way that it has impacted the fundamental fairness of the proceedings,” and that “there is no way for the court to right this wrong.” Dismissal, she said, was “the only warranted remedy.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The court’s decision not only immediately freed Baldwin, who burst into tears at the news, but could also exonerate fellow defendant in the case, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed. Gutierrez-Reed, the chief weapons handler for the film, was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/closing-arguments-trial-baldwin-shooting-3fdc75c2510804065a19a9fa374cfefd">convicted</a> of involuntary manslaughter on March 6, 2024, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/15/arts/rust-sentencing-hannah-gutierrez-reed.html">sentenced</a> to 18 months in prison for her controversial role in Hutchins’s shooting. Following Friday’s decision, her defense team immediately <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/12/alec-baldwin-rust-manslaughter-case-dismissed-by-judge.html">set about</a> seeking her release.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So what happened here? </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">The new evidence might have provided answers to a longstanding mystery. But we’ll never know now.</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Baldwin’s trial was shaping up to be one of the most high-profile courtroom dramas in years. Prior to its commencement, multiple networks announced that they would be streaming every minute online to thousands of eager trial watchers. What those onlookers received, instead of a glitzy celebrity drama, however, was an abrupt look at how a criminal prosecution can go completely off the rails.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Thursday, Baldwin’s defense <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/alec-baldwin-rust-trial-how-prosecution-fell-apart-key-moments-rcna161671">questioned</a> a prosecution witness, a crime scene technician, about evidence supplied by a new witness, a former Arizona police officer named Troy Teske. Teske, who is a close friend of Gutierrez-Reed’s stepfather, had come forward to police both during and after Gutierrez-Reed’s trial to drop off ammunition that he claimed matched the live rounds used on set.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During her trial, the prosecution had <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/rust-weapons-provider-seth-kenney-provided-live-rounds/story?id=107778471">strongly implied</a> that Gutierrez-Reed brought the live rounds to the set in a state of cocaine-addled confusion or negligence, but no one has ever been able to definitively explain how the bullets wound up on location. Early on, investigators <a href="http://docs.dpaq.de/18064-affidavit_for_search_warrant_no._1_and_warrant_issued_by_court.pdf">speculated</a> that Gutierrez-Reed might have accidentally purchased live rounds from the production’s gun supplier, PDQ Arm and Prop LLC. But Gutierrez-Reed has <a href="https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Gutierrez-Reed-Complaint_Redacted-2_Redacted-USE.pdf">alleged</a> since a 2021 lawsuit she filed against him that PDQ’s owner, Seth Kenney, deliberately mixed live ammunition into the dummy rounds. She claimed this was part of an effort to discredit her due to a personal grudge involving previous accidental on-set discharges.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s a claim her defense, and Baldwin’s, could have used to support their version of events — and this new bullet evidence could have strengthened that argument. According to <a href="https://nmcourts.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/July-11-2024-Defendants-Motion-for-Dismissal-and-Sanctions-under-Brady-Giglio-and-Rule-5-501-752p.pdf">the motion to dismiss</a> filed by Baldwin’s lawyers, the new evidence suggests “that the live round came from Seth Kenney.” The motion also claims that the state “had been aware and had access to Teske for years” without alerting either of the defense teams to his evidence. On the witness stand Thursday, the crime scene technician admitted to knowing about Teske and the bullets. This confession prompted the defense to file the motion and request the hearing which subsequently took place Friday.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s unclear if there’s any connection between Teske’s bullets and the bullets that made it into the gun that day on set, but the problem is that the defense teams never had a chance to find out. The prosecution claimed it had done nothing wrong, but there was dissension in the ranks; one special prosecutor, Erlinda Ocampo Johnson, actually resigned in protest Friday, later claiming she had done so because she felt the state should have <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/prosecutor-resigned-alec-baldwin-rust-case-says-wanted-dismissal-rcna161681" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped the case</a> before the hearing even began.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The other special prosecutor, Kari Morrissey, described as “<a href="https://deadline.com/2024/07/alec-baldwin-trial-dismissed-rust-1236008918/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exasperated</a>” by Deadline, testified on the stand Friday that she had personally decided that there was no link between Teske’s bullets and the <em>Rust</em> set. “I could see it was not at all similar to the live rounds on the set of <em>Rust</em> so I made the decision not to collect the rounds,” she stated.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This is a wild goose chase that has no evidentiary value whatsoever,”she further <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/judge-puts-alec-baldwin-trial-on-hold-to-consider-defense-request-to-dismiss-over-ammo-dispute">insisted</a>. “This is just a man trying to protect his daughter” — in reference to Teske’s friendship with Gutierrez-Reed’s stepfather Thell Reed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The law, however, is quite clear on this point: It’s not up to the prosecution to make that decision. They’re required to turn over all evidence in a case to the defense, period.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>This case unexpectedly gives us insight into one of the most egregious — yet common — forms of criminal misconduct there is</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Under US law, deliberately concealing evidence from the defense is one of the worst things a prosecution can do. It&#8217;s known as <a href="https://theappeal.org/the-epidemic-of-brady-violations-explained-94a38ad3c800/">a Brady violation</a>, and it’s considered a very serious act of prosecutorial misconduct.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a criminal proceeding, the police work directly with the prosecutor’s office while investigating a case and turn over all their evidence directly to them. That means that any defense team must rely on the prosecution to be honest and thorough and turn over all of the evidence in an investigation to them before trial. The integrity of the justice system itself relies upon the prosecution handing over evidence to the defense. Withholding any evidence from them is such a serious offense that — when it’s uncovered — it routinely leads to trials like this one being halted, and to verdicts being overturned.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s truly shocking is how frequently Brady violations occur, despite their seriousness and despite how clear-cut the law is. But the attitude of the prosecution in this case illustrates why and how it happens. Simply put, with the prosecutor controlling most of the evidence, they sometimes think that they can decide on their own what evidence does and doesn’t matter. They can choose to “bury” evidence; for example, slipping it into an enormous case file but not actually notifying the defense of its significance, in the hopes that the defense won’t independently find it. Or, even worse, they can proactively <em>hide</em> the evidence, which the defense alleges is what happened to Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed when the prosecution misfiled Teske’s evidence with a different case number, as though it were part of some other case altogether.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Essentially, Brady violations, whether they happen intentionally or not, expose serious flaws in the criminal justice system. They’re a <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2017/11/08/new-york-courts-say-hand-it-over">leading cause</a> of wrongful convictions, and they can wreak havoc on even the most carefully constructed criminal trial.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The case against Baldwin has arguably never been carefully constructed; at one point, charges against him were dropped only to be <a href="https://abc7.com/alec-baldwin-rust-shooting-explainer-halyna-hutchins/12719228/">reinstated later</a>. Just days before the trial commenced, Judge Sommer threw a wrench in the prosecution’s case when she <a href="https://apnews.com/article/alec-baldwin-trial-rust-shooting-movie-7111ebd9d360a261eade601b5e4ec297">forbade them</a> from introducing his role as a producer on set into their arguments. His role as a producer — on a set fraught with production mismanagement and arguable mistreatment of staff — would likely have been more damning than the claims the prosecution went to trial with. Instead, they were left arguing that Baldwin intentionally pulled the trigger when he handled the gun on October 21, 2021, as Hutchins was filming. Baldwin has always maintained he never pulled the trigger and that the gun fired on its own.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, Gutierrez-Reed’s supporters have long <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/rust-armorer-fair-shot-trial-1235823841/">argued</a> that she had been scapegoated for stressful on-set conditions engendered by the film’s producers; after all, she reportedly spent the weeks leading up to the shooting warning her supervisors of unsafe conditions while seeking — and being denied — more opportunities to attend to gun safety. She’s been serving her sentence since April, but could have her conviction overturned as a result of the facts uncovered by Friday&#8217;s hearing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hutchins’s husband, Matthew Hutchins, had settled with producers in connection with her death, but recently <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/rust-halyna-hutchins-alec-baldwin-settlement-late-1235935392/">re-opened the suit</a> after the <em>Rust</em> production team failed to make the settlement payouts to the family. In a statement after Friday’s courtroom events, the family’s lawyer indicated they would be pursuing civil action against Baldwin. “We respect the court’s decision. We look forward to presenting all the evidence to a jury and holding Mr. Baldwin accountable for his actions in the senseless death of Halyna Hutchins,” Hutchins’s lawyer, Brian Panish, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/prosecutor-resigns-in-alec-baldwin-rust-trial-1235947358/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter#?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">said</a> in a statement.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The new decision comes after nearly three years of twists in a confusing case</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Santa Fe District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies announced <a href="https://abc7.com/alec-baldwin-rust-shooting-explainer-halyna-hutchins/12719228/">exactly a year ago</a> that the county would bring charges against Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed<em> </em>for the cinematographer’s death. Hutchins was killed in October 2021 on a ranch near Santa Fe, after a prop gun Baldwin was holding accidentally discharged. The film’s director, Joel Souza, was also injured in the shooting.</p>

<p>Baldwin was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/31/entertainment/alec-baldwin-charges-rust/index.html">formally charged</a>, but<strong> </strong>prosecutors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/20/arts/alec-baldwin-charges-dropped-rust.html">soon<strong> </strong>dropped</a> all charges against him. Yet the charges were dropped <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2023/04/alec-baldwin-charges-dropped-rust-shooting.html">without prejudice</a>,<strong> </strong>meaning<strong> </strong>prosecutors could still choose to<strong> </strong>refile them or file different charges against Baldwin in the future. Prosecutors claimed to have dropped and subsequently refiled the charges in January 2024<strong> </strong>only because they had new forensic evidence regarding the gun Baldwin fired<strong> </strong>— a Pietta replica of a .45 Long Colt that seems to be the other central figure in this case. Baldwin has long maintained that he never pulled the trigger, but a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/16/entertainment/rust-shooting-gun-report-alec-baldwin/index.html">new forensics report</a> published in August claimed, in an apparent contradiction of previous tests on the prop, that he must have.</p>

<p>On the strength of that new report, the prosecution revived the case against Baldwin. Prior to Friday’s dismissal, he faced up to 18 months in prison.<strong> </strong>Baldwin’s lawyers responded by saying, “We look forward to our day in court.” </p>

<p>The back-and-forth prosecution<strong> </strong>followed an already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/27/movies/rust-alec-baldwin-shooting-report.html">lengthy investigation</a> into the incident by the Santa Fe sheriff’s office that concluded in October 2022. The report, which was <a href="https://deadline.com/2022/08/alec-baldwin-rust-investigation-sante-fe-sherrifs-department-1235090368/">crucial</a> in prosecutors’ initial<strong> </strong>decision to file charges, focused on lapses in safety procedures on the film’s highly criticized set, though it failed to determine the most important factor — exactly how loaded guns with live ammunition made it onto the set. Even after the end of Baldwin’s trial, this issue remains unsettled despite&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2022/10/05/rust-shooting-halyna-hutchins-settlement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">numerous investigations and lawsuits</a>&nbsp;surrounding the production environment on the&nbsp;<em>Rust</em>&nbsp;set.</p>

<p>The assignment of blame has also proved elusive on a set plagued by claims of labor exploitation, rushed work, unsafe conditions, and “<a href="https://digital.abcaudio.com/news/rust-camera-assistant-who-quit-shooting-says-safety-concerns-were-ignored">very fast and loose</a>” handling of weaponry.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What happened on the <em>Rust</em> set?</h2>

<p>No one disputes the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/19/entertainment/alec-baldwin-interview-rust-shooting/index.html">broad facts</a> of what happened on October 21, 2021. Prior to the filming of the scene, Gutierrez-Reed, a props assistant who doubled as the on-set armorer, <a href="https://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_80c3df5b679cb590dcccc6db0e021c7d">examined</a> the gun. She looked inside the barrel, spun the barrel, visually confirmed what she believed were dummy bullets — fake bullets containing no live ammunition — and handed the gun over to assistant director and production safety coordinator David Halls to take to the filming location. (Halls avoided facing trial by pleading guilty to negligent use of a deadly weapon.)</p>

<p>Safety protocol calls for Gutierrez-Reed to have checked all the bullets in front of Baldwin herself — and she claims to have intended to do so, asking Halls to let her know if Baldwin required her to come down to the filming location and directly examine the gun. But according to a <a href="https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Gutierrez-Reed-Complaint_Redacted-2_Redacted-USE.pdf">lawsuit</a> later filed by Gutierrez-Reed, the gun wasn’t actually intended to be used in that afternoon’s filming, and Halls was just “sitting in” with it, keeping it in case it became necessary for later use — which it did when Baldwin decided to rehearse an unscheduled scene that required the gun.</p>

<p>At that point, Halls should have summoned Gutierrez-Reed to come back and further examine the bullets inside the gun. Instead, he yelled, “Cold gun!” — “cold” meaning a gun that was not loaded with live ammunition — to warn the crew that a gun was about to be discharged. Then he handed it over to Baldwin. While Baldwin was following Hutchins’s instructions to aim the gun toward the camera, the gun discharged, striking both her and Souza.</p>

<p>Baldwin has always been adamant that he never pulled the trigger, one of the central questions of the case. He has <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/key-takeaways-alec-baldwins-exclusive-interview-george-stephanopoulos/story?id=81519931">explained</a> that he would never pull the trigger on a prop gun while it was pointed at another human (though <a href="https://sjsunews.com/article/poor-working-conditions-lead-to-on-set-accidents">safety protocols forbid</a> pointing any prop gun at any human for any reason), and that the gun discharged independently.</p>

<p>He instead <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/key-takeaways-alec-baldwins-exclusive-interview-george-stephanopoulos/story?id=81519931">claims he cocked the gun</a> — that is, he pulled the hammer back — and that when he released it, the gun suddenly discharged on its own. Later, FBI <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/gun-rust-shooting-fired-pulling-trigger-fbi-report/story?id=88311336">forensics reports</a> on the same gun apparently contradicted Baldwin, suggesting that this particular prop gun could <em>only</em> be discharged by pulling the trigger after the gun was cocked or partially cocked.</p>

<p>Yet those reports, according to Baldwin’s attorney, downplayed the fact that FBI investigators tried repeatedly to discharge it and were unable to do so, either by pulling the trigger or through any other means. “The gun fired in testing only one time — without having to pull the trigger — when the hammer was pulled back and the gun broke in two different places,” attorney Luke Nikas <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/14/entertainment/rust-shooting-gun-trigger/index.html">stated</a>. “The FBI was unable to fire the gun in any prior test, even when pulling the trigger, because it was in such poor condition.”</p>

<p>The early 2024 forensics report seems highly contestable from the outset because, again, the gun fell apart after the one and only time the FBI was able to get it to fire. In order to conduct testing, the prosecution’s latest forensics expert, Lucien Haag, had to replace the broken gun parts, so his analysis was not based on the gun’s exact condition at the time of the shooting.<strong> </strong></p>

<p>Haag’s testing found that the gun, with replaced parts, was unable to discharge without at least two pounds of pressure being exerted to pull the trigger. He also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/16/arts/alec-baldwin-gun-trigger-rust.html">cited</a> the seemingly careless way Baldwin tended to place his fingers near the triggers of guns as evidence that he could have fired the gun. </p>

<p>The assumption that Baldwin must have unsafely handled the weapon partially led Hutchins’s family to file <a href="https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Complaint-Hutchins-Wrongful-Death.pdf">a lawsuit</a> against him in February 2022. That suit named Baldwin, Gutierrez-Reed, the ammo supplier, and a litany of <em>Rust</em> producers but took as its primary claim the allegation that Baldwin “recklessly shot and killed Halyna Hutchins,” and that he along with the staff had “failed to perform industry standard safety checks and follow basic gun safety rules while using real guns to produce the movie<em> Rust</em>, with fatal consequences.” Baldwin <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2023/01/alec-baldwin-rust-shooting-what-happened-gun-details.html">filed his own lawsuit</a> in November 2022 against Gutierrez-Reed and the <em>Rust</em> producers, alleging that they were culpable for handing him a loaded gun to begin with.</p>

<p>And he has a point: If the gun had contained blanks when discharged — if it had actually been a “cold” gun when Halls handed it over to Baldwin — Hutchins would still be alive.</p>

<p>So how did a gun filled with live ammunition make it onto the set? That&#8217;s the question that might never be answered, thanks to prosecutorial misconduct. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hutchins’s death was part of a disastrous working environment</h2>

<p>Most of the public information about the conditions on the <em>Rust</em> set comes from a <a href="https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/2022-04-19-NM-OSHA-Rust-Summary-of-Investigation.pdf">report</a> completed in April 2022 by the New Mexico Occupational Health &amp; Safety Bureau (OHSB). As a result of the OHSB’s investigation, the agency <a href="https://deadline.com/2022/04/rust-production-company-fined-nearly-137000-1235005600/">fined <em>Rust</em> about $137,000</a> for workplace safety violations, the maximum amount allowed under state law.</p>

<p>The OHSB report found multiple problems with <em>Rust</em>’s on-set production environment, concluding that the production “demonstrated plain indifference to the safety of employees &#8230; failed to follow company safety procedures, which likely would have prevented the accident from occurring &#8230; [and] “did not ensure their own safety procedures [were] followed at the worksite.” The OHSB also castigated specific producers for ignoring their employees’ repeatedly voiced concerns about on-set safety, and rushing the employees who were tasked with ensuring that safety. One employee who voiced concerns and was overridden was Gutierrez-Reed.</p>

<p>“Hannah was tasked with doing two jobs including props assistant and the very important job as armorer but not given adequate time and training days to do so,” Gutierrez-Reed’s attorney <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/gun-rust-shooting-fired-pulling-trigger-fbi-report/story?id=88311336">told ABC News</a>, “despite repeated requests or the respect required of the armorer’s position and responsibilities.”</p>

<p>Indeed, a week before the shooting, <em>Rust</em>’s line producer, Gabrielle Pickle, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/rust-producers-penalized-for-serious-violation-of-safety-law-agency-rules-1235132830/">emailed</a> Gutierrez-Reed to reprimand her for spending too much time on her armory duties — which included inspecting all weapons to ensure their safety — and not enough on her other duties as prop assistant. Gutierrez-Reed replied that “since we’ve started I’ve had a lot of days where my job should only be to focus on the guns and everyone’s safety,” and that “there are working guns on set every day and those are ultimately going to be a priority because when they are not that’s when dangerous mistakes can happen.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to the <a href="https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/2022-04-19-NM-OSHA-Rust-Summary-of-Investigation.pdf">OHSB report</a>, there were two other accidental discharges on set, both on October 16, five days before the incident that killed Hutchins. (In her lawsuit against Kenney, Gutierrez-Reed claimed that her criticism of the production’s primary prop manager for his role in these discharges then motivated the prop manager to conspire with Kenney to effectively set her up.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A third dangerous incident involved a special effects explosive device accidentally exploding.&nbsp;It was partly in response to these incidents that one of Hutchins’s camera assistants, Lane Luper, quit the job the day before Hutchins’s death — citing rampant safety violations in his <a href="https://digital.abcaudio.com/news/rust-camera-assistant-who-quit-shooting-says-safety-concerns-were-ignored">resignation email</a>, among many other exploitative work conditions.</p>

<p>Another crew member, Jonas Huerta, also resigned the same day, again citing exploitative, unsafe, and rushed working conditions. “I also feel anxious on set,” he <a href="https://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_80c3df5b679cb590dcccc6db0e021c7d">wrote</a> in his resignation email. “I’ve seen first hand our AD [the assistant director, Halls] rush to get shots and he skips over important protocols.”</p>

<p>The reinstated criminal charges related to Baldwin seem to involve his specific act in handling the weapon, rather than his broader role as one of the film’s producers. But the lack of charges filed against any of the other producers on set, several of whom more directly oversaw the frazzled, unsafe filming conditions that led to the multiple accidental weapons discharges, is puzzling. The OHSB report criticized specific producers, including head producer Ryan Smith, for failing to take workplace safety concerns seriously despite repeated complaints by staff. Pickle also faced scrutiny for actively scolding Gutierrez-Reed, including ordering her off armorer duty and limiting her time spent training the cast and crew on how to safely handle weapons.</p>

<p>It seems baffling, given this type of evidence, that Santa Fe prosecutors opted not to bring charges of negligence against the producers — charges that seem clearly provable according to the available evidence. The initial charges of involuntary manslaughter against Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed seemed much harder to prove given how confused their roles were.</p>

<p>What does seem clear is that, on this set and likely on many others, Gutierrez-Reed was one of countless crew members who were<strong> </strong>underpaid, overworked, harangued by equally frazzled supervisors, and pushed to cut corners to save money and time. Five days before Hutchins’s death, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/iatse-strike-explained.html">narrowly avoided</a> an employee strike in response to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/07/hollywood-film-industry-union-wages-conditions">pervasive exploitative conditions</a> throughout Hollywood, including the prevalence of minimum-wage gigs, stretched workers, strenuous labor conditions, and wide gender gaps in pay rates and opportunities.</p>

<p>Hutchins’s death, as tragic as it is, seems to be the latest culmination of terrible working conditions found not just on set but throughout the industry. The <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369118X.2023.2166363?journalCode=rics20">advent of streaming media</a>, the strain of <a href="https://www.mediapolisjournal.com/2022/05/labor-immobility-supply-chain/">supplying content</a> in a post-pandemic world, and a widespread culture of demanding tireless work for little pay all contribute to the kind of callous disregard for safety and for employees that resulted in the <em>Rust</em> working environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And while <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2023/01/inside-the-vfx-union-brewing-in-hollywood.html">unionization</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ia_stories/">efforts</a> are bringing some meaningful change to the industry, Hutchins’s death arguably stands as a far greater indictment of the industry as a whole than individual indictments against <em>Rust</em>’s on-set players could ever be.</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the credos for the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders is that cheerleaders, by their definition, are supposed to make everyone feel better — even when they themselves aren’t feeling particularly cheerful. That seems innocent enough, but across the seven hours of Netflix’s <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81685878"><em>America’s Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders</em></a>, we see DCC management weaponize this altruism to inflict a host of harms, from eating disorders and broken hips to embarrassingly low wages and performances in horrendous temperatures. Now, after watching the series, I think I better<strong> </strong>understand one of the most dark-sided frauds ever perpetrated on American women. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The punishing system that creates these picture-perfect performers is built on a pyramid of harmful ideals, sky-high expectations, regressive beauty standards, dangerous physical demands, seductive but false ideas of sisterhood, and exploitative working conditions. Throughout the show, we witness firsthand behavior that’s usually only brought to light when someone decides to blow a whistle on a sorority, a fraternity, or a cult: the type of manipulation and skewed thinking that’s usually never discussed until the traumatic ordeal is over.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The most compelling thing about <em>America’s Sweetheart</em>s isn’t that this behavior exists. It’s that it’s all caught proudly on camera. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The seven-episode docuseries centers on the creation of the 2023 DCC squad. Each year, veteran cheerleaders and rookies try out in the hope of snagging one of the 36 spots. The rule is that you can be a DCC for five years but have to try out each time, competing with a fresh set of younger, more athletic, perhaps more talented newbies. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s all up for grabs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From the jump, we’re told how important the DCC have been to the Cowboys; the squad is perhaps just as famous as the professional football players when it comes to brand recognition. From calendars to magazine spreads to Barbies, the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders are a money-making entity for the billion-dollar organization. They’re a business within a business, one that doesn’t depend on winning seasons as much as it does visibility. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Determining who makes it and who gets cut are director Kelli Finglass and her henchwoman and head choreographer Judy Trammell. Kelli and Judy, as they explain to the camera, are both DCC alumni appointed by Charlotte Jones, a scion to the ultra-rich family that owns the Cowboys. Since the ’90s, Kelli and Judy (but primarily Kelli) have been tasked with turning the DCC into an extremely popular, super profitable, impossibly wholesome and simultaneously sexy cheerleading squad. This means Kelli and Judy must ensure the cheerleaders stay relevant and desirable year in and year out. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>America’s Sweethearts</em> isn’t the DCC’s first reality rodeo. Kelli and Judy were part of another DCC series, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dccmakingtheteam"><em>Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders: Making the Team</em></a>, which began in 2006 and ran for 16 seasons on CMT before moving to Netflix.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/Americas_Sweethearts_Dallas_Cowboys_Cheerleaders_E1_00_48_20_12.pngAmericas_Sweethearts_Dallas_Cowboys_Cheerleaders_E1_00_48_20_12.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4613147178592,100,93.077370564282" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&quot;Welcome to the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, we hope you survive the experience!&quot; | Netflix" data-portal-copyright="Netflix" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">As Kelli and Judy admit, both were inducted into the DCC in an era when there was less emphasis on dancing skills. It’s unclear whether their current authority is based on real-life experience or just handed down from the Jones family. Yet, they inflict their arbitrary standards of “professionalism” and “appeal” with a self-righteous confidence.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Like the guards who ran with too much power in the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/6/13/17449118/stanford-prison-experiment-fraud-psychology-replication">Stanford Prison Experiment</a>, Kelli and Judy whittle down DCC training camp to those 36 spots in sometimes cruel ways. Their cuts and critiques look more like hazing than business decisions. They’re shown ripping one hopeful’s appearance after giving her the brunette makeover that they find so unappealing, picking apart the smiles of women who applied online, and asking each other “What’s her &#8230;? She’s Indian?” when evaluating a South Asian dancer during live auditions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the most pathos-filled examples of this is the strange ire the two seem to harbor toward four-year veteran Victoria Kalina. I say “seem to” because Kelli and Judy never say they don’t respect Victoria, but they certainly act like it. Victoria is, according to DCC lore, the daughter of alumnae Tina Kalina, who Kelli and Judy describe as one of the most alluring cheerleaders ever to put on the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders uniform. Ostensibly the pair — especially Kelli — are friends with Tina and cannot be as mean to her daughter as they are to the women whose moms aren’t former DCCs. Somehow this results in something even meaner.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Victoria’s legacy affords her some protection, but also yokes her to a bad situation that clearly makes her feel terrible about herself. Kelli and Judy tell Victoria in so many ways that not only does her personality pale in comparison to her mother, but that she also needs to lose weight. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think it’s harder for girls not to just wanna starve themselves,” Victoria says in a confessional, as the camera shows Victoria eating a lunch that consists of a bowl of watermelon, three or so slices of turkey sandwich meat, and two rice cakes. Victoria and other DCC vets and alums explain that the uniform they wear, particularly the hot pants, are tailored to their bodies and aren’t resized. That means veterans, especially four- and five-time returning stalwarts, have to keep their bodies the same size over the course of years. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Victoria looks at the uniform, she says, she thinks, “Oh man, I need to lose at least three pounds.” It is heavily indicated that she took time off to get healthy after a bout with disordered eating.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/Americas_Sweethearts_Dallas_Cowboys_Cheerleaders_E7_00_53_37_03-1.pngAmericas_Sweethearts_Dallas_Cowboys_Cheerleaders_E7_00_53_37_03-1.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4812273582611,100,93.037545283478" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Victoria, one of the show&#039;s star cheerleaders, isn&#039;t the coach&#039;s favorite. And they tend to remind her at every opportunity. | Netflix" data-portal-copyright="Netflix" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Throughout the season, when Victoria and her cohort aren’t performing to Kelli and Judy’s standard, they ask Victoria and the other women if they are “fueling” themselves properly — a nutrition double-speak to ask if they’re eating. That might pass as genuine concern if the DCC set these women up with resources like nutritionists or trainers. Or if Kelli and Judy hadn’t been captured throughout the series, and in archival footage, haranguing women about their midsections.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Much of this fueling, practicing, criticism, and self-recrimination happens in the name of a routine called “Thunderstruck.” Throughout the series, candidates and coaches talk about “Thunderstruck” as if it were some holy ritual, and as though you’re an alien from a different planet if you’ve never heard of the classic routine set to a whirling, waa-waaa-ing 1990 AC/DC song. Judy explains over and over again that “Thunderstruck” is so complicated that even though the DCC attracts the best dancers, many of them ballet- and jazz-trained, few of them are able to perform “Thunderstruck” to her liking. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To be clear, I am no dancer and not up to date on the nuances of dance, but the moves in “Thunderstruck” are predominantly fancy prances, body rolls, and hair tosses, choreographed in the loosier-goosier era of the DCC’s dance standards. If one can rhythmically undulate from their hips and has enough hair to fling, one can perform the majority of “Thunderstruck.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Judy and Kelli both admit that even today, their selections are more about the overall appeal of a DCC cheerleader than her dancing ability. Despite their strict expectations, they constantly, accidentally raise questions about their own credentials. If routines like “Thunderstruck” are passed down from DCC class to DCC class, then what “choreography” is Judy bringing to the table? If dancing wasn’t required of her to be a cheerleader, what makes her fit to lead now? And further, what kind of excellence does Kelli possess? Other than her supernatural ability to make the beautiful and talented women trying out feel so ordinary and wanting.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With Kelly and Judy picking apart their appearances and stuffing them into shorts that they may have to fit into for five years, the DCC — rookies and vets — are seen helping each other and forming strong friendships. They do things together like teach Reece, a rookie and recent Alabama graduate, what to order at Starbucks since she has never ordered from a Starbucks before (she gets a strawberry refresher because she likes strawberries).<strong> </strong>They have prayer circles where they talk about grace and forgiveness and share stories about dancing as kids. They all show up for each others’ engagement parties. Even Victoria is seen taking rookies under her wing and teaching them steps. This is the camaraderie and wholesomeness that the organization — all the way up to Charlotte Jones, the filthy-rich nepo baby Judy and Kelli answer to— loves to talk about on camera. These beautiful, talented, friendly women are the face of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. They’re so valuable. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But this spirit is so thoroughly undercut by the behavior of the women in charge that you wonder if this sisterhood is something that exists in spite of management rather than because of it. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the final two episodes, Sophy, a returning veteran, is part of an off-camera incident. During the Thanksgiving Game, she tells DCC officials and police that a cameraman at the game inappropriately touched her as she was coming onto the field during the third quarter. The news eventually reaches Kelli, who is busy reading DCC praise off her phone (Dolly Parton was a surprise halftime performer with the squad).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kelli almost dismisses it at first, stating that Sophy “is talking to the right people” and not getting up from her seat. Then, she makes eye contact with the camera, seems to remember she’s being filmed, and then asks about how Sophy is. Kelli eventually pulls Sophy off the field and asks if she needs water. No one from the DCC sits with Sophy as she gives her statement to the police, and in a title card, the show explains that the police were not able to pursue the charges. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The most damning material, though, might come from extensive interviews with Kat Puryear and Caroline Sundvold, two DCC alums who spell out what happens when your years (a max of five) with the DCC are done.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the pair remain heavily involved in the DCC social world — attending engagement parties and alumni events — they honestly explain that post-cheerleader life is like falling back to Earth. Caroline, who is hobbling on a walker or crutches at a couple of points in the series, explains that five years of jump-splitting (a jump where you land in the splits) in “Thunderstruck” tore her hips to the point of requiring surgery. She also needed foot surgery after her season and was, at the beginning of the series, sharing a studio apartment with her sister Anna Kate, who she encouraged to try out for DCC. Caroline, who seems to be wandering in a depressive fog, wonders out loud if her glory days are done. </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/Americas_Sweethearts_Dallas_Cowboys_Cheerleaders_001.pngAmericas_Sweethearts_Dallas_Cowboys_Cheerleaders_001.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.2242446125819,100,93.551510774836" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="According to Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, once you make the team your uniform can never be re-sized. For some women, that means wearing the same size of hot pant for five years. | Netflix" data-portal-copyright="Netflix" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Kat, an alum of the same year, tells the camera that it’s been hard to find a job after DCC. In between applying for interviews, Kat explains that the pay for a DCC is comparable to a fast food worker. Should one become a DCC, <a href="https://time.com/6994498/dallas-cowboys-cheerleaders-salary-americas-sweethearts-netflix/">pay is allegedly</a> $15-$20 per hour, $500 per game day, and up to $75,000 per year, provided the cheerleaders take advantage of professional and event appearances. The lack of pay explains why most of the women trying out for the DCC have day jobs; some of them are nurses or orthodontists. Meanwhile, the Dallas Cowboys organization is, <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/cowboys/news/jerry-jones-dallas-cowboys-named-most-valuable-sports-team-world-franchise#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20Cowboys%20generated%20%241.05%20billion,Barcelona%2C%E2%80%9D%20Kurt%20Badenhausen%20wrote.">according to Sports Illustrated,</a> worth $9.2 billion and had a 2022 revenue of $1.05 billion. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One would think that the DCC, which is so important to the Dallas Cowboys — as Kelli, Judy, and their boss Charlotte constantly remind us — would be worth more than what they’re being paid. The Dallas Cowboys certainly have enough money to do it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Making someone believe that belonging to something is so crucial to their existence that they should give up things that make them happy is exactly the kind of quality that the most effective <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area/24133960/america-cult-internet-culture-end-monoculture-communication-tribalism">cult leaders</a> possess. As is constantly reminding your followers that they’re part of a “sisterhood” or “family” or “something special,” as Kelli, Judy, and their boss Charlotte also like to say, all of which apparently outweigh things like your health or financial security.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The DCC are far from the only women in the US told they should be honored at the opportunity to fit into a narrow and deleterious mold, from pageant queens to sorority rushes to even new mothers and women on dating apps, these kinds of sharp, exhausting standards are de rigueur in American life. Like a pair of DCC hot pants, it’s all a trap — but it&#8217;s easier to see when women are starving themselves to fit into unyielding short shorts. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The natural question is whether the hunger, humiliation, low pay, broken hips, and casual judgment of Kelli and Judy are all worth it. Perhaps there’s some kind of calculus to becoming a Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader that we’re still not privy to. Maybe there’s something there that seven hours couldn’t possibly capture. Or perhaps that rationalization is part of the same hollow fantasy that fuels the DCC.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/357948/url-harris-replace-biden-trump-debate-reaction-polling-vice-presidency">There are a lot of reasons Vice President Kamala Harris</a> would be the obvious successor to President Joe Biden if he decides not to run again this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether he actually will has been an open question since <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357788/biden-trump-debate-winners-losers">Biden’s disastrous debate performance on June 27,</a> when he stumbled over his answers, offered non sequiturs on different topics, and failed to communicate key achievements. Those missteps came amid heightened scrutiny of his age, and were followed by recent press appearances where he’s confused <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/ce78zklp77wo">the names of major figures</a>, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/359160/biden-abc-news-interview-drop-out">offered hard-to-follow answers</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All that’s led to discussion among pundits and grassroots Democrats alike about <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357936/biden-harris-buttigieg-newsom-whitmer-pritzker-convetion-debate-2024">who would fill in for Biden</a> with just under four months until Election Day. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has been a popular suggestion, as has California Gov. Gavin Newsom.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But perhaps no one makes as much sense as Harris, who’s already in a role designed to take over for a president unable to continue their duties.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As VP, she’s steeped in the policy work of this administration, and has extensive experience in the White House that she could bring to the job. And she could well be an energizing candidate for many Democratic voters as the first Black and South Asian woman to have the party’s presidential nomination, and as a younger, charismatic alternative to the 78-year-old Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump. Logistically, it would also be fairly easy to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-biden-fundraising-election-campaign-donations-5709f07420b4f138caa884361653368e#">transfer Biden’s $91 million in campaign funds to Harris</a> (and more difficult to hand that money over to someone else).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, Harris has real vulnerabilities — which have been evident during her tenure as VP and as a 2020 presidential candidate — that could potentially bog her down. Notably, <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article289792134.html">her favorability ratings have sometimes lagged Biden’s</a> while she’s been vice president, and a common critique she faces is that she hasn’t been able to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/magazine/kamala-harris.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/magazine/kamala-harris.html">carve out a distinct lane for herself</a>. When she ran for the presidency in 2020, she fielded similar issues, leaving people confused about what she stood for.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Taken together, there’s still a strong argument for Harris to step in, if Biden drops out of the race. Notably, though, there are also some key challenges she’ll have to overcome.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The case for Kamala Harris taking over for Biden</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Harris were to take over for Biden, she’d have some version of the incumbency advantage as the sitting vice president. Though there are important caveats, as detailed by <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/23562688/joe-biden-2024-presidential-election-polls-democrats">my colleague Andrew Prokop</a>, roughly two of three incumbents have won reelection.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As part of that advantage, Harris would be able to tout her role in the Biden administration’s wins — like the Inflation Reduction Act, which will help lower prescription drug costs and invest in climate initiatives, and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which includes historic funding for bridges and roads. She’d be able to point, too, to the experience she’s garnered as vice president and how it’s prepared her to become commander-in-chief.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a strategy Biden himself successfully employed in 2020, when he <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/16/20863343/joe-biden-barack-obama-2020-democratic-presidential-primary">linked himself to the Obama administration’s achievements</a> — and emphasized how <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/04/26/remarks-vice-president-joe-biden-foreign-policy-camapaign-event">he was often the “last one in the room”</a> when key decisions were being made.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“When you think about all these legislative pieces that were passed in Congress, the vice president was part of the conversations with the president, with the Cabinet, whether it was the infrastructure bill, or the IRA, or the CHIPS bill,” <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/3/27/23655248/kamala-harris-vice-president-approval-criticism">former Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, who’s worked alongside Harris, previously told Vox</a>. That experience, in itself, is significant and invaluable.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the fall of <em>Roe, </em>Harris has also taken on the mantle of abortion rights, meeting with advocates and voters across the country, and rallying people on the issue in places like Wisconsin, Arizona, and Florida.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This subject has been particularly motivating for Democratic voters and women in recent elections, with multiple ballot initiatives — like <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23451074/abortion-ballot-measure-midterms-kentucky-montana-michigan">those in Vermont and Michigan</a> — passing with overwhelming support. During the 2022 midterm elections, protecting reproductive rights was a central policy for many voters, and a decisive one that helped boost Democrats. Harris’s defense of abortion access is a point that would allow her to paint a sharp contrast with Trump, who has taken credit for <em>Roe</em>’s demise and argued that abortion should be decided on a state-by-state basis.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition to the experience she has in the White House, Harris also brings legislative expertise from her four years in the Senate, and background on criminal justice reform from her time as attorney general in California. Although some of her tenure as vice president has been plagued with communications missteps, she’d previously been known for her viral moments questioning Trump appointees as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and made a big splash in 2019 during a debate confrontation of Biden over his past stance on busing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris could infuse the ticket with new energy as well. Numerous polls have found that majorities of Americans don’t want Biden on the ballot, including a <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/contest-for-president-still-up-for-grabs/">July 2024 PBS News/NPR/Marist</a> survey placing that number at 56 percent, and want to see <a href="https://wapo.st/469LlsL">options other than Biden or Trump</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris could potentially be that alternative. At 59, she’s decades younger than both the current nominees. And she’s also emblematic of both an increasingly diverse Democratic Party and country, making her a candidate who could be especially motivating for key voting constituencies including Black women. (<a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/trackers/kamala-harris-favorability">In a July 2024 YouGov poll,</a> Harris’s favorability numbers were at 41 percent with adults overall, and 69 percent among Black respondents.) That could bode well for better turnout and enthusiasm.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“She’s the second Black woman elected to the Senate, which in a state like California is no small feat,” says University of Maryland public policy professor <a href="https://spp.umd.edu/our-community/faculty-staff/niambi-carter">Niambi Carter</a>. “So she’s shown that she can get voters, white, Black, Latino, and others, to come to the polls.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Experts note, too, that bypassing Harris for another candidate — especially a white one — could run the risk of fracturing support from Black voters and other key Democratic constituencies, says <a href="https://split-ticket.org/author/lakshyajain97/">Lakshya Jain</a>, the CEO of electoral analysis site Split Ticket.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think there would be significant voter backlash,” Jain told Vox. “It would rupture the party and create negative news cycles for quite a while, and the eventual nominee would emerge quite wounded and with a massive amount of ground to make up among Black voters.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, on the logistics front, Harris would be able to make the transition a bit more seamlessly because she could inherit Biden’s fundraising apparatus and campaign staff, as former White House press secretary <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTNUhvweM/">Jen Psaki explained in a TikTok post</a>. “Structurally, she could just move the campaign staff, she could move all their resources over,” Psaki noted.&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The case against Harris</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For all the strengths she’d have as a nominee, there have also been issues Harris has struggled with as vice president, and as a presidential candidate in 2020. And those could haunt her should she be Democrats’ 2024 presidential nominee.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Notably, while she’s remained liked by a number of Democratic constituencies, her overall favorability and approval numbers haven’t been the strongest. As a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/">FiveThirtyEight aggregation</a> found, Biden has 37 percent approval from all US voters, while Harris has <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/">38 percent</a>. And she’d be seen as a continuation of the Biden administration, meaning she could be simply viewed as “more of the same” by voters who aren’t happy with the policies or positions it’s represented. Per surveys from this past year, voters are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/podcasts/the-daily/trump-biden-poll.html">interested in change</a> and have expressed discontent with the status quo.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris also hasn’t always defined herself — and what she stands for — that clearly.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2020, that was evident in how she sought to adopt both progressive and moderate policy stances, seemingly losing members of both constituencies. She’s especially struggled with the left and its often younger voters: Despite her self-described position as a progressive prosecutor, she was called out by grassroots progressives  during the 2019 campaign for actions she’d taken on truancy as well as wrongful convictions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This same overarching issue has emerged in her vice presidency, when some critics have argued that she hasn’t established what issues she owns or been clear about what she’s been able to achieve.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">White House officials have previously highlighted her extensive work on foreign policy, immigration, voting rights, and reproductive rights. That’s a broad portfolio, and staffers who’ve worked with her have described the catch-22 that it can feel like Harris faces: if she chose solely to work on one issue, for example, she risks getting pigeonholed. If she works more broadly, as she has opted to do, she’s criticized for not being dedicated to just one area.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And though she’s been an effective communicator in a number of high-profile cases ranging from her questioning of former Trump Attorney General Jeff Sessions to a major speech she gave on the 50th anniversary of <em>Roe</em>, she’s also been pilloried for statements that have been commonly derided as sounding like “<a href="https://nypost.com/2023/12/20/news/kamala-harris-serves-up-another-word-salad-as-discusses-most-election-of-our-lifetime/">word salad</a>.” Those remarks have prompted some to wonder if she’d be able to be a strong enough messenger for Democrats during this pivotal time.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her record with staff has been scrutinized by reporters, too, due to the turnover that’s taken place in her office across the roles she’s held, raising questions about her management style. Stories emerged about her <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kamala-harris-staffers-toxic-office-culture-dysfunction-2021-7">attorney general</a> office and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/30/kamala-harris-office-dissent-497290">her VP office</a> detailing what some staffers describe as a difficult work environment that stemmed from the top. Such reports fuel concerns about what leadership would look like in a Harris White House, though her office is far from the only one to have <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/tracking-turnover-in-the-biden-administration/#:~:text=President%20Biden's%20%E2%80%9CA%2DTeam%E2%80%9D,Biden's%20Cabinet%20turnover%20is%2013%25.">seen turnover</a> in these roles.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And latent sexism and racism among voters is a key worry some Democrats have raised. “I don&#8217;t know that a lot of people want to admit this, [but] I think there are a lot of people who are uncomfortable with a Black woman being the president,” says Carter. Candidates of color and women, including former President Barack Obama, have long had to navigate such biases &#8212; <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna24284188" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna24284188">and electability concerns</a> &#8212; though he was ultimately able to win in spite of them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Overall, these dynamics indicate that a Harris nomination, like any other, would come with both pros and cons. In the difficult situation that Democrats find themselves in, Harris’s strengths could well outweigh her vulnerabilities — if she can address them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In talk about what a second presidential term for Donald Trump might bring, one name has become the shorthand for all the horrifying things that might await: Project 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/09/trump-project-2025-heritage-foundation/">been called</a> “authoritarian” and “dystopian.” It’s the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/Project-2025?lang=en">talk of TikTok</a>. Some Democrats <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/11/biden-democrats-project-2025-trump/74349980007/">see it as</a> the ace in the hole that could save President Joe Biden’s struggling reelection campaign. But Trump is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/05/trump-project-2025-disavowal/">now claiming</a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/trump-allies-project-2025/index.html">implausibly</a>, to know nothing about it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So what is it?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Project 2025 is the conservative movement’s detailed and specific plan for what the next Republican president should do with his power, including its preparation to put that plan into action. Basically, it’s an attempt to make the second Trump term way more organized and effective than the first.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Organized by the right-wing think tank the Heritage Foundation and advised by <a href="https://x.com/Prjct2025/status/1809276867347681759">more than 100</a> conservative groups, Project 2025 has put forth a <a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf">922-page</a> list of policy recommendations, going agency by agency in the federal government.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is not a pie-in-the-sky policy agenda full of bold but empty promises. It is crafted to be a list of things the next president’s appointees really can do, put together by many people who served in top posts under Trump last time and could well do so again. (Project 2025 is also collecting a database of names of conservatives who could take jobs in Trump’s second term.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But what does it say? Are its proposals as terrifying and extreme as progressives are claiming? And are they really what Trump would end up doing?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The answers are a bit complicated because Project 2025 encompasses a lot of different things (and there are some claims about what’s in it that are simply false). I think of its agenda as falling into three buckets:</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>1) Concentrating power in the presidency</strong>: The idea here is to give Trump and his appointees more power over the executive branch relative to permanent nonpartisan civil service professionals (who he disparages as the so-called “deep state”). Critics fear this will lead to the abuse of power and political hackery. Trump supports these ideas and we have every reason to believe he’d implement them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>2) Achieving longtime conservative priorities: </strong>This is stuff like slashing regulations, reducing federal spending on the poor, ditching efforts to fight climate change, ramping up military spending, and so on. Many progressives think these ideas are terrible, but they aren’t exactly new. Trump supports basically all of these. (Project 2025 mostly avoids taking firm positions on issues where Trump breaks from the conservative consensus, such as trade.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>3) Taking a hardline religious-right agenda</strong>: The project lays out quite aggressive proposals to use federal power to prevent abortions and restrict certain contraceptive coverage. It even says that pornography should be “outlawed” and its creators and distributors should be “imprisoned.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These last ones are the proposals Trump may be most wary of. “Some of the things they’re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal,” he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/05/trump-project-2025-disavowal/">wrote on TruthSocial</a>, without specifying which things he meant. But the reality is that these are all major causes of some of Trump’s most important and loyal political allies, people he frequently rewards with key appointments. If he hands them key posts again in his second term and neglects to rein them in, the abortion proposals in particular could well come to pass.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, there are also many claims circulating about things purportedly in Project 2025 that are not in fact in there (it does not, for instance, propose ending no-fault divorce). But much of its 922 pages do indeed seem to be a plausibly accurate guide to what Trump would pursue if elected.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who is behind Project 2025? Is it Trump?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The story of Project 2025 starts with the Heritage Foundation. Since its founding in the 1970s, Heritage has styled itself as the main think tank of the conservative movement. Its goal is to push the Republican Party toward a further right agenda so that GOP officials listen more to ideologues and hardliners, not moderates and the traditional party establishment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Heritage does this partly by crafting and advocating for policy proposals. They also try to be a sort of “administration-in-waiting” when the GOP is out of power, with experts on their payroll who can join a newly elected administration. In some ways, Project 2025 is not new: The Heritage Foundation has been releasing extremely long (and extreme) plans for what the next conservative president should do <a href="https://prospect.org/politics/2024-07-10-project-2025-republican-presidencies-tradition/">since 1980</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet the dynamics this time around are different, in part due to Heritage’s close ties to Trump and in part due to the unusual situation where a former president is trying to regain office.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ordinarily, there’d be a fair amount of ambiguity about who the next president would appoint to his administration if elected. But Trump has been president before, and when he was, he heavily relied on Heritage appointees. (After his unexpected 2016 win, he needed to quickly staff an administration and come up with policies, and <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/140271/dc-think-tank-behind-donald-trump">Heritage</a> was <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/trump-transition-heritage-foundation-231722">ready</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/magazine/trump-government-heritage-foundation-think-tank.html">waiting</a>.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">About two-thirds of authors and editors involved in Project 2025’s plan served in the Trump administration. HUD Secretary Ben Carson, acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller, deputy White House chief of staff Rick Dearborn, former OMB director Russ Vought, and top DHS official Ken Cuccinelli contribute chapters, just to name a few. And John McEntee, the White House personnel director who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-white-house-purge/2020/11/13/2af12c94-25ca-11eb-8672-c281c7a2c96e_story.html">purged</a> officials viewed as disloyal to Trump, has a key role in <a href="https://www.heritage.org/press/former-ppo-director-john-mcentee-joins-project-2025-personnel-database-launches">collecting staff recommendations</a> for the project. (<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/trump-allies-project-2025/index.html">CNN reported</a> that at least 140 former Trump administration officials were in some way involved in it.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump also <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/project-2025-trump-heritage-foundation-what-know-rcna161338">praised</a> the Heritage Foundation at an April 2022 event, calling it a “great group” that would “lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do” when “the American people give us a colossal mandate to save America.” (Obviously, that conflicts with <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112734594514167050">his recent claim</a> that he has “no idea who is behind” it and that he has “nothing to do with them.”) Much of the plan also seems crafted to appeal to Trump specifically, and there’s tons of stuff in it that he openly supports.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Having said all that, it does appear true that Project 2025 was crafted without Trump’s personal involvement. It was put together <a href="https://www.heritage.org/press/project-2025-publishes-comprehensive-policy-guide-mandate-leadership-the-conservative-promise">in early 2023</a>, before Trump had actually won the nomination again, and while Heritage was cultivating close ties to Florida Gov. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/conservative-think-tank-emerges-force-behind-desantis-campaign-2023-08-18/">Ron DeSantis</a> too. It’s a plan for what movement conservatives, including many close Trump allies, hope to do, but he hasn’t necessarily signed onto all of it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is actually in Project 2025?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The main Project 2025 policy document is, again, <a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf">922 pages long</a>. After an introduction by the Heritage Foundation’s president, there is a separate chapter for each major executive branch agency or office. Each is written by someone with expertise on that office’s capabilities — often someone who could, conceivably, run that office if Trump returns to power.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The details, within three broad categories, break down along these lines.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>1) Concentrating power in the presidency</strong>: Trump’s allies believe that his first term failed because he couldn’t get enough “loyal” appointees in place and because the “deep state” bureaucracy sabotaged him. So a main recurring theme of Project 2025 is how to bend the executive branch to a conservative president’s will.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“A President today assumes office to find a sprawling federal bureaucracy that all too often is carrying out its own policy plans and preferences — or, worse yet, the policy plans and preferences of a radical, supposedly “woke” faction of the country,” Vought, Trump’s former OMB director, writes in one chapter. “The modern conservative President’s task is to limit, control, and direct the executive branch on behalf of the American people.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Project 2025’s proposals to achieve that goal include:</p>

<ul>
<li>The “Schedule F” plan to reclassify tens of thousands of civil servants as political appointees, so they could be fired and replaced with Trump cronies. (Trump issued this order in late 2020 but left office before it could be implemented, and Biden rescinded it.)</li>



<li>Reconsidering the traditional separation between the White House and the Justice Department (something that could give the president more direct control over criminal investigations)</li>



<li>Installing a “vast expansion” of political appointees at the DOJ in particular</li>



<li>Expanding performance-based pay for the civil service (which sounds fine in theory, unless the performance evaluations are politicized)</li>



<li>Letting political appointees apportion federal funds (currently civil servants do this, and proposals that the government do otherwise <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/08/20/federal-funds-omb-apportionment-trump/">have been met</a> with fears of politicization)</li>



<li>Expanding White House review of military promotions to ensure promoted officers aren’t too focused on “climate change” or “manufactured extremism” (that is, domestic right-wing extremism)</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>2) Longtime conservative priorities: </strong>The vast majority of Project 2025’s policy plan is focused on longstanding conservative priorities — with some tweaking and elisions for the Trump era.&nbsp; Though some are indeed quite extreme, they’re not all that new or specifically tied to Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are far too many to list here, but just as a flavor:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Education</strong>: Eliminate the Department of Education, give every parent a <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/23689496/school-choice-education-savings-accounts-american-federation-children">voucher-like option</a> they could use to send their child to private school, zero out federal funding to low-income schools over the next decade, greatly cut “wasteful” school meal programs, and end Biden’s student loan forgiveness programs</li>



<li><strong>Energy and environment</strong>: Deprioritize fighting climate change, repeal Biden’s clean energy subsidies, further unleash oil and natural gas production, roll back various environmental regulations</li>



<li><strong>Health care: </strong>Majorly cut <a href="https://pnhp.org/news/critiquing-project-2025-medicaid/">and overhaul Medicaid</a>, roll back the recent law banning surprise medical billing</li>



<li><strong>Immigration</strong>: <a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/project-2025-unveiling-the-far-rights-plan-to-demolish-immigration-in-a-second-trump-term/">Deny</a> loan access to students at “schools that provide in-state tuition to illegal aliens,” ban non-citizens from living in federally assisted housing (even if they live with a citizen), reinstate and expand the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/08/politics/border-patrol-del-rio-horse-investigation/index.html">horseback-mounted Border Patrol</a></li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On a few issues — trade, antitrust, the Export-Import Bank — the plan states that the conservative movement is divided, and lays out the thinking of two different sides on each issue. On the question of Social Security and Medicare, which Heritage has long supported overhauling but Trump does not, the document is basically silent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>3) A hardline religious-right agenda</strong>: There are also parts of Project 2025 that, while not exactly surprising for conservatives, are quite extreme in ways that are politically problematic for Trump. The plan calls for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Revoking FDA approval of the abortion pill mifepristone, which <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2024/3/21/24105984/supreme-court-mifepristone-abortion-pills-fda-alliance-hippocratic-medicine">is used</a> in about half of US abortions (“Abortion pills pose the single greatest threat to unborn children in a post-<em>Roe</em> world,” the document states)</li>



<li>Using an old law known as the <a href="https://www.vox.com/abortion/351678/the-comstock-act-the-long-dead-law-trump-could-use-to-ban-abortion-explained">Comstock Act</a> to prosecute people who send abortion pills through the mail</li>



<li>Ending the mandate for insurance to cover the “week-after” contraceptive pill Ella (which the document argues is a “potential abortifacient”)</li>



<li>Crack down on “abortion tourism” in liberal states by requiring states to report where women seeking abortions live and cutting federal funds if they refuse</li>



<li>Ending subsidies for stem cell or fetal cell research</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a fiery introduction by Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts, Project 2025 also calls for banning porn:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-left"><em>Pornography should be outlawed. The people who produce and distribute it should be imprisoned. Educators and public librarians who purvey it should be classed as registered sex offenders. And telecommunications and technology firms that facilitate its spread should be shuttered.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Roberts also adds that pornography is “manifested today in the omnipresent propagation of transgender ideology and sexualization of children,” suggesting that he may define “pornography” much more broadly than is typical — that he may view any attempt to explain or teach about trans people as worthy of outlawing and imprisonment.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is reflective of a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/trump-conservatives-pornography-fight/index.html">broader push</a> from religious and cultural conservatives. (The demand for porn prohibition does not show up in the document again after Roberts’s introduction, making it unclear how it would be implemented.)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s not in Project 2025</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Project 2025 has captured the attention of progressives, various lists purporting to lay out what’s in it have spread online. Some of these lists <a href="https://x.com/Sky_Lee_1/status/1810370456064840086">are largely accurate,</a> but others contain exaggerations and falsehoods.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://boingboing.net/2024/07/07/a-list-of-the-terrible-things-project-2025-has-in-store-for-us.html">Contrary to some online claims</a>, Project 2025 itself does not call for ending no-fault divorce, a complete ban on abortions without exceptions, a ban on contraceptives, raising the retirement age, teaching Christian beliefs in public schools, ending marriage equality, banning Muslims from entering the country, or abolishing the FDA and EPA.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, various Heritage Foundation experts and allied groups who signed onto the project have indeed called for many of these things at various points and hope to work toward such goals. Here are Heritage links in support of <a href="https://www.heritage.org/social-security/commentary/should-the-social-security-retirement-age-be-raised-yes">raising the retirement age</a> and a nationwide <a href="https://www.heritage.org/protect-unborn-life-and-family-formation">abortion “heartbeat” ban</a>. (Trump, of course, called for “a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2015/12/07/458836388/trump-calls-for-total-and-complete-shutdown-of-muslims-entering-u-s">complete and total shutdown</a> of Muslims entering the United States” during his 2016 campaign. He also called for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/26/republican-candidates-donald-trump-eliminate-epa-law-experts">abolishing the EPA</a>.) But such proposals are not in the document itself.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">If Trump wins, how much of Project 2025 will happen?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lots!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the level of broad principles, Trump supports much of Project 2025’s ideas. He has appointed many of its authors, and may well appoint many of them again. The proposals are mostly crafted to be achievable through executive authority alone.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s every reason to believe a second-term President Trump will go full steam ahead with centralizing executive authority in a way that could enable major abuses of power, and with pursuing much of the typical conservative agenda through the executive branch.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are a handful of things that he probably won’t do — like the porn ban, something he has never supported or shown any seeming desire to pursue.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The big uncertainty is around the abortion-related topics.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In his first term, Trump happily handed over key appointments to anti-abortion conservatives, including the Supreme Court justices who eventually overturned <em>Roe v. Wade</em>. And now that <em>Roe</em> is gone, those loyal allies of his want more.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While running for office, Trump has been wary of the demands of anti-abortion activists. He has been vague about what he’d do with federal authority over abortion policy if elected, saying that he wants to leave the issue to the states.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But what would he do once the election is in the rearview mirror? Would he appoint anti-abortion hardliners to key posts? If so, would he overrule them if they took extreme measures, given his intermittent interest in the nuts and bolts of governance?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We can’t know for sure. But given Trump’s current vagueness, there are good reasons to believe he’d reward his loyal allies once he’d no longer be punished for that at the polls. Which means some of the most extreme Project 2025 ideas could well come to pass if he wins.</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The president of the United States proved himself capable of speaking in complete sentences during a press conference Thursday night.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This was notable because, before the presser, President Joe Biden’s competence at the most rudimentary aspects of public speaking had come into doubt. At both the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357788/biden-trump-debate-winners-losers">first presidential debate</a> in late June and his interview <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/359160/biden-abc-news-interview-drop-out">with ABC News</a> last week, Biden repeatedly failed to produce coherent English on command.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a perfectly rational world, the abysmal quality of Biden’s previous public performances should have <em>raised</em> the bar for him at Thursday’s press conference: If you just demonstrated that you’re a dreadful candidate at your worst, then winning your party’s confidence should require showing that you are an absolutely <em>brilliant</em> one at your best. Otherwise, why should your co-partisans tolerate your manifest unreliability?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But this is not how all Democrats see things.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many in the party are reluctant to publicly defy their president, who has made his desire to stay in the 2024 race clear. And they also have <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/02/16/senior-democrats-joe-biden-old-00083129">little faith in Vice President Kamala Harris</a>, who is by far the most likely Democrat to replace Biden at the top of the ticket. For these reasons, some Democratic lawmakers would like to believe that the case for Biden to step aside isn’t crystal clear. But the president’s disastrous debate performance forced such Democrats to entertain the idea that Biden was an anchor around their party’s neck. As the press revealed that Biden had been <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/joe-biden-age-public-election-campaign-343a47bf">suffering such mental lapses</a> with increasing frequency — and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/03/us/politics/poll-debate-biden-trump.html">polls</a> showed the president and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/12/us/politics/democrats-biden-battleground-states.html">his party</a> slipping — the ranks of the rebellion-curious swelled. Before Thursday’s press conference, CBS News <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/potentially-dozens-of-democrats-expected-to-call-on-biden-to-step-aside-after-nato-conference/">reported</a> that “dozens” of congressional Democrats were considering calling for Biden’s exit after the event.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet some of these reluctant rebels evidently found cause for wavering in Biden’s news conference.<strong> </strong>Between the end of that presser and midday Friday, only a handful of Democratic lawmakers called on him to step aside. Others, meanwhile, declared themselves reassured. “I think he convinced a lot of people he should stay in the race,” Rep. Steve Cohen (R-TN) <a href="https://x.com/AC360/status/1811569212558606408">told CNN</a>. Chris Coons, a Democratic senator from Biden’s home state of Delaware, <a href="https://x.com/ChrisCoonsforDE/status/1811559710945874239#">declared</a>, “Tonight President Biden was knowledgeable, engaging, and capable.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democrats skeptic of Biden’s candidacy suggested that his performance had set back their cause. In New York Times reporter Annie Karni’s <a href="https://x.com/anniekarni/status/1811564428258607505">summary</a> of their thinking, “This may make an already very slow decision process even slower.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Democrats must not succumb to the gross irresponsibility of low expectations. Nothing Biden did Thursday evening indicated that sticking with him is the Democratic Party’s best bet. And Democrats have a civic duty to put forward the strongest possible candidate, given that their defeat would bring an insurrectionist back to power.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To give Biden his due, his performance Thursday night did suggest that he remains competent to perform his office’s basic functions — certainly, <em>more</em> competent to do so than his Republican challenger. The president demonstrated fluency in foreign affairs and an ability to intelligibly convey his thoughts, at least much of the time.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This said, the rigor and cogency of his remarks on geopolitics have been <a href="https://x.com/AndrewJBates46/status/1811553625572790488">grossly exaggerated</a>. To take just one example: At the NATO summit, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pressed the United States to give his country greater latitude for using American weapons offensively. Zelenskyy argued that Ukraine could not win the war without greater freedom to strike military targets within Russia. A reporter asked Biden whether he found this argument persuasive. Here was <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/07/11/remarks-by-president-biden-in-press-conference-9/">Biden’s reply</a>, according to the White House transcript:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>We have allowed Zelenskyy to use American weapons in the near term, in the near-abroad into Russia.&nbsp; Whether or not he has — we should be — he should be attacked — for example, should Zelenskyy — he’s not, but if he had the capacity to strike Moscow, strike the Kremlin, would that make sense? It wouldn’t.</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>The question is: What’s the best use of the weaponry he has and the weaponry we’re getting to him? I’ve gotten him more HIMAR— I got him more long-range capacity as well as defensive capacity.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>And so, our military is worki— I’m following the advice of my commander-in-chief — my — my — of the — the chief of staff of the military as well as the secretary of Defense and our intelligence people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the start of this answer, Biden struggles to articulate a coherent thought. By the end, he’s said enough to convey the broad outlines of his position to the already well-informed: He is worried about getting into a direct conflict with a nuclear superpower, so he doesn’t want Ukraine to be able to fire American weapons at major Russian cities. He thinks that he has provided Ukraine with all necessary weaponry, but he is prepared to make adjustments, should his military advisors instruct him to do so.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, he did not articulate these ideas in a manner that would render them comprehensible to the typical voter. And even a more pristinely worded version of his answer would still be light on substance; Biden did not acknowledge that Ukraine has been losing ground for a long time now, nor did he explain how this trajectory could be reversed in the absence of a shift in US policy. In other words, he did not really engage with the argument he intended to rebut.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the substance of Biden’s remarks was mediocre, the presentation was something much worse. The president sounded frail and coughed frequently. He failed to read his opening address off the teleprompter without stumbling over his words repeatedly. He referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as “Vice President Trump.” A <a href="https://x.com/PeterHamby/status/1811604490962804877">clip</a> of the latter gaffe rapidly amassed more than 8 million views on TikTok.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This performance did not amount to a convincing case that Democrats can best prevent Donald Trump’s election with Biden as their leader. Yet on Thursday, the president suggested that he should not <em>need</em> to make such a case.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Asked whether he would step down if his team presented him with polling showing that Harris would fare better against Trump, Biden replied, “No, unless they came back and said, ‘There’s no way you can win.’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The president’s poll numbers <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/">have fallen</a> since the debate (before which he was already on track to lose, according to the polls). But it would be an overstatement to say that he cannot possibly win. Polarization has put a hard floor under Biden’s support. If he sweeps Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, he will likely win reelection. He is more than <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/pennsylvania/trump-vs-biden">5 points behind Trump</a> in Pennsylvania, according to RealClearPolitics’s polling average, but trailing Trump by <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/michigan/trump-vs-biden">smaller</a> <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/wisconsin/trump-vs-biden">margins</a> in the other two. It would not take an extraordinarily large polling error — or a historically unprecedented shift in political winds — for Biden to prevail.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet if Biden believes what he says about Donald Trump, then he should not find the fact that his odds of victory aren’t 0 percent especially reassuring.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The president is historically unpopular, and has been so for the majority of his term. His <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/">approval rating</a> sits near 37 percent. Many voters blame him for inflation, and (<a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/24137666/trump-agenda-inflation-prices-dollar-devaluation-tariffs">mistakenly</a>) <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/trump-trusted-biden-inflation-top-issue-voters-poll/story?id=110343680">have more faith</a> in Trump’s ability to bring prices down. And <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/03/us/politics/poll-debate-biden-trump.html">more than 70 percent</a> consider Biden too old to serve another term. He failed to catch up with Trump in swing states before the debate, even when the media’s attention was focused on the Republican’s felony convictions and the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/355756/joe-biden-campaign-ad-trump-convicted-criminal">GOP had yet to begin seriously advertising against him</a>. It is highly unlikely that Biden will have an easier time gaining ground, now that 1) he has repeatedly validated the electorate’s concerns about his cognitive decline, 2) the press has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/joe-biden-age-public-election-campaign-343a47bf">revealed that his team</a> has been willfully misleading the public about his condition, and 3) his every misstatement from here until Election Day is certain to attract outsize media scrutiny. </p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is possible the polls are wrong. But in both 2016 and 2020, they <em>overestimated</em> Democrats’ support. It is not prudent to assume that a hypothetical polling error is concealing Biden’s strength rather than overstating it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kamala Harris is not an ideal candidate. And she would very likely be Biden’s replacement. But she does have <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/">a lower disapproval</a> rating than the president, and performs <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/09/biden-clinton-harris-democrat-poll-00166937">better</a> than him <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oLv3PqktVHZ1bKWZJzGct7ADi9qTqJZWpNALJsD_ZiA/edit?gid=1892265243#gid=1892265243">against Trump</a> in several recent polls. Above all, she is a competent, coherent public speaker who comes across as neither ancient nor deeply weird, a quality that favorably distinguishes her from the major parties’ current standard-bearers. I think some Democrats have forgotten what a normal presidential candidate sounds like. I’d encourage those impressed with Biden’s performance Thursday night to view it — side by side — with Harris’s remarks in North Carolina that same day:</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Common sense suggests that a political party will not maximize its odds of victory by nominating a profoundly <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/">unpopular</a> 81-year old who is trailing badly in the polls, unable to reliably speak coherently, and believed to be unfit to serve another term by the vast majority of voters. And a dispassionate read of the available data says the same.&nbsp;Democrats should not be satisfied with a standard-bearer who can sometimes convey the impression of bare competence when speaking publicly. And Biden should not be satisfied with retaining <em>an outside chance</em> of beating Trump. The Democratic Party must field the strongest possible candidate this November, so as to minimize the odds of an authoritarian insurrectionist taking power. Biden’s performance Thursday night confirmed that he is no longer that candidate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After Hurricane Beryl made landfall in southeast Texas at <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-beryl-texas-7dfd5353671ee30d0c6d11518ea5a370">Category 1 strength earlier this week</a>, it left <a href="https://www.click2houston.com/sports/2024/07/11/am-i-officially-a-houstonian-now-texans-lineman-tytus-howard-documents-flooding-aftermath-of-hurricane-beryl/">extensive flooding</a> and power outages for <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-beryl-texas-7dfd5353671ee30d0c6d11518ea5a370">nearly 3 million homes and businesses</a> in its wake. As of Friday morning, more than <a href="https://poweroutage.us/area/state/texas">a million electricity customers in Texas are still in the dark</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/358323/hurricane-beryl-rapid-intesification-caribbean-climate">Hurricane Beryl</a> was unprecedented in many ways — it marked the earliest time in the hurricane season that <a href="https://www.starnewsonline.com/story/news/local/2024/07/11/what-hurricane-beryl-the-earliest-category-5-storm-could-mean-for-nc/74288495007/">a tropical storm grew to Category 5 strength</a> when it reached that level on <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/category-5-hurricane-beryl-makes-explosive-start-2024-atlantic-season">July 2</a> — yet it was also predictable. So were its consequences. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Extraordinarily <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/2024/2/28/24085691/atlantic-ocean-warming-climate-change-hurricanes-coral-reefs-bleaching">warm waters in the Atlantic Ocean</a> served as fuel for the storm while a rising La Niña in the <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24145756/la-nina-2024-el-nino-heat-hurricane-record-temperature-pacific">Pacific Ocean</a> created a fertile atmosphere for hurricane formation, allowing Beryl’s winds to whip up to <a href="https://www.providencejournal.com/story/weather/2024/07/01/hurricane-berly-category-4-tracker-maps-spaghetti-model/74266076007/">170 miles per hour</a>. Scientists tracking these trends have been warning of an “<a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-predicts-above-normal-2024-atlantic-hurricane-season">above-normal</a>” hurricane season for months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the storm’s impacts on vulnerable infrastructure and its convergence with severe temperatures were just as foreseeable.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beryl is the latest example of a <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/352234/how-one-weather-extreme-can-make-the-next-one-even-more-dangerous">compound disaster</a>, where multiple extreme weather events intersect at the same time, or where the fallout from one exacerbates the damages from another.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">It’s just one thing after another</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beryl struck a region that’s still recovering from destruction caused by wind and water this year. The Houston area experienced severe flooding at the beginning of May after a torrential downpour drenched the area in upward of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/houston-texas-flooding-severe-weather-117b0f63c9bd53be31ee34e11547da21">23 inches of rain</a>. A band of intense thunderstorms known as a <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/152843/derecho-darkens-houston">derecho then galloped across Texas</a> on May 16 and charged into Houston, tearing off roofs, shattering windows, and knocking down power lines. Another burst of thunderstorms and tornadoes erupted over Memorial Day weekend, lashing Houston with winds up to <a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/05/at-least-23-killed-in-long-weekend-swarm-of-severe-weather/">88 miles per hour</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These back-to-back storms <a href="https://houstonlanding.org/houstonians-left-in-the-dark-by-centerpoint-turn-to-social-media-to-tackle-power-outages/">stressed infrastructure and depleted emergency resources</a>. They also left little time to rebuild, let alone harden streets, power lines, and sewer systems against future disasters.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then Beryl brought its own suite of destruction. It pushed a life-threatening storm surge onto the coast, dumped <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/07/08/hurricane-beryl-texas-damage-updates-rain/">up to 15 inches of rain</a>, and even <a href="https://www.foxweather.com/weather-news/beryl-landfall-texas-hurricane">spawned tornadoes</a> that pushed trees over into homes and utility poles. Power companies are warning residents to stay at least <a href="https://houstonlanding.org/these-houston-areas-received-the-strongest-wind-gusts-during-hurricane-beryl/">35 feet away from downed power lines</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now a heat wave is baking the region, threatening <a href="https://www.foxweather.com/weather-news/houston-texas-power-restoration-update-hurricane-beryl">vulnerable Houstonians</a> who don’t have power right as they need it the most. At a city council meeting this week, officials pressed a representative from CenterPoint Energy, the main power provider in Houston, about the ongoing outages. </p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hurricane Beryl is the culmination of a story we’ve been reporting on for months</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">The factors leading up to Hurricane Beryl have long been brewing. Read more of Vox’s reporting on how climate change influences ocean temperatures, heat waves, and amplifies the risk of such compound disasters:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/358323/hurricane-beryl-rapid-intesification-caribbean-climate">Hurricane Beryl is the terrifying storm that scientists have been expecting</a></p>

</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Colleen DeGuzman reported for <a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/city-of-houston/2024/07/10/493189/houston-city-council-criticizes-centerpoints-inability-to-keep-lights-on-during-hurricane-beryl/">Houston Public Media</a>, Brad Tutunjiun, CenterPoint’s vice president of regulatory policy, told the meeting that his company had conducted drills and mustered repair crews ahead of Beryl. But he noted that “the storms are more frequent. They’re more severe, and our paradigm on how we look at things has to change.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Officials weren’t assuaged. “We’re past the time of saying that this wasn&#8217;t predictable,” said city council member Abbie Kamin. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">CenterPoint did apply for a <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/doe-rejected-houston-grid-improvement-a-year-before-beryl-blackout-2/">$100 million grant</a> last year from the US Department of Energy to bolster its wires and poles to withstand severe weather, but the agency denied the proposal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Houston Mayor John Whitmire laid some of the blame for the slow recovery on a lack of preparation on the part of the city before he took office. “Yes, I’m angry at the level of neglect at this stage,” he <a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/city-of-houston/2024/07/11/493278/houston-mayor-whitmire-says-beryl-exposed-gaps-in-citys-storm-preparedness/">told the city council</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The city is no stranger to severe weather, and its flat, paved, low-lying terrain has long made it <a href="https://www.click2houston.com/sports/2024/07/11/am-i-officially-a-houstonian-now-texans-lineman-tytus-howard-documents-flooding-aftermath-of-hurricane-beryl/">notorious for flooding</a>. The most vivid example was <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/8/24/16198030/hurricane-harvey-2017-texas-gulf-corpus-christi-galveston-houston">Hurricane Harvey</a> seven years ago, which doused Houston with an <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/8/28/16217626/harvey-houston-flood-water-visualized">extraordinary 27 trillion gallons of water</a>, the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/08/hurricane-harvey-is-the-rainiest-atlantic-hurricane-ever-measured/538407/">rainiest hurricane ever measured in the Atlantic</a>. It racked up <a href="https://tdem.texas.gov/disasters/hurricane-harvey">$125 billion in damages</a>, making it the second most costly hurricane to make landfall in the continental US after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And the state of Texas has become infamous for the <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/23144696/texas-grid-energy-market-blackouts-heatwave-winter-storm">weaknesses in its energy infrastructure</a>. The Texas power grid is largely isolated from its neighbors so it can’t easily draw power from other states when its supply is disrupted. Its freewheeling state energy market prioritizes abundant cheap electricity over maintaining backup power reserves and investments to protect against severe weather.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-2161665260.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,13.35664827659,100,73.28670344682" alt="A pair of plastic skeletons along with a sign that reads &quot;Waiting on Centerpoint&quot; is seen in the front yard of a Houston home." title="A pair of plastic skeletons along with a sign that reads &quot;Waiting on Centerpoint&quot; is seen in the front yard of a Houston home." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Houston residents are growing frustrated with CenterPoint Energy, the local power provider, as electricity outages stretch into their fifth day. | Jason Fochtman/Houston Chronicle via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Jason Fochtman/Houston Chronicle via Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">These factors combined to cause widespread blackouts across the state after <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/2/16/22284140/texas-blackout-outage-winter-storm-uri-ercot-power-grid-cold-snow-austin-houston-dallas">Winter Storm Uri</a> in 2021 froze natural gas pipelines, coal piles, wind turbines, and solar panels just as chilly Texans cranked up the heat. The state is also struggling to keep up with <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/23893057/power-electricity-grid-heat-wave-record-blackout-outage-climate">summertime energy demand</a> as average temperatures rise and cooling needs grow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The future is likely to pose even greater challenges. Texas’s <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/12/19/texas-2023-population-growth-census/">population is growing</a>, so there will be more people who will need more energy. And climate change is worsening the effects of many of these disasters, raising average temperatures and water levels. That means more Texans are likely to end up in harm’s way when a disaster strikes. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This pattern is repeating across many parts of the world. Much of humanity will remain haunted by past disasters as the specters of more catastrophes lurk over the horizon. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mitigating these risks thus requires thinking beyond hurricanes as stand-alone events, and instead as phenomena built on the wreckage of past storms whose shock waves will reverberate for years to come. </p>

The images and sounds of caged children stunned the nation, and the outcry was swift: Democrats rallied against then-President Donald Trump, protests swept the country, and public opinion was <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/6/18/17475740/family-separation-poll-polling-border-trump-children-immigrant-families-parents">sharply against Trump</a>’s policy. Immigration soared to become a top concern <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/261500/mentions-immigration-top-problem-surpass-record-high.aspx">again</a>, and the share of Americans saying immigration was a good thing for the country jumped. That sentiment <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1660/immigration.aspx">continued to grow</a> during the rest of Trump’s presidency.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, things look much different. Americans <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/611135/immigration-surges-top-important-problem-list.aspx">once again</a> view immigration as the country’s <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx">single most important problem</a>, but public sentiment appears to have taken a sharp<strong> </strong>turn to the negative. Polling this spring and summer seems to suggest that a significant share of American voters — not just Republicans — are warming up to the idea of tough-on-immigration policy proposals and rhetoric.</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Inside this story</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Numerous polls suggest the American public is souring on immigration,&nbsp;with even Democratic voters showing more interest in Donald Trump’s policy proposals for mass deportations. It’s a reversal of the public’s several-decades-long trend of increasing sympathy and appreciation for immigrants. This piece lays out three reasons for this surprising trend in public opinion.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/647123/sharply-americans-curb-immigration.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_campaign=syndication" data-type="link" data-id="https://news.gallup.com/poll/647123/sharply-americans-curb-immigration.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_campaign=syndication">According to Gallup</a>, 2024 is the first time since 2005 that most of the public have wanted less immigration, and this year marks the largest share of Americans feeling resistant to immigration since 58 percent said so in 2001.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And those shifts are happening across party lines: Gallup notes in its most recent public opinion report that the desire to decrease immigration has jumped 15 percentage points among Republicans, 11 points among independents, and 10 points among Democrats — the group most supportive of immigration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">An Axios poll from April suggested <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/04/25/trump-biden-americans-illegal-immigration-poll">42 percent of Democrats</a> would support mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. Other polls have also found an anti-immigrant shift in the public’s mood. Gallup’s <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1660/immigration.aspx">long-term tracking poll</a>, which has been running since the 1960s, shows a more general decline in the share of Americans who want to increase rates of immigration or keep them the same.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Conversely, the portion of Americans who want to decrease immigration has spiked: <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/647123/sharply-americans-curb-immigration.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_campaign=syndication" data-type="link" data-id="https://news.gallup.com/poll/647123/sharply-americans-curb-immigration.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_campaign=syndication">55 percent </a>of Americans feel this way, up from a low point of 28 percent in 2020.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This shift against immigration is happening even as the general American consensus has been moving in favor of immigrants over the last few decades. In 1994, for example, 63 percent of Americans believed that immigrants were a “burden” to the country; only 31 percent said immigrants strengthen the country, according to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/01/31/majority-of-americans-continue-to-say-immigrants-strengthen-the-u-s/">Pew Research Center</a> data. By 2019, those dynamics had flipped: 62 percent of Americans believed immigrants were an asset to the nation; only 28 percent thought they were a burden.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, with the public seemingly <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24153132/us-border-crisis-mexico-migrant-immigration-asylum">lurching</a> to the right on immigration, politicians are moving accordingly. There’s been a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-immigration-asylum-border-congress-7507034034ba49a8f170777600cad46e">rightward</a> pivot by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/immigration-biden-trump-election-3e27793981ecda46d1b87d996f04dce0">Biden</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/democrats-border-security-task-force-seeks-redefine-party-immigration-rcna143039">congressional Democrats</a>, and Trump —&nbsp;who built his first campaign on demonizing immigrants (and particularly immigrants of color) —&nbsp;has stepped up his constant attacks on the Biden administration’s immigration policy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So what explains the American public’s souring mood on immigrants and immigration?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though there are no simple answers, pollsters and immigration researchers offer a few explanations that can be roughly sorted into three theories.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first theory centers the role of elected officials — specifically Republicans, and more specifically Trump. As Republicans left power and shifted into opposition mode, they’ve refocused attention on immigration as a threat to American identity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other experts argue the economy — particularly inflation&nbsp;and the public’s “scarcity mindset” —&nbsp;has made more Americans critical of immigration. When the public feels as though the economy is booming and there&#8217;s plenty to go around, they feel more open to sharing that wealth. But when people perceive the economy to be tenuous, like after the pandemic when inflation took off, Americans feel more hesitant to share with outsiders.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A third group argues that the anti-immigrant turn is being driven by concerns about the rule of law and social disorder. This theory posits that the post-pandemic surge in crime, combined with heightened media coverage of disorder in public, prompted greater concerns from Americans about security and quality of life —&nbsp;concerns that were then also applied to the border and people trying to cross it without documentation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Theory 1: It’s the politicians&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s first presidential campaign — starting <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/06/16/theyre-rapists-presidents-trump-campaign-launch-speech-two-years-later-annotated/">quite literally</a> with his announcement speech —&nbsp;was built on demonizing immigrants and claiming that open borders were destroying America. But that created a rhetorical tension once he took office, as he had to claim that the problem was rapidly improving thanks to his new anti-immigration measures.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since Joe Biden took office, he has <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/01/20/joe-biden-trump-immigration/">pledged</a> a more open, humanitarian approach to immigration and border politics. He paused construction on a border wall; he issued new protections for DACA recipients, and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/20/fact-sheet-president-biden-sends-immigration-bill-to-congress-as-part-of-his-commitment-to-modernize-our-immigration-system/">sent</a> a new immigration bill to Congress. He essentially sought to create the <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/news/first-100-days-office-biden-executive-actions">sharpest contrast</a> possible with Donald Trump’s legacy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That shift, however, created the perfect opportunity for Republicans, led by Trump, to once again cast immigration and immigrants as a threat to American identity. The surge in illegal border crossings and legal asylum seekers that followed the pandemic —&nbsp;as well as this liberalizing of migration policy —&nbsp;were fodder for the fear-mongering and exploitation of racial and social fears. And right-wing politicians and commentators have routinely played up this threat, unifying immigrant-skeptical Americans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The lead-up to the 2022 midterms and the 2024 campaign so far provide evidence of this shift. While the 2020 campaign centered on the pandemic and the economy, once Biden took over, Republican candidates across the country shifted into talk about “open borders.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For example, the pro-immigration groups America’s Voice and Immigration Hub <a href="https://theimmigrationhub.org/new-report-gop-revs-up-anti-immigrant-ads-and-misinformation">in 2021 tracked an increase</a> in mentions of the terms “Biden-Harris border crisis” and “mass amnesty” in paid advertising, as well as increased anti-immigrant discourse online. Once the midterm season picked up, more Republican campaign ads began to mention immigration negatively — <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/gop-campaign-ads-put-focus-immigration-inflation-n1294130">about one in five ads in March 2022</a>, for example. And in 2024, Republican candidates (most visibly Donald Trump) have also <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b60b2381aef1dbe876cd08f/t/663928fa7427034ec69088f8/1715022075139/Immigration+Hub+Memo_+Q1+AdImpact+Spending+Data.pdf">stepped up</a> talk of immigrant “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/26/us/politics/republicans-immigration-ads-election.html#:~:text=A%20campaign%20ad%20from%20a,a%20Senate%20seat%20in%20Michigan.">invasions</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s more recent framing of illegal immigration as “poisoning the blood of our country” is a key example of this more vitriolic talk of immigrants. And it fits into a longstanding history of American xenophobia; immigration scholars consider this kind of discourse a direct appeal to “in-groups”: existing communities that define themselves against “out-groups” like immigrants, and exploit suspicion and bigotry.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, this theory can’t fully explain the shift in negative sentiment since the pandemic. Republican politicians (including, famously, Trump) and right-wing media have previously led other cycles of outrage and panic over migration, “<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/1/18041710/migrant-caravan-america-trump-epistemic-crisis-democracy">caravans</a>,” and the southern border. Immigration was a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/11/7/18071658/fox-news-caravan-midterm-elections">key campaign point</a> for Republicans during the 2018 midterms, but support for immigration <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/508520/americans-value-immigration-concerns.aspx">continued to rise</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Theory 2: It’s the economy</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Americans feel good about their financial security and the health of the national economy, they also feel good about immigrants and immigration. That’s the lesson from the last few decades of Gallup polling, according to Jeff Jones, one of Gallup’s data and public opinion experts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We saw some declines around the Great Recession — favorable percentages were in the 50s — and then in 2018 and 2019, opinions were quite positive,” Jones told me. In fact, both Republicans and Democrats were more positive about immigration during that time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But after the pandemic and its ensuing inflation and interest rate hikes, economic sentiment took a nosedive, and anti-immigrant sentiment began to pick up as well.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These more recent swings also show up in a few of Gallup’s other tracking polls. When asked whether immigrants have a positive or negative effect on job opportunities, taxes, or the economy in general, negative sentiment <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1660/immigration.aspx">tended to increase</a> in the lead-up to the Great Recession but recovered after. A similar dynamic emerged before and after the pandemic: 43 percent of respondents said immigrants had a positive effect on the economy, while 31 percent said it had a negative effect. By 2023, respondents were nearly evenly divided: 39 percent to 38 percent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But economics alone don’t explain recent twists. Both economic conditions and sentiment about the economy have been improving more markedly over the last year, but the public’s anti-immigrant shift has <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/611135/immigration-surges-top-important-problem-list.aspx">been accelerating</a>. Clearly, something else is happening here.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Theory 3: It’s the “law-and-order” mindset</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Matthew Wright, a University of British Columbia political scientist who studies immigration, suggests a third complementary explanation: a renewed public desire for “law-and-order” policies prompted by the pandemic-era rise in crime and the Biden-era increase in border-crossing attempts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Compared to the lull in rates of immigration during the pandemic, the surge in border crossings <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24153132/us-border-crisis-mexico-migrant-immigration-asylum">in the last three years</a> was unprecedented, overwhelming what federal and local officials have been able to manage. That volume has resulted in dramatic scenes at the border, in border communities, and in big cities, where many asylum seekers have been moved.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wright suggests that a good chunk of Americans feel conflicting emotions that conflate illegal immigration, asylum seekers, and immigration in general with a sense of public disorder. They are torn between having sympathy for immigrants in general and feeling worried about public safety, order, and the rule of law. And they combine their feelings about the border with their attitudes about crime and governance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“In terms of what people are concerned about, the way I read these figures and these trends is that they&#8217;re mainly concerned about illegal immigration, and they&#8217;re mainly concerned about the border,” Wright said. “There&#8217;s something to be said for people being seriously uncomfortable with the idea that their country doesn&#8217;t have a border, that the border is not something we can enforce.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gallup polling also provides some clues of shifting sentiment here: In 2023, 47 percent of Americans said they believed immigrants had a worsening effect on crime in the US, up from 42 percent in 2019. And the share of Americans who say they personally worry a “great deal” specifically about <em>illegal</em> immigration has steadily increased since 2020 — from 32 percent in March 2020 to 48 percent in March of this year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To Wright, these findings complement other polling that shows a confounding mix of opinions on immigration. A not insignificant number of voters hold both these more critical views of immigration as well as generally open views: positive toward refugees, favoring reform of legal migration, and supporting pathways to citizenship for those already here.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This law-and-order theory suggests that these voters can hold competing ideas in their minds: not opposing migration, but wanting it done in an orderly manner. This theory also explains why Trump and Republicans may have a unique opening this year — to activate both nativist and bigoted attitudes in some voters, as well as to exploit fear of “chaos” and bad management.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“They can use a very simple message to capture different kinds of people: They can capture both the prejudicially motivated person and the pure law-and-order guy — that person is not expressly racist, necessarily, but values order in society,” Wright said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The steamy and stifling Washington humidity poaching European diplomats through their business suits wasn’t the only cloud hanging over this week’s NATO summit. It had already been clear for weeks that the gathering, held in DC to commemorate the alliance’s founding here 75 years ago, would be shadowed by questions about the upcoming US presidential election. And that was before President Joe Biden’s disastrous June 27 debate, which made it increasingly likely that NATO leaders would soon be dealing with Donald Trump, not Biden, in the White House.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The debate between Biden and Trump is sort of an elephant in the room,” Rachel Rizzo, a senior fellow and expert on NATO at the Atlantic Council, told Vox. “And I think if you are a European ally, and you watched that debate, you’re probably concerned about Biden’s ability to win the election.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Speaking with reporters on Thursday, national security adviser Jake Sullivan denied that any allies had expressed concerns about Biden’s performance in office. On the contrary, he said, he had heard “a drumbeat of praise for the United States, but also for President Biden, personally, for what he’s done to strengthen NATO.” <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/11/nato-allies-weakened-biden-trump-return-00167424">Reporting from</a> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-05/biden-s-allies-abroad-think-it-s-untenable-for-him-to-stay-on">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/biden-age-concerns-world-leaders-democrats-6d753921">news outlets</a> suggests otherwise, but whatever misgiving these allies might have, they have little incentive to bring them up in public.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“No European leader is going to come out and disparage the US president,” Rizzo noted. “It doesn’t help to come to Washington and tell everyone you’re freaking out about this.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Any hopes Biden would be able to use the summit to reassure his critics about his fitness for the campaign were dashed on Thursday afternoon when he accidentally introduced President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine as “President Putin” — the man currently trying to kill Zelenskyy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether he stays on the ticket or not, it’s looking increasingly likely that Biden, a longtime fixture of the US foreign policy establishment and a longtime supporter of the transatlantic alliance, may only have a few months left in office.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Zelenskyy <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/razom-z-amerikoyu-svit-zdaten-robiti-pravilni-rechi-vistup-v-92045">put it somewhat obliquely in a speech</a> in Washington on Tuesday, “Let’s be candid and frank. Now everyone is waiting for November.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Waiting on Trump</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s skepticism about the value of long-term alliances, which he largely sees as opportunities for countries to free-ride on American security guarantees and defense spending, was arguably the most consistent through line of his foreign policy as president. The prospect of his return has stoked fear about the future of those alliances. The Japanese press has even coined a word for this anxiety: “<a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/03/21/japan/politics/donald-trump-moshitora-japan/">moshitora</a>,” or “what if Trump?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There has long been a special place <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/closer-trumps-years-criticizing-nato-defense-spending/story?id=107201586">in Trump’s ire for</a> NATO, which he has called “obsolete” and “<a href="https://www.axios.com/2018/06/28/donald-trump-foreign-policy-europe-nato-allies-worried">as bad as NAFTA</a>.” (NAFTA, in Trump’s protectionist view, was <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/nafta-under-trump-the-myths-and-the-possibilities/">about as bad as international deals get</a>.) Trump <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/natosource/trump-confirms-he-threatened-to-withdraw-from-nato/">threatened</a> on several occasions as president to pull out of the alliance, and advisers say he<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/04/bolton-says-trump-might-have-pulled-us-out-nato-if-he-had-been-reelected/"> likely would have</a> if he had been reelected in 2020. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s main complaint was that a significant number of NATO members had long failed to meet the alliance’s target of spending 2 percent of their GDP on defense. That complaint wasn’t a new one — former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush voiced <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/11/obama-and-bush-also-pressed-nato-allies-to-spend-more-on-defense.html">the same</a> complaint — though Trump’s comments suggested misleadingly that these countries owed money to<em> </em>NATO, or even to the US. (They didn’t and don’t — the target, which is nonbinding, refers to countries’ spending on their <em>own </em>defense.) </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More recently, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-trump-nato-277d1b30ba6fd0ee37ca626c59ab05ed">Trump boasted</a> that he would let Russia “do whatever the hell they want” to countries that “didn’t pay.” This week, Trump underlined NATO leaders’ anxieties by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/11/trump-orban-meeting-florida-nato-00167547">meeting with Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán</a>, the alliance’s principal gadfly and Putin defender. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The “moshitora”<em> </em>in Washington this week has created insecurity for an alliance that would otherwise have some reason for swagger on its 75th birthday, though for a very unfortunate reason. Throughout the war on terror, NATO struggled to define its post-Cold War mission amid long-term, long-range deployments, such as Afghanistan, for which it often felt ill-suited. Just five years ago, French President Emmanuel Macron, hardly a Trumpian isolationist, described the alliance as “<a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/11/07/emmanuel-macron-warns-europe-nato-is-becoming-brain-dead">brain-dead</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All that changed with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which brought the alliance back to its original core mission: protecting Europe from Russia. As Sen. James Risch (R-ID), ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, put it on Wednesday, before 2022, “​​NATO had become stodgy. We’d forgotten what it was formed for. NATO was formed for the exact circumstance we find ourselves in today.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The most obvious post-war change for the alliance is the addition of two new flags outside its headquarters in Brussels: Sweden and Finland, who joined in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine after decades of neutrality. The allies have also gone a long way toward addressing Trump’s principal complaint. In 2024, 23 of the 32 members are <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_67655.htm">expected to spend</a> more than 2 percent of their GDP on defense, up from just three in 2014. Trump’s <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/closer-trumps-years-criticizing-nato-defense-spending/story?id=107201586">allies have taken some credit for this</a>, as have Biden administration officials. But in truth, most of the credit probably belongs to Vladimir Putin for reminding NATO’s member-states why it exists. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The bargaining stage</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent months, Trump has somewhat softened his rhetoric on NATO, saying he would “<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-says-he-wont-quit-nato-if-europe-pays-its-way/">100 percent</a>” stay in the alliance, as long as European countries “play fair.” But he still seems poised to undermine what has become NATO’s overriding priority: aiding Ukraine in its war with Russia. Trump reportedly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-reviews-plan-halt-us-military-aid-ukraine-unless-it-negotiates-peace-with-2024-06-25/">plans to pressure Ukraine</a> into negotiations with Russia by threatening to withhold US military aid. Without it, the war wouldn’t end, but Ukraine’s defenses <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24002840/ukraine-russia-war-united-states-aid-volodymyr-zelensky-vladimir-putin-europe-congress-border">may not be able to hold out</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the summit in Washington this week, which took place in the wake of a devastating <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainian-air-defence-engaged-repelling-russian-missile-attack-kyiv-officials-2024-07-08/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">missile attack</a> on a children’s hospital in Kyiv, Ukraine <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/07/11/situation-report-nato-washington-summit-ukraine/?tpcc=recirc_latest062921#:~:text=40.,according%20to%20the%20summit%20communique.">got some major new aid pledges</a>, including dozens of new air defense batteries and the long-awaited announcement that US-made F-16 fighter jets <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/10/nato-allies-begin-transfer-of-f-16s-to-ukraine-blinken-says">would be on their way to the country</a> from Denmark and the Netherlands. Ukraine was not offered full NATO membership but the summit communique <a href="https://nato.cmail20.com/t/r-e-tdjtjydd-nzutlhlju-r/">did affirm </a>its “irreversible path” to membership, which is stronger language than has been used before. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">NATO policymakers have been working to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/07/10/trump-proof-nato-summit/">“Trump-proof”</a> some aspects of aid to Ukraine, such as setting up a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/nato-to-establish-new-kyiv-post-for-ukraine-81b4205c">new command center in Germany</a> to coordinate military aid and the training of Ukrainian troops. But the strains on Ukraine’s defenses caused by Congress’s monthslong delay in authorizing new aid this year made it clear how much <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024/4/24/24138541/ukraine-russia-us-aid-congress">the international assistance effort</a> still relies on US support. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As I reported around the summit this week, it became clear that the talk was less about “Trump-proofing” — likely impossible — than about making a pitch for the alliance and its mission in terms that can be seen as MAGA-friendly. If not quite acceptance, it seemed officials had at least reached the bargaining stage when it came to a Trump return. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At a reception hosted by the European Union on Tuesday night, Oleksandr Kamyshin, Ukraine’s minister of strategic industries, suggested that what’s good for Ukraine is also good for American business, whoever is occupying the White House. “I’ve heard that Republicans stand for the defense industry. We’re bringing value to the defense industry of the US,” he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same event, Laurynas Kasčiūnas, Lithuania’s defense minister, said, “There are many directions where we can work with a future possible Trump administration if it happens.” A worse strategy, he suggested, would be “if we try to build in Europe a moral wall against Trump. We need to be calm and find ways to communicate with him.” He also noted that Trump’s hostility to the Euro-Atlantic mission was often more talk than practice. It was under Trump, after all, that US troops were <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20191021-us-moves-troops-tanks-into-lithuania-in-message-to-russia">first deployed to Lithuania</a>, on Russia’s border. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One senior NATO official, speaking on background in Washington this week, suggested that the recent boost in defense spending by NATO countries might defuse some of the tension. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Calling out European allies and Canada to spend more on defense was warranted,” the official said. “Raising the issue of defense spending was not exclusive to the Trump administration. [Now] we are in a different place. We have turned a corner and I think we have several examples to show that.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Zelenskyy notably spoke at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and was introduced by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, though this felt like an appeal to an internationalist Republican party that no longer exists.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whatever your views on the former president, it’s hard to fault European leaders for their Trump-friendly appeals this week. There’s little other option.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen put it on a panel at NATO’s public forum on Wednesday, referring to the US complaints about European reliance on American military power: “We have to admit, from a European perspective, that we were depending on you. We still depend on you. Never leave us.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The age of froyo has faded. Fancy cupcakes are passé. The cronut craze is now a distant fever dream. Dessert trends can sweep by fast, and today we’re in the era of the elaborate cookie — kind of.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Crumbl first burst onto the scene, the novelty was that the company had turned a relatively easy, low-fuss dessert that might come as a side to your food order into an enormous, over-the-top main attraction. A single Crumbl cookie can be somewhere around 5 inches in diameter, and unusual flavors in the past have included cornbread, churro, Biscoff lava, maple bacon, and more. They’re colorful and photogenic, packaged in a baby-pink box instantly recognizable even from a distance. Since 2017, the brand has grown rapidly, opening over 1,000 locations and becoming perhaps the most accessible cookie chain in the nation. But whether Crumbl is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/17/dining/crumbl-cookies.html">actually good</a> depends greatly on who you ask, and that unsettled question helps fuel its continued popularity and relevance online.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rather than offering a steady menu of reliably beloved cookies to get customers through the door, Crumbl courts online virality — whether it’s positive or not so much — with a revolving door of new desserts every week. Increasingly, they don’t just make cookies, but pies, cakes, ice cream, pudding, and more. The brand has over 9.6 million followers on its official TikTok account, but the real juice is in the multitudes of influencers <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/channel/crumbl">regularly posting about Crumbl</a> on the platform. Its decadent constructions, sometimes bafflingly unwieldy-looking, draw curiosity: What sugary invention will it try to pull off this time? Open TikTok on a Monday to see a fresh batch of Crumbl review videos, with countless creators enthusiastically biting into a new confection.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This is an internet brand,” says Stephen Zagor, an adjunct business professor at Columbia University. Crumbl, as a company, is making “all the right marketing moves.” The company has not responded to a request for comment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s no denying that Crumbl has harnessed the power of social media to grab — and, so far, hold on to — people’s precious attention. The question is whether it’s sustainable to be a dessert chain that’s entirely about pushing new trends and offering something ephemeral. If you’re any kind of content creator, the perpetual freshness is a boon. But if you’re just here to enjoy some dessert and stumble upon a flavor you love, good luck. It might <a href="https://crumblcookieflavors.com/all-weeks/">take months</a> to see it return, if it ever does.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">How Crumbl grew and grew and grew</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In an era of ghost kitchens, no other cookie chain has as big a physical presence as Crumbl today: Insomnia launched in 2003 and only has about 300 stores at this time, as does Mrs. Fields in the US. Levain, representing the fancier end of baked goods, opened in the ’90s and isn’t franchised, with just a few locations scattered around the country. Other newer competitors like Dirty Dough and Crave also have far fewer locations than Crumbl.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Crumbl’s founders, Jason McGowan and Sawyer Hemsley, are two cousins from Utah. Before they launched Crumbl in 2017, they “didn’t know anything about baking,” McGowan said in an interview with <a href="https://www.theceomagazine.com/executive-interviews/food-beverage/jason-mcgowan/">CEO Magazine</a>. They had backgrounds in tech and marketing but thought they could give cookies a go; the company started <a href="https://www.qsrmagazine.com/reports/how-crumbl-baked-up-a-cookie-revolution/">franchising new locations</a> quickly, opening hundreds per year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Very few brands I’ve seen have grown at that rate, especially brick and mortar,” says Kathleen Gosser, a professor of franchise management practice at the University of Louisville. But unlike <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/355959/subway-ads-athletes-explained-simone-biles-travis-kelce">Subway</a>, which famously employed a strategy of opening too many stores, Gosser says that Crumbl seems to have been more strategic about spacing out their locations. “There’s not one on every corner,” Gosser says. In New York, for example, there are none yet in Brooklyn or Queens, and one on Staten Island, and a handful in Manhattan — including one in the West Village, ground zero for dessert crazes from cupcakes to cronuts, where I tried my first Crumbl cookie.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to the mobile apps insights firm Sensor Tower, the Crumbl app has been downloaded over 6.4 million times in the US this year and is ranked 15th overall in the US Food &amp; Drink category, which is impressive for a chain that only sells desserts (no coffee, as the founders are Mormon).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">The internet just can’t stop talking about Crumbl</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most brands today rely on social media for at least some marketing. What sets Crumbl apart is that its products don’t just become a trend for influencers to glom onto when there’s an especially strange limited-edition flavor drop, like the recent collaboration between <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.ca/article/oreo-coca-cola-collaboration-cookies-review/">Oreo and Coke</a>. While there are occasionally <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@trishlikefish88/video/7395371008737250591">celebrity endorsements</a> and tie-ins — an Olivia Rodrigo-themed cookie was released over the summer — most of the advertising also apparently happens organically. Dedicated content creators weigh in on weekly drops, using the popular (and sometimes polarizing) desserts as a vehicle for their own fame.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s a sustained hype machine built into Crumbl’s business model thanks to its regular carousel of new flavors, which serves as fodder for seemingly endless discourse as there’s a constantly refreshing feed of Crumbl content to consume. Some influencers loathe Crumbl; others can’t get enough. Taste tests are often titled something along the lines of “My honest thoughts on Crumbl,” as if to suggest they’re cutting through all the noise to deliver the definitive verdict on the cookies. The fact that the flavors are only available for one week also all but ensures a sense of urgency in the way luxury streetwear drops do. Online, people post “Crumbl spoilers” — leaked information about what flavors are coming in the next few weeks — though being a <a href="https://crumblcookies.com/rewards">gold tier rewards member</a><strong> </strong>in the loyalty program gets you early access to its “weekly drop videos.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The built-in scarcity means “people have to run to get there” when a new menu is unleashed, says Zagor.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Online mentions of Crumbl have ticked up in the past year — up 29 percent compared to 2023, according to the consumer insights company Brandwatch — but the biggest surge in attention hit a few months ago, when news of a Crumbl “pop-up” in Sydney, Australia, spread on social media. People lined up to pay <a href="https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/crumbl-cookies-australian-pop-up-expensive-trip">$17.50 Australian</a> (nearly $12 US) for a cookie, over double what it costs in the US for what turned out to be an unauthorized resale pop-up. For the people posting about it online, the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@destiny___g/video/7419903777441910034">virality</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sofiaqistinee/video/7419950269338799378?_r=1&amp;_t=8ruxkIY9n7T">of the single-day</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@elle_easternsuburbsmum/video/7419924662538276116">event</a> was the highlight — blink and you might have missed it — and not so much the anticipation of how good the days-old imported cookies might taste (though many did remark on <a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/crumbl-cookie-scam-sydney-australia-8723194">the staleness</a>). Crumbl, for its part, chose not to take any legal action. In fact, the scandal revved up the brand’s plans to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/09/crumbl-cookies-to-open-in-australia-after-viral-unofficial-pop-up-at-bondi-beach-turned-stale">open its first store</a> outside of North America in Australia. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Food marketing on social media platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram is especially alluring to young people because of how interactive it is, says Jennifer Harris, a senior research adviser of marketing at the UConn Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health. “You’re not just sitting watching television and passively viewing that anymore,” she tells Vox. “The changing flavors every week is also really attractive to kids who don&#8217;t want to miss out. [It’s] the FOMO factor.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Can Crumbl keep serving up excitement?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s unlikely that the people clamoring for Crumbl don’t know that these gargantuan desserts probably aren’t healthy (a single cookie can run upward of <a href="https://crumblcookies.com/profiles/9fa9f710-6c7e-11ef-be9b-858c5e17000f:Cookies">900 calories</a>, but when it comes to digital content about the brand, the literal nutritional content of the desserts is irrelevant. The point is being in the know and keeping up with consumer trends, whether that’s a cookie or a skin care product. In a recent video, YouTuber Edvasian compared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JhQB_DYdQo&amp;t=508s">the Crumbl phenomenon</a> to being the “fast fashion” of cookies. It’s yet another manifestation of hyper-consumption fueled by a conveyor belt of micro-trends that come and go at an ever-increasing pace. The brands need content creators for marketing, and the content creators need brands as a jumping off point for cultivating an audience. Behind every new Crumbl week is the possibility of viral fame.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This relationship between fast fashion and influencers is nothing new, but the juxtaposition is a little stranger when we’re talking about food — specifically, a kind of food that’s often an indulgent, nostalgic comfort. Dessert is a difficult category for companies to be successful in. “You&#8217;re constantly being measured against grandma&#8217;s cookies and the local bakeries&#8217; cookies,” says Zagor. Crumbl provides adventure, but not familiarity, and not necessarily loyalty.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite Crumbl’s speed-run of success, there’s been some concerning signs in its recent performance. Its profits per store plummeted in 2023, down about <a href="https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/financing/fast-growing-crumbls-unit-volumes-store-profitability-took-hit-last-year">58 percent</a> compared to the year before. This throws into question whether its height of popularity can be maintained, or whether the extravagant cookie trend could <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/02/10880935/why-frozen-yogurt-trend-ended">go the way of the froyo</a>. Some customers grumble <a href="https://www.sanluisobispo.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/article276772116.html">about</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrumblCookies/comments/1ctldpb/couldbe_customers_are_walking_out_because_the/">the</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrumblCookies/comments/1bv0x8z/how_much_is_too_much/">price</a> of a single cookie compared to its quality, which can vary by week and by store. (A single cookie at my nearest Crumbl is $4.99; at Levain it’s $5.77, and most Insomnia cookies are $2.95.) The company has also been fairly aggressive about defending its perch as the cookie chain known for offering a weekly menu of inventive flavors. In 2022, it <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/artsliving/2022/07/22/crumbl-ceo-doubles-down-utah/">sued</a> two much smaller competitors that also offer new flavors every week — Crave Cookies and Dirty Dough — for allegedly copying its strategy, trademarks, and packaging, even arguing that Dirty Dough <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/artsliving/food/2023/08/15/judge-says-crumbl-challenger/">stole many of Crumbl’s recipes</a>. Crumbl has since agreed to resolve both lawsuits through a settlement.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The challenge is maintaining its momentum “in a world where everything is virtual and everything disappears with light — it&#8217;s so easy for somebody else to come along and take the spotlight away from them,” says Zagor.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">My personal experience of Crumbl is that its desserts taste just fine. They’re not inedible — I enjoyed my tiny <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@iwantcandy77/video/7441738903872343342">pecan pie</a> — but neither is any of it memorable or something I would crave or reach for when the mood for something sweet strikes. “It&#8217;s as much air as there is substance,” Zagor explains. “It’s what you see, and what you hear, and what you read, and what the color of the box is.” The actual taste of the thing, in the face of so much other fluff, can’t help but recede into the background.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In July, New York City Mayor Eric Adams convened police officials and media to proudly <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/605-24/mayor-adams-celebrates-shut-down-more-750-illegal-cannabis-shops-since-launch-operation#/0">announce</a> that the city had made terrific progress in its much-publicized crackdown on illegal marijuana shops.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unlicensed shops had sprung up in empty retail storefronts with jaw-dropping speed after New York state legalized marijuana in 2021. There are the bodegas that keep THC products discreetly under their counters, the leaf-emblazoned “food” trucks, the folding-table operations, the brightly lit smoke shops packed with pipes, vapes, and THC-laced hot cheese curls as far as the eye can see. They <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2022/10/11/23391609/new-york-marijuana-laws-legalization-bodega-weed-truck">have become so ubiquitous</a> and so popular among the city’s cannabis users and tourists that officials have been playing a fruitless game of whack-a-mole with them for three years.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So Adams’s showy crackdown, dubbed “Operation Padlock to Protect,” seemed to be a success, with the city shuttering more than 700 shops and seizing tens of millions of dollars worth of weed and THC-laced products. There’s only one problem: There are <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/13/new-york-rogue-weed-retailers-00177408">thousands more</a> stores still operating.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In many ways, that’s emblematic of how marijuana legalization has spun wildly out of the control of states, more than two dozen of which have now legalized recreational use. States&#8217; efforts to create and then tightly regulate legal markets for pot have, ironically, made the black market for weed bigger than it&#8217;s ever been.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In California, which legalized recreational marijuana in 2016 and oversaw its sale in retail outlets beginning in 2018, that market has manifested as <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/31/us/california-black-market-marijuana-grow-houses-invs/index.html">countless illegal suburban grow operations</a> — many alleged to be connected <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/chinese-organized-crime-us-marijuana-market">to organized crime</a>. They’re cultivating more weed than residents of the state even want to buy and funneling it (in violation of federal law) to buyers across the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Oregon, which legalized in 2014, it <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/01/14/oregon-marijuana-legalization-black-market-enforcement-527012">looks much the same</a>. In Washington, DC, where recreational weed sales were never legalized, there are an estimated <a href="https://wamu.org/story/24/10/02/dc-cracks-down-on-illegal-marijuana-shops/">100 illegal weed shops</a>, 10 times the number of licensed medical dispensaries, according to its city officials. And in midwest Michigan, where <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-08-30/how-is-michigan-selling-more-weed-than-california">legal sales have surprisingly outpaced</a> even California’s, illegal growers flourish, and courts and prosecutors are reluctant to <a href="https://www.crainsdetroit.com/cannabis/michigans-marijuana-law-allow-black-market-go-unchecked">quash them</a> — if they even could.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The intensifying battles against an untamable black market come just as the country inches closer to big federal changes that could open the door to nationwide legalization. The Drug Enforcement Agency, at President Joe Biden’s behest, is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/update-deas-efforts-reschedule-cannabis-what-you-need-know-2024-09-11/#:~:text=September%2011%2C%202024%20%2D%20As%20readers,towards%20federal%20legalization%20in%20more">considering whether to reclassify cannabis</a> from a drug on par with heroin to one recognized as having moderate-to-low potential for physical and psychological dependence, like ketamine or steroids. The change would leave the drug still highly regulated but loosen restrictions on access.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s happening in the states that already allow recreational marijuana offers a startling glimpse at what it might actually look like to fully legalize the drug across the US. Which is to say, messy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mostly, it reminds us that drugs — and those who grow, sell, and use them — have a way of being resistant to the machinations of policymakers. That was true at the height of the war on drugs and remains true now, even when the policies are markedly friendlier.&nbsp;</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rise of the black market has, in many ways, blindsided states.<br><br>States that had hoped to rake in tax dollars from marijuana legalization are instead seeing their legal markets soften. Take Colorado, once a national model of how a state could legalize weed and also profit wildly from it. It made an estimated <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/12/colorado-passes-1-billion-in-marijuana-state-revenue.html">$1 billion in tax revenue</a> in the first five years after it legalized retail sales in 2014, money it pledged to put toward education. Now, that revenue is dwindling, decreasing by 11 percent in just the last year, according to <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/images/sept2024forecastforposting.pdf">a state forecast</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The truth is, most buyers don’t really care whether the shop selling their THC-laced spicy cheese snacks is licensed, but they’re fully aware when they have to pay an additional <a href="https://www.cdtfa.ca.gov/industry/cannabis/tax-facts.htm#:~:text=As%20a%20cannabis%20retailer%2C%20you,of%20cannabis%20or%20cannabis%20products.">$20 in taxes</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There’s more public acceptance and interest in the plant, and so [illegal] situations are of course going to continue to thrive — especially if the regulated market is essentially overregulated … and there’s a price difference,” says <a href="https://www.lastprisonerproject.org/team/jason-ortiz">Jason Ortiz</a>, a founder and former president of Minority Cannabis Business Association and director of strategic initiatives for Last Prisoner Project, which calls for an overhaul of the nation’s drug laws.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, because the laws of supply and demand apply to marijuana, too, the price of even the licensed good stuff has also dropped precipitously in <a href="https://www.crainsdetroit.com/cannabis/michigans-marijuana-law-allow-black-market-go-unchecked">state</a> after <a href="https://www.cannabisbusinesstimes.com/us-states/colorado/news/15687071/how-much-did-an-ounce-of-cannabis-flower-cost-in-2023">state</a>, driven in part by black market products.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That has infuriated licensed shops and growers, and sapped enough of their potential income that in California, for instance, the number of legal marijuana growers and brands is down 70 percent — and many shuttered companies owe millions in back taxes to the state, <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/cannabis/article/california-cannabis-economy-crash-19492956.php">according to reporting by SFGate</a>. And if the black market has dashed the dreams of many a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medmen-spectacular-collapse-complete-just-192601911.html">weed entrepreneur</a>, it has also caused another surprising turn of events.<br></p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

<p class="has-text-align-none"><br>The <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2022/10/11/23391609/new-york-marijuana-laws-legalization-bodega-weed-truck">rise of brazen, unlicensed marijuana sellers</a> is a relatively new phenomenon, probably driven in part by <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/03/26/most-americans-favor-legalizing-marijuana-for-medical-recreational-use/">growing public acceptance of marijuana</a> and the relatively easy access to pot being cultivated for legal sale in dozens of states. There is something eerily familiar, however, about the attempts to quash them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The last time most of us saw law-enforcement agents posing on the local news with confiscated drugs and boasting about successful drug raids, it was the height of the war on drugs.<br><br>But in state after state, and for advocates across the country, cannabis legalization was, by design, supposed to undo the injustices of that era. It was supposed to reduce criminalization, <a href="https://www.lastprisonerproject.org/">bring about the release of people convicted</a> of nonviolent drug offenses under harsh, antiquated laws, and even <a href="https://omc.delaware.gov/socialEquity/">provide business licenses</a> to formerly incarcerated people to participate in the future of the market they helped to create.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But experts Vox spoke with questioned whether the licensing infrastructure set up by states would have ever encouraged illegal sellers to get licensed. In some ways, it was short-sighted legalization policies and nearly-impossible-to-meet regulations that created the perfect storm that states find themselves in today. New York, for example, took more than a year to license a single seller, which sent many weed-seekers right to unlicensed sellers instead.&nbsp;<br><br>“We have a limited, regulated access model, and that did not provide opportunities for all the people currently selling weed to go legit,” says Ortiz, who worked on <a href="https://reason.org/commentary/the-strengths-and-weaknesses-of-connecticuts-marijuana-legalization-law/">Connecticut’s legalization</a> effort, which he now calls <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/02/06/marijuana-new-york-connecticut-weed-shortatge-licensing-delays-federal-laws/">nothing short</a> of a <a href="https://ctmirror.org/2024/06/23/ct-cannabis-social-equity-council-grants/">debacle</a>. “When you do that, you are practically guaranteeing that a lot of the folks in the illicit market will stay there.”<br><br>States such as Connecticut and Massachusetts also legalized despite not having much of a strong agricultural base for actually growing marijuana; illegal sellers filled the gap by simply bringing in better weed from other states.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Advocates like Ortiz say the only fix now is no longer to try to stymie the trafficking or illegal shops, but full federal legalization and more licenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead, states are wrestling back control of the market through raids like those in New York, <a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/dc/youve-been-warned-dc-raids-closes-5th-weed-shop-in-a-month-illegal-weed-shop/65-86f65b0b-deb7-472d-81a3-d1048405afd9">and DC</a>, and California, and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/01/14/oregon-marijuana-legalization-black-market-enforcement-527012">Oregon,</a> and — well, you get the picture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“States and cities are trying to build a market that’s unnatural. We’ve always had a cannabis market; it’s grown on the West Coast, it’s brought to the East Coast and other parts of the country, and that market worked,” says Rafi Aliya Crockett, who was an appointee on Washington, DC’s Alcoholic Beverage and Cannabis Board until 2022. Now, states are trying to stop that market to ensure that licensees are rewarded, she says, “by knocking out their competition.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Crockett left the regulatory board frustrated over enforcement.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>“It’s the drug war 2.0,” she says. “And we’ve decided who are going to be the winners and who are going to be the losers.”</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2019, a rash of vaping-related illness broke out across the US, killing several dozen people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most sufferers reported smoking not just e-cigarettes before getting ill but THC vapes specifically. At the time, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/10/28/20936888/vaping-lung-illness-symptoms-death-cdc-report">Vox’s Julia Belluz wrote</a>: “The agency isn’t tracking whether people were using legal or black market sources to vape, but the data we have from states suggests it’s overwhelmingly illicit.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The deaths were a reminder that while buyers may not make a distinction between black market products and regulated products sold at licensed shops, the difference between them can be stark. DC’s Alcoholic Beverage and Cannabis Administration, for example, began testing drugs confiscated from unlicensed sellers and reported recently that it had <a href="https://wamu.org/story/24/10/02/dc-cracks-down-on-illegal-marijuana-shops/">found methamphetamines in marijuana flower</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cases like these — and the slew of illicit shops padlocked by police on the local news — have the potential to alarm Americans who have only just begun to support the notion of legalization, and provide fuel for those who are opposed to it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And they come as a growing number of reputable sources within medicine and the scientific community sound the alarm about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/cannabis-marijuana-risks-addiction.html">increasingly potent products sickening users</a>. There’s almost no doubt that at least some of those products are illicit and unregulated. As a report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recently noted, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/science/cannabis-laws-health-risk.html">the patchwork laws from state to state have contributed to the risks</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In that way, the black market could backfire against the very legalization movement that has allowed it to come out of the shadows.&nbsp;</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is a truth about the marijuana black market that we ought to acknowledge.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The legal cannabis market is not even 15 years old. But the illegal market is nearly 100, going underground after the US officially criminalized marijuana in the 1930s. It is nimble.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps it was naive to ever believe that a legal market would stamp it out for good. What was harder to foresee was the black market’s roaring growth in the shadow of that legalization. Now, in the battle for consumers, it just might win.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Almost all of us know what a peak experience feels like. For some people, it’s climbing mountains or surfing; for others, it’s an intense meditation practice, or maybe it’s as simple as that sensation you get on the floor at a great concert.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Call it a flow state or transcendence or whatever you want, but it’s a kind of ecstasy most of us have experienced at some point in our lives. And it’s something people have written about and explored for centuries. Indeed, there’s a whole tradition of mystical thinking that tries to make sense of these experiences and offer blueprints for achieving them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Simon Critchley is a professor of philosophy at the New School in Manhattan and the author of a fascinating new book called <a href="https://www.nyrb.com/products/mysticism"><em>Mysticism</em></a>. Although he isn’t a religious person in any conventional sense, Critchley is very interested in mystical experiences and the history of mystical literature. His work is open-minded and curious about this world in a way that is quite rare in professional philosophy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I recently invited Critchley on <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> to talk about why he thinks mysticism — or what someone he quotes in the book calls “experience in its most intense form” — isn’t about beliefs or ideas or rote rituals. Instead, he argues, it’s about how we use our attention and how we break free of habits and default modes of being in the world that make it hard for us to get outside of ourselves. And that, really, is what this conversation is about: What can we do to get out of our heads so that we can see and feel things that we otherwise can’t see and feel?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As always, there’s <em>much</em> more in the full podcast, so listen and follow <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/id1081584611">Apple Podcasts</a>,<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6NOJ6IkTb2GWMj1RpmtnxP"> Spotify</a>,<a href="https://www.pandora.com/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/PC:30793?source=stitcher-sunset"> Pandora</a>, or wherever you find podcasts.

<iframe frameborder="0" height="200" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP8911241736" width="100%"></iframe>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How do you describe mysticism?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I don&#8217;t want to ask you to just define mysticism because it&#8217;s not that simple. But let&#8217;s wrap our arms around it a little bit. You discuss a lot of different ways people have understood mysticism in the book. How do you describe it? What are some of the more useful ways to think about it?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Simon Critchley</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s a lovely short definition by Evelyn Underhill that I begin the book with, which is &#8220;experience in its most intense form.&#8221; So pushing yourself aside in order to be open to a lived intensity of experience, an experience of ecstasy. That&#8217;s the core of it for me. The other thing is that mysticism is not a religion; it&#8217;s a tendency within religion, everything that we can call religion. Which means that for as long as there have been human beings, there is something like religion. And at the core of that is something like mystical practice.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How much of the mystical experience is really about shutting down the thinking mind?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Simon Critchley</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A lot of it is about shutting down the thinking mind. It&#8217;s about pushing yourself out of the way as much as possible. I mean, I begin the book with Hamlet. And I say that Hamlet is the anti-mystic par excellence. Hamlet is entirely in his own head, and it&#8217;s the most intelligent head you could imagine being inside. He knows everything. He can see everything from 17 different angles, and he can soliloquize with the most extraordinary elegance and eloquence. But what that does in his case is it kills the capacity for love. And it kills the capacity for love for his girlfriend and partner Ophelia, for his mother, and for the world. The world is a sterile promontory for Hamlet. So Hamlet is what it&#8217;s like to be inside your head.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So the question is then, &#8220;How do you push that aside?&#8221; How do you push that self that we think is us, that actually is blocking our view of what we really should be seeing? How do you push that away? And the mystics are people that have tried to do that, who have given us kind of itineraries of ways of doing that where we can kind of leave ourselves behind, de-create ourselves as Simone Weil says, in order to undo ourselves, in order to open ourselves to something else.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There&#8217;s a great line from Marguerite Porete, where she talks about, &#8220;I have to hack and hew away at myself in order to make a space that&#8217;s large enough for love to enter in.&#8221; To hack and hew. There&#8217;s a lot of hacking and hewing in mysticism, that the self is something that has to be kind of torn apart, torn open. And if you can do that, then you can make a space that&#8217;s large enough for love to enter in.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I kept thinking about Dostoevsky&#8217;s <em>Notes from Underground</em> while reading your book and one of the opening lines is from the protagonist, who says &#8220;I swear to you that to think too much is a disease, a real actual disease.&#8221; That whole book is like a case study in how someone can be completely undone by their own thoughts, and I’ve really come to believe that being self-absorbed in that way, being trapped in your own mind in that way, is what hell actually looks like for most people.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Simon Critchley</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Oh, absolutely. I don&#8217;t believe in the existence of a place called “Hell” where most people are going to go, but I burn in hell insofar as I am a prisoner to myself. Insofar as I&#8217;m locked in this head, locked in these preoccupations, these doubts, this second-guessing, I’m in hell every day.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So is the idea here that when you can quiet your mind, when you can detach from the ego, there&#8217;s a part of the world or a way of being in the world that becomes available to you that otherwise isn&#8217;t?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Simon Critchley</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes, I think that is it. &#8220;Quieting the mind&#8221; is a very good way of putting it. It&#8217;s about quietening the mind and also trying to escape the curse of reflection. The underground man is someone who is cursed with ratiocination. He&#8217;s cursed with reflection. And to quieten the mind means to let that go and to open yourself to find what one of my favorite mystical writers, Meister Eckhart, calls &#8220;releasement.&#8221; Which is a releasement from the self, a releasement from the ego, to be out there with what is, and to stand there with what is, and not to be inside one&#8217;s head. And that means looking, attending, having cultivated practices of attention.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And these people you describe in the book, how do they get here? What do they do? Is it fasting, meditation, prayer, intense reading? What are the practices?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Simon Critchley</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Everything really has to begin with reading. The mystics were not just these people having these strange extreme experiences. They were people for whom all of this began with the reading of texts. So in many ways, the easiest way of describing how to become a mystic is by reading, by allowing your attention to be genuinely taken by something, a text that you are engaged with, and to really give yourself over to that. And not to necessarily always ask questions about whether it&#8217;s true, whether it makes sense, but to try and enter into its world. Of course you can get to that state by the adoption of a series of bodily and spiritual practices and then open yourself up. But everything really begins with reading.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How do you think about the relationship between mysticism and love? Is the experience of true love, the act of true love, itself a kind of mystical practice?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Simon Critchley</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes, I think it is.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In what way?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Simon Critchley</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, it would be love of something which is not you, love of something which is outside you. So to give oneself over to someone, to something else, completely. Another way of thinking about it is to give what you do not have and to receive that over which you have no power. So I cannot give love. I can say &#8220;I love you,&#8221; but love has the strange quality where I have to pledge myself in love. But for someone else to experience that love, or for me to get close to that love, it&#8217;s not something that I have a certain quantity of in my mind. I have to give what I do not have. And then if I&#8217;m fortunate, I can receive love as a form of grace, which is something over which I have no power. I can be in love, I can receive love, I can get love back. But it&#8217;s not in my control. So the practice of love turns on a renunciation of control.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So much of this mystical thinking points to the ultimate emptiness of a cynical, endlessly questioning intelligence, which in the end just draws you deeper and deeper into yourself. And that&#8217;s a road to nowhere. It&#8217;s certainly not a road to fulfillment.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Simon Critchley</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes, and I think that&#8217;s often what gets paraded or presented to us and applauded as being “smart.” And that seems to be the most important criterion we can use to decide whether someone should get a job or not get a job or be admitted into some institution. We want to know whether they’re smart. But there’s an emptiness to it. There&#8217;s a howling void at the core of it. And it does require, I think, work. Interesting work requires a kind of idiocy, a kind of stupidity, which I think is important in the book.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the things I do at the end is to pick up this idea from the musician Brian Eno, who talked of &#8220;idiot glee.&#8221; Idiot glee is a kind of sheer joy at the mad fact of the world. Eno is the inventor of various new categories of music, including ambient and generative music, and an all-round total genius. And the idea there is that we have to just be kind of happy idiots in a way and not be imprisoned in our smartness. This takes us back to Hamlet. Hamlet is smart. Hamlet is the ultimate expression of a cynical questioning intelligence, and it&#8217;s fun to watch. It&#8217;s extraordinary to watch. But it&#8217;s hell to be and it’s hell to be around. And the idea that we should valorize that above other forms of being human seems to me extremely, extremely strange.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You say that mysticism mostly lives on in the modern world as an aesthetic experience. What does that mean?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Simon Critchley</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If we had to put it into shorthand, it would be that the mystic becomes the romantic poet who gives us the view of the whole. Which is good news in the sense that the kind of experience that we associate with mysticism does survive in things like poetry and music, but it loses all of its institutional framing. It loses its church. It just becomes some guy writing poems in a room.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But for me, the aesthetic experience that most captures mysticism is the experience of music. And also a lot of things that we were talking about — about a quietening of the mind, a sense of leaving oneself behind, of giving up that cynical questioning intelligence — all of those things for me can be had very directly in the experience of listening to the music that I love.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">My favorite line in the book might be when you say, “It’s impossible to be an atheist while listening to the music that you love.” I&#8217;m not exactly sure what you mean, but I also know exactly what you mean and anyone who loves music will know what you mean, too. But what’s actually going on there?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Simon Critchley</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yeah, that&#8217;s it. You know exactly what I mean. I think it&#8217;s an incredible opening of the mind, and it&#8217;s hard to describe. For me, the world opened up through music, through pop music, and it gave me a vocabulary. It gave me a way of not being me, but of looking at something else. I talk about some of those experiences in relation to early ’70s Krautrock, and some punk stuff, and I end up with Nick Cave and people like that. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s an experience of the sacred in music that just is, and I think it’s why we judge people with bad musical tastes so harshly. It&#8217;s why it&#8217;s really unforgivable. &#8220;Okay, so you voted for Trump or whoever. Okay, fair enough. I&#8217;ll try to understand you. But you like <em>this</em> album? That&#8217;s unforgivable!” And if someone doesn&#8217;t appreciate something that I really love musically, then I judge them. I think, &#8220;Okay, you don&#8217;t get that? Well, good luck with the rest of your life.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But how does it do it? How does music do that? Well, the philosopher Schopenhauer thought music resonated with the will, the unconscious will. There was an attunement between us and the world through music. Nietzsche had similar sorts of ideas, namely that music is the highest art form because it resonates with the deepest level of us. I think something like that is probably true.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/9/14/9319293/syrian-refugees-civil-war">early days</a> of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFpanWNgfQY">uprising</a> against Bashar al-Assad’s Syrian regime — which came to a stunning <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/07/world/syria-war-damascus">end this weekend</a> after 13 long years of civil war as rebel forces <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/08/world/syria-war-damascus">entered the capital of Damascus</a> and Assad fled into exile — were defined by two famous pieces of graffiti.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first was written by a group of teenage boys on a school wall in early 2011 in the city of Daraa. Inspired by the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/1/27/10845114/arab-spring-failure">Arab Spring protests</a> then seemingly <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/23896050/protest-decade-2010-revolutionary-handbook-vincent-bevins-arab-spring-brazil-occupy-hong-kong">sweeping away the old order</a> in longtime dictatorships like Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya, they <a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20210311-a-decade-on-in-syrias-war-assad-has-no-moral-high-ground-to-cling-to/">wrote</a>, “You are next, doctor,” referring to Assad, who had trained and worked as an ophthalmologist in London in his early years before returning to take over the family business of ruling Syria with an iron fist. The boys were then arrested and tortured by the <a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/life/syrias-graffiti-boy-recalls-start-of-deadly-conflict/1088949">regime’s security forces</a>, an event credited by many with sparking the mass protest movement against Assad. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The message proved to be overly optimistic: Assad didn’t flee and he didn’t compromise, instead opting to crush the uprising by force, leading to a civil war that would kill as many as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/syrian-observatory-says-war-has-killed-more-than-half-a-million-idUSKCN1GO13M/">half a million people</a> and displace millions more.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The second graffiti message was a <a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190521-the-syrian-regimes-slogan-assad-or-we-burn-the-country-must-not-become-reality/">slogan scrawled</a> by pro-regime militias throughout the country in the early days of the uprising: “Assad or we burn the country.” The phrase signaled the regime’s complete unwillingness to compromise with its enemies and the lengths it would go to stay in power. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the past week, even as the rebels <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/389694/syria-rebels-bashar-assad-iran-hts-united-states-refugees-middle-east">took the ancient city of Aleppo</a> on November 30 and began streaming down the highway south toward Damascus, it still seemed far-fetched that the Syrian regime would fall — that a family that had been in power since Bashar’s father Hafez al-Assad carried out a coup 54 years ago and was willing to go so far as to <a href="https://www.state.gov/tenth-anniversary-of-the-ghouta-syria-chemical-weapons-attack/">use chemical weapons</a> on its own people and <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2016/12/16/13974780/aleppo-explained-4-minutes">reduce its own cities</a> to rubble to preserve that power would simply crumble in a matter of days.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But that’s exactly what happened: As the rebels advanced, there were numerous reports of government forces simply <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/07/world/syria-war-damascus">abandoning their positions</a> and <a href="https://x.com/danny_makki/status/1865640577401831666">discarding their uniforms</a>. The Russian government says it <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/russia-says-syrias-assad-left-114922912.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJltPSltBt1QINFpbKMB3JT1eeNofE_yqWyUOQvM1gMSC9KhvK4kTYHiOG-jNWRa_9obkYpsdTS_Xr2Q1Iob_ofPuH5UeUfwLpxG_UqvxtjkroGeyFy3LoKw7iOg9GMNxcnRCBSAqaVwIq09cACCnSCbhfsE-cCoSLPH7GTaYJP-">has offered Assad and his family asylum</a>. US officials say they have not confirmed that Assad is in Russia, but have no reason to doubt it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, footage from Damascus is showing the kind of celebrations not seen since the heady <a href="https://aje.io/pq3n3i?update=3371540">early days of the Arab Spring</a>. Videos on social media show people who were imprisoned, <a href="https://x.com/AimenDean/status/1865693614291951925">including small children</a> and people <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/bewildered-elated-prisoners-pour-out-assads-jails-flung-open-2024-12-08/">who’ve been incarcerated for decades</a>, being released from the regime’s notorious prisons. The events of the past week have raised hopes among <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/08/world/syria-war-damascus">at least some</a> of the more than 6 million Syrians who’ve fled the country — forming the world’s <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/us/global-trends">largest refugee population</a> — that they may be able to return home.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The view from Washington</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/11/30/statement-by-nsc-spokesperson-sean-savett-on-syria/">initially distanced</a> itself from the events in Syria, after the fall of Aleppo. But on Sunday, President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/08/biden-says-us-will-support-syria-and-its-neighbors-after-assad-dynasty-collapses.html">spoke</a> from the White House calling Assad’s fall a “fundamental act of justice” and a “moment of historic opportunity.” His statement also linked the event to the US support for Ukraine and Israel in their fight against Russia, Hezbollah, and Iran, all key backers of the Assad regime.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The initial caution to embrace the offensive wholeheartedly was due in no small part to the fact that the main group leading the opposition, Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/389694/syria-rebels-bashar-assad-iran-hts-united-states-refugees-middle-east">is a former affiliate of al-Qaeda</a> that is still designated as a terrorist organization by the US. On a background call on Sunday, a senior US administration official said that the US “intends to engage with [HTS] appropriately and with US interests in mind,” but would not comment on whether it would reconsider the group’s terrorist designation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are looming questions over issues including the fate of Assad’s chemical weapons and the fate of Syria’s religious minorities, including the Kurdish forces that have allied with the American military to fight ISIS. Seemingly driving this point home, the US <a href="https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/PRESS-RELEASES/Press-Release-View/Article/3989696/us-central-command-conducts-dozens-of-airstrikes-to-eliminate-isis-camps-in-cen/">conducted dozens of airstrikes</a> targeting ISIS in Syria on Sunday as part of what US Central Command called an effort to “ensure that ISIS does not seek to take advantage of the current situation to reconstitute in central Syria.” For American policymakers, the scenes in Damascus could reawaken memories of <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2017/9/18/16309558/isis-iraq-kurds-trump-us-mosul-syria-war-terrorism">Iraq</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/2/17/8051669/libya-chaos">Libya</a> — countries where longtime dictators were toppled, only to see their countries consumed by sectarian violence and terrorism.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One key difference this time around is that Assad was toppled by a mostly homegrown uprising, rather than a US-led military intervention. Not that the US has been totally absent from the scene. American military forces carried out a strike on <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/air/2024/12/04/a-10s-are-being-spotted-in-syria-heres-how-theyre-being-used/">Iranian militia targets</a> in Syria on December 3, though the Pentagon was quick to stress that this was in response to a threat to American forces, not in support of the rebels.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rebel forces also include the controversial Turkish proxy group known as the Syrian National Army (SNA) , and it appears likely <a href="https://www.kyivpost.com/post/43117">Ukraine’s intelligence services may have played some role</a> in assisting the offensive by fellow opponents of the Russian military. It’s worth noting that the fighters entering Damascus also <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kv582lpnro">included a new rebel group from southern Syria</a> dominated by veterans of the Free Syrian Army, which for years was backed by the US and other western powers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But as of now, as Biden suggested, it looks as if the biggest role international actors played in assisting the rebels was indirect and took place outside of Syria itself: After <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/388407/ceasefire-lebanon-israel-hezbollah-biden-netanyahu-us">14 months of war with Israel</a>, Assad’s ally Hezbollah was not in a position to intervene on Assad’s behalf, as it has in the past; with its main military assets <a href="https://www.vox.com/russia-ukraine">tied up in Ukraine</a>, neither was Russia.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The new rulers</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Attention will now turn to Syria’s new rulers and how they will govern. Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, the HTS leader, has said all the right things, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/12/7/syria-war-live-news-govt-says-president-al-assad-has-not-fled-damascus?update=3371098">calling on its supporters</a> to avoid vengeance against regime supporters. For now, he is leaving Assad-appointed Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi al-Jalali in place until a <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/8/ex-syrian-pm-to-supervise-state-bodies-until-transition-al-julani-says">transitional government is formed</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Saturday, a few hours before Assad’s overthrow, Vox asked Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the US-based Syrian Emergency Task Force, what a transitional government could look like. He suggested that <a href="https://press.un.org/en/2015/sc12171.doc.htm">UN Resolution 2254</a>, adopted back in 2015 but never implemented, could provide a road map: It calls for a Syrian-led political process facilitated by the United Nations leading to new elections within 18 months. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the coming months, we’ll see whether Jolani, the former al-Qaeda fighter with a $10 million price on his head from the US government, is really <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/06/middleeast/syria-rebel-forces-hayat-tahrir-al-sham-al-jolani-intl-latam/index.html">the pragmatic pluralist he now says he is</a>, and assuming he is, whether he’s capable of keeping together an ethnically and religiously diverse country, one awash with weapons, various armed groups, and traumatized by decades of dictatorship and war.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A big question mark is how Damascus’s new rulers will contend with the Kurdish-ruled northeast corner of the country, particularly if the incoming Trump administration follows through on plans from his last term to remove US troops from the region. There have already been <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/as-assad-falls-fighting-intensifying-over-northern-syria-town-/7891689.html">concerning reports in recent days</a> of clashes between Kurdish forces and the Turkish-backed SNA. On Saturday, <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113612147757280297" rel="nofollow">Trump posted on Truth Social</a> that the offensive in Syria was “NOT OUR FIGHT” and that America “SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyond these questions, Assad’s fall should be a reminder of some important facts. One, governments and analysts <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/12/13/23998928/hamas-taliban-isis-attacks-terrorism-extremist-groups-israel-palestine">continue to be extremely bad</a> at assessing the strength of non-state militant groups like HTS, their ability to launch major offensives, and the ability of governments to resist them. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Two, authoritarian regimes are often much weaker than they appear. As the just-freed Russian dissident Vladimir Kara-Murza <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/388169/kara-murza-putin-russia">recently told Vox</a>, referring to his own country, “In these repressive, tyrannical regimes, you don’t know what’s happening beneath the surface … there may be problems developing for the regime, but nobody’s aware of them until they come out of the open and suddenly everything collapses.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the past few years, the world <a href="https://authory.com/app/content/aac980a0a94fd4cb088ac55c457c93166">had all but decided that Assad</a> had won the civil war. Regional governments that had spent years trying to topple him were welcoming him back into the fold, while the US was moving on to other priorities. If the last few days teach us anything, it’s that governments like Assad’s can often be more brittle than they appear from the outside, and it just takes a strong push to knock them over. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For all the very justified concern and caution about what lies ahead for Syria, that should be some cause for optimism.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The stereotypical image of public housing in America is one of deteriorating buildings, urban blight, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/11/nyregion/new-york-city-housing-authority-lead-paint.html">dysfunctional housing authorities</a> in seemingly never-ending crises. Residents routinely deal with <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2022/01/27/tenant-never-wins/private-takeover-public-housing-puts-rights-risk-new-york-city">bad living conditions</a>, including heat failures, pest infestations, mold, and leaks. And public housing projects are often found in <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/housing/public-housing">areas with concentrated poverty</a> and in underserved, racially segregated neighborhoods.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By and large, America’s experiment with public housing has been <a href="https://www.governing.com/community/americas-failed-experiment-in-public-housing">viewed as a failure</a> — so much so that housing authorities have <a href="https://prospect.org/infrastructure/housing/public-housing-going-private-residents-fighting-back/">offloaded some of their responsibilities</a> to the private sector.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the demise of public housing was not an inevitable outcome. As my colleague Rachel Cohen <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23278643/affordable-public-housing-inflation-renters-home">has pointed out</a>, other countries have successfully pulled it off. Governments around the world have shown that they can <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/23/magazine/vienna-social-housing.html">operate mixed-income housing developments</a> that have reliable maintenance and upkeep and that public housing doesn’t have to segregate poor people away from the middle class.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So why did public housing in the United States age so poorly?&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A bold experiment that was designed to fail</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The federal government’s plans to build public housing started in the 1930s, as part of the New Deal, in an <a href="https://nlihc.org/resource/public-housing-history#:~:text=The%20federal%20public%20housing%20program,result%20of%20powerful%20grassroots%20organizing.">effort to create jobs during the Great Depression</a> and address the country’s housing shortage.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But efforts to undermine public housing are about as old as the efforts to build it. From the outset, opposition was fierce. Many Americans didn’t like the idea of the government using their tax dollars to subsidize poor people’s housing, and real estate developers <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/09/public-housing-success/406561/">were concerned about having to compete</a> with the government.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Housing Act of 1949, which had a goal of providing “a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family,” bolstered America’s public housing plans by heavily investing in the construction of new housing units. But by then, the federal government had already <a href="https://ggwash.org/view/78164/how-public-housing-was-destined-to-fail">undermined its own stated plans</a> by capping construction costs (which encouraged using cheap materials and discouraged modern appliances) and allowing racial segregation. Congress had also doomed public housing authorities’ ability to raise revenue through rents in 1936 when it passed the George-Healey Act, which <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/homes-for-all/">established income limits</a> for who can qualify for public housing — making mixed-income public housing models impossible for federally funded projects.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As housing projects started to draw more Black residents, white people who lived in public housing started leaving, especially after the Civil Rights Acts of the 1960s <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/pdredge/pdr-edge-pdrat50-101723.html">banned racial discrimination in housing</a>. This was partly because the Federal Housing Authority <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/09/public-housing-success/406561/">pushed for more people to own homes</a> and expanded its loans mostly to white people, helping white families move out of the projects. Black families didn’t receive the same opportunity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“You saw a change in the racial composition, which simply added to the stigma and the pattern of administrative neglect that characterized many housing authorities,” the historian Ed Goetz <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/09/public-housing-success/406561/">told the Atlantic</a> in 2015. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Starting with President Richard Nixon — who <a href="https://yonahfreemark.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Myth-Public-Housing-Failures-Led-to-a-Natural-Death.pdf">declared that the US government</a> had turned into “the biggest slumlord in history” and <a href="https://nlihc.org/resource/public-housing-history#:~:text=The%20federal%20public%20housing%20program,result%20of%20powerful%20grassroots%20organizing.">suspended federal spending</a> on subsidized housing — public housing started facing serious austerity measures and never recovered. Federal investments shifted away from building new public housing units and toward housing vouchers and public-private partnerships.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the decades that followed, public housing started declining in quality, and Congress <a href="https://nlihc.org/resource/public-housing-history">funded a program to demolish</a> dilapidated public housing units and replace them with newly constructed or renovated mixed-income developments. But <a href="https://nlihc.org/resource/public-housing-history">according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition</a>, those demolitions were an “overcorrection”; public housing simply needed more funding and better management.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>It didn’t have to be this way</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">America’s public housing was an ambitious program that consistently faced efforts by lawmakers to undermine it. Throughout the program’s history, legislation deliberately limited its potential to house Americans as needed. In addition to the George-Healey Act, laws like the 1998 Faircloth Amendment <a href="https://nationalhomeless.org/repeal-faircloth-amendment/">put a ceiling</a> on the number of homes public housing authorities are allowed to own.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But that doesn’t mean that public housing in the United States is entirely devoid of successes. The general picture of decay and neglect ignores the many positive experiences people have had living in government-run dwellings. As Goetz, a public policy professor at the University of Minnesota, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/09/public-housing-success/406561/">writes</a>, “The story of American public housing is one of quiet successes drowned out by loud failures.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More than <a href="https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/101482/the20future20of20public20housing20public20housing20fact20sheet_0.pdf">2 million people live in public housing</a> in the United States, and without it, many of them would struggle to find affordable shelter. Indeed, there are countless stories of people whose lives would be tangibly worse without public housing. Mike Connolly, a Massachusetts state representative who has proposed expanding public housing, is one example. “Personally, I view [public housing] as a success. I was raised in a public housing project in Norwood, Massachusetts,” he told me. “Having that stable environment — not being subject to eviction, not being necessarily subject to a particular cost burden around housing — I think was really terrific for me and gave me the opportunity to develop into someone who has been doing a lot of good things in life.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These bright spots show that there’s a solid foundation that the United States can build on rather than abandon its public housing experiment. “I think of [public housing] as a successful program that has provided low-cost, moderate-quality shelter to millions of people for almost a century across the United States,” Paul E. Williams, the executive director of the Center for Public Enterprise, told Vox. “It has been hampered and limited in its ability to do more by policy mistakes over the past 80 years.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So if America wants to be a public housing success story, it can. It just has to stop sabotaging its own efforts to get there.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">H.G. Wells is probably best known for his story about an alien invasion, “The War of the Worlds,” and some of his other fantastical science fiction. But he also dabbled in some less well known prehistorical fiction. In 1921, he published a story about early modern humans and Neanderthals called “<a href="https://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks06/0602061h.html">The Grisly Folk</a>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In it, a group of early modern humans is wandering around. Wells makes it clear that he does not think they are especially refined. They engage in scintillating dialog like:</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>“Ugh!” said one abruptly and pointed.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>“Ugh!” cried his brother.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But though these “true men,” as Wells calls them, were “still savages, very prone to violence and convulsive in their lusts and desires,” they were, he claims, recognizably human.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We can understand something of what was going on in their minds, those of us who can remember the fears, desires, fancies and superstitions of our childhood,” he says.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By contrast, the antagonists of this particular story, the “grisly men,” are not recognizably human at all. These are Neanderthals, and, Wells imagines, they were less intelligent than “true men”; they “had no speech” and “did not understand.” They were less social than true men, and senselessly violent. In the story, they make a hobby of making off with the children of “true men.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And, in Wells’ version of events, they treated their own children no better. He writes descriptions like:&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>“A male may have gone with a female or so; perhaps they parted in the winter and came together in the summer; when his sons grew big enough to annoy him, the grisly man killed them or drove them off. If he killed them he may have eaten them. If they escaped him they may have returned to kill him. The grisly folk may have had long unreasoning memories and very set purposes.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In short: Wells assumed Neanderthals were unintelligent brutes. And he was absolutely not alone. For around a century, this was the prevailing narrative about Neanderthals. It was present, not just in Wells’s imagination, but in scientific papers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In more recent decades, we’ve realized that this narrative is <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/rethinking-neanderthals-83341003/">almost</a> <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/society/2023/new-finds-about-neanderthal-brains-and-behavior">certainly</a> <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0096424">incorrect</a>. Researchers have revisited old Neanderthal bones and tools, and realized that our prior understanding of these early human peoples was misguided.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, the myth of the ignorant Neanderthal is so pervasive that headlines often lead with it. “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/apr/30/neanderthals-not-less-intelligent-humans-scientists">Neanderthals were not less intelligent than modern humans, scientists find</a>” reads a Guardian headline. Or, from HowStuffWorks:&nbsp; “<a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/evolution/worlds-oldest-sample-string-was-made-by-neanderthals.htm">More Proof Neanderthals Weren&#8217;t Stupid: They Made Their Own String</a>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The question is: Where did this idea even come from? Why did researchers think Neanderthals were so unintelligent to begin with?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It turns out there&#8217;s a really deep past to that,” says Paige Madison, a science writer who wrote <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/45380543">a journal article on this topic</a>, and is writing an upcoming book on human origins. “There’s a reason why we tend to think of Neanderthals as these kind of brutish, dumb, lesser Homo sapiens.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We spoke to Madison as part of the latest episode of <em>Unexplainable</em>, Vox’s science podcast, which looks at how difficult it is to really know anything about Neanderthals at all.&nbsp;</p>

<iframe frameBorder="0" height="482" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?p=VMP9331026707" width="100%"></iframe>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What follows is my conversation with Madison, edited for clarity and length.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Byrd Pinkerton&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Don’t leave me in suspense. What is the deep, dark reason that we thought of Neanderthals as dumb?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Paige Madison&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So the first Neanderthal fossils [recognized as such] <a href="https://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/homo-neanderthalensis#:~:text=Neanderthal%201%20was%20the%20first,%2C%20the%20thick%2C%20strong%20bones.">came out of the ground in the 1850s</a>. And you have this confluence of factors that shaped how people were thinking about Neanderthals and even how they were thinking about themselves.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This was [a time] of colonialism, and you had all of these assumptions about what variation meant amongst humans and what it meant for potentially taking over other cultures and extracting resources from them. There were a lot of assumptions about certain groups of living humans being superior to other groups. Those assumptions made their way into the science of Neanderthals. [They] were just sort of taking [their] worldview on humans and applying it to these fossils in the past.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Byrd Pinkerton&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Is there a specific example that helps explain how the culture of the late 19th century wound up informing how people looked at bones?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Paige Madison&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the time you had this new science that was really trying to put living humans into categories and characterize them and understand differences. The form that it really took was the measurement of skulls. <a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/new-take-on-infamous-Morton-skulls">There were scientists collecting skulls from all over the world and trying to measure these variations</a>. One was the presence of a brow ridge, which is something that varies a little bit with living humans, and there was this idea that [a brow ridge] was more primitive.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And then the presence of a steep forehead. They thought that this had to do with a region of the brain that was more developed. And so they would generally categorize most Europeans, for example, as having this steep forehead, and they would use this as evidence that these groups were superior.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those differences are minuscule and they are certainly not meaningful in terms of intellect and cognition, but at the time they were seen as incredibly meaningful and a way that you could differentiate these groups.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So Neanderthals then come out of the ground and just get slotted into that worldview. They fit in exactly the spot that these European scientists were categorizing as the lower end of human intellect. The more “primitive” end. And it automatically then carried with it the implication that these were creatures that were primitive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Byrd Pinkerton&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Where did the perception of the hunched Neanderthal come from? Beyond just them being foolish, I feel like I also have this impression of them knuckle-dragging around. Slumping.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Paige Madison</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yeah! So there’s this story that you will find in textbooks, where basically this one French scientist, Marcellin Boule, <a href="https://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/fossils/la-chapelle-aux-saints">misinterpreted a Neanderthal skeleton</a>. And as the story goes, he got a hold of one of the first really complete specimens and he took a look at it and decided that these were these hunched-over brutes that were so dumb that they couldn&#8217;t even really stand up straight.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But I think he kind of applied this brutish conception that had already existed and applied it to their posture. And so of course that is significant. It did partially shape how we think about them. But he certainly did not invent it by any means.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Byrd Pinkerton&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Got it. So a variety of European scientists developed this narrative about Neanderthals as dummies, people who were somehow inferior to other early modern humans. How did we start pushing back on that story?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Paige Madison</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It definitely wasn’t just one thing. Very rarely in the history of science do we ever see big conceptions shifting because of one thing. So just as Boule didn&#8217;t create this image [of the brutish Neanderthal] alone, it wasn’t destroyed by one scientist alone, but instead was more of a confluence of factors that happened all around the same time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of those was World War II coming to a close and the consequences of the involvement of race science in World War II being really clear. So, for a historian, it doesn&#8217;t seem to be a coincidence that you see people starting to push back on this dumb, brutish, primitive conception [of Neanderthals] right around the time that people are also pushing back on the racial conceptions of living humans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another thing was, scientists actually got back into the museum in Paris, where the skeleton that Marcellin Boule looked at was housed … and they took a second look. They noticed that this was an elderly individual, and it was very clear that there were signs of arthritis on the bones.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Byrd Pinkerton&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So basically it was like if people 10,000 years in the future took like one super arthritic old man and were like, “Yep, every person in the 2000s was just like this 72-year-old.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Paige Madison</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Exactly. And it&#8217;s worth mentioning, too, that the signs of arthritis on the skeleton are well recognized and Boule probably should have been able to recognize them. So it kind of goes to show how our expectations can lead us towards a certain conclusion and kind of push us in that direction even when the evidence isn&#8217;t quite there.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s why you see these interpretations change over time — because there&#8217;s so much else that&#8217;s going into the interpretation. It&#8217;s not as simple as looking at the bones and immediately knowing exactly what they mean. That is being filtered through tons of other information, both scientific and cultural. You know, we just can&#8217;t turn off that lens at any given moment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Byrd Pinkerton&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So&#8230; it’s kind of like Boule’s ideas in his time were easily accepted because they made sense in the cultural context that they were a part of, but later, they were rejected, in part because of evidence and also in part maybe because the narrative had shifted. People were questioning race science anyway. They were starting to question race science applied to Neanderthals. And so suddenly it&#8217;s almost like it opened up space to also question this image that Boule had [of Neanderthals]?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Paige Madison</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Exactly. Suddenly the earlier ideas about Neanderthals just didn’t make as much sense.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Byrd Pinkerton&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It sounds like what you&#8217;re saying is that our perception of Neanderthals has always been less about Neanderthals and more about ourselves, or our current cultural moment? Like, if you read what people historically have written about Neanderthals, you learn less about Neanderthals and you just learn more about the scientists and the society that they live in?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Paige Madison</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s exactly what I would argue. Some scholars have said that it’s a little bit like holding a mirror up to ourselves, because Neanderthals were so closely related to humans living today.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think what’s interesting about it — and you&#8217;ll hear this from a lot of historians of science — is that it’s much easier to see that in the past, to accuse <em>them</em> of making mistakes given their biases or their cultural or political leanings, but in fact, what most historians and philosophers of science would argue is that that is still going on. It’s just harder to see it in the present.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Byrd Pinkerton</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How do modern scientists guard against this in their attempts to better understand Neanderthals?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Paige Madison</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think the best thing that most scientists can do at this point is to be very explicit about what their biases could be, what the limitations might be, and really just put all of that out on the table so that we can examine it the best that we can.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One really strong way that I see this playing out in the science is [scientists] recognizing that their worldviews are shaping the kinds of questions that they’re asking and the ways they&#8217;re asking those questions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, for example, if you find artwork in a cave, and you assume that artwork is something that only Homo sapiens have done and that Neanderthals were not capable of it … then you never even ask the question [“could Neanderthals have made this?”]. You just ask “Which Homo sapiens did this and when?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But if you come into a cave and you see that there&#8217;s art in there, you can ask, “Who did this?” in a more open way.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s something I work with scientists [on] a lot — just thinking about the ways that their starting points, their questions, have already either opened or closed certain possibilities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Twenty-five years ago, millions of people were nervously looking ahead to New Year&#8217;s Eve.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When the clocks struck midnight, they wondered, would they lose power? Would planes fall from the sky? Would banks collapse and the world order crumble?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such nightmarish fantasies were never truly based in reality, but the public genuinely feared that the computer systems society had become increasingly reliant on would fail at the stroke of midnight, ushering in a dark beginning to the year 2000.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For years, computer engineers and government officials had worked on what was then called <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/Y2K-bug/">the Year 2000 problem</a>, also known as the Millennium Bug. Starting in the 1950s and ’60s, programmers stripped the first two digits of the year from code in order to save time and money. The assumption was that the code would be replaced long before the turn of the millennium.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But in the following decades, engineers began to sound the alarm that if computer systems switched from 1999 to 1900, it would cause massive disruptions, affecting the electric grid, nuclear power plants, hospitals, supermarkets, government agencies, and home computer users.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the final months and weeks of 1999, officials expressed optimism that the crisis would be averted, and that the countless hours and billions of dollars invested in the problem had minimized its impact. But that didn’t stop people panicking and stocking up on food, water, and weapons. Celebrities <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x65AAsVNxKI">weighed in</a> on whether they were freaking out or not. <em>The Simpsons</em> episode <a href="https://youtu.be/WWPdBhlsBYI?feature=shared">“Life’s a Glitch, Then You Die”</a> parodied the fears.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But New Year’s Eve came and went, and the impact turned out to be relatively minor. As a result, Y2K has become somewhat of a <a href="https://time.com/5752129/y2k-bug-history/">punchline</a> and an <a href="https://today.yougov.com/society/articles/48653-americans-remember-y2k-exaggerated-problem-poll">exaggerated threat</a>, despite the unsung heroes who worked diligently behind the scenes to prepare.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 1999, actor and recent <em>Saturday Night Live</em> cast member Kyle Mooney, then 15 years old, felt somewhat let down by the anticlimactic ending to the Y2K panic.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Twenty-five years later, he has directed his debut film, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4f9gCTLhYs"><em>Y2K</em></a>, which imagines a nightmare scenario far beyond what anyone had predicted. Sean Rameswaram talked to Mooney about his memories of Y2K and what it was like revisiting late ’90s culture with a cast that was mostly born after the event he depicts.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Sean</strong> <strong>Rameswaram</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tell us about the thing you made.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Kyle Mooney</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I made a movie called <em>Y2K</em>, wrote it with my pal Evan [Winter], and it&#8217;s somewhat based on our lives. I was 15 when Y2K happened. He was 14. And for those of us who were alive during Y2K, it was a letdown and nothing really happened. And I think I&#8217;ve always been sort of minorly obsessed with that. So one day the idea struck me to make a movie about “teenagers go to a party and Y2K actually happens.” I pitched it to Evan and we started working on it.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Sean Rameswaram</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Amazing. Can you tell us what you were doing on New Year&#8217;s Eve, 1999?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Kyle Mooney</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I hung out with my friend Mark. We watched the MTV New Year&#8217;s Eve special. So I would have, I guess, been enjoying Carson Daly riffing with Kathy Griffin. I don&#8217;t know that I was particularly super nervous or frightened as to what could happen when midnight arrived. But my mom prepped and she got some goodies just in case, I guess, the world was destroyed in some way or another.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the moment, it just sort of came and went. I don&#8217;t know what thought I gave to it until I just started, again, minorly obsessing over it. It would just hit me every once in a while. But I don&#8217;t really know that I put much immediate thought into it in the moment.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Sean Rameswaram</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And of course, you cast your movie with a bunch of teenagers. I wanted to ask whether something about this buildup and this letdown felt sort of essentially teenage to you.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Kyle Mooney</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I&#8217;m sure that is true. The story we were always interested in telling was, to a degree, a riff on teen culture of the era, specifically, like, all of these movies were coming out that were geared toward us. It was <em>She&#8217;s All That</em>, <em>Can&#8217;t Hardly Wait</em>, <em>American Pie</em>, <em>10 Things I Hate About You</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To a degree, I don&#8217;t know that I thought in terms of, like, this is speaking to teenagedom as much as like, this is sort of like the culture that was being blasted to me, and I wanted to return to that.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Sean Rameswaram</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unlike all those movies you just named, this movie takes a fairly dark turn. As much as you&#8217;re willing to share with people, what happens when the clocks strike 12 in <em>Y2K</em>, your movie?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Kyle Mooney</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At midnight, the machines go crazy and start killing people, essentially. It&#8217;s weird. I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;ve ever made anything that has maybe been so violent, but I was really excited by just taking left turns and doing something that elicits reaction. I really hope that if people see it, you know, there are some laughs, there are some tears, and there are some moments of like, “Oh my shit, that&#8217;s fucking crazy.”&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Sean Rameswaram</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">[Laughs.]</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Kyle Mooney</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Did I say, “Oh my shit”?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Sean Rameswaram</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">[Laughs.] You did.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Kyle Mooney</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Oh my shit. I kind of don&#8217;t hate that.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Sean Rameswaram</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We&#8217;ve also got a long lineage of movies in which technology turns on us and terrorizes us. And <em>Y2K</em>, your movie, is the latest. Why do we love to watch technology try and kill us? Did you think about that while you were making this movie?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Kyle Mooney</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think that fear is constantly present. I feel like with the introduction of electronics and robotics, there&#8217;s always been that thought that, like, when is the point that these things are going to turn on us? And even in the course of working on this movie, we started in 2019 and now it&#8217;s 2024 that it&#8217;s coming out. We&#8217;ve seen an evolution of AI and it&#8217;s seemingly become more threatening and more real than even it was when we first started talking about this.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/https___cdn.sanity.io_images_xq1bjtf4_production_602b4dfeec69d362fc76514396ca5732f64b8eb0-7952x5304-1.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752726382539,100,78.494547234923" alt="A still from the film showing three teens in a house showing the signs of a New Year’s Eve party (lots of bottles, empty solo cups, and streamers)." title="A still from the film showing three teens in a house showing the signs of a New Year’s Eve party (lots of bottles, empty solo cups, and streamers)." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Jaeden Martell, Rachel Zegler, Julian Dennison in &lt;em&gt;Y2K.&lt;/em&gt;" data-portal-copyright="" />
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Sean Rameswaram</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A lot of the actors in your movie weren&#8217;t even alive on New Year&#8217;s Eve 1999. Did you have to have, like, Camp Y2K, where you kind of gave them the essentials of what life was like back then?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Kyle Mooney</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We made playlists for them. We sent them lists of movies to watch. And, you know, any phrase or reference they didn&#8217;t know, obviously, we&#8217;d fill them in. It was really on them to decide how much they wanted to invest in learning about the culture and the time.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think the characters, even though they are these archetypes of the period and some of them are very distinctly late ’90s, early 2000s, there is a universal quality to them I think that even our young actors could relate to —&nbsp; the vulnerability of being this age.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Sean Rameswaram</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Y2K, beyond your movie even, is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/style/fashion/y2k-time-cut-didi-the-fire-inside-early-2000s-nostalgia-movies-6815dd0f">having a moment</a>. I mean, there are Y2K vintage clothing stores. Charli XCX, who had a huge year, has a song on her album called “Von Dutch.” Did the fact that Y2K is back in so many ways — you know, kids using digital point-and-shoot cameras again — help you sell this movie to A24?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Kyle Mooney</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think so. I mean, I can&#8217;t say that I&#8217;m like the king of the zeitgeist by any means, you know what I mean? But you kind of got a sense that <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22364404/low-rise-jeans-trend-y2k-fashion">Y2K as a fashion aesthetic</a> was coming back. But it&#8217;s grown in the time from the conceptualization to now. And now I feel like I&#8217;m just lucky that we&#8217;re getting it out in time because we&#8217;re probably at a moment where people will be sick of it after this, you know what I mean? And we could be like a month or two away.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Sean Rameswaram</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Do you think we can learn anything from Y2K, from your experience making this movie?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Kyle Mooney</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You know, Y2K was something that we were overprepared for. And, like we said, nothing happened.&nbsp; There were people working on these computers and making sure that we were ready. So there are these unsung heroes. Who knows what would have happened if they hadn&#8217;t done the work that they did?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But I think we&#8217;ve seen in our fairly recent culture and history that there are moments that we were not prepared for and that then kind of shifted our lives. And so there is something to always be thoughtful about, like, “Okay, we should maybe take this somewhat seriously and think about it and make sure we&#8217;re all good if something bad were to happen.” Let&#8217;s not be super obsessive about it, but let&#8217;s be smart about it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s often a threshold for how weird something can sound beyond which most people stop taking it seriously. One of the quickest ways to kill a conversation, for example, is to start telling someone about that strange dream you had. Perhaps an even more surefire way to land on the far side of that threshold is to tell them about your trip on one of the most bizarre, powerful, and under-studied psychedelic drugs: DMT, or, if you speak chemistry, N,N-dimethyltryptamine.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tales of hyperdimensional worlds populated by various intelligent creatures —&nbsp;tiny <a href="https://realitysandwich.com/dmt-research-from-1956-to-the-edge-of-time/">machine elves</a> eager to teach you the universe’s secrets or <a href="https://www.iflscience.com/why-do-people-see-elves-and-other-entities-when-they-smoke-dmt-62234">giant praying mantises</a> that seem to harvest human emotions —&nbsp;are commonplace in DMT trip reports.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because these trips are so bizarre, even compared to other psychedelics, DMT has largely lived on the fringes of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23721486/ketamine-dmt-lsd-psychedelics-magic-mushrooms-legalization-recreation-psilocybin">ongoing revival in psychedelic research</a> and therapy. Ketamine clinics are spawning left and right. MDMA therapy teeters <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/365820/mdma-therapy-lykos-therapeutics-maps-psychedelics-ecstasy">on the brink</a> of government approval. Legal psilocybin centers are set to open across multiple states. But DMT, once <a href="https://maps.org/srv/htdocs/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/01883lea.pdf">called</a> &#8220;the nuclear bomb of the psychedelic family” by Harvard psychologist and psychedelic hype-man Timothy Leary, has lagged pretty far behind in mainstream attention and scientific interest.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s slowly starting to change. “We unashamedly think there’s value here, beyond the weird stuff,” neuroscientist <a href="https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/c.timmermann-slater15">Chris Timmermann</a>, who leads the DMT Research Group at Imperial College London, told me. Like its more conventional psychedelic counterparts, DMT <a href="https://cybin.com/development-pipeline/">could play</a> a role in psychedelic therapy, offering a new treatment for conditions ranging from <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/benjaminadams/2022/08/17/small-pharmas-patented-injectable-dmt-formulation-could-help-battle-depression/?sh=77645ccd641a">depression</a> to <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/14/4/348">cluster headaches</a> — and it could even serve as a kind of <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/169525/psychonauts-training-psychedelics-dmt-extended-state">rocket fuel</a> for the science of consciousness.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The compound naturally occurs in a variety of mammals and plants. “DMT is everywhere,” wrote chemist Alexander Shulgin, who created nearly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/30/magazine/dr-ecstasy.html">200 psychedelics</a> through the late 20th century. Humans have been ingesting a slow-acting form of it for at least a few hundred, and perhaps <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6561276/">thousands</a> of years by boiling DMT-containing vines and leaves to make the psychoactive brew <a href="https://www.sup.org/books/anthropology/global-ayahuasca/excerpt/introduction-excerpt">ayahuasca</a>. But scientists didn’t figure out how to isolate, extract, and ingest pure DMT on its own <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6088236/">until 1956</a>, which branched the drug off from ayahuasca into its own history.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>On high doses of DMT, the self does not disappear. Instead, the self feels largely intact, but transported to alternate worlds reconstructed out of the chaos.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Timothy Leary <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/01/05/575392333/nixons-manhunt-for-the-high-priest-of-lsd-in-the-most-dangerous-man-in-america">was</a> the “high priest of LSD” in the 1960s, the eccentric philosopher <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/09/us/terence-mckenna-53-dies-patron-of-psychedelic-drugs.html">Terrence McKenna</a> became DMT’s rhapsodic bard a generation later. “My entire expectation of the nature of the world was just being shredded in front of me,” McKenna <a href="https://chacruna.net/terence-mckenna-first-smoked-dmt/">recalled</a> of his first trip. “All this stuff was just so weird and so alien and so un-English-able that it was a complete shock — I mean, the literal turning inside out of my intellectual universe.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-1322408018.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.676808305058,100,78.646383389884" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Terrence McKenna." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Like other psychedelics, DMT was pushed underground when President Richard Nixon outlawed it in 1970. Well before today’s psychedelic renaissance, it was <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1941365/">research</a> on DMT’s hallucinogenic <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/496497?casa_token=TMQ_XApNlkMAAAAA:uISolFyl-t7E-re-mNS7Bi0GCFbWyMBO58pWXyaNryWgIBeJ-Hha6LymsCOvrwNHeAjdJkJSww">effects</a> led by psychiatrist Rick Strassman in the early 1990s that marked the first return of legal psychedelic research.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the decades since, other psychedelics have claimed the spotlight, but in the last few years, DMT research has shown hints of a resurgence. The drug’s unique properties may make it both a more convenient therapy and a more powerful tool for studying the mind than its trippy counterparts: While psilocybin or LSD trips run for <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06204-3">several hours</a>, a DMT trip winds down after just <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-53363-y">20 minutes</a>, and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10411500/">unlike</a> with other psychedelics, users <a href="https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/0006-3223(95)00200-6/abstract">don’t build up</a> a tolerance to DMT that diminishes its impact.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">DMT’s propensity to construct rich alternate realities in the minds of its users can also help push the study of consciousness into new terrain. The drug puts the mind’s ability to create immersive, convincing models of the world on full display — the very same thing our minds do <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area/376839/creativity-predictive-processing-chaos-mark-miller">during ordinary consciousness</a> (and dreams). And if DMT can simulate that process in a quick and controllable way, then studying the mechanics of DMT trips could help us learn more about the construction of our sober minds, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, even with all the world’s research funding and best scientific minds, we may never be able to truly “explain” what happens under the influence of this peculiar molecule — but there’s certainly more to know than we do now. So to the woefully incomplete degree that’s currently possible, here’s the news on DMT as we know it today, in not-quite-all of its curious and under-studied glory.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">When pure DMT hit the scene</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pure DMT was first synthesized in <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6088236/">1931</a> but was set aside, leaving its effects unknown. It wasn’t until 1956 that the first straight DMT hit was reported. Hungarian pharmacologist Stephen Szára had wanted to study LSD, but upon requesting some from the Swiss Sandoz Laboratories, which had been supplying to psychiatrists in the 1950s, he was denied. Communist governments scared them enough, but communists with acid? That was too risky.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No matter, thought Szára. He pored over the existing psychedelic literature, found research identifying DMT as an active ingredient in longstanding psychedelic drinks of the Amazon, extracted it from the Mimosa hostilis plant, and became the first person to describe what happens when you take a hit.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-1417906279.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,23.826799894557,100,52.346400210886" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">From his Budapest laboratory, Szára <a href="https://realitysandwich.com/dmt-research-from-1956-to-the-edge-of-time/">reported</a> “brilliantly coloured oriental motifs and, later, wonderful scenes altering very rapidly.” Immediately after, he recruited volunteers from his hospital to try the strange drug. In these first DMT trials throughout the late 1950s, participants <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13554710/">reported</a> rooms “full of spirits” and “curious objects.”</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“DMT is the most efficient reality-switching molecule currently known to exist”</p><cite>Andrew Gallimore</cite></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rumors of the immensely powerful, conveniently short-lasting psychedelic began to spread through the 1960s counterculture (famously, they were pretty into mind-altering drugs). By 1962, word of DMT <a href="https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/timothy-leary">reached Timothy Leary</a>, who was then researching psychedelics at Harvard. He ran experiments that applied his idea of carefully crafting the “<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2050324516683325#:~:text=The%20set%20and%20setting%20hypothesis,which%20the%20experience%20takes%20place)%20(">set and setting</a>” of a trip — focusing on how everything from a room’s lighting to one’s preexisting cultural ideals shape the psychedelic experience — to DMT. Though Leary’s experiments successfully nudged them toward increasingly positive experiences, DMT trips remained indelibly weird and never rose to the level of LSD among the counterculture’s preferred vehicles for exploring altered states of consciousness. When it was outlawed under the 1970 <a href="https://www.dea.gov/drug-information/csa">Controlled Substances Act</a>, the modest interest that remained was largely put on ice.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The freeze lasted until the early 1990s, when Strassman managed to jump through the heap of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1941365/">regulatory hoops</a> to carry out legal <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8297216/">DMT research</a> at the University of New Mexico, making DMT the origin of today’s revival in psychedelic science. He went on to publish a <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/DMT_The_Spirit_Molecule/J14oDwAAQBAJ?hl=en">book</a> in 2000 that dubbed DMT “the spirit molecule,” which was later adapted into one of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180724025758/https://variety.com/2018/film/news/dermot-mulroney-melora-walters-hard-luck-love-song-1202882056/">most-viewed</a> documentaries on Netflix, starring podcaster Joe Rogan.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, DMT remained concentrated more on podcasts and internet forums than in the medical and therapeutic highways toward mainstream acceptance like MDMA and psilocybin. High-profile psychedelics research —&nbsp;like much of neuroscientist Roland Griffiths’s <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16826400/">work</a> at Johns Hopkins or studies funded by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (<a href="https://maps.org/">MAPS</a>) —&nbsp;has tended to focus on psilocybin or MDMA. By 2019, the world’s first <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/190994/imperial-launches-worlds-first-centre-psychedelics/#:~:text=Funded%20by%20more%20than%20%C2%A3,into%20a%20licensed%20treatment%20for">dedicated academic center</a> for psychedelic science opened at Imperial College London, where Timmermann was finishing up his PhD on the neuroscience of DMT. After advising a few PhD students also working on DMT, he figured, “Let’s make this into a group and focus our energies into understanding [DMT] from a consciousness perspective,” launching the university’s DMT Research Group in 2022.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, Timmermann said, “there’s definitely traction here. And the way to develop that is by doing good science.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">What it’s like to take DMT</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, the fun stuff. Neurobiologist Andrew Gallimore, author of a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Death-Astonishment-Confronting-Mystery-Strangest/dp/1250357756">forthcoming book</a> on the history and science of DMT, <em>Death by Astonishment</em>, has <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reality-Switch-Technologies-Psychedelics-Exploration/dp/1739110102">called</a> it “the most efficient reality-switching molecule currently known to exist, almost instantaneously transporting the tripper from the Consensus Reality Space to a bizarre hyperdimensional omniverse teeming with superintelligent entities of every (un)imaginable form and character.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We’ll get to all that, but let’s move slowly.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Recreationally, most people smoke DMT either from a pipe or, especially nowadays, a vape pen. The effects kick in within a few seconds, before you can even exhale the first hit. All psychedelic experiences are dose dependent — a gram and a half of dried mushrooms might as well be a different drug than 5 grams — and with DMT in particular, ascending doses lead not just to more intense experiences, but to different kinds altogether.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s no agreed upon “map” of what <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300276091/psychonauts/">psychonauts</a> (self-experimenters who explore altered states of consciousness) call the “DMT space.” Different people slice it up in different ways, with varying <a href="https://x.com/FatherMcKennaa/status/1582107818848837634">degrees of detail</a>. Some taxonomies <a href="https://qri.org/blog/hyperbolic-geometry-dmt">have six levels</a>, with names like “The Magic Eye Level” and “The Waiting Room.” Others have mapped out <a href="https://smoothbrains.net/posts/2023-02-19-dmt-with-two-eyes-open-part-i.html">four-step ladders</a>. For brevity’s sake, I’m going to zoom out as much as possible and cram the weirdness of DMT trips into three simple categories: low, medium, and high doses.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At low doses, the onset of DMT feels similar to other psychedelics. Colors grow more vivid, your body may tingle, the world appears a bit crisper, as though the contrast and saturation have been dialed up. A portentous, ambient sense of meaning begins to set in, what’s been called the “<a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23972716/psychedelics-meaning-science-psychedelic-mushrooms-ketamine-psilocybin-mysticism">noetic quality</a>” of psychedelic trips.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At medium doses, that vivid picture of the world begins to dissolve into classically psychedelic imagery: swirling geometric patterns, flashing colors and shapes, and a general deconstruction of ordinary perception into chaos. Your ordinary sense of self, too, while not obliterated or dissolved, will likely begin to lose its familiar anchors in space and time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then there are high, or “breakthrough,” doses (around 20–30 milligrams and up), where the distinctly DMT-flavored weird stuff starts to happen. The incoherent imagery of a medium dose snaps into a new kind of coherence, reconstructing a very high-definition world, albeit one that looks entirely different from what we’re familiar with. When people talk about exploring <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/169525/psychonauts-training-psychedelics-dmt-extended-state">other dimensions</a> on DMT, it’s this dose they’re talking about.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If the dose is sufficient … the user bursts through a kind of membrane into an entirely novel domain unlike anything within this universe,” as Gallimore <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1739110102/">put it</a>. “The most striking feature of this ‘DMT space’ is its structure, often described as ‘hyperdimensional.’” In our normal states of consciousness, human perception tends to see space as flat, even though, ever since Einstein’s theory of relativity, we’ve known that mass bends space and time. <a href="https://qri.org/blog/hyperbolic-geometry-dmt">Some consciousness researchers</a> believe that on high doses of DMT, perception takes on this kind of <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/an-obscure-field-of-math-might-help-unlock-mysteries-of-human-perception">curvy geometry</a>. That could help explain why the experiences are so strikingly unusual, and why it’s so hard to describe them back in our sober minds.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But since DMT trips only last a few minutes, people often feel that they’re pulled out of the oddly curved DMT worlds right as they begin to find their bearings, or, as we should probably now get into, before they can finish their conversations with the entities.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">We do need to talk a bit about the DMT entities</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the strangest things about these breakthrough doses are the entities. “I was neither intellectually nor emotionally prepared for the frequency with which contact with beings occurred in our studies, nor the often utterly bizarre nature of these experiences,” Strassman wrote of his DMT experiments in the ’90s.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Not everyone meets entities on DMT, but it happens often enough that it seems like more than a random quirk. A 2022 <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-11999-8">analysis</a> of 10 years worth of trip reports posted on the r/DMT subreddit, totalling 3,778 DMT experiences, 45.5 percent included “entity encounters,” including: deities, aliens, “creature-based entities” like reptilian and insect beings, mythological beings, “machine elves,” and “jesters.”&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-1468272759.gif?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.3830044301248,100,93.23399113975" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="An artistic rendition of a DMT entity." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">While McKenna, who succeeded Leary as <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Re_Enchantment_of_the_West_Vol_2/iIfdkgicKhIC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;pg=PA113&amp;printsec=frontcover">the voice</a> of the psychedelic counterculture, is often credited with <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-archaic-revival-terence-mckenna?variant=32117983543330">spreading the idea</a> and expectation of encountering “self-transforming machine elves” in DMT space, humans have been encountering other seemingly intelligent beings while under the influence of DMT since well before he <a href="https://chacruna.net/terence-mckenna-first-smoked-dmt/">had his first trip</a> in 1965. One of the hallmarks of ayahuasca is encountering other spirits and beings, so much so that ayahuasca is often personified as “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=358273108267284">Mother Aya</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even among the early pure DMT users in Szára’s experiments in the 1950s, people <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-mental-science/article/abs/dimethyltryptamine-experiments-with-psychotics/1AAE2E0411B8CE878FA80D9F67E9CB13">reported</a> seeing “strange creatures, dwarfs or something.” A young physician <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13554710/">recalled</a> that “The whole room is filled with spirits.” Another stated, “In front of me are two quiet, sunlit Gods … I think they are welcoming me into this new world.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A whole scientific <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0214377#sec008">literature</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-11999-8">is</a> <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0269881120916143">emerging</a> to document the different kinds of entities people meet in DMT spaces. (And outside of peer review, there’s <a href="https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA667306437&amp;sid=googleScholar&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;linkaccess=abs&amp;issn=10639330&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;userGroupName=nysl_oweb&amp;isGeoAuthType=true&amp;aty=geo">a debate</a> over whether these entities and alternate dimensions are “real.” Gallimore, for example, has argued for conducting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ba5pAjM8HZM">diplomacy with the DMT entities</a>, since we can’t rule out their existence.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Either way, the full-on construction of novel worlds and beings gives scientists an opportunity to study the mind in the midst of one of its most dazzling abilities: creating worlds of experience. “You can track the brain as it’s dissolving the habitual model of the world and generating a novel one that has equal or even deeper feelings of immersion,&#8221; Timmerman told me.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">What DMT could mean for the science of consciousness</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">DMT, along with the other classical psychedelics — psilocybin, LSD, and mescaline — share a primary mechanism of action, binding to the serotonin 2A receptor and <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2218949120">scrambling activity</a> across both the brain’s default-mode and salience networks (brain regions responsible for self-referential thinking and helping our brains choose what information is worth paying attention to). DMT also binds to the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028390821001660?dgcid=raven_sd_recommender_email#">sigma-1 receptor</a>, which a team of Hungarian <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028390821001660?dgcid=raven_sd_recommender_email#!">researchers recently found</a> helps protect brain cells when they lack oxygen, as in a stroke. At least one neuroscientist thinks that <a href="https://doubleblindmag.com/no-dmt-entities-arent-real/">could help explain</a> the whole entities thing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Also like other classical psychedelics, DMT is neither physiologically addictive (though any drug carries <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0269881113513852">abuse potential</a>) nor <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23619992/">toxic</a> to the brain (per that sigma-1 research, it could actually be neuroprotective). Still, DMT experiences can be destabilizing. One of the main risks is sometimes called “<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4817368">ontological shock</a>,” where someone’s worldview is undermined in a way that causes lasting distress. One <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0269881120916143">survey of 2,561 DMT users</a> found that more than half who identified as atheists before their DMT trips no longer identified as atheist afterward. There’s nothing wrong with abandoning atheism per se, but upending worldviews should always be handled with care, caution, and available support.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, upending worldviews in reliable, controlled, and targeted ways could also help advance our understanding of how minds construct worldviews in the first place.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So far, though, psychedelics <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8378075/">haven’t quite lived up</a> to their <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/LSD_Psychotherapy/DYU3AQAAIAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0&amp;bsq=microscope">promise</a> of revolutionizing the science of consciousness. “The big limitation on the use of psychedelics to understand the mind and brain concerns how difficult it is to isolate components of the psychedelic experience that we’re interested in,” said Timmermann. His hope is that short trips associated with DMT, which can be repeated in quick succession without diminishing in intensity, will prove more easily interpretable to scientists working in lab settings. For example, DMT research is already turning up a curious pattern that hasn’t emerged with other psychedelics.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the major findings in psychedelic science has been that the entropy —&nbsp;or randomness, complexity, and disorder —&nbsp;of brain activity is a kind of signature of a trip’s intensity. Stronger trips are associated with higher levels of entropy in the brain, all the way to reports of “<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6007152/">ego dissolution</a>,” dubbed the “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0028390818301175#:~:text=The%20entropic%20brain%20hypothesis%20proposes,informational%20richness%20of%20conscious%20states.">entropic brain” hypothesis</a> by neuroscientist <a href="https://www.vox.com/23896208/robin-carhart-harris-professor-neurology-psychedelics-ucsf-future-perfect-50-2023">Robin Carhart-Harris</a>. Most psychedelics push our minds from <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00020/full">order to disorder</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">One surprising thing</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">A 2006 study found that two months after taking&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/10/9/21506664/psychedelics-mental-health-depression-ptsd-psilocybin-mdma">psilocybin</a>, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, two-thirds out of 30 volunteers rated their trip as one of the five most meaningful experiences of their lives.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Read Vox’s reporting on <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23972716/psychedelics-meaning-science-psychedelic-mushrooms-ketamine-psilocybin-mysticism">the science of how psychedelics crank up the dial of meaningful experiences here</a>.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">DMT fits this mold, up to a point. Low to medium doses show a reduction in the alpha frequency of brain waves (which <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/alpha-wave">correspond</a> to relaxed and wakeful states), along with rising entropy, a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-51974-4">signature finding</a> of sober brains sinking deeper into a trip.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But in high doses of DMT, that trend flips. The self does not disappear. Instead, the self feels largely intact, but transported to alternate worlds reconstructed out of the chaos. The rising entropy gives way to new neural signatures of order. “We’re starting to see the emergence of low-frequency brain waves in the breakthrough state, usually called delta or theta waves,” Timmermann said. “What’s intriguing about them is that these brain waves are very much present when people are asleep and dreaming. And there’s a resonance between dreams and the DMT state, the deconstruction of the assumptions about external waking life and the reconstruction of a novel world of experience.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These “contractions” in brain entropy, as Timmermann called them, tend to happen when his team asks tripping study participants to pay attention to a single, salient feature of their experience, like an entity. “Our perceptual systems are finding a way to make sense out of this chaos,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Researchers hope that probing how DMT deconstructs and reconstructs our experiences of the world can make at least some progress on psychedelic science’s original promise of a major leap in our understanding of consciousness. “Our scientists are interested in how world-modeling actually comes about, and whether something like DMT can simulate that for us,” said Timmermann. That, in turn, can help us understand “how we generate a model of the world in our habitual, daily lives.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Next year, Timmermann’s research group is moving to University College London, where they’ll add DMT’s molecular relative, 5-MeO-DMT (bufo), to their research agenda, which, I kid you not, is considered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RonFMPnZq8">even stronger</a> than DMT. If DMT can help scientists study how brains model worlds, bufo can show what happens when the brain stops modeling everything altogether and a bare form of consciousness without content remains.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“5-MeO-DMT is like the modeler of no-worlds … it’s like a canvas without the paint on it. If we can have that experience, then you can look into the more fundamental, core workings of the mind and brain,” said Timmermann. Together, DMT and bufo could make for a hell of a one-two punch in the future of consciousness science.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">What the heck is DMT doing in the human body?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another mystery sets DMT apart from just about every other psychedelic: It’s <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4149582/">naturally produced</a> by the human body, and no one knows why.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Research <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-45812-w">published in 2019</a> led by a team at the University of Michigan found that some parts of the mammalian brain can have similar levels of DMT as they do serotonin, a neurotransmitter that regulates a huge variety of important <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK545168/">functions</a>, from behavior and mood to memory.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When trace amounts of naturally occurring DMT were first <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/2061052a0">found in humans</a> in 1965, scientists <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02698811221104054">speculated</a> that it may underlie mental illness, like schizophrenia. Further research found that DMT might actually mitigate symptoms of psychosis, which <a href="https://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs2/presti/sites/mcb.berkeley.edu.labs2.presti/files/u3/2005%20DMT%20Jacob%20Presti.pdf">tanked</a> that idea pretty quickly.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Next, in 1976, it was <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4987/">proposed</a> that DMT might be a neurotransmitter, akin to serotonin and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24159087/what-is-dopamine-hacking-fasting-does-it-work-science">dopamine</a>, that has a functional role in the body. Serotonin is popularly associated with happiness, dopamine with motivation and pleasure — but what the heck would DMT be doing in the neurochemistry of our minds?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02698811221104054">2022 review</a> of the last 60 years of debate over DMT’s function concluded that DMT is likely doing <em>something</em> in the brain. But in the two years since, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-27538-y">new research</a> has turned up more questions than answers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s tempting to speculate. When Strassman called DMT “the spirit molecule,” he meant it rather literally: Its function in the brain, he argued, is simply to elicit psychological states that we call spiritual. Research <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-45812-w#Abs1">published in 2019</a> showed that levels of DMT in rat brains spike during cardiac arrest, lending some substance to <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01424/full">a link</a> between DMT and near-death experiences.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But neuroscientist Jimo Borjigin, lead author of that study and <a href="https://dmtquest.org/dr-jimo-borjigin/">considered</a> one of the world’s leading experts on the puzzle of DMT in the human body, put it bluntly: “We know nothing — seriously! — about the role of endogenous DMT.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Mainstreaming DMT</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For all the far-out ridiculousness of DMT — the curvy geometry, the mischievous but <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0214377">generally benevolent</a> elves, the prospect of hidden dimensions — it could have remarkably practical applications. <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/14/4/348">Studies</a> are beginning to corroborate <a href="https://clusterbusters.org/forums/topic/1016-anyone-tried-dmt-for-ch/">anecdotes</a>, for example, that DMT could <a href="https://forum-bots.effectivealtruism.org/posts/4dppcsbcbHZxyBC56/treating-cluster-headaches-using-n-n-dmt-and-other-1">treat cluster headaches</a>, one of the most <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/5/15/24156372/psychedelics-chronic-pain-cluster-headache-medicine-lsd-psilocybin">painful conditions</a> known to humankind.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">DMT could also offer a few advantages over the current generation of psychedelic therapy treatments that rely on MDMA or psilocybin. The big one is money: Psychedelic therapy is incredibly expensive. A few months of MDMA therapy recently tested in clinical trials cost about $<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8880875/">11,537</a> per patient, nearly half of which came from paying two therapists to stay with each patient for a full eight hours during the MDMA sessions. DMT, since it winds down within 20 minutes, could make for much more affordable treatments. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gallimore and Strassman <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2016.00211/full">have proposed</a> the possibility of extending DMT trips via a steady IV drip, keeping levels of DMT in the body elevated and stable much like we do with anesthesia during surgery. Last year, researchers from Imperial College London kept 11 healthy volunteers in the DMT space for an extended period of 30 minutes, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02698811231196877">demonstrating for the first time</a> that “extended DMT,” or DMTx, works and that the length and intensity of DMT therapy sessions could be customized to patient preferences.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“When we speak about precision psychiatry and how to treat individuals according to their specific profiles and needs, a plastic and dynamic psychedelic experience could make things cheaper and more effective,” said Timmermann.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">DMT has already shown promising results <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-53363-y">for depression</a>, and clinical trials are <a href="https://cybin.com/development-pipeline/">underway</a> —&nbsp;and patents <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/benjaminadams/2022/08/17/small-pharmas-patented-injectable-dmt-formulation-could-help-battle-depression/?sh=77645ccd641a">being filed</a> —&nbsp;for DMT as an injectable treatment.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Extended DMT would be exciting news on the consciousness science front, too. The longer people can stay in the strange worlds of DMT space, the more access that gives scientists and psychonauts alike to one of the mind’s most fascinating tricks: constructing worlds of experience. And even though these worlds may be so alien that many of us might be tempted to write them off, there’s no explanation for our universe, no matter how sober, that isn’t unfathomably weird, as philosopher Eric Schwitzgebel writes in his book, <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691215679/the-weirdness-of-the-world?srsltid=AfmBOorISq2hUpj8zTCHSMmWIEAwQReC7pQ41HBk9Ka520s2tfq_EKjl"><em>The Weirdness of the World</em></a>. There’s only “a complex blossoming of bizarre possibilities,” where “something radically contrary to common sense must be true about the fundamental structures of the mind and the world.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given how DMT seems to shred just about every bit of common sense, perhaps it’ll help turn up some answers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether that happens may depend on efforts to rein DMT in from the fringes of psychedelia. Given its ubiquity in nature, there’s plenty to go around. And given its presence in our bodies, we all stand to gain from a better understanding of what it’s doing there and why taking more of it leads to what remains perhaps the most bizarre kinds of experiences humans have yet encountered.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This week was a big win for animals across Mexico.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On December 2, Mexican President <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/353131/claudia-sheinbaum-amlo-lopez-obrador-mexico-elections-politics-morena-pri-pan">Claudia Sheinbaum</a> <a href="https://animalequality.org/news/mexicos-president-to-protect-animals/">signed</a> a set of <a href="https://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/ref/dof/CPEUM_ref_267_02dic24.pdf">constitutional reforms</a> that will pave the way for a comprehensive federal animal welfare law. The changes represent the first-ever mention of nonhuman animals in the Mexican Constitution, marking a milestone achievement for Mexico’s animal rights movement, which has for years been drawing attention to pervasive animal cruelty and extreme confinement in the country’s growing meat industry.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This is huge,” says <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/386449/2024-future-perfect-50-progress-ai-climate-animal-welfare-innovation?section=dulceramirez">Dulce Ramirez</a>, executive director of Animal Equality Mexico and the vice president of Animal Equality’s Latin American operations. These constitutional changes come after two years of campaigning by animal advocacy organizations, including Igauldad Animal Mexico, Humane Society International/Mexico (HSI/Mexico), and Movimiento Consciencia.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These reforms are internationally unique. While national animal protection laws aren’t uncommon, most countries have no mention of animals in their Constitutions. Constitutions are “a reflection of socially where we are,” Angela Fernandez, a law professor at the University of Toronto, told Vox, making any constitutional reform symbolically a big deal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyond Mexico, <a href="https://animal.law.harvard.edu/what-we-do/projects/constitutional-law/">nine countries</a> include references to animals in their Constitutions, but those mentions have generally been brief and open to interpretation. “Mexico is different,” Kristen Stilt, faculty director at Harvard Law School’s Animal Law and Policy Program, told Vox. “It&#8217;s longer, it&#8217;s more specific. It&#8217;s in several provisions. It&#8217;s not just a general statement.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Plenty of countries have laws against animal mistreatment, including the US, where <a href="https://www.animallaw.info/content/state-animal-anti-cruelty-laws">all 50 states</a> have an anti-cruelty law, but that doesn’t mean they’ve been particularly effective at stopping violence against animals. Part of the problem is that these laws very often <a href="https://aldf.org/article/laws-that-protect-animals/">exempt</a> farmed animals such as cows, pigs, and chickens, thereby excluding from protection the overwhelming majority of animals that suffer at human hands. That’s where Mexico’s reforms stand out: They’re intended to protect all animals, including farmed animals and other exploited species. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The reforms in Mexico, the world&#8217;s largest Spanish-speaking country, represent a major advancement in the status of animals globally. It could set a precedent for other countries in Latin America, where a vibrant animal rights movement has emerged in recent years, said Macarena Montes Franceschini, a fellow at Harvard Law School’s Animal Law and Policy Program.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, as one of the world’s top producers of <a href="https://fas.usda.gov/data/production/commodity/0111000">beef</a>, <a href="https://fas.usda.gov/data/production/commodity/0115000">chicken</a>, <a href="https://fas.usda.gov/data/production/commodity/0113000">pork</a>, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/263971/top-10-countries-worldwide-in-egg-production/">dairy</a>, and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/egg-production-thousand-tonnes?tab=chart">eggs</a>, Mexico has an intensive animal agriculture industry much like the US, says Antón Aguilar, Humane Society International/Mexico’s executive director. Business interests will undoubtedly want to influence the writing of animal welfare laws that could impact their bottom lines, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/31/23852325/farming-myths-agricultural-exceptionalism-pollution-labor-animal-welfare-laws">as they have in the US</a> and elsewhere. The question now is what changes the constitutional reforms will really bring to animal law in Mexico, and how effective they will be.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What will these reforms do?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The reforms comprise changes to three separate articles of Mexico’s Constitution. The most foundational change amends the Constitution&#8217;s Article 73, which dictates what Congress has the authority to legislate on. The article now gives the federal government the power to issue laws on animal welfare and protection.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Previously, animal welfare was largely left up to local and state authorities, and the result has been uneven laws and enforcement across the country. While all states in Mexico have animal protection legislation, just three include farmed animals: <a href="https://igualdadanimal.org/noticia/2022/06/08/hidalgo-primer-estado-de-mexico-en-proteger-a-los-animales/">Hidalgo</a>, <a href="https://igualdadanimal.mx/noticia/2024/07/11/congreso-de-colima-aprueba-iniciativa-para-proteger-a-los-animales-en-granjas/">Colima</a>, and as of last month, <a href="https://igualdadanimal.mx/noticia/2024/11/11/oaxaca-tiene-su-primera-ley-de-proteccion-e-incluye-a-los-animales-en-granja/">Oaxaca</a>, following pressure from animal advocates. And though Mexico does have a <a href="https://www.animallaw.info/statute/mexico-health-ley-federal-de-sanidad-animal">federal law on animal health</a> that focuses on farmed animals and includes some broad mentions of animal welfare, it was created to protect human health rather than animals. The same goes for Mexico’s <a href="https://www.animallaw.info/statute/mexico-wildlife-la-ley-general-de-vida-silvestre">federal wildlife law</a>, which was written with a focus on sustainability and conservation, rather than on protecting individual animals from cruelty.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps the most significant part of the reforms is an amendment to Article 4 of Mexico’s Constitution prohibiting the mistreatment of animals and directing the Mexican state to guarantee the protection, adequate treatment, and conservation and care of animals. The language is broad, Ramirez says, but she sees it as a substantial improvement over existing animal welfare laws. She and other advocates worked to ensure that no animals were excluded, particularly given that farmed animals have historically been left out of animal protection.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s really, really important in Mexico to start with this first step — but a big one — because now it&#8217;s all animals” that are covered, Ramirez said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The changes to Articles 4 and 73 tee up the creation of federal legislation on animal welfare. Under these reforms, Mexico’s Congress has been directed to write a first-of-its-kind General Law of Animal Welfare, Care, and Protection, a comprehensive bill that would address and develop regulations preventing the mistreatment of all types of animals, including farmed animals, wildlife, animals in laboratories, and companion animals, Aguilar said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This general animal welfare law will need to consider animals’“nature, characteristics and links with people,” according to the <a href="https://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/ref/dof/CPEUM_ref_267_02dic24.pdf">reform decree</a> released last week. What does this actually mean? Ramirez gave the example of chickens: Part of the natural behavior of these animals is to be able to spread their wings and move around. But if chickens are stuck in cages, as is standard practice on egg factory farms, they can’t do either of those things. Now, the idea is to develop legal criteria that would consider the ability to express these natural behaviors as part of their welfare. (The language could also be interpreted to prioritize human needs, however — particularly the reference to animals’ “links with people.” Animal Equality said they would interpret this through an animal welfare lens, and with the word “link” invoking what humans owe animals.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, Article 3 of Mexico’s Constitution, which pertains to the education system, was also amended to require that animal welfare be included in school curricula for grade school and high school students. Aguilar said this change could help “attitudes shift and change in a very enduring, long-term way” for future generations. But the new constitutional language is unspecific, and the devil is in the details.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s next for animal welfare in Mexico</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Advocates in Mexico have two focuses going forward, Ramirez and Aguilar said: shaping the general animal welfare bill into a strong piece of legislation, and working with the Ministry of Education to get meaningful implementation of animal welfare into the national curriculum.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It will also be important for lawmakers working on the new animal welfare bill to avoid industry capture. Various stakeholders will want a say in what regulations go into the law, including academic experts, animal-related professions such as veterinarians, and powerful corporate interests like animal agriculture producers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When asked about what concerns she might have about the implementation of the reforms, Fernandez pointed first to the sway of business interests. “Are there going to be generous justifications that maybe are very industry-dictated?” she asked. Animal Equality also told Vox via email that there have been times when Mexican authorities have failed to issue legislation, even in situations like this where they’ve been tasked to do so.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the animal welfare movement has relationships across the political spectrum that will likely work to its advantage when proposing what goes into this law. Ramirez told Vox that Animal Equality Mexico works with both liberal and conservative parties to find agreement on animal rights. Despite political polarization in Mexico, the animal welfare reforms “went very swiftly” through both chambers of the legislature, Aguilar said, passing <a href="https://animalequality.org/news/mexicos-president-to-protect-animals/">unanimously</a> in each.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Animal issues are issues where political forces can find common ground,” he added.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The left-wing Morena party, of which recently elected President Sheinbaum is a member, also holds a majority of seats in both of Mexico’s legislative chambers. Before signing onto the constitutional reforms, Sheinbaum <a href="https://igualdadanimal.mx/noticia/2024/10/01/sheinbaum-respalda-la-reforma-constitucional-contra-el-maltrato-animal/" data-type="link" data-id="https://igualdadanimal.mx/noticia/2024/10/01/sheinbaum-respalda-la-reforma-constitucional-contra-el-maltrato-animal/">vocalized her support</a> for them in her first address as the country’s leader.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there’s an internal challenge, too, according to Aguilar and Ramirez. Animal welfare organizations that cover different species and different aspects of animal welfare will need to work as a united front. Some groups’ work focuses primarily on protections for farmed animals, others focus on banning bullfighting and cockfighting, and some have their sights on companion animals. It may be hard to settle on a proposal that works for everyone.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ensuring meaningful implementation and enforcement will also be key concerns. &#8220;You can undercut obviously good language by poor enforcement,” Stilt said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think the worst thing that could happen is for this to just be a pretty provision in the Constitution and nothing else,” said Montes Franceschini. “Not seeing any change for the government, not to give resources to the agency that has to ensure animal protection, not having funding, not having staff, not teaching police officers how to act in case of animal mistreatment. I think that that would worry me.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The future of animal welfare will be <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23344716/future-perfect-50-carolina-galvani-animal-welfare-activist-sinergia-animal">decided in the Global South</a>, where meat consumption and American-style factory farming are growing rapidly. Animal welfare advocates in Mexico are entering new, more ambitious, potentially much more impactful territory, a testament to the movement’s strength and political savvy. Other nations will be watching.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&#8220;It&#8217;s going to get pretty interesting,” said Aguilar. “I&#8217;m optimistic that we will come up with good compromises that are good for animals.”</p>

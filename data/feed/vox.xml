<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s that time again. The last act of Congress funding the federal government <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/09/congress-government-spending-shutdown-deadline/">expires on September 30</a>. So, unless Congress passes new funding legislation by then, much of the government will shut down.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4850815-proof-of-citizenship-voting-bill-government-shutdown/">egged on by the House Freedom Caucus</a> and by <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/03/30/no-big-wave-immigrants-voting-illegally-trump">former President Donald Trump</a>, reportedly wants to use this deadline to force through legislation that would make it harder to register to vote in all 50 states. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Johnson plans to pair a bill funding the government for six months with a Republican bill called the “Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act” or “<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/8281/text">SAVE Act</a>,” that would require new voters to submit “documentary proof of United States citizenship,” such as a passport or a birth certificate, in order to register to vote.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is no evidence that noncitizens vote in US federal elections in any meaningful numbers, and states typically have safeguards in place to prevent them from doing so. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, for example, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/noncitizen-voting-is-extremely-rare-yet-republicans-are-making-it-a-major-election-concern">claims to have identified 1,634 “potential noncitizens”</a> who attempted to register during a 15-year period. But these possible noncitizens were caught by election officials and were never registered. In 2020, <a href="https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/georgia/">nearly 5 million Georgians voted</a> in the presidential election. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More broadly, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center, “illegal registration and voting attempts by noncitizens are routinely investigated and prosecuted by the appropriate state authorities, and there is <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/five-things-to-know-about-the-save-act/">no evidence that attempts at voting by noncitizens</a> have been significant enough to impact any election’s outcome.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While noncitizen voting — which is, of course, illegal — has never been proven to have affected an election, there is evidence that the SAVE Act could have an impact on elections. That much is clear from Arizona, which already has a SAVE Act-like regime. <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/367701/supreme-court-arizona-rnc-republicans-mi-familia-vota">Data from Arizona</a> suggests the state’s law has made it slightly harder for people of color, a group that skews Democratic, to vote. And at least one analysis of Arizona voter data suggests that the SAVE Act could <a href="https://www.votebeat.org/arizona/2023/12/18/arizona-federal-only-voters-concentrated-college-campuses-proof-of-citizenship/">suppress voter registration among another group that tends to vote for Democrats</a>: college students. So the bill could make it slightly more difficult for Democrats to win elections.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, the SAVE Act law does have a vague provision allowing voters who “cannot provide” the required documentation to submit other evidence that they are a citizen, and it provides that state or local officials “shall make a determination as to whether the applicant has sufficiently established United States citizenship.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s unclear what, exactly, that means.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Notably, the SAVE Act would <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/five-things-to-know-about-the-save-act/">take effect immediately if enacted by Congress</a>, and it imposes significant new administrative burdens on state and local election offices. So, if the law did take effect in the two months before a presidential election, it could potentially throw that election into chaos.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Realistically, that outcome is unlikely. Axios reports that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) is <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/08/25/mcconnell-republicans-save-act-immigrant-voting">opposed</a> to making continued funding for the US government contingent on passing the SAVE Act. Most Democrats and President Joe Biden also oppose the bill.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, the battle over the SAVE Act could put the US in danger of a government shutdown. And though it is unlikely to become law in the next two months, it is likely to be on the short list of bills that Republicans will be eager to turn into law should they prevail in this November’s election.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How would the SAVE Act actually impact US elections?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the SAVE Act became law, it would likely only have a marginal impact on election results — although even a modest shift in who is allowed to vote could <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/367701/supreme-court-arizona-rnc-republicans-mi-familia-vota">potentially flip very close elections</a>, particularly in swing states. On its face, the bill addresses a non-problem — again, there are no legitimate concerns about noncitizen voting in the United States. And most voters do have some documentation they could use to register under the SAVE Act.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, Arizona offers a useful window into what voting might be like under the SAVE Act. In 2004, the state enacted a SAVE Act-like law requiring new voters to submit documentary proof of citizenship to register. This law, however, <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/367701/supreme-court-arizona-rnc-republicans-mi-familia-vota">conflicts with a federal law</a> which requires states to register voters who submit a standardized federal form. In 2013, the Supreme Court ruled that Arizona could not prevent voters who register using this form from voting in federal elections.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Arizona, however, responded to this decision by creating a second-class tier of voters. Arizona voters who submit the federal form without documentary proof of citizenship are allowed to vote in federal elections (for Congress and the president), but not in state elections.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Data from Arizona suggests that <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/367701/supreme-court-arizona-rnc-republicans-mi-familia-vota">non-white voters</a> (who tend to prefer Democrats to Republicans) are more likely to be registered as federal-only voters than white voters. But college students appear to be hardest hit by Arizona’s two-tiered regime.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A report by Votebeat, a news outlet that reports on election administration, found that most Arizona voting precincts have fewer than a dozen total federal-only voters. But, “of the dozen outliers with more than 300 federal-only voters,” Votebeat reports that “<a href="https://www.votebeat.org/arizona/2023/12/18/arizona-federal-only-voters-concentrated-college-campuses-proof-of-citizenship/">all but one are located at least partly on a college campus</a>.” The one exception was a Phoenix precinct that includes a homeless shelter.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This conclusion is intuitive. College students who leave home to earn their degree often do not bring their passport or birth certificate to school with them, so they are unable to submit it when they register to vote. (People without permanent housing are also likely not to have immediate access to these documents because they do not have a home to store them in.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a close election, a law disenfranchising many college students could be dispositive.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the razor-thin 2000 election, for example, official tallies showed that President George W. Bush <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/on-this-day-bush-v-gore-anniversary">won the crucial state of Florida by 537 votes</a>. Meanwhile, the University of Florida alone <a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/university-of-florida-1535/student-life#:~:text=University%20of%20Florida%20has%20a,students%20and%2056%25%20female%20students.">enrolls nearly 35,000 undergraduates</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, while the SAVE Act wouldn’t do much to address the fake problem of noncitizen voting, it would have at least some impact on US elections.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite having the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/beyonce-cowboy-carter-tops-country-album-chart-number-one-1234998548/">biggest</a> new country album <a href="https://www.goldderby.com/gallery/billboard-number-one-albums-2024/sabrina-carpenter-2/">of the year</a>, Beyoncé received a complete shut-out from the 2024 Country Music Awards. Her <em>Cowboy Carter</em> topped the country chart — a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/beyonce-tops-billboard-country-chart-genre-debut-texas-hold-em-rcna139791">historic first</a> for a Black woman singing country — and spent 22 weeks on the Billboard top 200 album ranking. Yet despite the CMAs giving nominations to other pop crossover artists, including Post Malone and Shaboozey, the voting body denied <em>Cowboy Carter</em> nominations in any category.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rejection marks the second time the CMAs and its audience have <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2016/11/4/13521928/beyonce-cma-awards-controversy-deleted-performance">clashed with Beyoncé</a>. But while the 2016 backlash over her CMA performance with the Chicks arguably stemmed from tension over the artists’ political identities, it’s hard to chalk this snub up to anything but <a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2023/05/professor-coins-new-word-misogynoir/">misogynoir</a> at its most blatant — especially in a year that saw both Malone (in a <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/355306/post-malone-beyonce-taylor-swift-morgan-wallen">chart-topping collab</a> with <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23842173/oliver-anthony-rich-men-controversy-morgan-wallen-jason-aldean-small-town-political">Morgan Wallen</a>) and Shaboozey nominated for Single of the Year.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are several complicating factors that may have contributed to the CMA’s diss of <em>Cowboy Carter</em>. But it’s also clear that sometimes the simplest explanation may be the truest.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Cowboy Carter</em> may have suffered from a lack of promotion</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The lead single off <em>Cowboy Carter</em>, “Texas Hold ’Em,” had just about the biggest release boost ever — a drop during the Super Bowl on February 11, 2024. That date is important, because while the song immediately lit up the charts and saw significant radio play, it <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/country/beyonces-new-music-will-country-radio-play-1235607096/">took two days</a>, per Billboard, before country radio stations actually received copies of the song from Beyoncé’s label, Parkwood, via Sony Nashville. As <a href="https://savingcountrymusic.com/dispelling-the-myth-that-country-radio-rejected-beyonce/">detailed</a> in the industry blog Saving Country Music, the media narrative that swiftly coalesced of country radio refusing to play the song wasn’t actually accurate. Rather, due to the way the song was positioned initially — it was first cataloged as a pop song rather than a country song, and serviced first to pop stations — it took a week before most country stations added the song to their playlists. When that finally happened, <a href="https://assets.countryaircheck.com/public/5b95283f-18ab-4631-91a8692368c2871b/1863e111-7269-466b-98fa9338bbc386fa/Issue-897-February-20-2024.pdf">on February 20</a>, the song received radio play on 79 country music stations across the country, and debuted atop Billboard’s Hot Country Songs charts. Beyoncé’s label even took out an industry ad to thank them:</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-09-at-12.37.24 PM.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,30.393647759119,100,39.212704481762" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Beyonce’s promotional thank you to country stations during the week of the country radio debut of “Texas Hold ’Em.” | Country Air Check" data-portal-copyright="Country Air Check" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">As Billboard noted, “Country radio has traditionally been reluctant to play songs that aren’t serviced to them or then actively promoted by the label.” Billboard further pointed out that Beyoncé didn’t heavily promote her 2016 crossover single “Daddy Lessons” either, which may have contributed to its lackluster performance on the country charts at the time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That lack of promotional energy may have hurt <em>Cowboy Carter</em> in the long run. Although the album was a hit, it slid rapidly down the Billboard ranks and faced tough competition from artists like Wallen and Taylor Swift — particularly in <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/359734/female-pop-stars-charts-billboard-rap-country-popularity">a male-dominated year</a> that saw men sweeping charts and receiving tons of radio play despite a bumper crop of new releases from female artists.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyoncé’s label seemed disinclined to promote the album or its songs beyond the initial drops: “Texas Hold ’Em” received no follow-up music video, and Beyoncé did no regional promotion or in-person radio drop-ins to boost the song’s recognition to radio listeners.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Much of this is understandable as falling within Beyoncé’s brand; her superstardom is powered as much by mystique and glamor as her artistry itself. That mystique lends itself to abrupt album drops with little promotion, but not to over-exposure through traditional industry channels like radio. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, there also seemed to be a deliberate choice on Beyoncé’s part to actively disengage from promoting <em>Cowboy Carter</em> as a country album — quite literally, in that she initially <a href="https://ca.billboard.com/music/country/beyonce-cowboy-carter-album-cover-art-1235636280/">announced</a> it by saying, “This ain’t a country album, it’s a Beyoncé album.” If she intended for her fans to make the argument that, in fact, it <em>was</em> a country album, that tactic worked; fans swiftly got Apple Music to change its initial designation of the songs from “pop” to “country,” and pushed <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/4518998-petition-country-stations-beyonce-songs/">a petition</a> to get the album more radio play to over 27,000 signatures. If industry insiders didn’t feel sufficiently catered to, though, that sense of being overlooked could easily have translated to a lackluster response when the CMA voting rolled around.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s another explanation for all of this, though — and it’s the one you’re thinking of.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>(Straight) male crossover artists, including Black artists, tend to be welcomed at the CMAs</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s no secret that the country music industry has a longstanding problem with excluding artists of color. The CMAs specifically famously snubbed first Beyoncé for “Daddy Lessons” (which was itself <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/4/28/11526188/beyonce-country-music-black-roots">a musical lesson</a> in the erasure of Black artists from country history) in 2016 and then Lil Nas X in 2019. The CMAs <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/8/30/20838444/lil-nas-x-country-music-association-awards-nominations-billy-ray-cyrus">rejected Lil Nas</a> from every musical category while giving him a nod for his collaboration on the song with Billy Ray Cyrus — effectively suggesting that he owed the song’s massive success to a white man and not his own merit.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That this happened several months after Lil Nas came out as gay might also have factored into the equation, given that other straight Black male artists like Darius Rucker have found success and a warm country welcome in Nashville. Artists like Charley Pride and Ray Charles have also broken boundaries in the genre, though the fact they were already huge stars prior to turning their talents to country might have been a factor as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Lil Nas snub also puts this year’s CMAs — in which Beyoncé’s own Black male collaborator, Shaboozey, got multiple top award noms — into sharp perspective. Shaboozey, a Nigerian American multi-genre artist, got a huge boost into the mainstream from collaborating with Beyoncé on two songs on <em>Cowboy Carter</em>, and then saw his single “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” go viral; it was hailed as one of <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/363120/charli-xcx-chappell-roan-song-summer">the (many) songs of the 2024 summer</a> and received a <a href="https://www.effinghamradio.com/2024/09/08/shaboozeys-a-bar-song-tipsy-breaks-carrie-underwoods-record-by-topping-country-airplay-chart-for-7th-week/">record-breaking amount of radio play</a> across country radio. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By first boosting and promoting, and then nominating, Shaboozey’s work on the back of his collaboration with Beyoncé, the industry seems to be sending a message, however inadvertent it might be, that the artistry of Black women lags behind that of their straight male counterparts. That’s quite a statement to make about <em>Cowboy Carter</em>, an album that features country legends like Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">That goes without saying. Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/Beyonce?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Beyonce</a> for opening a door for us, starting a conversation, and giving us one of the most innovative country albums of all time!</p>&mdash; Shaboozey (@ShaboozeysJeans) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShaboozeysJeans/status/1833149046933848172?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 9, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it’s also undeniable that the industry is more hospitable to male pop crossover artists. Post Malone has come under fire for collaborations that <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/355306/post-malone-beyonce-taylor-swift-morgan-wallen">appropriate styles</a> from Black artists, a problem that stands uncomfortably next to his collaboration with Wallen, whose incredible career boost following his <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23842173/oliver-anthony-rich-men-controversy-morgan-wallen-jason-aldean-small-town-political">n-word scandal</a> is arguably an interlinked issue. Yet country fans had little trouble embracing Malone and Wallen’s “I Had Some Help,” and the CMAs rewarded the song with <a href="https://holler.country/news/breaking/post-malone-earns-first-ever-cma-awards-nominations-for-i-had-some-help/">four total nominations</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, while Beyoncé has undoubtedly opened doors for artists including Shaboozey, the progress of Black women in country remains fraught. While the industry has <a href="https://www.countrymusichalloffame.org/calendar/an-evening-with-valerie-june-rachael-davis-thao-and-yasmin-williams">upheld</a> Black artists like Valerie June, Mickey Guyton, and Yasmin Williams, it has yet to bestow CMA awards on any of them. Last year, legend <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2024/2/9/24065282/tracy-chapman-song-fast-car-grammys-meaning">Tracy Chapman and her iconic song “Fast Car”</a> became the first Black woman in history to win a CMA award for Song of the Year — but she did so only because of a white man, Luke Combs, and his viral cover of the song.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In other words, while there may be some logistical arguments behind the industry’s snub of Beyoncé that have nothing to do with identity, the CMA has a noticeable pattern of erasing and sidelining Black women, even in their own art. Beyoncé is actively aware of this gatekeeping; <em>Cowboy Carter</em> is <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024/3/26/24111978/beyonce-album-cowboy-carter-black-country-history">built on the marginalized contributions</a> of centuries of Black artists that came before her. It’s hardly any wonder she distanced herself and her album from the country establishment from the start; she likely knew well before the rest of us that the CMAs were never going to let her in the door — even with the entire world clamoring for her to be let in.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For decades, the anti-abortion movement in the United States worked toward one major goal: the overturning of <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, the Supreme Court decision that established a federal right to abortion. In 2022, it finally succeeded, and states across the country began banning abortion immediately. Today about half the states either ban or severely restrict abortion. But now the anti-abortion movement is regrouping around a new goal: using the federal government to ban abortion in the rest of the country.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Republicans take control of Congress in the 2024 election, it’s possible they could pass a national abortion ban law. But experts don’t consider that the most likely way a national abortion ban could come about, for two reasons: polling shows it would be extremely unpopular, and it would require the elimination of the Senate filibuster. Instead, they point to a different branch of the federal government — the president’s office and all the federal agencies it oversees.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the federal agencies, opponents of abortion could fashion a de facto abortion ban by chipping away at abortion access in numerous ways; for example, limiting access to medication abortion, which now constitutes <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/2024/03/medication-abortion-accounted-63-all-us-abortions-2023-increase-53-2020">nearly two-thirds</a> of all abortions in the US. The biggest way that the president’s office could limit abortion is by deciding to enforce something called the Comstock Act: a 150-year-old abortion ban made obsolete by <em>Roe v. Wade</em> but possibly revived by its repeal.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The final way the next president could determine the future of abortion rights is through federal court appointments. The anti-abortion movement’s “next <em>Roe v. Wade</em>” is the national legal recognition of fetal personhood, an idea that would by definition outlaw all abortion. The current Supreme Court isn’t yet right-wing enough to endorse this idea. But after another Trump term, that could change.</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/2024/3/20/24106925/where-is-kate-middleton-kategate-explained-updates">Kate Middleton</a> — now Catherine, the Princess of Wales — <a href="https://x.com/KensingtonRoyal/status/1833165733368574081">announced Monday</a> in a video message that she had completed chemotherapy for the cancer diagnosis she first revealed in March. She said she would resume some public events, though engagements are expected to remain limited through the end of the year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Doing what I can to stay cancer free is now my focus,” the princess wrote in a post shared on  X. “Although I have finished chemotherapy, my path to healing and full recovery is long and I must continue to take each day as it comes.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She was diagnosed with cancer after doctors performed abdominal surgery on her and discovered evidence of the disease. </p>

<p>Kensington Palace has not released details on what type of cancer the princess has, nor did it specify what stage the cancer was when it was found. But as a 42-year-old woman, Middleton is far from alone in her diagnosis: Worldwide, more and more people under 50 are developing cancers.</p>

<p>Cancer typically strikes those who are in their 50s, 60s, or even older. Yet, in recent decades, early-onset cancers — which are usually defined as occurring in patients younger than 50 — are occurring at a higher rate, particularly in wealthy countries. As illustrated in the chart below, a <a href="https://bmjoncology.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000049#DC1">2023 <em>BMJ</em> analysis</a> found that the early onset of 29 different cancers had risen nearly 80 percent globally between 1990 and 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25350322/gwDvD_more_young_people_are_getting_cancer_today.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,24.278341533841,100,51.443316932319" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="Dylan Scott/Vox" />
<p>Separately, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2808381">a study published in <em>JAMA Network Open</em></a> the same year concluded that the occurrence of a wide range of cancers among people under 50 had increased between 2010 to 2019 among American adults, particularly among women.</p>

<p>Much of the increase is attributable to colon and rectal cancers: In 2019, there were about 5.7 cases of colorectal cancer among 100,000 people ages 14 to 49. That’s up 63 percent since 1990, when there were approximately only 3.5 cases per 100,000 people. Breast, cervical, and skin cancers are still the most likely cancers to develop in adults under 50, but individual cases of colorectal cancers taking the lives of well-known <a href="https://www.vox.com/celebrities" data-source="encore">celebrities</a>, like actor <a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/synthesis/issues/winter2021/patient_focus/chadwick-boseman.html">Chadwick Boseman</a> in 2020, have made that trend more visible in recent years.</p>

<p>Cancers of the bladder, kidney, ovaries, pancreas, prostate, thyroid, and uterus also became significantly more common in the nearly three decades covered by the global investigation published in BMJ.</p>

<p>John Marshall, director of the Ruesch Center for the Cure of Gastrointestinal Cancers at Georgetown University, told me recently that, early in his career, he rarely saw a patient under 50. Today, half of his patients are in that age range, many of them appearing to be healthy and fit. At first, these young patients usually came in with colorectal cancer, but Marshall has increasingly seen younger people with cancers attacking other parts of the gastrointestinal tract.</p>

<p>No single factor is to blame for this widespread uptick in numerous cancers among young people, particularly the rise in the gastrointestinal system, but scientists are starting to put together a picture of the reality behind one of the most important medical mysteries of our time.</p>

<p>One <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9218641/">review published in <em>Frontiers in Nutrition</em></a> in 2022 found several dietary factors were associated with early-onset colorectal cancer. Eating a lot of deep-fried and processed foods, foods high in fat, and sugary drinks and desserts was a significant risk factor, as was <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24049505/protein-intake-fiber-plant-based-vegetarian-vegan-meat">having a diet low in fiber</a>. Other studies have found higher alcohol consumption is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer early.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Toxins in our environment, such as <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/3/8/24093650/mental-health-report-happiness-growth-well-being-smartphones">microplastics</a>, could also be a contributing factor. These tiny particles can be found in everything from food containers to <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/2023/11/14/23955673/fast-fashion-shein-hauls-environment-human-rights-violations">synthetic clothing</a>, before making their way into our bodies and our GI tracts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One New Zealand research team <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10340669/">concluded</a> the upticks in cancers among young adults matched the timeline that we would expect from the multiplication of microplastics in the environment. Cellular and rodent models have suggested that microplastics could promote tumor growth. Though more research is needed, these materials contain chemicals that can disrupt hormones and pose a risk to our health.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But these are still theories. Scientists still don’t fully understand what is primarily driving earlier-in-life cancer cases. What we do know is that stories like Middleton’s are becoming all too common.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Update, September 9, 12:55 pm ET: </em></strong><em>This story was originally published on March 22 and has been updated to reflect new information about Kate Middleton’s health status.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At any given second, millions of people are liking various things on Instagram. Pictures of sunsets and sunrises, recipes for keto brownies, videos of viral K-pop dances — there’s something for everyone. But right now there’s one specific semi-famous woman whose social media activity (liking, unliking, posting) has drawn widespread attention: <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/29/sports/brittany-mahomes-is-brushing-off-haters-after-patrick-mahomes-advice/">Brittany Mahomes</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Best known as the wife of Super Bowl-winning Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, Brittany Mahomes’s national profile has, for the moment, eclipsed her husband’s. That’s due to her perceived support for former President Donald Trump and his promised political policies. This all started when Mahomes liked and then unliked an Instagram post from the former president that <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/08/28/brittany-mahomes-trump-support/">outlined his 2024 platform</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Under any normal circumstances, only <a href="https://www.instagram.com/brittanylynne/?hl=en">Brittany Mahomes’s biggest fans</a> would be deeply invested in whether she desires mass deportation and an Iron Dome missile defense system built over America. But Mahomes has connections to Taylor Swift, the most famous woman in the world. That very valuable association is why the social media likes and dislikes of an American football WAG (that’s “wives and girlfriends”) has become a pop culture saga.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We’re here to answer your most pressing questions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Wait, what happened?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Brittany Mahomes has become a moment in this news cycle because she has been liking and unliking social media posts supporting former President Donald Trump and his various policies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-m53xGu3MY/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=a69d4fdc-9933-4d07-904b-7e88d71753a8">August 13</a>, Trump’s Instagram account posted a platform promising to “Seal the border, and stop the migrant invasion,” “Keep men OUT of women’s sports,” and&nbsp;“Carry out the largest deportation operation in American history.” He also plans to cut “federal funding for any school pushing Critical Race Theory, Radical Gender Ideology, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://x.com/tiredasslesbian/status/1826972546052325629">Eagle-eyed internet sleuths</a> spotted that Mahomes “liked” and “unliked” the xenophobic and transphobic dog whistle salad last week. And though Mahomes doesn’t follow Trump on her account, it seems as though the narrative was already set: Mahomes supports some of Trump’s most pernicious and divisive politics.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The news that people saw Mahomes’s social media activity eventually circled its way back to Mahomes, who was not pleased that people noticed her public actions. To that, she posted a message via <a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/brittany-mahomes-message-haters-liking-pro-trump-instagram-post">Instagram Story</a> (Instagram Stories are temporary), denouncing her haters and telling them they were emotionally damaged adults:&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>I mean honestly, to be a hater as an adult, you have to have some deep rooted issues you refuse to heal from childhood. There’s no reason your brain is fully developed and you hate to see others doing well.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/brittany-mahomes-slams-haters-instagram-015629071.html?.tsrc=daily_mail&amp;segment_id=DY_GOLDLIST_TEST&amp;ncid=crm_19908-1202929-20240825-0&amp;bt_user_id=6JRyBTwoYQzmdnLH3pN2QzNZuI5lUW99eij89uny52Y9VmIpDsEpGGO5JWIe&amp;bt_ts=1724580120381&amp;guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKBxQxF-fo9Px30l0B6tcZu6KwckIA3BbKQcCQTyBfmdE-eLjhpbxsDzUFDj5U0riA9M2Jsg-zMbF58SDN42jXuDiD764vw6o2Wv0F_tzmN_zscfp-UWDMzLVQM4dRmTihmI2MylQw9k_ZcZWJAySNmtqdVp7JDgb2AdfXCpwmLA">Mahomes seemed</a> to see the negativity surrounding her social media proclivities as a sign that people were mad that she was succeeding, rather than that people were disappointed in her presumed politics, that is to say, what appeared to be her beliefs about how the country should be run and how others should be treated. Mahomes also <a href="https://x.com/PopCrave/status/1828870083847884899">liked a pro-Trump comment</a> under a recent post, eliminating any ambiguity that her previous liking and unliking spree might be an accident.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On August 26, Mahomes doubled down and <a href="https://people.com/brittany-mahomes-doubles-down-calling-out-critics-after-backlash-8701908">shared a post</a> that read, “Contrary to the tone of the world today … You can disagree with someone, and still love them. You can have differing views, and still be kind.” She did not comment on or explain the relative kindness of the views she appeared to support.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then, on September 4, Trump apparently heard the news and was flattered, <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113080034075111751" rel="nofollow">posting a message</a> on his own social media platform, Truth Social. In the post, Trump called Mahomes “beautiful” and thanked her for “strongly defending” him, going on to decry “Crime and Illegal Immigration,” “INFLATION,” a “World that is laughing” at US leaders. </p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mahomes has yet to comment on Trump’s thanks. During the Chiefs game on September 5, <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/brittany-mahomes-not-in-taylor-swift-chiefs-box.html">Mahomes and Swift</a>, who sat together during multiple games last year, enjoyed the game from separate suites. But during the US Open men’s tennis final on Sunday, September 8, <a href="https://people.com/taylor-swift-brittany-mahomes-shut-down-friendship-rift-rumors-hug-at-us-open-photos-8708258">the pair were seated in the same box</a> (with their significant others) and photographed embracing. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>And sorry, who is Brittany Mahomes again? Do people regularly care about Brittany Mahomes in general?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Brittany Mahomes is primarily famous because she’s married to Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who was her high school sweetheart. She’s also the <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a45601704/who-is-patrick-mahomes-wife-brittany-mahomes/">co-owner</a> of the Kansas City Current, a team in the National Women’s Soccer League, which was the sport she excelled in through college, and she was a Sports Illustrated <a href="https://www.si.com/sports-illustrated/brittany-mahomes-makes-her-sports-illustrated-swimsuit-debut-01hxt4v7tp05">swimsuit model</a> in May of this year. She and Patrick have two children and are currently expecting a third.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore/TIMESERIES/1724935800?hl=en-US&amp;tz=300&amp;geo=US&amp;hl=en&amp;q=brittany+mahomes,brittany+mahomes+trump&amp;sni=3">biggest “Brittany Mahomes” search spike</a> of the past year was during the Super Bowl when people were ostensibly trying to figure out whether Patrick Mahomes had a wife and if she was hanging out with Taylor Swift (more on this in a bit).&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/gettyimages-2160725206.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.696771244586,100,78.606457510828" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Patrick Mahomes and Brittany Mahomes at Wimbledon this year. | Karwai Tang/WireImage via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Karwai Tang/WireImage via Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">For the most part, the name Brittany Mahomes is not one the average American gives a lot of thought to, and her political views would probably warrant even less consideration. She’s not a political scholar nor is she some kind of kingmaker. Prior to her online statements about “haters,” the <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore/TIMESERIES/1724935800?hl=en-US&amp;tz=300&amp;geo=US&amp;hl=en&amp;q=brittany+mahomes,brittany+mahomes+trump&amp;sni=3">American public wasn’t furiously Googling</a> “Brittany Mahomes loves Trump?” or “Brittany Mahomes Republican.” There’s a bit of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">Streisand effect</a> happening, where the more Mahomes doubles down, the more attention she draws to the kerfuffle. There’s possibly a timeline in which Mahomes lets the entire saga run its course and fade away as football season begins.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One thing to note is that her pro-Trump political stance appears to many to be at odds with her husband’s identity. Patrick is biracial, with a Black father and a white mother. And it would seem that Brittany’s liking that pro-Trump post, especially his bits about attacking critical race theory (an attack that would minimize the historical <a href="https://www.vox.com/22443822/critical-race-theory-controversy">Black American experience</a>) would be insensitive if not incongruent with her husband’s identity. <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/364172/trump-nabj-black-voter-journalist-racist-kamala-harris-indian-american">Trump has recently attacked</a> Vice President Kamala Harris’s biracial ethnicity, claiming that she “turned” Black for political gain. Harris’s father is Jamaican.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Patrick hasn’t been open about who he’s voting for, but he has spoken up about police brutality and <a href="https://andscape.com/features/patrick-mahomes-saw-george-floyds-death-and-chiefs-quarterback-knew-he-couldnt-stay-on-the-sideline/">supported Black Lives Matter</a>. In 2020, he <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/watch-patrick-mahomes-and-other-nfl-stars-demand-the-nfl-condemn-racism-and-admit-wrong-in-silencing-players-from-peacefully-protesting-2020-06-05">urged the NFL</a> to denounce and separate itself from racism.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But more important than her husband and the reason everyone’s talking about Brittany at all is that she’s allegedly friends with Taylor Swift — the most famous person on the planet.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>So this is all because she’s friends with Taylor Swift?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pretty much!&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>How long have they been friends?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Swift and Mahomes seem to have formed their close bond after Swift started dating <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2023/9/25/23889682/taylor-swift-travis-kelces-date-nfl-chiefs-game">Travis Kelce</a>, a Chiefs tight end who plays with Patrick Mahomes. The two women likely cultivated their relationship during Chiefs games last year, when they <a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/taylor-swift-brittany-mahomes-rcna121662">were photographed</a> together multiple times at the VIP suites, even potentially wearing matching necklaces. It wasn’t long until they took their friendship on the road, with Taylor including Brittany on a <a href="https://www.eonline.com/photos/36639/taylor-swifts-nyc-night-out-with-selena-gomez-brittany-mahomes-more">girls’ night in NYC</a> with the rest of her squad.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Wait, what does Taylor have to say about Trump?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Swift has spoken up against Trump in the past, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2020/01/24/taylor-swift-politics-miss-americana-donald-trump">acknowledging in her 2020 documentary</a><em> Miss Americana</em> that she regretted not speaking up about him and his policies during the 2016 election. Ahead of the 2020 election, <a href="https://x.com/taylorswift13/status/1266392274549776387">Swift tweeted</a> that Trump was cavorting with white supremacists and promised “we will vote you out in November.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But ahead of the upcoming 2024 election, Swift has been less vocal about Trump and publicly more nonpartisan.<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/taylor-swift-urges-282-million-instagram-followers-vote-super-tuesday-rcna141848">In March</a>, she urged her fans to vote for “the people who most represent YOU into power.” Kelce, her boyfriend, has appeared in Covid-19 vaccine and <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/restaurants/bud-light-boycott-movement-goes-after-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce">Budweiser</a> commercials, <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/2023/4/12/23680135/bud-light-boycott-dylan-mulvaney-travis-tritt-trans">two targets</a> of right-wing protests.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At last year’s Super Bowl, Swift and Kelce found themselves in the middle of a kooky <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/12/us/politics/biden-tiktok-super-bowl.html">right-wing conspiracy theory</a> that President Joe Biden rigged the game in Kelce and Kansas City’s favor, all to get some of that sweet Swift attention. The gist: that Kelce and Swift were liberal, so Biden tilted the game in their favor.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/19/politics/donald-trump-taylor-swift-ai/index.html">Trump also recently posted an AI image</a> falsely suggesting he has the support of her fans. Swift has not <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/24/us/ai-content-laws-taylor-swift-trump/index.html">officially responded</a> to that “acceptance.”<strong> </strong>Still, Swift has yet to endorse a presidential candidate. In what’s likely to be a close election, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/08/swifties-kamala-harris-zoom/679637/">some of Swift’s biggest fans</a> are urging her to throw her support behind Harris.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Okay, so … Brittany Mahomes isn’t actually Taylor Swift, she’s just a friend. Why do her perceived politics matter?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mahomes’s social media meltdown came at a peculiar time for megastar Swift. Mahomes and her husband spent the weekend with Taylor Swift at the singer’s Rhode Island estate on August 24. Swift was reportedly hosting a birthday party for pal Blake Lively that weekend. Lively has been having a difficult time in the press recently because of a <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/367451/blake-lively-it-ends-with-us-press-tour-controversy">feud with co-star Justin Baldoni</a> during the filming of their movie <em>It Ends With Us</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Swift’s getaway weekends are famous for being luxurious and over the top, but also as invitations only her very best friends receive. Swift is known for picking and choosing her friends from the world of beautiful and notable people and then visibly hanging out with them. Ever since Swift’s <em>1989</em> tour, where her pals — ranging from Fifth Harmony to Gigi Hadid — joined her onstage, <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24134809/taylor-swift-tortured-poets-department-matty-healy-joe-alwyn">Swift’s friendships</a> with the hippest, smartest, kindest, and most beautiful women in pop culture have become a crucial part of her image. All these people who call Swift friends are culturally cool, which makes Swift culturally cool.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/gettyimages-1717057814.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.7460602225,100,78.507879555" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Taylor Swift, Brittany Mahomes, and Blake Lively hanging out! One of these women may or may not be deeply into mass deportation! | Kevin Sabitus/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Kevin Sabitus/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, Swift’s friendships are the most human thing about her. They’re her way of signaling to the public that as different as she is from the rest of the population — a billionaire making hit music and selling all kinds of albums — she’s relatable as a good friend. Arguably, Swift’s friends have defined the singer almost as much as she’s defined herself. The Mahomes’ presence in Rhode Island would indicate that Brittany is indeed a bestie.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, not unlike how fans are trying to puzzle out the dynamic of Brittany’s relationship with her husband, Swifties are trying to figure out how Brittany’s politics figure into her friendship with Swift. Since the singer has been relatively quiet, they’re trying to get a read on Swift’s current feelings about Trump. Or, possibly, get a read on how much longer Brittany and Swift will remain friends.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Swift’s friendships have always been a crucial and visible part of her image.<strong> </strong>And Brittany Mahomes may have just made a mark on that image that Taylor Swift didn’t agree to.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Update, September 9, 10:30 am:</strong> This story, originally published August 29, has been updated multiple times, most recently with news that Mahomes and Swift sat together at the US Open on September 8. </em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, Vox editor-in-chief and publisher <strong>Swati Sharma </strong>announced a new cross-platform editorial franchise that will further the brand’s mission of explaining the world. Launching on Wednesday, September 18th as a podcast and newsletter, with a video series to kick off later in the month, <strong>Explain It to Me </strong>will answer questions from Vox’s audience with deep reporting and expert insight. With new episodes out weekly on Wednesdays, <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/explainit">the podcast</a> will be hosted by <strong>Jonquilyn Hill,</strong> who will serve as a trusted resource to listeners, answering complicated questions about everything from retirement and why there’s so much money in politics to Gen Z’s odds of avoiding an apocalypse and why jars are so hard to open. The <a href="https://www.vox.com/pages/explain-it-to-me-newsletter-sign-up">newsletter</a> will also publish on a weekly cadence, featuring a rotating cast of journalists from across Vox’s newsroom, answering questions from readers about politics and policy, the economy, culture, science, technology, and more. <em>Explain It to Me </em>launches with Klaviyo as its sponsor across its podcast, newsletter, and video editions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“<em>Explain It To Me</em> is a show for the naturally curious,” says Hill. “Our world is full of so many questions and whether they’re big or small, they reveal so much about the world around us and the way it functions. I’m so excited to be a guide for our audience as we go down these fun and informative rabbit holes.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“One of the things Vox prides itself on is our commitment to answering, in an approachable and rigorous way, the questions on people’s minds,” said Elbert Ventura, executive editor of Vox. “The Explain It to Me newsletter is a logical extension of our mission, one that puts our audience’s curiosity and our newsroom’s expertise in closer conversation.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The trailer for the <em>Explain It to Me </em>podcast is out today and available <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/EITMtrailer">here</a>, with the first episode to follow on Wednesday, September 18th.

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first time <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mollyerutter">Molly Rutter</a>’s followers accused her of being “rage bait” (that is, someone who posts something online exclusively to make people angry), she was about to go on a date with a finance bro. He was younger — 23 to her 32 — but offered to help with her taxes. Then, in a familiar twist to anyone who has ever used a dating app, he ghosted.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet Rutter’s audience decided she was the one at fault: In comments sections, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/dating/woman-ghosted-taxes-date-tiktok-b2531075.html">in the tabloid media</a>, and in other TikToks, she was called <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tiffanicvd/video/7358947225323441450?q=molly%20rutter&amp;t=1725557978441">desperate</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@winnieparkerr/video/7401597933180816670?q=molly%20rutter&amp;t=1725557978441">unhinged</a>, and even, bizarrely, a “pedophile” for dating someone younger and for being willing to trust an internet stranger with her financial information. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s just so funny to me,” she says now, months later. “People have latched onto this caricature of me: someone who doesn’t give a shit about what anyone thinks to the point that she’s self-destructive, doesn’t care about other people, is emotionally unstable.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This, however, is precisely the caricature that has made Rutter, a former teacher and now full-time content creator in Buffalo, New York, so fascinating to a growing and devoted following of 85,000 people who obsessively watch her videos. Like a modern-day Carrie Bradshaw — if scene-y nightclubs were replaced with Hinge and the glittering lights of Manhattan with snowy upstate — Rutter has built a budding career off juicy, detailed posts about what it’s like to be on the dating market in 2024. And much like <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24124448/carrie-bradshaw-is-the-worst-netflix">viewers of <em>Sex and the City</em></a><em>,</em> the fans aren’t always on her side.</p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">TikTok is full of Bradshaw protégés right now: women — mostly in their 20s and 30s, and mostly those who date men — who have used the platform as their personal dating diary, captivating millions of viewers in multi-part sagas about men with their own nicknames, like “<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mollyerutter/video/7394138389206912286?q=dangly%20earrings%20guy%20molly%20rutter&amp;t=1725562453340">dangly earrings</a>,” “<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@michelleknutson/video/7389044040341179694">five date guy</a>,” or “<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@annemariehagerty/video/7314169184055856426">Mr. America</a>.” Their content feels like FaceTiming with your most endearingly chaotic single friend, the one you root for even when they miss the glaring red flags.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They also provide a refreshingly hopeful perspective on an otherwise bleak subject. The media is currently awash in heterosexual dating horror stories: The major <a href="https://www.bustle.com/wellness/dating-apps-have-gotten-worse-hinge-tinder-bumble-gen-z-millennials">dating apps are, we’re told, in their flop era</a>, prioritizing the money they can gouge from users by paywalling their most attractive users over the business of actual matchmaking. Women are <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/tiktok-videos-single-women-crying.html">weeping on TikTok</a>, exhausted after years of trying and failing to find a decent partner; others are going “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/03/style/boysober-celibacy-hope-woodward.html">boysober</a>” and taking extended breaks from sex and dating. There’s a sense that dating these days is worse in every possible way than it was in the golden age of yore, even though nobody can quite put their finger on when, exactly, that was.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet all of the dating diaries TikTokers I spoke to believed the opposite. “I&#8217;m kind of, like, delusionally optimistic about things, so I would say that dating is better than ever,” says <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@annemariehagerty">Anne Marie Hagerty</a>, a 28-year-old founder of a production company in New York City. “We have so many more options. You can go out and about and meet people, you can be on dating apps. We have social media. You have so much more education about how to be emotionally healthy, therapy, and [how to] be a good partner. That&#8217;s one reframe on the dating conversation that I think is pretty important.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hagerty’s videos gained traction in early 2023 when she recounted the story of meeting a guy at a wedding and immediately feeling as though she’d found her perfect match, despite the fact that, at the time, he had a girlfriend. Months later, she posted <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@annemariehagerty/video/7213584012525210922">a video</a> titled, “POV: getting ready for a first date(?!) w person you think is your soulmate,” since she wasn’t sure if he was single yet.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The date — and it was, in fact, a date — was “the best first date of my life,” she wrote on a video immediately afterward, adding that it felt like she was falling in love. The man, nicknamed in her content as “soulmate first date,” soon became her boyfriend. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her commenters didn’t necessarily see it that way. “Honestly the whole thing sounds like a red flag,” wrote one. Said another: “Run.” After their eventual breakup, Hagerty says that her viewers may have picked up on something she hadn’t. “They called our breakup months before it happened,” she says. “The comments about him were always not very nice, and they ended up being true.”</p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But that kind of real-time feedback isn’t always welcome. Last fall, when Hagerty <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@annemariehagerty/video/7301316456757710126">planned a surprise helicopter ride</a> for a man who thought they were only going for coffee, people ridiculed her with sexist jokes and for “treat[ing] him like the princess he is.” “It’s the cost of doing business,” says Hagerty of the rude comments. But, she says, “I’m probably a chronic oversharer, but I’m also a storyteller at heart.” That’s part of why her content is so appealing: “It’s a lot of living vicariously as you would with a TV show, but TikTok is way more intimate,” she says.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@wisdomsinclaire">Wisdom Sinclaire</a>, a Chicago-based 24-year-old who works in data analytics for a housing nonprofit, occasionally gets heat for dating multiple men at the same time and supposedly being a “gold digger” (sexism is often a theme in the negative reactions). Overwhelmingly, though, her comments are from either young women who feel grateful that she’s normalizing the idea of dating around, or from older women who tell her they wish they had done the same in their 20s. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I’m a girl who wants to get married eventually, I want to have kids eventually,” says Sinclaire. “But in my 20s, I think it’s really important that I learn what I like and what I don’t like, and if I just settle down for the first guy who makes me smile and laugh, I might be missing out on so much more happiness. So of course I&#8217;m going to go out and date and meet as many new people as I can, and I feel like a lot of women should do that.”</p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rutter’s fanbase, like most TikTokers’, includes people who watch her with some level of either schadenfreude or not-exactly-kind voyeurism. She tends to have a plucky attitude toward her haters — “I always respond to people when they think I&#8217;m insane. I&#8217;m like, ‘Yeah, I&#8217;m cuckoo bananas!’” she says. But recently, someone leaked her Hinge profile on the <a href="https://www.cjr.org/analysis/reddit-snark-pages-influencers.php">snark subreddit</a> devoted to making fun of her. The replies were so cruel — mostly criticizing her for supposedly “catfishing” by including older photos — that Rutter deleted her dating apps. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sometimes, the criticism comes from the suitors themselves. All of the TikTokers I talked to had dealt with dates who were staunchly against the idea of being mentioned online, even anonymously and even though the creators took care to obscure their identities and faces. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I know for certain there are probably men who have not gone on a second date with me because of my social media. And to that I say, good riddance,” says Rutter. “This is my job. I recognize that doing what I do is going to limit my options. It’s way more socially acceptable to be a teacher than it is to be an influencer on TikTok. But I’m not meant to be with those people who aren&#8217;t comfortable with it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of her recent dates — a British man on a trip to the US whom Rutter drove two hours to meet — was so upset that he asked her to delete the video she’d already posted of herself getting ready that morning. “I told him I wouldn’t [delete the videos] because I stand by the fact that there’s nothing revealing about you on there,” she explains. “What I didn’t tell him was that I had already gone really viral for those videos, and I looked at the amount of money I was going to make, and I was like, ‘No way are you taking away $500 from me.’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rutter’s dating diaries are now her livelihood: She recently quit her job teaching at a private elementary school because she was earning thousands more from TikTok’s Creator Rewards Program, which allows eligible users to earn cash for views, than she was from her salaried position (parents had also complained to the school about her videos, even though she says she never violated its social media policy). She’s also found success on Cameo, the app that allows you to book personalized video messages from celebrities and influencers. In less than two weeks, Rutter says she’s booked 50 of them at $20 apiece. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@michelleknutson">Michelle Knutson</a>, a 30-year-old realtor living on a rural ranch outside Nashville, found that posting about her dating life has come with other pleasant surprises. She hasn’t made money or found a partner, but she’s met some of her best friends through the platform, women who related to her approach to dating — that is, waiting to find someone who is truly additive to her already-great life — as many of their peers were settling down with husbands and kids.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@michelleknutson/video/7389044040341179694" data-video-id="7389044040341179694" data-embed-from="oembed"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@michelleknutson" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@michelleknutson?refer=embed">@michelleknutson</a> <p>Replying to @Kathy warning in advance for multiple hand slams 😂 but thats a wrap on five date guy <a title="datingstorytime" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/datingstorytime?refer=embed">#datingstorytime</a> </p> <a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - michelleknutson" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7389044073610496811?refer=embed">♬ original sound &#8211; michelleknutson</a> </section> </blockquote> 
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Knutson guesses that the reason so many women (and the vast majority of dating diaries’ viewers are women) find her content so compelling is that it’s a huge break from the way influencers typically post. “You know what to post when you get pregnant: It’s going to be your gender reveal, your nursery haul, the names you loved but didn’t choose — it’s this cadence people are familiar with. It’s highly consumed content, but it’s very guarded and very curated,” she says. “I think the fact that I’m saying, ‘This is the date I went on and I blew it,’ or ‘this was embarrassing,’ people see themselves in that mirror of like, ‘Oh, I do that too, but I would never share that on the internet.’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hagerty says that when she began posting about dating, her audience shifted older to women in their 30s to 50s. “If you’re married, the dating content is interesting because it&#8217;s like, ‘What’s happening out there these days?’ Then if you’re single, you’re empathizing, and you’re like, ‘How are we navigating the scene?’” she says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Rutter, the answer to why she shares such an intimate part of her life — and opens herself up to harsh judgment at times — is much more personal. “Because of my body composition, I think it can be really lovely and inspiring for people to see someone being so unapologetic and confident. It can also be equally as uncomfortable for someone to see someone that confident,” she says. “It’s almost as though [people think], ‘She shouldn’t be this confident because of her body. Dating should be harder for her.’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now that content creation is her full-time job, Rutter is steeling for even more scrutiny from her commenters, Reddit, and the rest of the internet. But it hasn’t stopped her: She’s already planning a podcast, writing a children’s book, and dreaming about someday being a professional speaker or, if the stars align, a stint on a dating reality TV show. A soul mate? That’d be nice — as long as he’s cool with the camera. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The baddies of respiratory viral season are at your doorstep: The US is currently in the midst of a <a href="https://www.vox.com/coronavirus-covid19/367150/covid-surge-summer-wave-pandemic-vaccine-booster-mask">large uptick in Covid-19 cases</a>, and flu and RSV season is just a few months away.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More than 200 viruses cause the coughs and sneezes that make so many of us miserable every fall and winter. “Respiratory infections are actually inevitable,” says <a href="https://viceprovost.tufts.edu/shira-doron">Shira Doron</a>, an infectious disease doctor and hospital epidemiologist at Tufts Medical Center in Boston.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The good news is that there are now a range of strategies available to fight them, although after years of battling a constantly shifting pandemic, many people are understandably exhausted and confused about how they should keep themselves and others safe. The bottom line is you can minimize respiratory viruses’ effects on your life by reducing your exposure to them, priming your immune system to fight them off, getting vaccinated, and making a plan to get tested and treated for an infection if you’re someone who’ll benefit.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s how to think about this year’s cold, flu, and ongoing Covid-19 season, how to keep yourself healthy and safe, and how to be strategic about testing, vaccines, and medications.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Should I treat Covid like the flu? Or like the common cold?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The further we get from the OG Covid of 2020, the less likely it is that infections will translate into hospitalizations, deaths, or long-term disability. That doesn’t mean the virus doesn’t carry risk. “Covid continues to be a more dangerous virus than flu, [but] they’re becoming more similar,” said Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director Mandy Cohen in a late August press briefing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last season, Covid-19 caused <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/resp-net/dashboard/?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fsurveillance%2Fresp-net%2Fdashboard.html">more hospitalizations</a> than flu and RSV combined. However, with each successive wave of Covid, a <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker">smaller proportion</a> of infected people are hospitalized or die as a result. That suggests the virus is less likely to cause severe illness, especially in low-risk people. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A Covid-19 infection does still carry the risk of persistent symptoms — also called long Covid — but that risk has significantly <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2403211">decreased over time</a>, in large part due to Covid-19 vaccines.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We can&#8217;t attribute characteristics to Covid 2024 that we did to Covid 2020,” Doron says.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>If anything, people should be taking more care with other, non-Covid infections</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, an important question when thinking about Covid risk remains, “Who are you?” says <a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md">William Schaffner</a>, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. Older, immunocompromised, pregnant, and frail people still “ought to be clearly more concerned,” he says, because the consequences of an infection are worse for them than for others.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>How long should I stay away from others if I have Covid-19?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although there are no longer any hard guidelines about how many days you should isolate if infected with Covid-19 as of this year, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/precautions-when-sick.html">the CDC recommends</a> staying home and away from others if you have respiratory symptoms, regardless of the cause. Whether you had a positive Covid test or not, don’t go back to normal activities until your symptoms are improving overall and you’ve been fever-free (without meds like Tylenol or ibuprofen) for at least 24 hours.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In conversations among infectious disease specialists, says Doron, most advocate that workers with Covid-19 infections should apply the same rules for going back to work as they do with flu or cold infections.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That doesn’t mean you should be flippant about Covid’s risks, says Doron. If anything, people should be taking more care with other, non-Covid infections. “You should stay away from people who are high-risk or immunocompromised regardless of what virus you have,” she says, “because all viruses can be dangerous to high-risk people.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Doron recommends masking for people with any respiratory symptoms when in close contact with others, and for severely immunocompromised people (for example, people with low levels of infection-fighting cells after chemotherapy) when in public. During periods when lots of Covid-19 is circulating — like now — Schaffner suggests masking and avoiding crowded public locations for all high-risk individuals, including people 65 and up.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Should I be testing for Covid-19 if I get sick?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since CDC and other experts say the methods for protecting others should be the same for all respiratory infections, the main reason to get tested if you’re sick is to determine whether you should take medicines directed at specific viruses.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tamiflu (the brand name for oseltamivir) and other medications can make flu infections <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/treatment/whatyoushould.htm">less lethal</a> for high-risk people (e.g. people of all ages with asthma, heart disease, diabetes, and other conditions). <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/clinical-care/outpatient-treatment.html">Paxlovid</a> (the brand name for nirmatrelvir-ritonavir) can have similar effects in older and immunocompromised people with Covid-19 infections.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These drugs can be lifesaving if people take them for the right infections, but neither will do much good for other viruses. If you’re sick and you’re among those who’d benefit from treatment with one of these medications, it’s smart to get tested.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US government will once again mail <a href="https://aspr.hhs.gov/COVID-19/Test/Pages/default.aspx">free Covid-19 tests</a> to Americans who request them starting at the end of September, and you can get tested for flu at many pharmacies, at urgent care centers, or at a health care provider’s office.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the deal with all these different vaccines?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before the pandemic, the only seasonal vaccine most people needed to think about was a flu shot each fall. Now, there’s a Covid-19 booster vaccine available at about the same time. Additionally, shots to protect babies and older adults from the pneumonia-causing RSV virus — which was in development for years before the pandemic — finally became available to the public last fall. The toolkit is bigger now than it was a few years ago. It’s a good thing, but it can feel confusing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">US recommendations aim to keep things simple for most people: The CDC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/s-t0627-vaccine-recommendations.html#:~:text=CDC%20recommends%20everyone%20ages%206,with%20a%20COVID%2D19%20vaccine.">recommends</a> everyone over 6 months old get a Covid-19 booster and a flu shot for this fall (more below on how to time your shots).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When it comes to RSV, three categories of people should be getting a vaccine: older people, pregnant people, and babies. For now, this is a one-and-done shot — people who get it don’t need to worry about an annual booster. If you’re 75 or over, 60 or older with an <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/vaccines/older-adults.html">underlying illness</a>, pregnant, or have a newborn baby, talk to a health care provider about getting an RSV vaccine.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>How should I time the flu and Covid vaccines to give myself the best protection?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Getting the flu shot and the Covid-19 vaccine at the same time is perfectly fine, and you can even get them in the same arm a few inches apart. Any time before New Year’s is good protection, although you can be strategic with the timing if you need to.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Experts have landed on Halloween as optimal vaccination time for both to avoid the worst of the winter flu season and whatever Covid might also be bouncing around in late winter.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The main benefit of Covid-19 vaccination is protection from severe infection and hospitalization, not protection from infection altogether. However, there is a short-lived period after vaccination when antibody levels are so high that even infection is unlikely. If you have an important life event planned — say, a big overseas trip or a wedding — it’s not unreasonable to try to time your vaccine for about a month before that event in order to make it less likely you’ll be sick during your big moment, says Doron.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Experts have landed on Halloween as optimal vaccination time to avoid the worst of the winter flu season and whatever Covid might also be bouncing around in late winter</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re at risk for a severe Covid-19 infection, get a Covid booster as soon as you can, says Schaffner. His reasoning: There’s a lot of Covid circulating right now, and in any case, people who need extra protection can get <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html">an extra dose</a> of the updated vaccine midwinter.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re someone who’d benefit from the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/rsv/index.html">RSV vaccine</a>, the best time to get it is in the late summer or early fall, before the virus starts spreading. Vaccination for pregnant people in particular should happen between September and January.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Seriously, do I really need to get another Covid vaccine?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“You betcha,” says Schaffner, echoing the CDC’s broad recommendation. Experts have determined that in the US, the benefit of getting the vaccine exceeds the risk for all age groups.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, it’s more crucial for some than others. “The more high-risk you are, the more you’ll stand to benefit from the updated vaccine,” says Doron. That includes older people (65 and up) and those who are severely immunocompromised, like those actively receiving chemotherapy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All three Covid-19 vaccines expected to be offered this fall are safe and effective at preventing hospitalization. Novavax is <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37992183/">less likely to cause side effects</a> than the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines; in her <a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/top-6-questions-answered-about-fall">latest newsletter</a>, epidemiologist Katelyn Jetelina noted that’s a major reason she’ll be waiting to get a Novavax booster.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite the vaccines’ safety record, a recent survey by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania suggests <a href="https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/more-in-u-s-accept-covid-19-vaccine-misinformation-and-willingness-to-vaccinate-has-declined/">false Covid beliefs are on the rise</a>, with one in five Americans believing Covid infection is safer than vaccination. “The level of messaging on one side didn&#8217;t change. On the other side, it did change,” director <a href="https://www.asc.upenn.edu/people/faculty/kathleen-hall-jamieson-phd">Kathleen Hall Jamieson</a> told me. “There&#8217;s less pro-vaccination messaging that you&#8217;re routinely hearing, and you’ve still got the same amount of anti-vaccination messaging out there.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Do I need to get the Covid-19 vaccine if I recently had Covid?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-nationaltrend.html">Wastewater measurements</a> suggest we’re in the midst of a big Covid-19 uptick nationwide, with infections likely continuing to climb upward in the Midwest and Northeast. That means many Americans have recently been infected with the virus. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/76/10/1822/6964677?login=false">not much benefit</a> to receiving a Covid-19 vaccine in the three months after a Covid-19 infection. Holding out for longer gets you more bang for your vaccine buck and allows the immunity produced by a Covid-19 infection to mature and solidify, says Doron. Studies of vaccine timing have borne this out: In one study, for example, antibody levels (which are protective against infection) were <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.21.22274025v1">11 times higher</a> in people vaccinated eight months after infection than in people who only waited three months.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the flip side, the longer you wait to get vaccinated after a Covid-19 infection, the more likely you’ll get infected in the interim. (However, most people are not reinfected in the first nine to 12 months after an infection, says Doron.)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What else can I do to stay healthy this season?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re not sick, several familiar strategies can help keep you healthy: Wash your hands before touching your face or preparing food and after touching shared surfaces or using the bathroom; use a mask in crowded places; ventilate shared spaces by opening a window and turning on a fan if possible, and consider using an air purifier when gathering with others.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“During the height of Covid, we forgot about reinforcing how important sleep, exercise, nutrition, stress reduction, all of those things impact the immune system,” says Doron. Optimizing those factors — while also maintaining a healthy weight and controlling underlying medical conditions — makes it more likely you’ll stay healthy if and when you get a respiratory infection.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Welcome to <em>Your Mileage May Vary</em>, my new twice-monthly advice column offering you a framework for thinking through your ethical dilemmas and philosophical questions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Your Mileage May Vary </em>isn’t like other advice columns, which usually aim to give you a single answer — the underlying premise being that there <em>is</em> an objectively “right” answer to the complex moral questions that life throws at us. I don’t buy that premise.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">This story was first featured in the <a href="https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup">Future Perfect newsletter</a>.</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Sign up <a href="https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup">here</a> to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So I’m reimagining the genre. My advice column is based on <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/value-pluralism/">value pluralism</a>, the idea — developed by philosophers like Isaiah Berlin and Bernard Williams — that each person has multiple values that are equally valid but that sometimes conflict with each other. When values clash, dilemmas arise.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What happens when you value authenticity, for example, but also want to use ChatGPT to write your wedding speech because it would be more efficient? Or when you value fighting climate change but also desperately want to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22399882/climate-change-kids-children-overpopulation">have kids</a>?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When you write in with a dilemma,&nbsp;I won’t give you my answer; I’ll show you how to find your own. First, I’ll tease out the different values at stake in the question. Then I’ll show how wise people — from ancient philosophers to spiritual thinkers to modern scientists — have thought about these values and conflicts between them. Finally, I’ll guide you to decide which value you want to put more weight on. Only you can decide that; that’s why the column is called<em> Your Mileage May Vary</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here, I answer the first Vox reader’s question, which has been condensed and edited for clarity. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>My mother is retired, disabled, and poor. I assist her with her medical care by arranging appointments, talking to her doctors, and finding medical resources that she needs for her many ailments. I&#8217;ve even been able to find a home health aide to come to her house six days a week to assist her with daily cleaning, cooking, and other tasks.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>But as she ages, I know she will need more help than I can provide from afar. And I know I cannot take on the actual tasks of caring for an elderly person with the many issues she has. &#8230; Am I a monster for accepting the fact that she will likely end up in a state-run retirement community?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dear Definitely-Not-a-Monster, </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is not a traditional advice column, where someone writes in with a question and comes away with a simple answer. In your case, though, there is one question I can answer very simply right off the bat: “Am I a monster?” The answer is no. The world isn’t divided into good people and bad people (despite what fairy tales and superhero movies tell us). We’re all just human beings, trying to live in line with our values as best we can under the conditions we’re given. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s clear that you hold multiple values simultaneously. You want your mother to be well-cared for. You also want yourself to be well-cared for.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What could be more natural? I imagine that every animal on Earth feels this dilemma in their guts. And, demographically, <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22639674/elder-care-family-costs-nursing-home-health-care">it’s a fact</a> that more and more people are going to find themselves in exactly this position as baby boomers age. But I also know from personal experience that just realizing how common a dilemma is doesn’t make the internal tug-of-war any less confusing or painful.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Have a question you want me to answer in the next Your Mileage May Vary column?</strong> </h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:sigal.samuel@vox.com">sigal.samuel@vox.com</a> or <a href="https://forms.gle/wTU5egBukdhyKeL56">fill out this anonymous form</a>!

</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">People have been wrestling with this painful confusion for thousands of years. They’ve come up with different ways to navigate trade-offs between these competing values, depending on the social mores of the time. We can learn from the insights they’ve surfaced along the way.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Historically, even ancient traditions that take filial piety very seriously acknowledge that there will always be a tension between caring for your parents and caring for yourself. In Judaism, “Honor your father and your mother” is one of the Ten Commandments — it’s not all 10! In fact, biblical commentators have understood another commandment from Deuteronomy, “Guard yourself and guard your soul very carefully,” to mean that you’re obligated to take care of your own body and soul.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the Chinese ethical tradition of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Respect-Elderly-Implications-Service-Providers/dp/0761845305#:~:text=Book%20overview&amp;text=This%20book%20is%20concerned%20with,the%20resolution%20of%20those%20issues.">Confucianism</a>, your body is considered a gift from your parents, so to harm its health (for example, by stretching yourself too thin) would be to disrespect them. That means caring for your parents can’t be the be-all and end-all value without becoming self-defeating.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So to ask the question “What should care for my mom look like?” is to ask the question at the wrong level of granularity. A better question might be “What should care for my mom look like, considering everyone involved?”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To answer that, you’ll want to think about your mom’s evolving needs, but you’ll also want to consider: How much bandwidth do you have in terms of your physical and mental health? Who else is counting on you — a partner, a child, a dear friend? What other commitments do you value?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You straight-up say, “I know I cannot take on the actual tasks of caring for an elderly person with the many issues she has.” That actually makes things pretty simple in your case. Even Immanuel Kant — the 18th-century German philosopher I think of as Mr. Duty — <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/ought-implies-can">said</a> that “ought”<em> </em>implies “can,” meaning that if you’ve really thought through the situation and concluded that you can’t care for your mother on your own, you aren’t morally obliged to.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there’s a more radical point to internalize here: Even if we imagine a scenario where you <em>can</em> take on all these tasks for your mom, that alone doesn’t mean you should. Being able to do something is necessary but not sufficient for having an obligation to do it. Even if, for example, you could have your mom move in with you, it doesn’t automatically follow that that’s a wise idea. It depends on what the effects would be on everyone involved — yourself included.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you feel that the effects of doing something, even something “good,” are prohibitive, that’s not an indictment of your morality as an individual. <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23850582/millennials-aging-parents-boomers-seniors-family-care-taker">Modern life</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/22442407/care-for-caregivers-mental-health-covid">does not make</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22639674/elder-care-family-costs-nursing-home-health-care">caregiving</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/23911269/parents-caregiver-older-aging-in-place-seniors-family-support">easy</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As the surgeon Atul Gawande explains in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Being-Mortal-Illness-Medicine-Matters/dp/1250081246"><em>Being Mortal</em></a>, children used to live close to their parents and parents used to, well, die earlier. It was more feasible for children to be their parents’ caregivers. Now, we live in a globalized world where the young often migrate to get an education or a job, and surviving into old age is much more common. (For someone born in 1900, the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy">global average life expectancy</a> was 32 years; now that we have more medical knowledge and less poverty, it’s 71 years, and substantially higher in high-income countries.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Plus, today’s parents are having kids <a href="https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/popfacts/PopFacts_2019-5.pdf">later</a> in life than in the past, so when the parents reach old age, their offspring are in their prime. That means the young are trying to establish their careers and raise their own children at exactly the time their parents experience declining health and call for help —&nbsp;often from afar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Our society is not set up to handle that. And it’s one of the reasons why retirement communities first became a widespread fixture of American life in the 1960s.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These communities vary a lot in quality. You can try to find one with qualities that appeal to your mom, but you might also have to accept the fact that her living conditions may not be ideal. She might have an unhappy time there. That’s a societal failure that you can’t single-handedly fix. If you happen to be in a position to improve the system —&nbsp;if you work in public policy, say — great! Consider pulling those levers. More likely, though, you’ll want to focus on what you can do for her right now, given the system you live in and given all your other commitments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The existence of retirement communities doesn’t mean you should totally exempt yourself from caring for your mom. How you approach caregiving has implications for her, but it also has implications for your own moral development.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Philosopher Shannon Vallor <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-011-0015-x">argues</a> that the experience of caregiving helps build our moral character, allowing us to cultivate virtues like empathy, patience, and understanding. So outsourcing that work wouldn’t just mean abdicating a duty to nurture others; it would also mean cheating ourselves out of a valuable opportunity to grow. Vallor calls that “moral deskilling.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet she’s careful to note that caring for someone else doesn’t automatically make you into a better person. If you don’t have enough resources and support at your disposal, you can end up burned out, bitter, and possibly less empathetic than you were before.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Vallor says, there’s a big difference between liberation from care and liberation to care. We don’t want the former, because caregiving can actually help us grow as moral beings. But we do want the latter, and if a retirement community gives us that by making caregiving more sustainable, that’s a win.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ancient Greeks —&nbsp;they’re just like us! Aware that we often act against one of our core values, they gave the phenomenon a name:<em> </em>akrasia. Shayla Love does a great job <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/mar/21/why-we-do-things-bad-for-us-impulse-habits-akrasia">explaining it</a> in The Guardian.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Isaiah Berlin, the granddaddy of value pluralism, insisted that it was not the same as moral relativism. His tongue-in-cheek writing style makes <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vl/notes/berlin.html">this short piece</a> a fun read.</li>



<li>I love when I stumble across a philosophical idea that actually helps me a lot in real life. Bernard Williams’s idea of “moral luck,” first introduced to me by <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/living-the-life-authentic-bernard-williams-on-paul-gauguin">this Aeon essay</a>, has done that for me.&nbsp;  </li>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In life, there are certain inevitabilities. In the United States, those inevitabilities include death, taxes, and hearing about the Kennedys. With Robert F. Kennedy Jr. making a splash in the 2024 presidential race (and now endorsing Trump), Caroline Kennedy’s son <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/jack-schlossberg-vogue-political-correspondent.html">Jack Schlossberg</a> covering said race for Vogue, and rumors of the post-J. Lo Ben Affleck dating <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/ben-affleck-annoyed-kick-kennedy-200000357.html">Kick Kennedy,</a> it feels as though the media spotlight is circling back once again to America’s royal family. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For generations of Americans, especially those in the Northeast, a fascination with the Kennedys is nothing new. The ambition and glamour, public service and philanthropic triumphs, tragic deaths and scandals are all part of this family’s legacy, and so many people have watched and lived through each one with them. The American Kennedy obsession was a <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24043045/politics-fandom-trump-fans-toxic-stan-culture-conspiracies">parasocial relationship</a> before we even had a name for it. What might be harder to explain is that even as younger generations of Americans are further and further removed from the most famous and politically significant Kennedys, there’s still a fascination. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Why are so many people invested in <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/jack-schlossberg-interview">Jack Schlossberg</a>, perhaps best known for making <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jack.schlossberg/video/7389585125987650858?lang=en">goofy little lip-sync TikToks</a>, reasserting his family’s legacy? Why, in the case of Kick, are they still rubbing elbows with movie stars and entertainment moguls — or at least being rumored to? And what are we to make of the RFK Jr. of it all: the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/us/rfk-jr-brain-health-memory-loss.html">brain worm</a> and the separate <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/05/nx-s1-5063939/rfk-jr-central-park-bear-bicycle">bear</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/us/politics/rfk-jr-whale-head.html">whale</a> carcasses? Is having a parasite in your cranium and playing around with animal bones somehow more or less embarrassing when you’re a Kennedy? What does the family name mean in 2024?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For a better understanding of the Kennedys and this current moment, we turned to <a href="https://millercenter.org/experts/barbara-perry">Barbara Perry</a>, a Kennedy expert and professor at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center, an organization that specializes in presidential scholarship. I got to speak with Perry about why the Kennedys occupy such a special place in the American psyche, what Camelot means to politics, why some people are so desperate to see Schlossberg shed his silly goose era and run for office, and why RFK Jr. is so weird. She had answers for most of these burning questions. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>This interview has been edited and condensed for length and clarity. </em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Barbara, I’m here to ask you about Kennedys in the news. RFK Jr. is a Kennedy. Jack Schlossberg is a Kennedy. Taylor Swift </strong><a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/relive-taylor-swift-conor-kennedys-whirlwind-romance/"><strong>dated a Kennedy</strong></a><strong>. Ben Affleck might be dating a Kennedy. The Kennedys are everywhere again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well there’s just so many of them and there’s so many to date. Every American could probably date one, and maybe even marry one at this point! </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>That’s the dream, isn’t it? We’re into something like the third generation of, or Kennedy family 3.0, at this point. </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kennedy 3.0 is a really good way to describe it, but this goes all the way back probably to Jack Schlossberg’s third great-grandfather. President Kennedy&#8217;s grandfather, for whom he was named — John Fitzgerald — was the mayor of Boston and was in Congress in the 1890s. President Kennedy was only about three generations removed from abject poverty.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So that would actually put us somewhere at 5.0 or 6.0 today. This is also a family that, for generation after generation, has pursued or been involved in public service. And that’s why many people think of them as “America’s Royal family.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Being in public service and being in the public eye go hand in hand. Generation after generation of people are drawn to this family. </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I personally know a thing or two about that magnetism — my mother took me to see John F. Kennedy. I was a little thing, a wee thing. My mother was a homemaker, very smart, voted, and kept up with the news, but she hated down-and-dirty politics. And the one and only campaign rally she ever went to was then-Senator John F. Kennedy, at a rally one month before he was elected. She piled my two older brothers and me into the car. She drove from the suburbs, and she didn’t particularly like driving downtown, but she did. We got there early so we could stand right in front of the podium. And I’d say that I can’t remember the speech, but I do remember the crowd and the excitement. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I believe my mother feels the same as yours. Regardless of her own individual politics or how she feels about the current state of politics in the US, she adores the Kennedys.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I bring that up because that’s part and parcel of the broad reach of this family, and something I was thinking about before you even called. I can name all sorts of factors that I think draw people to them, but one is, they’re the first completely modern media political family. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What do you mean? Is it that the Kennedys begin to understand the value of media or that the Kennedys are made for the media?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">TV didn’t exist for any [previous] presidential families — the Roosevelts or the Adamses. But it comes on strong for President Kennedy, his young and beautiful wife, and their two beguiling children. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I always cite <a href="https://time.com/4795637/jfk-television/">this [stat]</a>: When Eisenhower was elected, the first time in ’52, only 20 percent of American homes had television sets. By the time Kennedy was elected eight years later, 80 percent of American homes had a television set. And that’s how people came to know him as this very young, handsome, active president, again, along with his stylish and beautiful wife, who took Washington by storm and then took the world by storm. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And there’s the fact that his dad, Joe Senior, was a movie mogul. He was a producer of Hollywood movies in the ’20s, and that’s in part how they made their fortune. That’s another thing about this family. They’re a rags-to-riches story. </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/gettyimages-515586136.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,16.976315497612,100,66.047369004777" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="John F. Kennedy and his wife Jackie. | Getty Images (archival)" data-portal-copyright="Getty Images (archival)" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Life magazine had also just come on the scene. Teddy Kennedy used to say, “Oh yeah, Life magazine was kind of like our family photo album.” And people reading Life would say, “Oh my gosh, this family has nine children.” The women were beautiful and the boys were handsome, and they were active and sporting and witty and well-educated at Harvard. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>It sounds like a perfect storm: the rise of new media and a family so photogenically perfect and stylish to take advantage of it. It’s the combination of a made-for-television family and the rise of television itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I have to add this as well, but it’s also the horrors of his assassination in 1963.&nbsp; For this young man dead at 46, his wife 12 years younger becomes a widow, and then these two beautiful little children are now fatherless — I just don’t think anybody who lived through that [wouldn’t be sympathetic].&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Obviously there were Republicans and people who hated the Kennedys, and still do and hate Jack Kennedy. I’m not saying 100 percent of Americans were upset and grief-struck, but interestingly enough, he had just barely slipped by Richard Nixon in 1960 and I’m not sure he even got 50 percent of the popular vote. But after he died, people were asked if they voted for him and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/to-tell-the-truth-to-pollsters/">well over 50 percent of Americans said yes</a>, which says to me that they were drawn to him even more in his death. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>It seems like the Kennedys are equal parts a mixture of tragedy and aspiration. You mentioned your mother being drawn to JFK despite not particularly being fond of politics. I think, for a lot of people, the Kennedys made political ambition seem glamorous — which, like you said, is very closely tied to Hollywood.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s this Hollywood theme that runs through the Kennedys, and if you sort of theoretically add that to a much better-looking royal family, it’s sort of like Diana — although she was attractive, most of the others are not. But if you add movies and beauty and charm and charisma and wit and athleticism to all of this, they just are very compelling. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Plus, like Diana or James Dean or Marilyn Monroe, these people flash across the sky like a shooting star and then are taken, usually with some kind of tragedy. It just somehow pulls people even closer to them, or they want to know even more about them, I think. And they’re frozen in time. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It was Mrs. Kennedy, Jacqueline Kennedy, who named her husband’s presidency Camelot, and to this day it sticks. That’s got a Hollywood air to it and a Broadway air. If you go and look at the lyrics to the main song from musical <em>Camelot</em>, “Don&#8217;t let it be forgotten. Once there was a spot for one brief shining moment known as Camelot.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I think your mention of Marilyn, Diana, and James Dean is interesting in that they’re not political figures. Monroe and Dean are tragic Hollywood figures — that whole live fast, die young curse. Diana is and has become more of a pop culture icon than she was a monarch. And those three figures are continuously mythologized and eulogized. </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>JFK Jr., I think, is often a part of that same conversation when it comes to American pop culture, since he never ran for office, but </strong><a href="https://www.history.com/news/jfk-jr-plane-crash-carolyn-lauren-bessette"><strong>died in a plane crash</strong></a><strong> when he was only 38.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He was going to be the one to restore Camelot. He got the best of the looks of his father and his mother, and he was a handsome devil. He married the Calvin Klein woman [Carolyn Bessette], and they were on their way to the White House.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/gettyimages-1453022170.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.721562822657,100,78.556874354687" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="JFK Jr. and his wife Carolyn Bessette. JFK Jr. was largely seen as the next Kennedy in line for political prominence after his father’s generation. | Sonia Moskowitz/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Sonia Moskowitz/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Well, that idea of promise seems to be the thing that keeps us all watching or keeps people interested. People are still curious if there’s a Kennedy who sort of absorbs the political fantasy that we project onto this family. I can’t help but think that’s sort of what’s happening with the media attention on Jack Schlossberg. Of course, he seems to play into the joke and sort of subvert his family name by being a silly goose.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">My question to you is, I think what I’m hearing is that you actually find that appealing, that he’s kind of a goofy comedian? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I’m not sure! But I think it’s not that different from what you said about the Kennedys being the first family with television. He’s sort of the first Kennedy that’s become a social media star.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I got to meet him two summers ago on Martha’s Vineyard. I don’t want to say he was overly serious, but he was mature and kind.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And he seemed to get all the best characteristics of everybody in the family, physically, mentally, and in terms of his personality, he had a nice wit about him. He was charming, charismatic, cute, handsome, just lovely. And I thought, oh, and what a cute girlfriend. And I thought, oh, I hope they get married and they’ll have beautiful children.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Barbara, you are sounding like your mother at the rally!&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Or your mother too! I maintain that I didn’t do anything that would embarrass me or the Miller Center or the JFK Library. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But I think that it’s probably good for him if he wants a public life because he clearly has been chosen by his mother. He goes on TV with her. They speak on video during the 2020 election — he’s clearly the designated son and restorer of Camelot because he’s the only male heir to John Kennedy. He’s the only grandson of John Kennedy and Jackie Kennedy. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Plus, as you say, he’s smart, and I guess for a newer generation, he’s got the right stuff, as far as knowing how to use social media and being witty and funny and serious when he needs to be, but approachable when not. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>On the other side of that, can I ask you your thoughts on RFK Jr.? Do you think the obsession with him comes from him representing a weird and bizarre side of the Kennedys — like everything they’re not supposed to be?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes, people are drawn to him I think in large part because he has the same exact name of his father and people still feel sad about that — maybe even more so in some way than Jack because with Bobby, he is, I think, more tied to our current politics and social policy of caring for the poor and minorities, and being anti-war.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Going back to my mother —  she and my grandmother talked about the President and the family as if they were our family, and my grandparents hung a picture from a magazine of President Kennedy in their living room when he died. So that’s all part and parcel of this, and I think that does still attach in part to Robert Kennedy Jr. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Is he genuinely weird or just weird for a Kennedy? Like, his scandals aren’t that far removed from the usual scandals — drugs and women — that have followed the Kennedy men around?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I can remember seeing interviews of Robert Kennedy senior, where he’d say, “Oh, my son, Bobby loves animals, and he has falcons.” And that always seemed to me to be rather odd, unless you’re in the Middle Ages in England. Falconry was not a big thing here, and even in the ’60s. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That home, Hickory Hill, where they lived out in northern Virginia, was a menagerie. They had a Newfoundland that would slobber all over everybody, and they had goats and rabbits and falcons and these raucous touch football games. </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/gettyimages-2167290858.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.735821710327,100,78.528356579346" alt="RFK Jr shaking hands with Donald Trump." title="RFK Jr shaking hands with Donald Trump." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="After a campaign in which RFK Jr. said his brain was partially eaten by a worm and that he may or may not have put a bear corpse in Central Park, he ended his presidential bid and endorsed Donald Trump. | Rebecca Noble/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Rebecca Noble/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">This was written about, but <a href="https://time.com/archive/6832932/the-administration-big-splash-at-hickory-hill/">Bobby and Ethel had some big party</a> at their home with a pool, and they started pushing people, fully clothed people, including Arthur Schlesinger Jr., the historian who was the White House historian during Kennedy’s presidency. That made the news, and Rose Kennedy was embarrassed, being the Victorian, and she’s writing to the family members to say, please don’t do that, it doesn’t make our family look very good. Your brother is the president of the United States, but even the parents were wild. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>So we shouldn’t be that surprised.</strong> </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If he weren’t crazy, people would still be interested in him, and maybe more so! And you can make all these alternative histories about him, but he made all the wrong decisions from the time he was a teenager and started doing <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2024-06-20/robert-kennedy-addict-reform-plans">heavy drugs</a>. Even with the crazy stuff, up until the bear story and up until Kamala Harris came on the scene as the nominee, he was polling 10 percent in some states. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>The power of being a Kennedy!</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They’ve had great, great joys and great ecstasies and great triumphs, and then they’ve had just the worst tragedies. It is fascinating, I must say. Since we don’t have a royal family to watch and follow, we have the Kennedys. And they do keep producing interesting if sometimes bizarre figures.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">PENNSYLVANIA — Ahead of November, both political parties have made a similar bet: that they can boost their odds of winning key swing states by going on offense in places they don’t normally compete.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Republicans, that means building on the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/23770342/latino-voters-democrats-2022-2024-election-new-reality">2020 trends</a> that saw their candidates, led by Donald Trump, make inroads among a swath of working-class voters of color, especially in urban centers. For Democrats, that looks like holding down GOP margins of victory in rural regions and accelerating changes in suburbs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With just a few weeks left until Election Day, the key to making these strategies work may be the ground operations each side has built up to make the case to new, undecided, or persuadable voters. To get a better picture of what this looks like, <a href="https://megaphone.link/VMP1489740388">I teamed up with <em>Today, Explained</em> producer Miles Bryan</a> to examine the ground game and the pitches Republicans are using to win over Black and Latino voters in Philadelphia, and that Democrats are using to turn out low-propensity or undecided Democratic and independent voters in rural and suburban areas like Lancaster County.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The side best able to do this may end up reaping the biggest prize of 2024: Pennsylvania’s 19 electoral votes and the presidency.</p>

<iframe frameBorder="0" height="200" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP1489740388" width="100%"></iframe>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Republicans have a clear message, but a shambolic operation</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Early in September, Miles and I drove up to North Philadelphia. We had received word that a “Black Voters for Trump” <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/race-politics/4864000-black-conservative-federation-bus-tour/">bus tour</a> would be making a few stops in the city as part of a five-state <a href="https://www.wypr.org/wypr-news/2024-09-13/tiny-baltimore-crowd-gathers-for-final-stop-of-black-voters-for-trump-tour">swing</a> to motivate and mobilize Black Republican voters. The first stop of the day would be at a cheesesteak takeout in Nicetown, a predominantly Black neighborhood.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Organized by the Black Conservative Federation, one of the main Republican-aligned groups campaigning with Black voters on Trump’s behalf, the tour was meant to drill down on the central kitchen-table pitches Republicans have been using to take advantage of trends in election polling and political surveys: namely, that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/373535/3-theories-gop-donald-trump-nonwhite-voters-hispanic-black-latino-asian">Democrats’ hold on Black voters seems to be weakening</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/08/22/black-voters-support-harris-over-trump-and-kennedy-by-a-wide-margin/">National polls</a> still <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/2024/05/20/an-early-look-at-black-voters-views-on-biden-trump-and-election-2024/">show</a> Democrats winning the lion’s share of this segment of the electorate, but also find Trump increasing his level of support from 2020. Black Republican party identification has also been increasing among the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/09/age-generational-cohorts-and-party-identification/">youngest segment</a> of this electorate, and though Vice President Kamala Harris appears to have <a href="https://x.com/admcrlsn/status/1838038449703567570">reconsolidated</a> support from Black voters compared to President Joe Biden’s now-defunct reelection campaign, she’s still <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16D9GSxqF5LFIRTcoVJlvWWefU_h-ZMzlomghgbvYRaM/edit?gid=1863533280#gid=1863533280">not hitting his 2020 margins</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Nicetown, Florida Rep. Byron Donalds, one of Trump’s key Black surrogates, told us he thinks this disaffection is being driven by economic nostalgia and frustration with immigration and crime.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Black people are sick and tired of being sick and tired, man,” Donalds said. “I&#8217;ve been in North Carolina, been in Wisconsin, been in California, here in Philadelphia, obviously in Florida, Texas — it doesn&#8217;t matter. The story remains the same.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Plenty of Black and Latino voters, he said, don’t trust Democrats to handle the nation’s economy, to lower prices, or to improve daily life —&nbsp;and when they compare their finances today to life before the pandemic, they can’t help but wish for a change. It’s a pitch <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/373535/3-theories-gop-donald-trump-nonwhite-voters-hispanic-black-latino-asian">I’ve explained previously for Vox</a>, and it sounds like a compelling message —&nbsp;but it’s hard to persuade people if no one shows up.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When the tour bus pulled up in front of Max’s Steaks, it arrived at a nearly empty scene. There were no crowds, a few local reporters, and just a solitary Trump sign, nestled on a chair near the shop’s entrance. Plenty of passersby heckled the BCF staffers and volunteers that began to talk to customers, but eventually Donalds and other surrogates did meet some receptive ears, like Sharita White, a Black woman living in Kensington — a <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/02/20/1232496906/addiction-opioid-overdose-kensington-philadelphia-zombie-tranq">rougher part of Philadelphia</a> hit hard by heroin addiction and the fentanyl crisis.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I&#8217;m in a neighborhood that I don&#8217;t want to be in, but if Trump gets in his chair that can change. I might [be able to] move,” White told us. “I need to survive. And these streets of Philadelphia, it seems like they’re turning into New York now. Everything is high here. People can’t even afford a water. I don&#8217;t know too much about politics, but the only thing I know, my income’s changed. And if I need that man to get into the chair to fix my income, I’m all down.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">White is the kind of voter Trump and Republicans are hoping will turn out in big cities like Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, Phoenix, Detroit, and Milwaukee, which net Democrats the big leads they need to win swing states like Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, and Wisconsin. In Philadelphia, at least, there are signs that these more diverse working-class neighborhoods are <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/inq2/philadelphia-working-class-voters-republican-20241001.html">becoming more competitive</a>. But receptive voters don’t mean much if you don’t have a way of activating them on Election Day.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We noticed that no one took down White’s information or checked her registration status, or logged her in any system to try to follow up with her and get her to vote. The same dynamic unfolded at the second stop of the tour, a soul food restaurant in the middle-class Germantown neighborhood.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This disconnect between potentially gettable voters and the organizing work needed to turn them out is a recurring <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/us/politics/trump-voter-outreach-super-pacs.html">problem</a> with the GOP’s ground game. Grassroots and local work is primarily being run by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/10/us/politics/2024-election-gop-black-men-voters.html">outside groups</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/us/politics/trump-voter-outreach-super-pacs.html">PACs</a> like the Black Conservative Federation, not the Republican Party. These groups are hiring canvassers, doorknockers, and staffers who <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/trump-allies-launch-20-million-effort-to-reach-young-men-e65aeb31">register</a> people to vote at Trump rallies, but in many cases rally attendees are from out of state. This <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/09/trump-campaign-rnc-ground-game-pacs">reliance</a> on outside groups has <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/republican-activists-say-little-sign-of-door-knocking-for-trump-in-swing-states">raised flags</a> among <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/30/republicans-alarm-trump-ground-game-00181577">longtime</a> Republican operatives, who warn that outreach and resource distribution by outside groups may be inefficient, and that local volunteers and longtime activists often know their neighborhoods and how to persuade voters better than paid staff do.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Democrats’ renewed ground game aims to lose by less</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democrats’ 2024 ground game stands in stark contrast to the GOP’s shortcomings, and could allow them to reverse a trend that has locked the party into close races in cycle after cycle.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Specifically, Democratic support in rural communities has collapsed in recent decades, in some cases allowing Republicans to overcome the big leads Democrats rack up in cities and their surrounding suburbs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 1996, for example, Bill Clinton won 1,100 rural counties. By 2008, Barack Obama won 455. And in 2020, Joe Biden won just 194, leading to a rural Republican romp that put Donald Trump within striking distance of victory yet again.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So ahead of 2024, Democrats set out to stem this bleeding. Biden and his cabinet spent much of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/11/biden-administration-releases-rural-playbook-launches-building-a-better-america-rural-infrastructure-tour-to-highlight-impact-of-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-on-rural-america/">2022</a>, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-biden-touts-new-economic-opportunity-in-rural-america-during-minnesota-visit">2023</a>, and early <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/02/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-launches-investing-in-rural-america-regional-event-series-to-highlight-how-the-president-is-delivering-for-rural-communities/">2024</a> visiting rural communities to talk up the massive investments being made through the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. While he was still the presumed Democratic nominee, Biden and his campaign began to set up field offices in, organize, and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-trump-biden-rural-voters-e368243f700ba46afe9a498ef876d687">visit</a> rural counties that Trump had won, and when the time came for Harris to take the reins in late July, the party had built up extensive ground operations in the kinds of rural places they need to lose by less.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That dynamic holds true in North Carolina, where Harris’s campaign has <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/how-kamala-harris-hopes-to-take-north-carolina-back-for-the-democrats?utm_content=308662786&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;hss_channel=tw-752608758476468224">invested heavily</a>, and in Georgia, where Harris went on a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/28/us/politics/harris-walz-georgia-bus-tour.html">rural bus tour</a> shortly after becoming the Democratic nominee. And it’s true in <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/09/24/harris-trump-voters-rural-pennsylvania">rural Pennsylvania</a>, parts of which Harris and Walz <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4904898-kamala-harris-tim-walz-bus-tour-pennsylvania/">toured this week</a>. The Biden and Harris campaigns have opened 50 coordinated Democratic campaign offices across the state and deployed 350 staffers —&nbsp;including 16 offices in rural counties that Trump won by double digits in 2020.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Miles and I drove out to Lancaster County in southern Pennsylvania to visit the county Democratic headquarters in Lancaster City&nbsp;and see this operation in action.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The county has historically been a Republican stronghold, but that’s quickly changing, Stella Sexton, the vice chair of the Lancaster County Democrats, told us.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“People move here for jobs for a bunch of reasons,” she said. “But the other piece of the story, and one that I think gets overlooked, is that our college-educated population is growing and it’s not just younger folks moving in with college degrees. It’s also retirees.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump won the county in 2020 by more than 44,000 votes, but in the 2022 midterms, Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat then running for his first term, got close to flipping the county, losing by just 4,000 votes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The bottom line is the reason the Harris campaign —&nbsp;Biden and now Harris campaign —&nbsp;made this investment here is not necessarily because we&#8217;re going to flip it this cycle. It may take one more cycle to outright flip the county, but … the pickup in margin that they can get here is very important to winning the state,” Sexton said.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/gettyimages-2170953302.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Harris smiling in a crowded coffee shop." title="Harris smiling in a crowded coffee shop." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Kamala Harris greets guests at Classic Elements, a coffee shop and bookstore, on September 13, 2024, in Johnstown in west central Pennsylvania. | Andrew Harnik / Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Andrew Harnik / Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">And the key to this margin-narrowing strategy is the field operation Democrats have built, both to encourage rural Democrats that may feel alone or forgotten by past campaigns and to contact persuadable or undecided voters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There were always Democrats around, but I don&#8217;t know that in our suburban or rural areas that the Democrats realized there were other Democrats as their neighbors,” Sexton said. “What I&#8217;m noticing is that folks aren&#8217;t embarrassed or hiding it. People are proud to be Democrats, and they&#8217;re proud to represent that to their neighbors.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That vibe was there earlier on, according to Sexton, even before Biden dropped out, but it’s only accelerated since Harris became the nominee. Since then, more volunteers have begun to get involved in canvassing. The switch created “excitement and urgency among people who might have sat back and waited until October to get involved,” Sexton said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We joined a canvasser going out to various suburban and working-class neighborhoods to see the Democratic pitch in action. Democrats we encountered were excited about Harris, anxious about Election Day, and happy to be reminded to vote. But undecided voters and independents were still not sure. One, a middle-aged union electrician named Ziggy, told us he didn’t have strong feelings about Harris, but was still upset that both parties had put up “somebody that&#8217;s over the retirement age” and showed “signs of slipping.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We watched as the Democratic canvasser, a nurse named Laura, cycled through a few policy issues and topics to see if she could find a way to persuade Ziggy. Talking about January 6, family-friendly policies like the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/1/16/24035922/child-tax-credit-wyden-smith-deal">Child Tax Credit</a>, and climate change didn’t really land, but when they got to reproductive rights and abortion bans, Ziggy seemed ready to listen—&nbsp;particularly about how certain anti-abortion policies could impact care for other pregnancy-related medical issues.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By the end of the conversation, he remained undecided about Harris, but did not seem like he’d back Trump, Laura told us. “And we <em>will</em> circle back to him,” she said, while marking him down in the party’s vote-canvassing app.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The whole exchange demonstrated the newfound hope that Democrats feel about competing in places that usually go red, and the advantage of having a highly organized in-house operation for turning out your own voters and persuading undecided voters. Democratic organizing efforts are also boosted by Harris’s improving favorability ratings, a <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/369878/kamala-harris-fundraising-transfer-state-legislature-abortion">significant</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/364964/harris-trump-fundraising-donations-campaign-2024">cash advantage</a>, and <a href="http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/">improving</a> economic vibes nationally.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite that edge, Pennsylvania remains a dead heat in <a href="https://split-ticket.org/2024-presidential-polling-averages/">polling</a> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/pennsylvania/">averages</a> and <a href="https://split-ticket.org/2024-presidential-ratings/">election</a> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2024-election-forecast/pennsylvania/">forecasts</a>. The presidential election may end up coming down to a few thousand votes in the state. And if that happens, the difference may well be the strategies each campaign is now pursuing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the wake of <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/374867/hurricane-helene">Hurricane Helene</a>, a devastating Category 4 storm that has ravaged the Southeast, leaders rushed <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/live-blog/helene-deadly-storm-live-updates-rcna173203">to restore homes, infrastructure</a>, and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-power-outages-32958ff95f6e51e8c69e56e587de46d2">power for millions</a> of people. And now, another life-threatening storm, Hurricane Milton, a Category 5, approaches the Florida coast. Amid the overwhelming destruction and the mounting chaos expected from these back-to-storms, and a death toll of at least <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-death-toll-asheville-north-carolina-34d1226bb31f79dfb2ff6827e40587fc">227 people across six states</a>, one group risks being overlooked in the scramble: the homeless population, those already vulnerable before the storm.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Disaster relief for people who were homeless prior to a hurricane has always been lacking, as FEMA, the main federal agency tasked with providing aid, has a policy that <a href="https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_iappg-1.1.pdf">explicitly excludes</a> those unhoused people from most forms of help, including housing and direct assistance. In recent years, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has stepped up to try to plug some of those gaps in social safety, but a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr1605/BILLS-118hr1605ih.pdf">new bill moving</a> through Congress <a href="https://nlihc.org/sites/default/files/HR_1605_Sign_on_Letter_Final.pdf">threatens these efforts</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These dynamics have grown more pressing as major hurricanes <a href="https://www.vox.com/natural-disaster/374366/hurricane-helene-florida-big-bend-beryl-storms-climate">increase in frequency</a> and the number of unsheltered Americans <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/ahar/2023-ahar-part-1-pit-estimates-of-homelessness-in-the-us.html">continues to grow</a>. In June the US Supreme Court <a href="https://www.vox.com/homelessness/357861/homelessness-encampment-grants-pass-supreme-court-housing">issued a landmark decision</a> in <em>Grants Pass </em>v. <em>Johnson</em>, greenlighting local governments’ legal authority to clear out <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/3/8/23618237/homelessness-tent-encampments-housing-affordable">homeless tent encampments</a> even if a city lacks any available housing or shelter for the unhoused person to stay in.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since then, more jurisdictions have passed laws criminalizing homelessness, part of a broader effort to crack down on those sleeping outside. Just this month <a href="https://www.flgov.com/2024/03/20/governor-desantis-signs-legislation-to-address-homelessness-and-protect-the-public-and-quality-of-life-for-floridians/">a new law</a> in Florida — that bans sleeping on public property anywhere in the state — took effect. While the law <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2024/1365/?Tab=BillText">includes exceptions</a> during emergencies like major storms, those protections end when the hurricane order is no longer in place. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In practical terms, this means that when Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis or a county official lifts Florida’s emergency hurricane order, Floridians who were homeless before Helene and Milton — <a href="https://fchonline.org/the-issue/">roughly 31,000</a> people — could face new criminal penalties. Local homeless advocates say there are countless questions and rumors circulating about how the new law will be interpreted and enforced in the wake of climate disasters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most people experiencing homelessness were aware the new anti-camping law was set to take effect, according to Martha Are, the executive director at the Homeless Services Network of Central Florida. “Some people are already trying to relocate their encampments to harder-to-find areas,” she told me in mid-September, about a week before Helene <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/373874/hurricane-helene-florida-forecast-warm-ocean-water">made landfall</a> in Florida’s Big Bend region.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><br>Leaders like Are have little idea yet what to expect, and she hears unofficially that most jurisdictions are in wait-and-see mode, watching to see which city gets sued first and what the judge who reviews that lawsuit decides. (Under the new Florida law, any citizen or business can sue beginning in January if they feel the anti-camping ban is not being properly enforced.)&nbsp;<br><br>“It’s going to be a challenge for how leaders actually enforce these [anti-camping] laws, like if I’ve lost my house from a hurricane and I’ve lived in that town for a decade, will I be found in violation of the law and are they going to arrest me?” asked Noah Patton, the manager of disaster recovery at the National Low Income Housing Coalition. “These laws create significant complications, will really make aid more difficult to sort out, and what I have been saying is it makes a community less resilient to disasters.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Moving homeless people to safety when a hurricane hits is difficult — and the anti-camping laws make that harder</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s always a stressful scramble to try and reach homeless people when a hurricane is coming. “A lot of people have phones but they don’t have data, they aren’t getting texts,” said Kelly Young, the CEO of the Coalition for the Homeless of Houston and Harris County.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Typically, homeless outreach workers will try and go out to spread the word, and existing homeless shelters will work to make extra room, sometimes allowing people to sleep in places like the kitchen and hallways. Unhoused individuals can usually seek refuge in convention centers and public schools, or at newly-erected Red Cross emergency shelters. Some governments and nonprofits arrange transport for unhoused people to get indoors, while others leave it on the individual to figure out their own travel.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We had up to 13,000 people at George R. Brown Convention Center <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/8/28/16211392/100-500-year-flood-meaning">after [Hurricane] Harvey</a> and there was no distinguishing between the homeless versus people who had just lost their homes and needed a place to be,” said Larry Satterwhite, who leads the Houston Mayor’s Office of Public Safety and Homeland Security.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Not everyone experiencing homelessness gets the information they need, and not everyone living outside <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/Understanding-Encampments.pdf">feels comfortable going to a shelter</a>, said Eric Camarillo, the executive director of SALT Outreach, which works with unsheltered homeless people in Orlando and central Florida. Some people fear losing their personal belongings, while others may have had traumatic prior experiences at shelters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The face of homelessness is not the same as it was 50 years ago,” Camarillo added. “These are single moms who can’t afford day care, these are seniors in their 70s and 80s on fixed incomes who can’t afford their rent increases, and youth and young adults.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The new anti-camping laws are intensifying the already tumultuous disaster response situation, as many homeless people living outside now try to become less visible to avoid jail time. The punitive laws are also expected to increase distrust between local government and homeless individuals, making it even more difficult for people to accept help if they are found.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“These laws exist, in my opinion, to push people away and out of sight which makes our job tougher,” said Eric Samuels, the president of the Texas Homeless Network. (Texas passed its statewide camping ban in 2021.) “And if people are badly hurt and they’re miles from public view because they don’t want to get a ticket, then emergency crews might not be able to get out to help.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Disaster aid for those already experiencing homelessness faces an uncertain future</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">FEMA has the primary responsibility of providing disaster relief and works with states and local communities to manage emergency shelters, <a href="https://maps.redcross.org/website/maps/ARC_Shelters.html">which are mostly run by</a> the Red Cross. FEMA prohibits housing assistance from going to those who were already homeless — “because the need for housing was not caused by the disaster,” as their policy states — though homeless individuals may qualify for temporary transportation, funeral, child care, and medical aid.<br><br>FEMA policy does permit those who lived, pre-disaster, in “non-traditional forms of housing” like “tents, certain types of huts, and lean-to structures” to apply for a few months of rental assistance. But to receive this FEMA money, applicants must obtain verification of their pre-storm situation from “a credible or official source” which, according to Patton, makes accessing the aid virtually impossible.<br><br>“People do not apply,” he said. “It’s an exceptionally burdensome and administratively difficult process.”<br><br>Recently, in light of this, and after years of advocacy by housing organizations, HUD stepped up to establish the <a href="https://www.hudexchange.info/news/rapid-unsheltered-survivor-housing-rush-notice/">Rapid Unsheltered Survivor Housing</a> (RUSH) program, using unspent funds from <a href="https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/comm_planning/esg">another emergency grant program</a>. RUSH aims to help those who were homeless prior to a storm or other climate disaster, and the first grants <a href="https://www.nhlp.org/resources/nlihc-and-nhlp-release-report-on-huds-rapid-unsheltered-survivor-housing-rush-program/">were deployed</a> in the <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/23389508/hurricane-ian-death-toll-storm-florida-landfall-climate">wake of Hurricane Ian</a> in 2022.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We were very pleased to have the ability to launch the program because we see that people who are doubled up or experiencing homelessness during the disaster often don’t access FEMA funds or receive support from FEMA for long,” said Marion McFadden, HUD’s principal deputy assistant secretary for community planning and development. “By providing funds specifically for these situations, we’re filling in gaps.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><br>The other way HUD comes in is through its <a href="https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/comm_planning/cdbg-dr">Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery</a> program (CDBG-DR), which is a highly flexible, long-term disaster aid program that can be used to provide months of rental assistance and build new affordable housing well after FEMA is gone. However the program is not permanently authorized — meaning it relies on periodic appropriations from Congress, which are often delayed and insufficient. The Biden administration has called for Congress to permanently authorize CDBG-DR, and a bipartisan bill in Congress <a href="https://www.naco.org/news/bipartisan-bills-introduced-support-counties-disaster-recovery-process">has called for the same</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1605">a separate bill</a> currently moving through Congress seeks to move much of this longer-term disaster recovery work back over to FEMA, something low-income housing advocates believe will threaten those who are homeless before a hurricane.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We are concerned that the bill, as written, may lead to the misuse of scarce federal recovery funds and prevent critically needed long-term recovery assistance from reaching low-income disaster survivors,” more than 35 national<strong> </strong>housing advocacy groups wrote in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U15ZfvjLRefLildANBu3ij7zRXRGjL_51893RBYPTaE/edit">a congressional letter</a> in late September.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">McFadden, of HUD, said there’s “a real role” for her agency to play in supporting communities after disasters. “We are making billions of dollars in grants every year and we understand the unique needs of low-income people and of low-income housing,” she told Vox.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">FEMA was noncommittal when I inquired about the agency’s plans for unhoused individuals during a disaster if Congress granted them new authority, or whether they’d reconsider their stance on aiding the pre-disaster homeless.<br><br>“If additional or new authority is passed by Congress and signed into law, FEMA would then develop guidance necessary to implement the new authority,” an agency spokesperson said. “FEMA would focus on supporting communities’ recovery in addressing needs resulting from a disaster and adhering to the intent of Congress in approving any new authority.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As climate change escalates, communities across the US face increasing threats not only from hurricanes but also from heat waves, floods, and wildfires. Advocates <a href="https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/energy-justice/pdfs/EMBARGOED_FEMA-Petition-on-Heat-and-Wildfire-Smoke.pdf">have been petitioning</a> FEMA over the last year to expand its criteria for disaster aid to include heat and smoke, emphasizing the need for more adaptable responses to these challenges. The nation’s severe shortage of affordable housing worsens the struggles of both the newly displaced and the long-unsheltered, and addressing these intertwined crises of climate resilience and housing stability has never been more urgent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In roughly 24 hours — a mere day — Hurricane Milton grew from a tropical storm to a fierce <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCUAT4+shtml/071558.shtml?">Category 5 hurricane</a>. With wind speeds pushing <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/072057.shtml">180 miles per hour</a> Monday afternoon, it’s one of the strongest hurricanes ever recorded in the Atlantic. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Forecasters expect Milton, which is now churning in the Gulf of Mexico near the Yucatan Peninsula, to make landfall in western Florida late<strong> </strong>on Wednesday. The storm will likely lose some steam before then as it faces disruptive winds and dry air, yet Milton is still expected to be an “extremely dangerous” hurricane upon arrival, <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/071735.shtml?">according to</a> the National Hurricane Center. Storm surge in the densely populated Tampa Bay, which could see a direct hit, could reach <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/072057.shtml">15 feet</a>, the Center said in an advisory Monday.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Milton is not the typical Atlantic hurricane, according to <a href="https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/jonathan-lin">Jonathan Lin</a>, an atmospheric scientist at Cornell University. “It is exceedingly rare for a hurricane to form in the western Gulf, track eastward, and make landfall on the Western coast of Florida,” he said in an email. “There are not really any hurricanes on record that have done this and made landfall at a Category 3+ status.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s even more unusual is how quickly the storm intensified, defying forecasts and gaining more than 100 miles per hour in wind speed between Sunday morning and early Monday afternoon. Milton had “some of the most explosive intensification this forecaster has ever witnessed!” a National Weather Service forecaster <a href="https://x.com/NWSAtlanta/status/1843324138230014357">wrote on X Monday</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Why Milton intensified so quickly</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The simplest explanation is unusually warm ocean water.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Take a look at the chart below. It’s showing ocean heat in the Gulf of Mexico, which is near a record high. The red line is 2024 and the blue line is the average over the last decade.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And heat is a key ingredient in rapid intensification, according to <a href="https://bmcnoldy.earth.miami.edu/">Brian McNoldy</a>, a climatologist at the University of Miami, who made the chart below. Put simply, hotter water evaporates more readily, and rising columns of warm, moist air from that evaporation fuel rapid intensification.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/ohc_gulf-3.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,12.589156124409,100,74.821687751182" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A chart of ocean heat content in the Gulf of Mexico | Courtesy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnoldy.earth.miami.edu/products.html&quot;&gt;Brian McNoldy&lt;/a&gt;" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnoldy.earth.miami.edu/products.html&quot;&gt;Brian McNoldy&lt;/a&gt;" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not entirely clear what has caused the Gulf to warm, though scientists suspect a combination of factors, including climate change — which raises the baseline ocean temperature — as well as lingering effects of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/23738846/el-nino-2023-weather-heat-wave-climate-change-disaster-flood-rain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">El Niño</a>, natural climate variability, and perhaps even a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/tonga-volcano-eruption-raises-imminent-risk-of-temporary-1-5c-breach/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">volcanic eruption</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another key to Milton’s explosive growth is a lack of wind shear in its path, according to <a href="https://people.miami.edu/profile/be7abbba52c947423b8133238c7e7b68">Benjamin Kirtman</a>, director of the Cooperative Institute for Marine &amp; Atmospheric Studies, a joint initiative of the University of Miami and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Wind shear describes the change of wind speed and direction —&nbsp;basically, chaotic air —&nbsp;and it can disrupt hurricanes. The storm is expected to encounter more shear as it approaches Florida, which will blunt its strength and make it likely to weaken before landfall.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s more, McNoldy said, is that Milton is also relatively small in width. As of Monday, Hurricane-force winds extended only about <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/072057.shtml">30 miles</a> from the storm center. Small hurricanes are “generally more prone to ups and downs,” he told Vox, because they’re influenced more easily by weather phenomena.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although Milton is set to grow in size before it reaches Florida (in part, through a complex process of <a href="https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hurricane_blog/paper-on-the-unusual-eyewall-replacement-cycles-in-hurricane-irma-released-online-in-monthly-weather-review/#:~:text=As%20a%20hurricane%20grows%20older,eyewall%20replacement%20cycle%20(ERC).">eyewall replacement</a>), it likely won’t be huge when it makes landfall &nbsp;—&nbsp;again, speaking in terms of diameter. “That is all-around good news,” he said. Smaller storms tend to produce less surge, which describes a rise in sea level. Compared to Hurricane Helene, which was an enormous system, for example, forecasters expect Milton to produce less storm surge.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That doesn’t mean experts like McNoldy, a Florida resident, aren’t worried. As of Monday, Milton appears to be headed straight for the Tampa Bay area, the most densely populated region of the state’s west coast. This is the same region where a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-florida-storm-surge-0284042dade78e04e453ad821e6e15c3">dozen people</a> were killed by Hurricane Helene in recent days.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This is a very ominous forecast,” McNoldy said. “It will still be an extremely strong hurricane.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Update, October 7, 5:30 pm ET:</strong> This story has been updated to reflect the increasing severity of the storm.</em></p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In J.R.R. Tolkien’s <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, Sauron is pure evil. He is the acolyte of Morgoth, a Satan figure in Tolkien’s mythos. Morgoth creates sun-hating minions, the orcs, during his reign of darkness — hellspawn, in other words, created by a devil figure to do his bidding. These are the villains our protagonists most frequently encounter, and their status as dispensable adversaries serves the function of challenges to be overcome, through trickery or battlefield carnage, so that the One Ring might be destroyed and with it, the spirit of Sauron, who seeks to enslave the peoples of Middle-earth.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>The Rings of Power</em>’s second season seems intent on asking: But what about orc personhood?</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/the-rings-of-power-orc-baby-1014x570-1.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4306971617525,100,93.138605676495" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">A minor stir was caused in episode three when an orc character named Glûg is shown with an orc wife and orc baby. Glûg is a deputy to Adar, a fallen elf tortured by Morgoth, who’s currently in charge of Mordor, the parcel of land the orcs forcibly took from a population of Men in season one. (Adar and Glûg are invented characters for the show.) In previous episodes, Glûg wants to remain in the orcs’ new home rather than march to war. Later, it dawns on Glûg that perhaps Adar does not care about the orcs, whom Adar calls his “children,” as evidenced by battlefield maneuvers certain to result in high orc casualties.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Having dispensed with the aforementioned storyline of the Men forcibly removed from their homeland, it seems that the writers might be casting about for a new population through which they can examine suffering and oppression, and they landed on orcs. The problems with this approach are manifold.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>A war machine does not make for a good metaphor</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Orcs are canonically bad in <em>The Hobbit</em> and<em> The Lord of the Rings</em>, even if Tolkien pondered their humanity in subsequent writings (more on that later). Here’s how Tolkien introduces them in <em>The Hobbit </em>(“goblins” and “orcs” are synonymous):&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">Now goblins are cruel, wicked, and bad-hearted. They make no beautiful things, but they make many clever ones. They can tunnel and mine as well as any but the most skilled dwarves, when they take the trouble, though they are usually untidy and dirty. Hammers, axes, swords, daggers, pickaxes, tongs, and also instruments of torture, they make very well, or get other people to make to their design, prisoners and slaves that have to work till they die for want of air and light. It is not unlikely that they invented some of the machines that have since troubled the world, especially the ingenious devices for killing large numbers of people at once, for wheels and engines and explosions always delighted them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Under Sauron’s influence in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, orcs could charitably be understood as victims — cogs in a war machine — their cruelties the result of Sauron’s own cruelty. Yet even away from the domination of Sauron and left to their own devices, as Bilbo finds them in <em>The Hobbit</em>, they are “cruel, wicked, and bad-hearted.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Creatures of Satan, naturally bad: At their core, orcs are distinctly unlike humans. This is important because the fantasy genre frequently explores real-world oppression through make-believe people. Not that this was Tolkien’s approach; his style is more mythic than allegorical. It’s the subsequent 60 years of fantasy storytelling that has made use of fantasy populations to explore real-world systems of oppression (<a href="https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/x-men-as-a-queer-metaphor">mutants in<em> X-Men</em></a>, <a href="https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1580235/FULLTEXT01.pdf">orogenes in The Broken Earth</a> trilogy, among many more examples).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But for the metaphor of oppression to work, it has to be rooted in some kind of overlap between the fantasy population and the subjugation of actual people. Real bigotry exercised through government policy is an enduring theme of <em>X-Men</em>’s mutants; orogenes are scapegoated and killed because of the powers they’re born with in The Broken Earth. With orcs, there is no overlap to draw on, no <em>there</em> there. Tolkien — and Morgoth — created them to be agents of evil. The metaphor falls flat when there’s nothing on the other side of it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The racialization of orcs cannot be wiped away</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tolkien’s creations are so influential that it’s easy to assume our modern conceptions of elves, dwarves, and orcs are as he wrote them. But it’s less of a straight line than a branching tree, with Tolkien at the root and evolutions and interpretations branching from a shared lineage. Untangling even the roots can be difficult.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There has <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-97475-6">been</a> <a href="https://pillars.taylor.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1075&amp;context=inklings_forever">much</a> <a href="https://dc.swosu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1180&amp;context=mythlore">debate</a> about whether Tolkien wrote racist depictions in the orcs and the Men who aligned with Sauron. Though Tolkien describes orcs mostly through their actions, the few recurring visual descriptions <a href="http://dimitrafimi.com/2018/12/02/revisiting-race-in-tolkiens-legendarium-constructing-cultures-and-ideologies-in-an-imaginary-world/">include traits</a> such as “swarthy” and “slant eyed.” The oliphaunt-riding <a href="https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Haradrim">Haradrim</a> who join Sauron’s side in the War of the Ring are described as “black men like half-trolls with white eyes and red tongues” with “harsh” sounding language. This is as bad as it gets in the canon proper; the physical characteristic Tolkien seemed most preoccupied with in these stories is stature.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But more emerges in the Legendarium, which is just shorthand for the entirety of Tolkien’s mythmaking, most of which was published posthumously, as well as his letters, which contain the <a href="http://dimitrafimi.com/2018/12/02/revisiting-race-in-tolkiens-legendarium-constructing-cultures-and-ideologies-in-an-imaginary-world/">infamous description</a> of orcs as “squat, broad, flat-nosed, sallow-skinned, with wide mouths and slant eyes: in fact degraded and repulsive versions of the (to Europeans) least lovely Mongol-types.” That description may not be found in the published books, but the spirit of the sentiment certainly is, even if it is implicit.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then there’s what’s explicit: For the most part, Tolkien’s various groups are so specific, and have become so iconically defined, that they are identifiable without race or ethnicity, ripe for <em>The Rings of Power</em>’s<em> </em>colorblind casting. Orcs are conspicuous outliers in this regard, with actors’ skin hidden under thick layers of sickly makeup. This makes it all the easier to project the modern ideas of orcs onto them — the ones that don’t stem from Tolkien at all, but use his creations as fantasy shorthand that, through repetition and time, have turned creatures like orcs into the tropes we recognize today.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dungeons &amp; Dragons is the most responsible for this; for decades, fantasy storytellers have been playing in Tolkien’s backyard, cherry-picking elements from his fantasy and transforming them into a kind of ethnographic adventure through a fantasyland textured by colonial shades of racism recognizable to players. Dungeons &amp; Dragons taught fantasy fans to understand orcs as a fusion of racist tropes, combining a barbaric other and a vaguely native people of tribes and clans.<strong> </strong>Players can play as half-orcs with a “sloping forehead, jutting jaw, prominent teeth, and coarse body hair,” which in the official handbook was for years <a href="https://mikemonaco.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/3ehalforc.jpg">accompanied by a drawing</a> that emphasizes Tolkien’s Asian caricature (the problematic visual depictions are all but excised in the new edition). Tabletop games like <a href="https://whfb.lexicanum.com/wiki/Savage_Orc">Warhammer</a> and <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/orcs-best-depictions-video-games/">many</a> video games have reinforced racist depictions of orcs, and Peter Jackson’s <em>Lord of the Rings</em> didn’t help. Jackson’s Uruk-hai are coded in the “<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryBlackMan">scary Black men</a>” trope, a significant departure from how Tolkien describes them (mostly more sun-tolerant and larger than orcs). </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>The Rings of Power</em> is a direct descendant of Jackson’s interpretation of Tolkien’s material, but all the cultural understandings of orcs seem to bear on decisions the show’s writers make. The writers seem to feel the responsibility of doing something with orcs, but instead of unpacking any of their baggage, they ignore the uncomfortable connotations in favor of a paste-on oppression narrative.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s almost as if, because orcs exist in such a distinct category of their own, <em>The Rings of Power</em> seeks to turn the orcs into a racialized population. This results in an oppression utterly devoid of context, so nonspecific as to be nothing. It’s an easy win to be against the concept of oppression; it’s much harder to actually say something about oppression. The reason<em> X-Men</em>, for instance, is interesting is not because oppression just exists, but because the mechanisms of oppression of mutants reveal how similar mechanisms harm real-world people — something that was very much <a href="https://www.history.com/news/stan-lee-x-men-civil-rights-inspiration">on the mind of its creators</a> during the civil rights era. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s no story — no interesting story, at least — in “oppression in general is bad.” For orcs’ oppression to mean anything, their suffering needs to be recognizable to us, the mechanisms of their oppression understood. That is to say: There must be an obvious corollary to an actual oppressed population. The writers are gesturing, however tentatively, at comparisons to everyone from Israeli Jews to<strong> </strong>exploited soldiers with their storylines of “Mordor as the only homeland for orcs” and “Glûg as unwilling conscript.” But perhaps the gestures remain so tentative because going any further into the allegory risks the obviously offensive.&nbsp;Who wants their oppression to be seen through the lens of orcs?&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Maybe orcs are vehicles of evil who don’t have babies, and that’s fine&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Humanizing orcs was always going to be difficult. But there’s an obvious alternative: In place of writing orcs as any kind of recognizably marginalized population, they could just be evil.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Evil is a powerful force, lurking in the shadows of the night. The malevolent forces of the world hide there; the ghouls who give us nightmares and ill omens and bad luck. Evil is a necessary and primal concept that motivates our most powerful stories (see: the Bible, all myth). Banding together to fight against it is the best unifier there is, in the real world and the world of Middle-earth.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It would seem Tolkien understood this when writing the orcs. Here’s a population of wicked beings, created by Morgoth (again: Satan) and in service of a warlord set on conquering the world and subjecting all its people. Tolkien depicts orcs again and again as killing innocents, enjoying torture, and enacting the sort of casual cruelty you’d expect from villainous minions. The overwhelming story Tolkien tells of orcs is not of a people suffering under a dictator, but the mindless and expendable soldiers Sauron uses to attempt to conquer Middle-earth.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By comparison, he wrote vanishingly little about the systems needed to support all those (tens of thousands? hundreds of thousands?) orcs. Imagine if he had sacrificed the potent locale of Mordor in service of thinking through the problem: Much farmland would be needed to grow crops, but plants can’t grow in a land of shadow where volcanic ash blocks the sun. Tolkien elided this particular bit of mundane world-building, which is good, as it doesn’t sound very interesting to read.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Likewise, how orcs procreate is not discussed anywhere in <em>The Lord of the Rings </em>or <em>The Hobbit</em>, but is mentioned almost as <a href="http://www.henneth-annun.net/events_view.cfm?evid=1590">an aside</a> in <em>The Silmarillion.</em> This may seem like a technicality, but it’s not. Dig deeply and greedily enough in the Legendarium and you can find a cavern of (sometimes contradictory) world-building that, for good reason, isn’t present in stories of the Ring. A second piece of marginalia supporting orc humanity includes the sentence in a <a href="https://bibliothecaveneficae.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the_letters_of_j.rrtolkien.pdf">letter</a>, unsent because “it seemed to be taking myself too importantly,” that finds the author discussing the theology of his creation and calling orcs “naturally bad” after nearly writing “irredeemably bad.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Not to put too fine a point on it, but what Tolkien chose to include in <em>The Lord of the Rings </em>and <em>The Hobbit</em> should be given more weight than what he chose to omit. If Tolkien, a deliberate writer and a devout Catholic, had wanted to get into the moral morass of what orc babies and their attendant loving and nurturing implies, he would have. Given everything that is on the page — the thousands of years of elves, Men, and dwarves and their fractured populations warring, allying, and achieving great feats — one wonders why the writers’ room of <em>The Rings of Power</em> is venturing into orcish territory at all.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a tall order to adapt all that myth into a television show. But we know how it will turn out: In the face of Sauron, an alliance of the free peoples of Middle-earth (<a href="https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/War_of_the_Last_Alliance">most of them</a>, anyway) will put their squabbles aside and fight Sauron’s forces — that is to say, orcs. And if the writers are true to Tolkien, our heroes will have no compunctions about killing many, many, many orcs. If our heroes do have compunctions because there have been several seasons’ worth of orc sociological theory, the writers have a difficult set of questions to answer: What does it mean to humanize cogs in a war machine? How do creatures with minds so weak they bend to the will of Sauron engage in free will? If orcs are more than hellspawn, what are they pointing to and what do they stand in for? These are questions Tolkien struggled with and ultimately didn’t answer. It doesn’t look good for<em> The Rings of Power</em>’s writers’ room.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For most of the past year, the war in Gaza dominated global headlines, while the growing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah along the country’s northern border <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24153755/hezbollah-israel-lebanon">was just below the surface, threatening to boil over</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, on the anniversary of the October 7 attacks, the situation is roughly reversed: the Israeli government and the international community are focused on the spiraling violence in Lebanon and escalation with Iran, while Gaza has fallen off the front pages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not that the combat in Gaza has ended. Just last week, nearly 100 people were killed by Israeli <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/03/world/israel-iran-lebanon-hezbollah?smid=url-share#israeli-strikes-killed-99-over-24-hours-gaza-health-officials-say-one-of-the-highest-tolls-in-months">airstrikes and ground operations in Gaza</a>. But Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) troop levels in Gaza are down as <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/04/11/1244053444/with-little-fanfare-gaza-war-enters-a-new-stage-from-high-to-low-intensity">much as 90 percent</a> from the high point of the operation, as Israel has shifted resources toward the fighting in the north.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet even as the military operation Israel calls “Swords of Iron” has receded, there are no signs that it is ending any time soon. Instead, the conflict seems to be transforming into the sort of “forever war” that both Israel and the US have become all too acquainted with in recent decades.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead of the “day after” that has been talked about since the invasion began nearly a year ago, Gaza is trapped in a perpetual present of conflict, chaos, and civilian death. There are no signs that will change — and that is exceedingly grim news for Gaza’s civilian population.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“With the world&#8217;s attention focused on Lebanon, I think the concern for Palestinians is that they&#8217;ve now been left to their own devices,” said <a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/who-we-are/people/tahani-mustafa">Tahani Mustafa</a>, senior Palestine analyst for the International Crisis Group.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A ceasefire in Gaza remains elusive. Multiple rounds of <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/367954/ceasefire-deal-israel-hamas-gaza-blinken-bridging">US-led talks</a> aimed at securing a pause in the fighting and a return of hostages have come to naught, with Netanyahu <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/02/biden-says-netanyahu-not-doing-enough-to-secure-ceasefire-with-hamas">repeatedly insisting</a> on maintaining an Israeli military presence in Gaza after the war. Meanwhile, after months of public rage following his government’s failures on October 7, Netanyahu’s popularity <a href="https://www.jns.org/in-first-since-oct-7-netanyahus-govt-wins-outright-majority-in-tracking-poll/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;wpisrc=nl_todayworld&amp;utm_campaign=wp_todays_worldview">has rebounded</a> after the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. That means there’s far less internal pressure to bring an end to a war that has sparked domestic protests, brought international opprobrium on Israel, and <a href="https://theconversation.com/israel-11-months-of-war-have-battered-the-countrys-economy-237915">battered its economy</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s not the only thing working against an end to the conflict. With the US election looming, President Joe Biden has effectively become a lame duck with diminishing leverage (<a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24101020/biden-netanyahu-israel-gaza-pressure-leverage-arms-un">that he’s willing to use</a>, at least) over America’s Israeli ally. After months of criticism of Netanyahu’s conduct of the war in Gaza, US officials — off the record, at least — have taken a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/30/us-israel-military-hezbollah-00181797">notably more positive tone</a> about its operations targeting Hezbollah and Iran.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As for Hamas, while it can still launch periodic attacks — including <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/4-idf-troops-killed-several-hurt-during-fighting-in-southern-gazas-rafah/">one that killed four IDF troops</a> in September — and may still be holding as many as 101 Israeli hostages, it has lost <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/16/israel-hamas-leadership/">more than half its military leaders </a>since the war began, according to Israeli estimates.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even in its weakened state, though, it is unlikely to agree to any deal that leaves Israeli troops in Gaza. More to the point, after witnessing the fate of Nasrallah, Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar is likely even less inclined to agree to any sort of deal with an adversary almost certain to kill him at the first opportunity, no matter what he agrees to. (That’s assuming he’s still alive — there has been growing <a href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-822458">speculation in recent weeks about Sinwar’s whereabouts</a>.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Add it all up and the situation in Gaza has become something hard to classify but no less grim – not a formal occupation or annexation, but one where the Israeli military effectively controls Gaza without governing it, reserving the right to strike when it desires while doing little to support the territory’s rebuilding. It is one where the possibility of a postwar Gaza seems more remote than ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As <a href="https://israelpolicyforum.org/about/staff/shira-efron/">Shira Efron</a>, analyst with the Israel Policy Forum and outside adviser to the Israeli government, put it, all these developments are leading some Israelis to contemplate the question: “What if this war never ends?” </p>

<iframe loading="lazy" frameborder="0" height="200" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP9127022290" width="100%"></iframe>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">A different kind of occupation</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel’s military occupied Gaza from 1967, following the Six Day War, until 2005, when Prime Minister Ariel Sharon ordered the withdrawal of security forces, along with the forced removal of about 8,500 Israeli settlers. Though the move was widely supported at the time — the occupation viewed by many as a costly quagmire — the withdrawal <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/shadow-of-israels-pullout-from-gaza-hangs-heavy-10-years-on-idUSKCN0QF1QQ/">came to be seen as a mistake by many Israelis</a>, particularly after Hamas took over Gaza in 2007.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s happening now in Gaza is different. Though some in Israel’s influential settler movement, including ultranationalist <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israeli-finance-minister-calls-for-reestablishing-israeli-settlements-in-gaza">Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich</a>, have called for rebuilding settlements in Gaza, this is not widely supported in Israel and the government does not appear to be actively contemplating it. And while some like Gen. David Petraeus have <a href="https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2023/12/07/petraeus-says-israel-should-try-us-style-counterinsurgency-in-gaza/">urged Israel to pursue an Iraq-style</a> “clear, hold, build” counterinsurgency approach, which would combine defeating militants with supporting the civilian population, digging wells and building schools in Gaza does not seem to be on the IDF’s agenda.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The Israeli plan right now is to move to a sort of a counterterrorism footing in Gaza,” said RAND Corporation military analyst <a href="https://www.rand.org/about/people/c/cohen_raphael_s.html">Raphael Cohen</a>. “It’s not going to be withdrawal, but it’s not going to be full-on occupation either.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This could involve control of the Philadelphi corridor along the border with Egypt and the so-called Netzarim corridor dividing Gaza’s north and south border, along with periodic raids into the center to target the remnants of Hamas, which will likely remain an insurgent force for the indefinite future.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The real concern is that Gaza gets stuck in a kind of middle state,” says Cohen, meaning the low-intensity fighting continues indefinitely, but with no opportunity for Gaza to rebuild or establish stable governance.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Not everyone has such a light footprint in mind: Retired IDF General Giora Eiland has been on a media blitz in recent weeks promoting <a href="https://www.israelnationalnews.com/en/news/395677">what’s been called the “Generals’ Plan”</a> for Gaza. This would involve giving the entire civilian population of northern Gaza (about 250,000 people) a week to evacuate, then declaring it a “closed military zone” with no supplies allowed in; essentially, seeking to starve out any Hamas fighters that remain. Netanyahu is <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/netanyahu-tells-lawmakers-hes-considering-generals-plan-to-lay-siege-to-northern-gaza/">reportedly considering</a> the plan, though it is almost certain to be widely condemned as a war crime.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel has set the destruction of Hamas’s military capabilities as a <a href="https://www.gov.il/en/pages/spoke-cabinet081023">core goal of its operation</a>. Given that Hamas can likely continue to operate as an underground insurgency for quite some time, this is a recipe for a very long war.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As for the other core goal, the return of the Hamas-held hostages, Efron notes that Netanyahu “mentions in every speech that he will do everything possible to bring the hostages back home.” But without a negotiated ceasefire, this is becoming increasingly unlikely. “I think we’re all concerned that there is currently no hostage deal on the table,” Efron said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In any event, Netanyahu has <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-09-22/ty-article/.premium/netanyahu-reportedly-tells-mks-half-the-hostages-held-by-hamas-in-gaza-are-alive/00000192-1a92-d417-abb6-dab61d690000">reportedly told legislators</a> that he believes as many as half the remaining hostages may actually be already dead.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Who will actually rule Gaza?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Regardless of its military plans, Israel does not appear to have any desire to provide the security or social services for Gaza’s civilian population that its offensive has utterly devastated.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The early weeks of the war saw a flurry of articles and policy papers proposing ideas for the post-war governance of the strip. The US and Western governments coalesced around a few.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The United States pushed ideas involving a <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/us-plan-to-empower-palestinian-authority-in-gaza-faces-israeli-opposition/7405175.html">“revamped and revitalized” Palestinian Authority</a> (PA) — the body that currently governs the West Bank — taking over control of Gaza. Netanyahu <a href="https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-777731">refused to consider</a> such plans, saying they would turn Gaza from “Hamastan” to “Fatahstan” (Fatah is the party that dominates the PA). In any case, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/26/g-s1-12949/khalil-shikaki-palestinian-polling-israel-gaza-hamas">given how unpopular</a> the PA is in the areas it already controls in the West Bank, it’s not clear how much legitimacy it would have had with Gaza’s population had the party been installed at the point of an Israeli gun.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Biden administration has also pushed Arab states to take a leading role in Gaza’s postwar reconstruction, but those countries have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/04/29/blinken-israel-gaza-postwar-plan/">ruled out committing</a> to that kind of project without a clear pathway toward a Palestinian state.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In any event, Efron says “this has never been a plan that Israel subscribed to.” Netanyahu has called vaguely for a “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/11/17/1213684429/benjamin-netanyahu-israel-hamas-gaza">civilian government</a>,” but Efron says Netanyahu’s government’s vision relies on finding “unicorn Palestinians” qualified to govern the territory but associated with neither Hamas nor Fatah nor any other Palestinian faction with a real constituency. Israel’s government remains opposed to any plan that involves a pathway toward a sovereign Palestinian state.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There’s no turn-key government that’s going to come in and guarantee [Israel’s] security,” said <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/people/aaron-david-miller?lang=en">Aaron David Miller</a>, a Mideast peace negotiator for several US administrations with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the moment, even with its senior leadership decimated and its physical infrastructure destroyed, the Hamas-controlled government is still able to provide at least some degree of security and social services in parts of Gaza. But its capacities are limited, and are unlikely to improve while Israel remains bent on the group’s destruction.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Going forward, Miller says, “you’re going to end up with clans and criminal gangs” filling the power vacuum. “Hamas and the Israelis will clearly also be in the mix, and of course the NGOs will be trying between the raindrops to figure out a way to deliver humanitarian assistance.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That assistance is still badly needed. UN officials describe Gaza’s humanitarian crisis as one of the worst in modern history, with food and health systems in a state of “<a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/09/1154001">complete collapse</a>.” More than a million people face <a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS/GAZA-HUNGER/myvmakwxrvr/">extreme malnutrition</a>. The UN estimates that <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/nearly-two-thirds-of-gaza-buildings-damaged-in-war-un-44ca5b3a">about two-thirds of Gaza’s buildings</a> have been damaged or destroyed. Some estimates have put the cost of reconstruction in Gaza at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-19/rebuilding-gaza-strip-after-israel-hamas-war?sref=C3P1bRLC">over $80 billion</a>, which is <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/country/west-bank-and-gaza">more than four times</a> the combined GDP of Gaza and the West Bank before the war.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Crisis Group’s Mustafa sees the current trajectory of the conflict as reducing Gaza to a “tent city in ruins” and feels it’s “unlikely that the international community are going to do much to pressure Israel into following through with any other sort of alternative vision for a day after.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Will there ever be a day after?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When he visited the country in the days following the October 7 attacks, President Biden expressed sympathy to the Israeli people and backed their right to respond with military force.&nbsp; But he also counseled them to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/18/joe-biden-urges-israel-not-be-consumed-by-rage-pledges-support-netanyahu-gaza-hamas">avoid the mistakes</a> the United States made after the 9/11 attacks, when a desire to eliminate security threats led to two decades of costly wars, mission creep, and human rights abuses that damaged the country’s international standing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In truth, Israel shouldn’t need such a warning — it knows a thing or two about quagmires. For most of the 1980s and 1990s, Israel occupied parts of southern Lebanon. It was a mission that began as an effort to wipe out Palestinian militants in the country and then expanded to maintain a “security zone” alongside local Christian militias to prevent attacks on northern Israel.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By 2000, when Brig. Gen. Benny Gantz — later to become an Israeli opposition leader and erstwhile member of Netanyahu’s government — became the last Israeli soldier to withdraw from the country, the conflict had become known as “<a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2000-may-24-mn-33497-story.html">Israel’s Vietnam</a>,” with hundreds of IDF soldiers and thousands of Lebanese civilians killed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The future “occupation” of Gaza may end up looking more like Lebanon during this era than the current occupation and settlement of the West Bank or the situation in Gaza prior to 2005.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Time and again, <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/12/13/23998928/hamas-taliban-isis-attacks-terrorism-extremist-groups-israel-palestine">governments caught flat-footed by terrorist attacks</a> have responded with open-ended military campaigns with the aim of completely stamping out the threat, only to learn too late that the costs are higher than they can imagine — for themselves and for the population under their control. It’s likely to be years before the costs of this one are fully tallied.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As the dust still hovers from the Israeli airstrikes that <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-podcast/375510/hezbollah-israel-lebanon-airstrike-hassan-nasrallah">killed</a> Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in his underground lair, and while bombs explode over the heads of Israeli targets from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-attack-war-lebanon-10-03-24-intl-hnk/index.html">Beirut in Lebanon</a>, to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-revolutionary-guards-consultant-dies-injuries-israeli-strike-damascus-2024-10-03/">Damascus in Syria</a>, to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2024/10/1/israeli-bombardment-kills-at-least-31-in-gaza">Rafah in Gaza</a>, to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/29/israeli-army-launches-air-raids-on-yemens-ras-isa-and-hodeidah">Hudaydah in Yemen</a>, we can see, emerging from the haze, the outlines of a new Middle East.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel’s initial intent in launching devastating attacks in Gaza, Lebanon, and beyond has been to cut off both the head and the hands of its enemies. The overriding strategic motivation, however, is far greater than that.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is harking back to a day, decades ago, when Israel’s military superiority was so overwhelming that no other power in the region could dare seriously challenge it. What both the year-long Gaza campaign and the ongoing attacks of the past two weeks are primarily about is to reestablish what, in the aftermath of Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel, had arguably been lost: deterrence. This is all about deterrence, demonstrated through overwhelming, asymmetric reaction to any military provocation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Israel’s post-October 7 mission</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The only potential brake on a Gaza response that has been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/qatars-emir-what-is-happening-region-is-collective-genocide-2024-10-03/">plausibly described by many as genocide</a> has been the potential threat of international condemnation in the form of sanctions and formal war-criminal status for Israeli leaders, as well as the loss of US military and political support. It is now clear that Israeli officials who might have feared those consequences needn’t have, and won’t need to fear them for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the context of Hezbollah and Iran, the two key members of the so-called “axis of resistance,” some observers, including me, had thought that Israeli deterrence had been permanently lost after October 7, replaced instead by a mutual “balance of terror” such that neither they nor Israel would willingly resort to all-out war. The Israelis have exploded that illusion, quite literally.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the past two weeks, employing everything from <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/372399/pager-explosions-lebanon-syria-hezbollah-israel-gaza">rigged pagers</a> to multi-thousand-pound bunker-busters, Israel has called the Hezbollah bluff. What we have learned is that Hezbollah’s long-range missile capabilities have been seriously overhyped, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-30/iron-dome-hezbollah-rockets-missiles-conflict-israel-lebanon/104394246">countered</a> by Israel’s effective “Iron Dome” antimissile system. As Israel continues to pound leadership bunkers and weapons caches at will from uncontested airspace — at the cost of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/israel-iran-live-updates-beirut-strike-idf-hezbollah-lebanon-rcna173762">hundreds of civilian lives in Lebanon</a> — the Lebanese Shiite militia has been revealed&nbsp;as a paper tiger.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Monday, Israel again <a href="https://www.vox.com/israel/375125/lebanon-hezbollah-israel-iran-invasion-gaza">launched</a> a “limited” ground invasion to destroy Hezbollah infrastructure, but it is unlikely to push far, nor to repeat its&nbsp;mistakes from past invasions of attempting to hold ground. However the endgame plays out, Hezbollah will soon have to accept what has now been amply demonstrated, just as it was during the month-long <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/10/01/israel-invasion-lebanon-hezbollah-2006-war-lessons-learned/">disaster</a> of the Israeli invasion of 2006:&nbsp; It is completely overmatched and will be forced, once again, to retrench and rearm.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>We can stop fearing a wider regional war because it is already being fought, and Israel has largely won it</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Iran, the lesson of its two <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqjrwg9dly1o">largely impotent missile assaults</a> this year on Israel’s Iron Dome, compared against the success of Israel’s ongoing attacks on its ally in Lebanon, has surely hit home. Tehran may have felt obliged on Tuesday to respond in some way to repeated Israeli humiliations, delivered in Lebanon, Syria, and the heart of Tehran itself, but make no mistake: The clerics who control Iran are anything but suicidal. We cannot know precisely how Israel will respond to the latest assault, but Iran will find a way to climb down before the exchange gets entirely out of hand.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What this means is that we can stop fearing a wider regional war because it is already being fought, and Israel has largely won it. And with it, the relative deterrence Israel sought has been restored.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The costs of a remade Middle East</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This doesn’t mean that the emerging regional balance, even if favorable to Israel at the moment, is stable. Even after its leadership decapitation, Hezbollah is still a formidable institution; the militant group, not the Lebanese government, remains the preeminent power in the country. The next round of confrontation, when it comes, will likely find the reconstituted Hezbollah stronger than before.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the far side of the Persian Gulf, Iran’s newly inaugurated President Masoud Pezeshkian will <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-03/weakened-iran-raises-fears-it-may-make-push-for-nuclear-weapons">likely be forced</a> by domestic political considerations, if not international diplomatic inertia, to put aside any notion of resurrecting the 2015 nuclear deal. He will focus instead on achieving the genuine deterrence that only nuclear arms can provide.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah still insists that it will continue its strikes on Israel until the war in Gaza ends, but nearly a year after October 7, that war has all but ended. Israel has achieved nearly all it can militarily there, at <a href="https://www.vox.com/24055522/israel-hamas-gaza-war-strategy-netanyahu-strategy-morality">horrific cost to the Palestinian people in Gaza</a>. Even after the guns have mostly fallen silent, Israel may see the odd missile salvo from Lebanon or the occasional terrorist attack. But the fact that Israel’s enemies will need to resort to terrorism will be a sign of their weakness, not their strength.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As for Palestine, its future is a question no more. Diplomats from the US, Europe, and the Arab world can save themselves the effort:&nbsp;There will be no negotiations worthy of the name and no solutions in Gaza or the West Bank, other than those unilaterally imposed by Israel and tacitly permitted by the US.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Netanyahu, whose <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c243zempn6zo">political rehabilitation is well underway</a>, and others on what used to be referred to as Israel’s extreme right, are hardly losing sleep over good governance in Gaza. The “solution” in the territory has already been arrived at.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel will retain physical control of the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-egypt-philadelphi-corridor-cd15c27cecffe70322becd933cf38909">Philadelphi Corridor</a> on the border with Egypt and the east-west strip bisecting what remains of the enclave, largely preventing reconstruction of the tunnels through which Hamas might otherwise rearm and the free movement of armed fighters within Gaza. With little effort, Israel can continue to control the flow of international aid to Gaza’s destitute population and use disproportionate and overwhelming force against any nascent glimmer of resistance. Should Gaza devolve into chaotic clan warfare, that will hardly arouse concern in Jerusalem, which will care only that the effective threat of militancy is permanently removed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We have seen a similar policy of asymmetric military response to armed Palestinian restiveness playing out to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/world/middleeast/west-bank-raids.html">telling effect</a> in the West Bank towns of Jenin and Tulkarm in recent weeks. Israel has responded with a combination of heavy air- and drone attacks, ground incursions, and the willful destruction of businesses and civilian infrastructure. These actions, stepped up but hardly new, are meant to quash popular resistance to a <a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/east-mediterranean-mena-israelpalestine/246-stemming-israeli-settler-violence">pervasive post-October 7 wave of Israeli settler-led violence</a> against Palestinians, aided and abetted as a matter of <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/10/04/west-bank-settler-violence-serves-israel-interests-idf-gaza-war/">government policy by the Israeli Defense Forces</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of this overlays a foundational policy of enforced impoverishment, as Palestinians are <a href="https://theworld.org/stories/2024/03/13/no-one-helping-us-palestinians-west-bank-barred-israel-face-unemployment">barred from jobs</a> they previously held in Israeli-controlled areas and as Israel <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/23/why-is-israel-sending-palestinian-taxes-to-norway">routinely withholds tax revenues</a> gathered on behalf of a Palestinian Authority it is systematically undermining. The message to Palestinians from Israel is clear: Resistance is futile.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel’s 40-year program of inexorable dispossession of Palestinians through land seizures and settlement, a process long slow and implicit, has become increasingly rapid and explicit since October 7. Even if occupied Palestinian lands aren’t formally annexed, a unitary Israeli state <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/23972967/river-to-sea-palestine-israel-hamas">from the river to the sea</a> is all but inevitable.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What will be left is managing the optics of what is clearly <a href="https://www.vox.com/23924319/israel-palestine-apartheid-meaning-history-debate">apartheid</a>. Though neighboring Jordan is unlikely to facilitate Palestinian expulsion, the desire of individual Palestinians to flee endemic poverty and hopelessness to neighboring countries may become difficult to stop. Nominally voluntary exile, arguably, is the policy of the Israeli far right. And while it won’t be easy, time is on their side.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">A campaign of state terror</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What we are witnessing is state terror, committed on all sides throughout the Levant, limited only by the combatants’ greatly differing capacities. To terrorize, one must necessarily practice wanton disregard for civilian casualties. For Israel, such willful indifference to suffering carries the risk of joining its adversaries as an international pariah. But Israelis are discovering that its pariah status, unlike for its enemies, carries few practical consequences when balanced, as it is, with <a href="https://globalaffairs.org/bluemarble/how-us-has-used-its-power-un-support-israel-decades">unblinking American support</a>.<br><br>The American reaction to Israel&#8217;s stunning but bloody military success is utterly predictable. Exultant Republicans are claiming vindication for their unembarrassed support of Israel’s merciless military strategy. As for the fate of Palestinians, former President Donald Trump has <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-i-told-netanyahu-get-your-victory-quickly-because-the-killing-has-to-stop/">already articulated</a> what we can anticipate to be his baseline policy, albeit one tinged with an amoral regard for PR optics:&nbsp;Do whatever you feel you must, “but get it over with fast.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democrats, despite their discomfort with the civilian casualties on the ground, will nonetheless <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/01/democratic-voters-kamala-harris-palestinians">uphold their traditional policy</a> of steadfast political and military support of Israel. They may feel differently, and they are acutely aware of the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-generation-gap-in-opinions-toward-israel/">significant generational drift</a> in American attitudes toward Israel and Zionism, particularly on the left. For now, political realities remain unchanged: Israel can still <a href="https://apnews.com/article/netanyahu-congress-gaza-hamas-israel-6ea5daf3cd1988b0ad6e874bd450f9bf">command more support</a> in Congress than any American president of either party could ever hope to.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vice President Kamala Harris, however she may betray humanitarian sentiment, would follow the example of President Barack Obama before her: She will not sacrifice precious political capital and her entire legislative agenda on the altar of a two-state policy gambit that has zero prospect of success. The toll of Palestinian casualties <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/5/2/24147192/israel-palestine-student-protest-columbia-ucla-radicalism">brought out mass protests</a> in the US and may continue to do so, but they have yet to meaningfully change US policy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Sunni Arab states, led by Saudi Arabia, have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/02/normalisation-of-saudi-arabia-israel-relations-depends-on-two-state-solution">paused</a> the diplomatic efforts that might otherwise by now have resulted in a historic rapprochement with Israel, but this should be seen as little more than a hiatus in deference to domestic political optics.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Human emotions aside, the <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/unlike-past-arab-israeli-conflicts-arab-governments-pursue-diplomacy-while-iran-proxies-fight/7807615.html">geopolitical interests</a> driving a de facto Saudi alliance with Israel remain in play. Generational change in Gulf country leadership has brought with it relative indifference to the Palestinian cause. Memories of crushed children and wailing mothers will soon fade when the media turns away. Compelling national interests in confronting the shared enemy, Iran, and promoting high-tech Israeli investment will prevail.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even as we look ahead to a time when Israel’s Shiite antagonists are again ready to engage, there may be little left to fight over. Nothing is so persuasive, or so deflating, as immutable facts on the ground. For those in the “axis of resistance,” the deepening hatred of Israel generated by the events of the last year will seethe for at least another generation. Even if the threat they pose to Israel is never existential, it ensures that Israelis will not be able to rest easy. And for Israel, as the reality of apartheid over the Palestinians becomes undeniable, it will gnaw at the national soul. For now, however much we may like to think otherwise, in our time as much as at any time in human history, might — for those ruthless enough to exercise it — still wins in the end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Workers at ports on the East and Gulf Coasts have agreed to go back to the docks —&nbsp;at least for now. Dock workers with the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA) went on strike Tuesday following a breakdown in negotiations between the ILA and the organization of international shipping companies that employ them. Now, they are back to work as negotiations on a new contract continue. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Approximately 45,000 workers walked off the job at 12:01 am Tuesday, making it the most significant strike the union <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/dockworkers-at-port-of-ny-and-nj-go-on-strike-for-first-time-since-1977">has engaged in since 1977</a>. ILA laborers stopped work after their six-year contract with the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX) expired, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/east-coast-port-strike-what-to-know/">shutting down 14 ports</a>, including some of the country’s largest. That could have had a monumental impact on the US economy, with a weeks-long strike bringing higher prices and goods shortages ahead of the presidential election and holiday season. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The striking workers shut down some of the country’s biggest ports, like the <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/dockworkers-at-port-of-ny-and-nj-go-on-strike-for-first-time-since-1977">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</a>. Overall, the affected ports handle about 50 percent of the imports and exports to the US.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The pause in the strike is an opportunity for the ILA and USMX to come back to the bargaining table and try to negotiate a new six-year contract. Workers will be covered by their old contract <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/port-strike-ends-tentative-deal-until-jan-15-dockworkers/">until next January</a>, though the two sides have <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/port-strike-ends-tentative-deal-until-jan-15-dockworkers/">apparently made progress on a wage hike</a>: The dockworkers have <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/dockworkers-strike-suspended-sources/story?id=114445386">reportedly secured a 62 percent raise</a> over the course of the new contract. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the </strong>International Longshoremen’s Association? Why are its members <strong>striking?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The ILA represents the approximately 45,000 workers who manage the unloading of massive shipping containers from large cargo ships. Eventually, inventory from the ships makes its way to warehouses, store shelves, and factories. The members work at ports up and down the East Coast as far north as Maine, as well as Gulf Coast ports in Louisiana and Texas.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There&#8217;s a strike over two main issues,” Art Wheaton, director of labor studies at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said. “One is money. Two is technology.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The union has demanded a significant pay raise for dock workers over the six-year life of the contract, as well as increased contributions to their retirement plan and a say in the role of automation in their industry. Some reports indicate the union asked for as much <a href="https://apnews.com/article/longshoremen-strike-pay-automation-ports-jobs-consumers-3aa66e0a05db25a49645fad404a5f000">as a 77 percent pay increase</a>; the most recent proposal from USMX offered a 50 percent increase over the life of the contract.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The biggest concern is, the dock workers do not want automated machines to be responsible for picking up, dropping off, and releasing the cargo automatically,” Wheaton said. “They would like to have a human operator there” to ensure the quality and safety of their operations — and job security.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Negotiations between USMX and ILA for a new contract stopped in June, reportedly over the use of <a href="https://mynbc15.com/news/local/hundreds-of-mobile-dockworkers-set-to-go-on-strike">automation at a port in Mobile, Alabama</a>. USMX filed a complaint with the National Labor Review Board last week claiming that ILA refused to continue with contract negotiations. USMX did not respond to Vox’s request for comment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Shipping companies that compose USMX —&nbsp;all of which are based abroad —&nbsp;have made billions as global trade and shipping has boomed, the union argues, while worker wages have stagnated in the face of inflation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dock workers on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/business/economy/port-strike-economy.html">West Coast make about $55 per hour compared</a> with the East and Gulf Coast <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/01/business/us-port-workers-strike-tuesday/index.html">average of $39 per hour</a> for experienced workers. West Coast dockworkers received an impressive <a href="https://www.portoflosangeles.org/references/2023-news-releases/news_083123_ilwu_contract">wage increase</a> in their most recent contract<a href="https://www.portoflosangeles.org/references/2023-news-releases/news_083123_ilwu_contract">;</a> they belong to a different union, the International Longshoremen and Warehouse Union (ILWU), which has long been much more radical than the ILA in terms of its politics, demands, and tactics, according to Gabe Winant, a labor historian at the University of Chicago.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the ILWU workers’ big wage wins proved that it was possible to demand more — and get it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, the ILA hopes to achieve a similar victory.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Which goods will be impacted?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More than 50 percent of all goods <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/east-coast-port-strike-what-to-know/">imported into the US using container ships</a> come in through the East and Gulf Coast ports, and nearly 70 percent of containerized exports leave through them. However, since the potential for a strike had been well-known for months, companies had plenty of time to prepare. The most immediate casualty of the strikes would have been perishables. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We have all these perishable goods coming imported [to] the East Coast,” like blueberries, bananas, and fish from South America, Chris Tang, a professor of supply chain management at UCLA, told Vox. “We also have apparel, toys, electronics, we import through the East Coast.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The automotive industry also depends on East Coast ports, as many cars and car parts are imported from Europe. “There’s still some inventories available in the car manufacturing, and as well as the car dealers, so in the short term, it is not a major impact,” Tang said. Under a prolonged strike, that inventory will run out, and car repairs could become more challenging as parts shipments are delayed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition to the strike, there are other factors affecting global shipping at the moment, including <a href="https://www.vox.com/videos/24113479/what-the-red-sea-ship-attacks-are-really-about">Houthi attacks in the Red Sea</a> that have disrupted shipping since November of last year, as has <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/374867/hurricane-helene">extreme weather</a>. The Panama Canal has also been impacted independent of the strikes; the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/business/panama-canal-drought.html">waterway is suffering from a drought</a>, which has created a shipping backlog there.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“As anyone who tried to buy toilet paper during the pandemic can tell you, we have a delicate supply chain, and when you start messing with the cargo ships, the rail, and the semi trucks, you&#8217;re toast,” Wheaton said. “You just aren&#8217;t going to get anything moved. Add to that that you just had a huge chunk of the East Coast get buried in water from the hurricane that just went through.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How might the dockworker’s strike end?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The progress on negotiations is a positive sign. The two sides agreed on January 15, 2025, deadline for finalizing a new contract, which gives them a cushion to negotiate on outstanding issues, namely the role of automation at the ports and an increase in pension contributions.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given the enormity of the potential fallout from the strike, there was some question of whether President Joe Biden would order dockworkers back to the ports for 80 days as USMX and the ILA continue contract negotiations through powers granted by the Taft-Hartley Act —&nbsp;something Biden said <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/01/biden-administration-dockworker-strike-00181839">he did not want to do</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The administration faced “pressure from the consumers, from the retailers, from the manufacturers, and also the shipping companies” to take action and reopen the ports, Tang said. Some business groups had <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/01/biden-administration-dockworker-strike-00181839">already called on Biden</a> to send ILA members back to work.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Biden has also been largely supportive of union action, save the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/11/29/23484623/congress-rail-strike-biden-sick-days">2022 railway workers strike</a>, and union support has been important to <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/372935/teamsters-union-harris-biden-uaw-labor-trump-endorsement-vote">Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The official policy of the government for more than 100 years, that the best solution is a negotiated solution,” Wheaton said. “The union won&#8217;t get everything they want, management won&#8217;t get everything they want, but you sit at the bargaining table to see what both sides can live with.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">An outbreak of Marburg, a virus closely related to Ebola that can cause severe and often <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON537#:~:text=This%20is%20why%20it%20is,low%20at%20the%20global%20level.">fatal</a> disease, is <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON537">spreading</a> in Rwanda. As Africa struggles with <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/1/24/24048361/mpox-covid-outbreak-africa-cdc-public-health">compounding public health challenges</a>, this one presents a rare silver lining: the chance to test new vaccines that could save lives across the continent in the future.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first patient infected with the virus in the country died on September 8, the World Health Organization (WHO) said at a press conference Thursday. As of September 29, a total of 36 cases and 11 deaths have been reported, making it one of the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/marburg/outbreaks/index.html">largest</a> Marburg outbreaks in history. Although most infections are among health care workers from two hospitals in Kigali, the capital of the East African country, seven of Rwanda’s 30 districts have seen cases. It is the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON537">first</a> time the virus has been known to cause infections in Rwanda.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The WHO <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON537#:~:text=This%20is%20why%20it%20is,low%20at%20the%20global%20level.">indicated</a> the outbreak is highly likely to spread to neighboring countries, but the risk of further global spread is low. Typically, humans become infected when they come into contact with a Marburg-carrying Egyptian <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/marburg-virus-disease">fruit bat</a>, a species found across Africa, the Middle East, and parts of western Asia. Once a person has the virus, though, it can then spread to others through contact with bodily fluids or contaminated surfaces and materials, like clothing or bedding. This mode of transmission means that Marburg virus will not spread as easily as, say, Covid-19 or other respiratory diseases.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, as we have seen in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/marburg/outbreaks/index.html">previous</a> Marburg virus outbreaks, travelers returning from countries experiencing an outbreak can introduce the disease into their home countries. Already, <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON537">one person</a> who came into contact with an infected patient in Rwanda has traveled to Belgium, underscoring the possibility of isolated overseas cases.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Historically, Marburg virus disease is fatal in about <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON537#:~:text=This%20is%20why%20it%20is,low%20at%20the%20global%20level.">50 percent</a> of patients, but in some previous outbreaks, the mortality rate has exceeded 80 percent. People <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/marburg-virus-disease">experience</a> high fever, severe headache, extreme fatigue, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/marburg/about/index.html">rash</a>, bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/marburg-rwanda#:~:text=Marburg%20is%20a%20viral%20hemorrhagic,Marburg%20virus%20is%20often%20fatal.">unexplained bruising</a> and bleeding from the nose and gums. Symptoms can appear anywhere from <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON537#:~:text=Burial%20ceremonies%20that%20involve%20direct,severe%20headache%20and%20severe%20malaise.">2 to 21 days</a> after the initial infection.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/marburg/outbreaks/index.html">previous</a> Marburg virus outbreaks have occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, most recently in Tanzania, where there were <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/marburg/outbreaks/marburg-virus-disease-outbreak-linked-to-marburgvirus-in-tanzania.html">eight</a> confirmed cases and five deaths, and in Equatorial Guinea, where there were <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/marburg/outbreaks/marburg-virus-disease-outbreak-linked-to-marburgvirus-in-equatorial-guinea.html">16 confirmed cases</a> and 12 deaths; both outbreaks occurred in 2023. Between 1967 and 2008, the US, Germany, Yugoslavia, and the Netherlands have reported Marburg disease among travelers returning from Uganda.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To date, there is no approved treatment or vaccine for Marburg virus disease, but there are at least <a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/blue-print/who-tag-cvp-report-marburg-trial-for-tag-cvp-review.pdf?sfvrsn=49e8c1ad_6&amp;download=true">four</a> vaccines in development. All four have been <a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/blue-print/who-tag-cvp-report-marburg-trial-for-tag-cvp-review.pdf?sfvrsn=49e8c1ad_6&amp;download=true">effective</a> in studies involving animals. A small, early-stage clinical <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)02400-X/abstract">trial</a> in humans had promising results; however, study participants who received the Marburg vaccine were not exposed to the virus to test how protective the shot was. Two other <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/marburg-virus-disease">vaccines</a> for Ebola virus could also be effective against Marburg virus.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Researchers in Rwanda are preparing to submit protocols for phase 3 trials to a Rwandan ethics committee for approval. This would be an opportunity to expedite the development of Marburg virus vaccines and treatments and perform larger trials in a real-world outbreak.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the trial moves forward quickly, the current crisis could allow scientists to identify a shot that protects millions of people in the years to come.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The slim vaccine silver lining</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The WHO, Rwandan public health officials, and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1010805">a group of scientists and institutes</a> working on vaccine research <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03218-3">met</a> earlier this week to discuss quickly setting up a vaccine trial that could help quell the ongoing outbreak.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of the vaccine candidates being developed, the most promising one that seems most likely to be tested if a trial moved ahead in Rwanda is the cAd3-Marburg vaccine developed by the National <a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/">Institute</a> of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Last year, the NIAID tested the vaccine for safety in humans for the first time in a phase 1 clinical <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)02400-X/abstract">trial</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Forty healthy adults received one of two different doses of the vaccine and were monitored for adverse reactions and to see if their immune systems produced antibodies, an indication that the vaccine would be effective if the individuals were exposed to the virus. The vaccine was deemed safe, and 95 percent of the participants had developed antibodies four weeks after receiving it. However, the participants were never exposed to the virus, so the vaccine’s practical effectiveness was not evaluated.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Earlier this year, the <a href="https://www.sabin.org/">Sabin Vaccine Institute</a> started a <a href="https://www.sabin.org/resources/sabin-vaccine-institute-begins-phase-2-clinical-trial-for-marburg-vaccine-in-uganda/">phase 2</a> clinical <a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05817422?cond=Marburg%20Virus%20Disease&amp;term=Sabin&amp;rank=1">trial</a> for the NIAID vaccine in Uganda and Kenya. Healthy adults will randomly be assigned to receive the vaccine or a placebo shot and then will again be monitored for adverse responses and antibody responses. Participants will also not be exposed to the Marburg virus during this trial.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Typically, if phase 2 trials are successful, scientists proceed to larger phase 3 trials and roll out the vaccine to a large group of people and then observe its impact when individuals are exposed to the virus. The emergency situation in Rwanda may accelerate this process. Scientists may move ahead with a phase 3 trial even though phase 2 results are not yet available.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Researchers and health officials have been preparing for this. Earlier this year, scientists from the WHO and 17 countries at risk for Marburg virus outbreaks developed <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/events/detail/2024/02/20/default-calendar/building-research-readiness-for-a-future-filovirus-outbreak-workshop-february-20-22-2024-uganda">protocols</a> to test both <a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/consultation-rdb/vx-discussion_martha-nason_who-filovirus-workshop-key-analyses-and-endpoints.pdf?sfvrsn=fccf158_3">vaccines</a> and treatments during an outbreak. A phase 3 clinical trial in Rwanda would follow a ring vaccination strategy where contacts of infected people are vaccinated. The trial would have two groups, one group of contacts who are immediately vaccinated and then a second “delayed” group who are presumably vaccinated at a later time. Researchers would then compare the impact of the vaccine between the two groups.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Scientists may also test a treatment that uses antibodies, proteins made by the immune system to kill viruses and other pathogens, against the virus. One <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5719873/">study</a> found that treating animals such as guinea pigs and monkeys with these antibodies after they were infected with Marburg virus prevented serious illness and death. Medical workers successfully treated patients with antibody <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(23)00552-2/fulltext">cocktails</a> during previous Ebola virus outbreaks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The WHO’s ethics committee has already approved protocols to test vaccines and the antibody treatment, a spokesperson told Vox. The next step is for these protocols to be approved by an ethics committee within Rwanda. Two Rwandan researchers have been selected to lead these efforts in the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One other hurdle remains. There are fewer than <a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/blue-print/who-tag-cvp-report-marburg-trial-for-tag-cvp-review.pdf?sfvrsn=49e8c1ad_6&amp;download=true">2,000</a> total vaccine doses currently available. In April 2023, the Sabin Vaccine Institute had produced about 850 of those doses. Oxford University, which is developing another Marburg vaccine, had about 1,000 doses. Larger-scale production could be needed, especially if the outbreak becomes more widespread. Both the Sabin Vaccine Institute and Oxford University have existing manufacturing capacity for the Marburg vaccines and previously reported to the WHO that they could rapidly produce additional doses.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Marburg outbreak has ignited amid a surging mpox outbreak in the region, which the World Health Organization <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/14-08-2024-who-director-general-declares-mpox-outbreak-a-public-health-emergency-of-international-concern">declared</a> an international health emergency in August. The Democratic Republic of the Congo, which neighbors Rwanda, is the <a href="https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/mpx_global/">epicenter</a> of the mpox outbreak. (The DRC has not yet recorded any Marburg cases.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fortunately, Rwanda has one of the <a href="https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/rwandas-health-care-success-holds-lessons-others">strongest</a> public health systems in Africa and has only reported a handful of mpox cases. An estimated <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10926934/">90 percent</a> of the population have health insurance, much higher than most of its neighbors. Rwanda also has a strong infectious disease surveillance <a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/lessons-rwanda-building-systems-protect-against-infectious-diseases-and-biothreats">system</a> and a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771424001800">history</a> of successfully containing outbreaks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That makes it an ideal setting for testing a Marburg vaccine during the current outbreak —&nbsp;if public health authorities can move quickly. The race is on.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While Virginia is reportedly for lovers, most everyone acknowledges that nearby Washington, DC, is not. The nation’s capital has been <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2015/08/27/why-the-dating-scene-sucks-for-women-in-dc/">consistently</a> ranked as one of <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/dc-disaster-dates-slide-into-our-dms-and-tell-us-your-funny-or-awkward-date-story/3531324/">the worst</a> places <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/04/03/dating-in-washington-is-really-hard-is-it-d-c-or-is-it-me/">to date</a> and one of the US’s <a href="https://wtop.com/news/2014/02/dc-is-second-worst-city-for-singles/">worst cities for singles</a>. Too many type As, too many people too into their jobs, too many people ready to leave after two years — it’s not exactly a city that screams romance. They say that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/08/modern-politics-show-business-for-ugly-people">politics is show business for ugly people</a>, which would make DC the Hollywood of uggos.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given Washington’s notoriety, it was only a matter of time before Netflix took <em>Love Is Blind</em> to the nation’s capital.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In its first season, the Netflix reality dating series asserted the hopefulness of romance — the possibility of falling in love with someone sight unseen and marrying them within a month — but it has become a show about <a href="https://www.vox.com/22958499/love-is-blind-season-2-recap-review">irreparable incompatibility</a> featuring terrifying tales of <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2023/9/22/23885294/love-is-blind-season-5-review-uche-villain">red flag-waving monsters</a>. There have also been <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2024/01/04/renee-poche-love-is-blind-netflix-lawsuit/72101776007/">lawsuits from contestants</a> alleging toxic and inhospitable <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/05/27/is-love-is-blind-a-toxic-workplace">workplace environments</a> in and out of the “<a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/love-is-blind-pods">pods</a>.” Yet the love experiment is one of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryroeloffs/2024/04/16/love-is-blind-most-popular-streaming-show-netflix-the-gentlemen-avatar-brooklyn-99-bluey/">Netflix’s biggest hits</a>, and each season a captive audience tunes in to see a new batch of daters and the horrors — body shaming, weaponized therapy speak, flies in toilets — that await them on the other side of the wall.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/Love_Is_Blind_n_S7_E1_00_23_01_22RC.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4383212962771,100,93.123357407446" alt="A group of women in colorful dresses gather in a beige living area and raise glasses of wine to each other in a large circle." title="A group of women in colorful dresses gather in a beige living area and raise glasses of wine to each other in a large circle." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Let’s go girls! Time to talk to faceless men! | Courtesy of Netflix" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Netflix" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Now we have what sounds like a perfect, hellish match: one of the worst dating cities in the US, combined with one of the bleakest reality TV dating shows in history. On paper, it feels more like a dare or taunt, a gift to haters. Truly only the freakiest freaks, some real District of Columbia sickos would sign up to be on <em>Love Is Blind: DC</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But while this immensely watchable season has plenty of villains and inter-crossing love triangles, it, sadly, doesn’t feel very DC.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For one thing, no one on this season explicitly works in government. To be fair, the show isn’t very specific when it comes to its participants’ professions, so an “IT specialist” could ostensibly be working for some military government contractor and an “engineer” could be doing research for, say, Lockheed-Martin. Still, the closest we get is a cast member being described as a “policy advocate,” which seems like a nice euphemism for lobbyist.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Capitol Hill keeping their employees from representing on <em>Love Is Blind</em> is understandable because of how embarrassingly and negatively many of the participants are portrayed. But that dynamic of an adjacency to national political power fueling a person’s dating identity is exactly what makes DC dating unique and (from all these news stories about people who hate dating there) so hostile. That the show spent a season in DC and couldn’t capture the snobbiness of a staffer asking “Who do you work for?” feels like a loss.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There seems to be a reluctance to get into politics this season, too. A contestant talks about how he voted in the 2016 and 2020 elections, and there’s a conversation about what kind of political beliefs one has while serving in the military, but politics as they relate to dating preferences  — e.g., whether love trumps politics, whether similar politics mean compatibility, etc. — is barely addressed. That’s a missed opportunity, not only given how politically active DC allegedly is, but also because finding partners who share the same politics has increasingly become <a href="https://thehill.com/changing-america/enrichment/arts-culture/3917348-politics-are-increasingly-a-dating-dealbreaker-especially-for-women/">more and more important</a> to singles. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, there’s still enough relationship dysfunction this season to sustain its horror-junkie audience.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Brittany, a beautiful woman who wants to be a trophy wife and tells the camera she cannot spell the word “physicist,” falls for Leo, a young art dealer who tells everyone that one of his insecurities is that he inherited a humongous amount of money and never has to worry about anything financially. The more the audience gets to know Leo, the more it seems like this isn’t an insecurity at all. The more Brittany gets to know Leo, the more interested she is in his “insecurity.”&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/Love_Is_Blind_n_S7_E1_00_22_59_12RC.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4383212962771,100,93.123357407446" alt="A group of men sit and stand around a long table, all dressed in suits or business casual, raising wine glasses to each other." title="A group of men sit and stand around a long table, all dressed in suits or business casual, raising wine glasses to each other." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="The dudes from Love Is Blind | Courtesy of Netflix" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Netflix" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s also Hannah, a 26-year-old woman who quit her “dream job” to be on the show. The dream job in question? Medical device sales. Perhaps there is honor and allure in, say, the vending of CPAP machine accessories, but she’s given it all up for the possibility of sight-unseen reality TV love. To that end, she tells Nick, one of her pod suitors, that she dates athletes and she’s always worried that men only see her as a hot girl. Nick tells her he looks like a less buff Henry Cavill. Neither is setting themselves up to overdeliver.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hannah, Nick, Leo, Brittany and their cohort deliver a season draped in red flags and dealbreakers. From chilling fights about yapping too much to roundabout conversations about getting the ick from watching your partner straddle patio furniture, there’s plenty here. If you’re coupled, they’ll make you breathe a sigh of relief that you’re not in the dating pool. If you’re single, they’ll make you relish it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Love Is Blind </em>is still a riveting, deranged exploration of the worst people falling in and out of love, even if it doesn’t feel like DC.&nbsp;</p>

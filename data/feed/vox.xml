<p class="has-text-align-none">“I’m really tired of being called a protectionist,” <a href="https://ustr.gov/about-us/biographies-key-officials/katherine-tai-ambassador">Katherine Tai</a>, President Joe Biden’s trade representative and a leading architect of his confrontational economic approach to China, told me on Monday.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given what Biden’s opponent has been saying lately, I empathize. Former President Donald Trump reportedly told Republican lawmakers he wants <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/13/trump-all-tariff-policy-to-replace-income-tax.html">an “all tariff” policy</a>, in which all federal taxes would be replaced with taxes on imports. In the near term, Trump has <a href="https://time.com/6972022/donald-trump-transcript-2024-election/">committed to a 10 percent tariff</a> on all imports from any country. Next to proposals like that — which would explode consumer prices and make the tax code far more regressive — Biden and Tai sound like free-traders.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But compared to the bipartisan consensus that prevailed until Trump took office, I think “protectionist” is fair. Tai and Biden have continued many of Trump’s tariffs from his term, <a href="https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2022/december/statement-ustr-spokesperson-adam-hodge">in defiance of World Trade Organization (WTO) rebukes</a>. This spring saw a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/14/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-action-to-protect-american-workers-and-businesses-from-chinas-unfair-trade-practices/">flurry of new Biden tariffs targeting China</a>, most notably hitting electric vehicles and batteries.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tai and the administration see themselves as charting a new course, reversing anti-worker trade policies of the past. “We have shunted workers to the side,” Tai told my colleague and <em>Today, Explained</em> host Noel King, “and we need a domestic and international economic policy that champions the interests of our people.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But was the previous era really so bad? And are the Biden administration’s policies helping matters?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Global trade helped the poor catch up</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From the perspective of humanity as a whole, the period of hyper-globalization starting in 1990 was kind of miraculous. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030438782100064X">Growth rates in poor countries have sped up markedly</a>, and economists have found they were gradually “converging” toward rich countries. This era saw <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/the-share-and-number-of-people-living-in-extreme-poverty">dramatic reductions in extreme poverty</a>, especially but not solely in China.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For manufacturing workers in rich countries, however, the consequences were grim. Regions and industries in the US exposed to competition from Chinese imports saw <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20131578">declining employment</a>, <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-economics-080315-015041">lower lifetime incomes</a>, and even <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20180396">higher drug overdoses</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, <a href="https://bigdatachina.csis.org/the-china-shock-reevaluating-the-debate/">researchers</a>, including <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/on-the-persistence-of-the-china-shock/">those who identified some of the biggest costs of the “China shock,”</a> have found that the US as a whole benefited from trade with China, albeit modestly. Chinese imports lowered the cost of goods, which raises living standards for poor people in particular, given <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/02/13/low-income-high-inflation-inequality/">how much more they have to spend on consumer goods</a> as a share of their income than the well-off.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We could preserve the gains from globalization to both the world and the US while addressing its very real costs by combining open trade with more assistance to workers displaced in the process, such as through the <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5acbd8e736099b27ba4cfb36/t/5be07a4140ec9a642e20aa70/1541438026120/Hyman_TAA_Latest.pdf">successful Trade Adjustment Assistance program</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, <a href="https://www.salon.com/2016/04/21/elites_are_clueless_on_trade_paul_krugman_cant_connect_the_dots_of_his_own_analysis_partner/">critics have long contended</a> that the redistribution offered to those who’ve lost out has been, in practice, far too limited.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s fed a desire for a more confrontational attitude toward exporters like China, culminating in the tariffs adopted by Trump and largely continued by Biden.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Trump tariffs didn’t work</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In her interview with Vox, Ambassador Tai contended that consumers do not necessarily wind up paying the cost of high tariffs. “When we have started looking back at the last five and six years of prices in the United States, you did not see an automatic increase in prices as a result of tariffs,” she told King. After all, the companies that import goods could simply choose not to pass along the cost of tariffs to their customers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Except, in reality, they always <em>do</em> pass along the cost. At least <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.33.4.187">four</a> <a href="https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/135/1/1/5626442">different</a> <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20190611">high-quality</a> <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20190536">studies</a> have looked at the Trump tariffs. All have found “complete” or “almost complete” passthrough: that is, the tariffs were paid for entirely or almost entirely by US consumers in the form of higher prices. Make no mistake: US consumers pay for tariffs we impose.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, <a href="https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2024-01/Help%20for%20the%20Heartland%20-%20The%20Employment%20and%20Electoral%20Effects%20of%20the%20Trump%20Tariffs%20in%20the%20United%20States.pdf">Trump’s tariffs did not succeed in creating jobs in the US</a>. They did, however, destroy jobs in agriculture by prompting China to retaliate with its own tariffs, particularly on soybeans and cotton. It’s not clear to me that Biden’s tariff regime will be any more successful at preserving or adding jobs in sectors like battery and auto manufacturing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even though they were an economic dud,&nbsp; the researchers found the tariffs were a political success. Areas protected by Trump’s tariffs were more likely to vote for him in 2020.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though Tai certainly believes in tariffs against China on the merits, you don’t have to be a total cynic to wonder how much political factors are driving the Biden administration’s tariff policy too.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Trade and the world order</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tai has also continued the Trump policy of <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/93024/its-time-for-the-united-states-to-end-its-bipartisan-attack-on-the-wto/">obstructing appointments to the WTO’s appeals board</a>, and spent much of our interview criticizing the global trade body for inadequately fighting China’s own protectionist policies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She and her team have been <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/commentary/transcript/us-trade-representative-katherine-tai-transatlantic-trade/">talking a lot</a> about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Trade_Organization">International Trade Organization</a>, a never-created agency floated 80 years ago by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. They see it as a more pro-worker, pro-environment, and anti-monopoly vision of what international cooperation on trade might look like. FDR, Tai told me, understood the power of “market-based economies coming together to fend off the challenges of fascism on the right and communism on the left.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As an economic history nerd, I find discussions about FDR’s trade philosophy fascinating, but I did not expect to have one with a White House Cabinet member in 2024. We don’t have an ITO because the <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/blogs-and-reviews/protectionism-nothing-new-republicans">US Congress</a> blocked it in 1950. If you look through the <a href="https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/havana_e.pdf">institution’s charter</a>, which Tai is right to say includes a lot of tough anti-monopoly and labor rights language, “a lot of it is not something the US Congress would ever sign up for,” <a href="https://www.cfr.org/expert/inu-manak">Inu Manak</a>, a trade policy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tai is surely thinking about China when she invokes the dream of an organization uniting “market-based economies” against fascism and communism. But at the same time she is defending <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/section-232-tariffs-steel-aluminum-2024/">tariffs on steel and aluminum</a> that apply to almost all countries, not just China.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Biden administration’s <a href="https://www.cato.org/commentary/bye-america">Buy American provisions</a> hurt allies like South Korea too, and Biden is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-china-steel-tariffs-union-workers-0399b0450b67086ca86edc43ac45e5e9">opposing a Japanese company’s effort to purchase US Steel</a>. Is this really just about China, or a more general (here’s that word Tai hates again) protectionist turn?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I hope I’m wrong. Tai has expressed <a href="https://agoa.info/news/article/16376-remarks-by-ambassador-katherine-tai-at-the-closing-ceremony-of-the-20th-agoa-forum.html">strong support for US trade preferences toward Africa</a>, which gives me some optimism that the new paradigm she represents will treat poor countries fairly. But so far, the new trade approach is mostly reminding me of how much we gained from the old one — and how much we might lose by abandoning it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President Joe Biden’s economic record is a bit like a certain orange-hued ex-president: It’s perpetually on trial.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For years, politicians and commentators have been arguing over the merits of the Biden-era economy. And the question of whether Americans have prospered under the president’s watch is certain to feature prominently in his Thursday night debate with Donald Trump.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The answer to that question, though, may ultimately hinge on which Americans we’re talking about. Any set of economic policies and developments will inevitably impact different sectors, workers, and regions differently. Some Americans are indisputably better off today than they were in January 2021. Others are not.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Specifically, the real winners of the Biden economy have been 24-year-old student debtors who lost their jobs during the pandemic and now work in hospitality, own a house in Tampa Bay, Florida, live in Minneapolis, have savings in an S&amp;P 500 index fund, lease an electric vehicle, and hate fast food.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is not to say that only people who fit that elaborate description have prospered since January 2021. But the closer an American comes to possessing that odd assortment of characteristics, the more likely they are to have benefited from virtually all of the Biden era’s major economic changes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To see why this is the case, consider seven ways that the US economy has changed under Biden.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">1) <strong>Unemployment rapidly fell</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Joe Biden took office, America’s unemployment rate sat at 6.4 percent. By the end of his first year in the White House, it had fallen to 3.9 percent, roughly equal to its pre-pandemic level.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The pace of this labor market recovery was extraordinary. After the Great Recession of the late aughts, unemployment didn’t return to its pre-crisis level for more than nine years. After the Covid recession, unemployment returned to its pre-pandemic mark in just two.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Like most features of the Biden-era economy, the president cannot claim full responsibility for this development. In 2020, the Trump administration and the House’s Democratic leadership united behind <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/7/7/21308450/extra-600-unemployment-stimulus-expiring-cares-act">historically robust relief spending</a> that laid the foundation for a swift recovery.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Biden’s policies accelerated job growth. And this was no accident. The White House chose to prioritize rapidly restoring full employment over minimizing the risk of inflation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To appreciate how big a premium Biden put on a speedy labor market recovery, consider the state of the economy in early 2021. By the time his American Rescue Plan was drafted, US households <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/u-s-households-net-worth-hit-130-trillion-in-2020-51615543202">were already $12 trillion wealthier</a> than they had been before the pandemic, and boasted <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/americans-are-sitting-on-a-lot-of-spare-cash-it-may-not-boost-growth-as-much-as-youd-think-51614366901">more disposable income</a> and less debt than they did at the peak of the Trump-era expansion. Unemployment was already recovering at a healthy pace.</p>

</ul>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The administration could have looked at this state of affairs and concluded that only a modest additional Covid relief bill was warranted. After all, the unemployment rate was 2 full points lower in March 2021 than it had been in February 2009, when President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats authorized only $787 billion of stimulus spending.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, Biden proposed a <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/3/10/22320350/biden-sign-stimulus-bill-covid-19">$1.9 trillion relief bill</a>, including $1,400 checks for most Americans, enhanced unemployment benefits, and a <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/8/30/23317834/child-tax-credit-ctc-ira">temporary child allowance</a> for most families, among myriad other economically stimulative measures. This injection of cash into Americans’ bank accounts boosted consumer spending and, thus, job growth.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is impossible to know exactly how much that legislation contributed to Biden-era inflation. In hindsight, it’s clear that the economy’s reopening was all but certain to trigger an inflationary surge, no matter what Biden did in office. After all, developed countries the world over witnessed historically large bursts of inflation in 2021 and 2022, despite enacting significantly less fiscal stimulus than the United States.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Regardless, America bought itself considerable economic benefits with all that relief spending. The Biden-era US did not suffer significantly higher inflation than the European Union, but it did enjoy a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7240265e-0157-428b-9c47-fb07c360dfc2">much stronger rate of economic growth</a>. As Martin Sanbu noted in Financial Times, in 2023, the US economy was only 1 to 2 percent smaller than it would have been had its pre-pandemic economic trajectory continued uninterrupted; the European economy, by contrast, finished the year 5 percent below its pre-pandemic trend.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This said, it’s undoubtedly true that Biden’s fiscal policy centered the interests of the unemployed, at the cost of somewhat higher inflation.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">2) <strong>Real wages rose sharply for young workers, especially in low-wage sectors</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The question of whether American workers as a whole are better off now than they were when Biden took office is a complicated one. By conventional measures, <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LES1252881600Q">real weekly earnings</a> — which is to say, earnings after inflation is taken into account — are about 2 percent lower today than they were when Biden took office.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But that figure is misleading. The Labor Department’s wage data measures median pay among Americans who have jobs at a given moment in time. For this reason, changes in the composition of the labor force can raise or lower “real weekly earnings,” even if no single worker in the economy has actually received a raise or pay cut. For example, if companies throughout the economy lay off a bunch of their lowest-paid workers, then real wages will rise, even if pay for all remaining employees remains the same.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And something roughly like this happens in every recession: Low-wage workers are the first to be fired and last to be rehired. Thus, real weekly earnings skyrocketed at the start of the pandemic, even though very few employers were actually increasing worker pay in the middle of a recession. Conversely, as low-wage workers regained their jobs during Biden’s first year in office, real weekly earnings appeared to fall — even before inflation took off — merely because the composition of the workforce was changing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A better measure of wage trends comes from the Atlanta Federal Reserve. The central bank <a href="https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker?panel=2">tracks the wages</a> of the same individual US workers over time. And as the labor economist Aaron Sojourner has shown, the Atlanta Fed’s data <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aaronsojourner.org/post/3kl6dqnvcph2w">suggests</a> that average hourly wages have grown by more than consumer prices since Biden took office.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, no measure of real wages is perfect. And once the impact of interest rates is taken into account, the picture can get a bit murky.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But such ambiguity disappears for certain subsets of the labor force. For example, American workers under 25 have <a href="https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker">seen their wages soar</a> during the Biden era. Wages for US workers between the ages of 16 and 24 were growing at a 7.3 percent rate in January 2021, according to the Atlanta Fed. By October 2022, young workers’ wages were rising at a 13 percent clip, and were still advancing by an 8.6 percent rate in March of this year. In other words, throughout the Biden presidency, young workers’ wages have grown much faster than prices.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similarly, workers in the bottom 25 percent of America’s income distribution have seen much stronger wage growth than higher earners, according to the Atlanta Fed’s data. And this trend is also reflected in data on wages in America’s leisure and hospitality industry, the nation’s lowest-paid sector. Even using the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CES7000000003">Labor Department’s data</a> (which likely underestimates wage growth due to the compositional issues mentioned above), pay for hospitality workers has far outpaced inflation during Biden’s time in office.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By contrast, workers in the top quarter of America’s income distribution, and those over age 55, have seen exceptionally slow rates of income growth in the Biden era. Taken together, these trends translate into a steep reduction in pay inequality.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">3) <strong>Homeowners prospered (at renters’ expense)</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Biden era has been a great time to own a home, but a lousy one to buy or rent a residence. Between the president’s inauguration and this May, the typical home price in the United States increased by 46.6 percent, according to Zillow’s <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FLUCSFRCONDOSMSAMID">home value index</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One person’s rising home value is another’s declining affordability. And for would-be homebuyers, the burden of high home prices has been compounded by a rapid jump in mortgage rates. When Biden took office, <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MORTGAGE30US">the average rate</a> on a 30-year fixed mortgage was 2.77 percent; today, that figure is closer to 7 percent. As a result, the median monthly mortgage payment jumped by roughly 50 percent between 2021 and 2023, according to an analysis from <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/average-monthly-mortgage-payment/#by-loan-type">Bank Rate</a>, a financial services company.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The president does not set interest rates. The Federal Reserve determines borrowing costs. Yet the central bank hiked rates in recent years in response to rising inflation (by increasing borrowing costs, the Fed aims to discourage debt-financed spending and investment, which theoretically slows the growth of prices). Therefore, to the extent that Biden’s fiscal policies contributed to inflation, he bears partial responsibility for rising interest rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, rents have soared. Since Biden took office, the average rent in a US city increased by roughly 21 percent, <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CUUR0000SEHA">according to</a> the Bureau of Labor Statistics.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, trends in shelter costs vary widely by location. In the Biden era, rents and home prices have risen especially rapidly in the Sun Belt region. Between January 2021 and March 2024, home prices in Tampa Bay, Florida, surged by roughly <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TPXRSA">51 percent</a>, while those in the Phoenix metro area <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PHXRNSA">appreciated by 40 percent</a>. And rents have followed a similarly <a href="https://zillow.mediaroom.com/2024-05-07-New-York-City-rents-grew-seven-times-faster-than-wages-last-year,-tightening-affordability-crunch">steep upward trajectory</a> in both markets. By contrast, Minneapolis, Minnesota, saw only <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MNXRSA">an 18.4 percent</a> increase in home prices, and similarly modest rental inflation. In fact, according to a recent <a href="https://zillow.mediaroom.com/2024-05-07-New-York-City-rents-grew-seven-times-faster-than-wages-last-year,-tightening-affordability-crunch">analysis</a> from Zillow and Streeteasy, the typical rent in Minneapolis increased by only 13.5 percent between 2019 and 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the most part, today’s housing affordability crisis has been decades in the making and thus has little to do with Biden’s policies. Restrictions on multifamily housing construction in major US cities have prevented America’s housing stock from keeping pace with demand. Meanwhile, millennials — now America’s largest generation — have entered their prime home-buying and childrearing years en masse, ditching roommates and seeking floorspace. Add in remote work, which has led to an increase in demand for square footage as professionals prefer at-home offices, and you end up with a severe housing crunch.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The tools for alleviating that crisis exist. But they’re primarily available to local governments, which generally have sovereignty over zoning. Minneapolis relaxed restrictions on housing construction in recent years and <a href="https://www.kare11.com/article/money/twin-cities-inflation-rate-among-lowest-in-the-country/89-40f01101-c8e4-4be8-a9ad-d737fa865697">has enjoyed relatively low housing inflation</a> as a result.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">4) <strong>The stock market boomed</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As of this writing, the S&amp;P 500 is more than 42 percent higher than it was on the day Biden took office. Such growth pales a bit in comparison to that seen over the entire course of the Trump presidency, when the index grew by about 68 percent. But it still represents robust gains for investors.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s more, the Biden-era stock market rally may have an unusually large impact on the broader economy. During the Covid pandemic, Americans dedicated a <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/24159281/consumer-spending-economy-inflation-interest-rates">historically high</a> percentage of their income to savings, as public health concerns rendered vacations, dining out, and all manner of other in-person leisure activities less appealing. And many plowed those savings into the stock market: Between 2019 and 2022, the percentage of US households that owned stocks <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/stocks-americans-own-most-ever-9f6fd963">jumped by 5 points</a> to an all-time high of 58 percent.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Combine equity gains with the Biden-era appreciation in home values, and US households in general — and high-income ones in particular — have seen their net worths grow considerably in recent years. When the value of a person’s assets rises, they tend to eventually increase their spending on goods and services. The Biden-era run-up in wealth has therefore likely helped the economy weather inflation, as consumers have been able to sustain high levels of spending by drawing on their savings, home equity, and capital gains — or else, merely by telling themselves that they can afford to spend more, given how good their 401(k) is looking. Indeed, according to <a href="https://economics.td.com/us-household-wealth-props-consumer-spending#:~:text=With%20a%20range%20of%20two,spending%20over%20the%20next%20one.">an analysis</a> from TD Bank, rising wealth explains between 15 and 30 percent of the increase in American consumer spending since the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">5) <strong>The green economy swelled</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2020, the US government and private investors collectively spent $102.5 billion on the green energy transition, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-opinion-biden-accomplishment-data/#schrager-income-inequality">BloombergNEF</a>. Last year, that figure exceeded $200 billion. And when investments in the power grid are taken into account, total climate spending in 2023 hits $303 billion.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This surge in green spending is a direct consequence of Biden’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/7/28/23282217/climate-bill-health-care-drugs-inflation-reduction-act#">Inflation Reduction Act</a> (IRA), which provided generous subsidies to American producers of renewable energy and electric vehicles, among other low-carbon technologies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All Americans will theoretically benefit eventually from the green transition, which will lengthen our lives by <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/8/12/21361498/climate-change-air-pollution-us-india-china-deaths">reducing air pollution</a> and render the Earth less inhospitable for our grandchildren by curbing global warming. But the IRA’s direct beneficiaries are principally American green technology makers, Sun Belt manufacturing workers, and climate-conscious consumers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/23/red-states-are-winning-big-from-dems-climate-law-00078420">Politico noted last year</a>, most of the green energy investments spurred by the IRA have been in Republican districts, with a highly disproportionate share concentrated in the American South.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, under Biden, most Americans became eligible for a <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/23498215/ev-tax-credit-2023-heat-pumps-solar">$7,500</a> tax credit on purchases or leases of electric vehicles.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The law made a given vehicle’s eligibility for that tax credit contingent on where its various inputs were produced: To promote American manufacturing of EVs and their batteries, a certain (and steadily rising) percentage of a car’s inputs must be sourced from the US to qualify. But the eligibility requirements for purchased cars are stricter than <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/what-to-know-about-leasing-an-ev-or-phev-with-tax-credit-a3007689035/">those for leased ones</a>, so Americans who leased an electric vehicle have done especially well in the Biden era.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">6) <strong>Many student debtors saw their loan balances shrink</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden’s plan to forgive at least $10,000 in student debt for the vast majority of US borrowers was <a href="https://www.vox.com/23762367/student-loan-forgiveness-supreme-court-biden-cancellation">blocked</a> by the Supreme Court last year. But his administration has successfully executed many smaller-scale acts of forgiveness that add up to a prodigious total. As of March, the administration had canceled roughly <a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-announces-additional-77-billion-approved-student-debt-relief-160000-borrowers#:~:text=Today's%20announcement%20brings%20the%20total,approved%20for%20some%20debt%20relief.">$167 billion</a> of federal student loan debt, more than 10 percent of all such outstanding debt in the country. All together, 4.75 million borrowers have seen at least a portion of their student debt forgiven under Biden.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">7) <strong>Fast food got pricier</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Precisely because pay for hospitality workers has surged, the cost of fast food has risen sharply. Between May 2020 and May 2023, hourly compensation at American limited-service restaurants <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/2020/may/oes353023.htm">jumped</a> <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes353023.htm">by</a> 23 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the same period, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/1/9/24027094/fast-food-prices-wages-mcdonalds">fast food prices soared</a>, rising 8 percent in 2021, 6.6 percent in 2022, and 6 percent in 2023, far outpacing the overall inflation rate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tight labor markets — in which jobs are abundant and workers scarce — benefit Americans in their capacities as laborers. They give workers more bargaining power at their jobs and more freedom to ditch a bad gig without risking prolonged unemployment.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is especially valuable for workers who lack rare skills, face discrimination in the labor market, or require special accommodations. When labor markets are loose, employers can afford to pay meager wages to lower-level staffers, or pass over Black applicants, or refuse to make postings accessible to people with disabilities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When finding enough workers to satisfy customer demand is a struggle, however, firms have no choice but to pay higher wages, consider applicants of all races, and make positions accessible to a wider pool of workers. This is why the Biden era has been so good for low-wage workers. And it is also largely why the unemployment rates of <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS14000006">Black</a> and <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNU04074597">disabled</a> workers have fallen to record lows during his tenure.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But tight labor markets have less beneficial effects for consumers. Rising wages generally translate into higher prices, especially for goods and services that are labor-intensive. And strong demand for workers also means that many businesses are going to struggle with retention and hiring, and be understaffed as a result.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many consumers of fast food, child care, taxi rides, and other labor-intensive services have therefore found themselves paying more — often for lower-quality service — in the Biden era. For upper-middle-class consumers, whose educational backgrounds and special skills provide them with a modicum of bargaining power even in times of elevated unemployment, the trade-offs of tight labor markets might not be favorable.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The Biden economy works well (albeit not for everyone)</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In my view, more expensive Big Macs are a small price to pay for higher growth, more worker power, and low unemployment. And I also think that the broader strengths of the Biden economy outweigh its weaknesses.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Recovering from the pandemic was always going to be painful. Covid shuttered entire sectors of the US economy and disrupted factory production the world over. At the same time, consumers suddenly shifted their spending away from in-person services and toward manufactured goods, a development that producers weren’t prepared for.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These disruptions had unavoidable economic costs. We could have paid those costs by immiserating America’s most vulnerable workers through a prolonged period of high unemployment. Instead, under Biden, we all chipped in to pay Covid’s toll through inflation while protecting the disadvantaged. I think this was a sound decision.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But I understand why some older, high-income Americans — especially those who never lost their jobs during the pandemic, keep all their savings in cash, paid off their student debts long ago, own no home, love fossil fuels, and live off Taco Bell — might disagree.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unauthorized crossings at the US southern border soared higher and higher during the first three years of Joe Biden’s presidency.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, in the first half of 2024, they’ve fallen sharply, but they’re still significantly higher than in the decade before Biden took office.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s the basic numerical trend, according to numbers from US Customs and Border Protection (CBP). How much Biden’s policies have affected that trend is tougher to untangle, and that will likely be a major area of dispute at his debate with Donald Trump this Thursday.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The dramatic surge in unauthorized immigration in Biden’s first few years was spurred by major factors outside of the president’s control, such as the ebbing of the Covid-19 pandemic and upheaval in several Latin American countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is also plausible that Biden’s more lenient immigration stance, relative to Trump, contributed to some degree. He has tried to strike a balance between humane policies toward migrants (like offering <a href="https://apnews.com/article/immigration-biden-haiti-cuba-nicaragua-venezuela-trial-fac9dc853231ba04ff0ea4e7442057ef">new legal pathways for entry</a> or <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/biden-plans-new-policy-shielding-undocumented-spouses-us-citizens-rcna157604">protections against deportation</a> for some already here) and more hard-headed actions trying to cut down on unauthorized arrivals.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet for his first three years, the number of such arrivals remained quite high. His defenders often argued that the main drivers of immigration were not within the president’s control and that his responses were constrained by a broken legal and political process, insufficient resources, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/1/25/24050278/senate-immigration-border-ukraine-trump-mcconnell-romney">Republicans’ refusal to act</a> on legislation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The twist in recent months is that the number of unauthorized arrivals finally <a href="https://www.wola.org/analysis/why-is-migration-declining-at-the-u-s-mexico-border-in-early-2024/">has dropped</a>. “Illegal crossings at the southern border continue to plummet,” Fox News reporter Bill Melugin <a href="https://x.com/BillMelugin_/status/1805272872967090201">wrote on X this week</a>, adding that CBP was now seeing “the lowest border numbers of Biden&#8217;s presidency.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We don’t know how long those lower numbers will persist, of course, and there are still more unauthorized migrants arriving than was typical in the Obama or Trump years. But it’s a notable change, and it’s worth digging into why it appears to have happened.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Unauthorized immigration did soar during Biden’s term. Was it due to Biden’s policies?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There really was a major unauthorized migration surge under Biden. For most of the decade before he took office, US Customs and Border Protection had in the range of <a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/homesec/R46999.pdf">300,000 to 500,000</a> “encounters” with migrants at the southern border each year. Under Biden, the average number has been about 2 million a year, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/21/us/politics/cbp-record-border-crossings.html#:~:text=There%20were%20more%20than%202.4,more%20than%201.7%20million%20apprehensions.">last year being the highest yet</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These are frequently cited as “record breaking” and “highest ever” migrant arrival numbers. But some analysts say it’s more complicated than that. Justin Fox <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-03-20/illegal-us-border-crossings-aren-t-really-breaking-records">argues at Bloomberg Opinion</a> that the true numbers were likely higher from the 1980s through the mid-2000s because back then far more migrants escaped CBP’s notice.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it does seem to be clearly true that far more people are coming in unauthorized under Biden than under Obama or Trump. So why?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Conservatives argue that there are specific features of US and Biden administration policy and messaging that drove the migration surge. Biden did, after all, run for office promising to reverse many of Trump’s cruel policies toward immigrants. More broadly, they believe many people are coming because they’ve heard that, with the way our system is set up, they have a pretty good shot at getting into the US and staying there for a good while. (The asylum claim system is incredibly backlogged and detention capacity is limited, so it’s common to release claimants into the US during the long wait until their claims are heard.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In contrast, progressives prefer to emphasize the conditions that drive migrants to leave their home countries, like the catastrophic collapse of Venezuela’s economy and degradation of conditions in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/27/world/americas/nicaragua-us-migration.html">Nicaragua</a> and <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/haitians-flee-collapse">Haiti</a>. Crises like these, they argue, have simply gotten worse in recent years, both in the region and around the world, and people need help. (Also, notably, the Covid-19 pandemic ebbed when Biden took office, making migrants more free to travel.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Both narratives likely have some truth to them. The president cannot simply wave a wand and make this issue disappear — otherwise Trump would have done it. (CBP still had more than 300,000 migrant encounters in each year of the Trump administration; in fiscal year 2019 that <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/sw-border-migration/fy-2019">number rose</a> to nearly a million.) The administration is indeed constrained by real-world practicalities and global forces outside its control.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet it’s also true that Biden’s policy, even if viewed charitably, has been a bit messy, in part because the Democratic Party is deeply torn about their fundamental values and goals on this issue.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Biden’s border policies have shifted during his term</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since taking office, Biden has tried to strike a balance between Democrats’ desire to help people seeking a better life in the US and their fear that too many unauthorized arrivals brings practical and political problems. But he has struck that balance in different ways at different times.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At first, his administration’s policy was aimed at “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/06/19/bidens-dilemma-at-the-border">managing the flow</a>” of migrants under the implicit assumption that policy could do little to actually reduce the overall demand to enter the US. Biden’s team did try to stress that the border was “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-homeland-chief-says-us-mexico-border-not-open-irregular-migration-2021-06-15/">not open</a>” and clearly viewed chaotic border scenes as a political risk, but they also <a href="https://www.nilc.org/issues/immigration-reform-and-executive-actions/biden-administration-day-one-immigration-actions/">rolled back</a> harsh Trump policies with great fanfare.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By 2022, with the number of arrivals rising sharply, Democratic politicians in blue states and cities seeing an influx of migrants <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/07/nyregion/eric-adams-migrant-crisis-response.html">increasingly</a> complained that they were <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/mayor-lightfoot-gov-pritzker-migrant-crisis/">overwhelmed</a> — with their shelter systems, schools, and budgets being seriously strained by the challenge of helping so many needy people. “It’s in our DNA to welcome immigrants,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kathy-hochul-new-york-governor-face-the-nation-transcript-10-01-2023/">said</a>. “But there has to be some limits in place.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In late 2022 and early 2023, then, Biden <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/2/22/23610849/biden-border-asylum-app-transit">embraced a two-sided policy</a>. Because so many recent arrivals had come from Venezuela, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Cuba, he used executive authority to let hundreds of thousands of people from those countries come legally if they followed an orderly process. He also changed policy to presume more asylum seekers ineligible if they didn’t follow an orderly process. The goal was to change chaotic and unauthorized migration into organized and legal immigration. Still, unauthorized border crossings remained at high levels.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In late 2023, Biden argued that the problem was really an outmoded <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-administration-urges-us-court-uphold-asylum-restrictions-2023-11-08/">asylum process</a> and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/12/06/remarks-by-president-biden-urging-congress-to-pass-his-national-security-supplemental-request-including-funding-to-support-ukraine/">insufficient resources</a> — and that the only solution was a big <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/12/14/23981077/immigration-deal-biden-senate-asylum-ukraine">new immigration bill</a> (which would be linked with a stalled Ukraine aid package). Bipartisan talks about this stretched on for months, and Biden was willing to give Republicans a whole lot of what they wanted. Ultimately, Trump <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/1/25/24050278/senate-immigration-border-ukraine-trump-mcconnell-romney">got the GOP</a> to nix the deal, and Senate Republicans <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wmxbJFbD_A">say</a> that <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSherman/status/1750295162310349121">Trump</a> openly <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/1/25/24050278/senate-immigration-border-ukraine-trump-mcconnell-romney#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWhen%20we%20started,is%20really%20appalling.%E2%80%9D">admitted</a> he did so because continued border chaos would be good for his election chances.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">This year, unauthorized border crossings have sharply declined. Why, and is it sustainable?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With no bill in hand, unauthorized arrivals quite high, and the 2024 election getting closer, the Biden administration acted on its own.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, officials got the Mexican government to agree to do more to stop migrants from getting to the US border in the first place. This, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2024/04/30/united-states-mexico-border-surge-biden/">analysts believe</a>, is likely the main reason why the number of arrivals dropped quite a bit in the first half of 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Second was Biden’s <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-signs-executive-order-shutting-southern-border-rcna155426">executive actions</a> this month to restrict asylum claims even further, shutting down the asylum process if too many people are coming. Many had previously argued that he doesn’t have the legal authority to do this, but he’s <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/06/04/biden-authority-border-executive-order/73968735007/">decided to try it</a> anyway, leaving it up to the courts whether to block his policy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So Biden may well claim some measure of victory in finally reducing the number of unauthorized arrivals, though it’s far from clear whether that will hold up over the long term. Still, if Biden’s recent actions did end up changing the situation, that may make some wonder why he didn’t take such actions much earlier in his term.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Additionally, progressive critics have noted that Biden’s moves to divert more migrants to Mexico and pause new asylum claims resemble policies pursued by Trump. “Though his Administration has avoided its predecessor’s belligerent rhetoric, its goal appears essentially the same: to push the border farther south and to hold Mexico responsible for managing the flow of migrants,” the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/06/10/will-mexico-decide-the-us-election">New Yorker’s Stephania Taladrid writes</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That similarity shouldn’t be overstated. Biden’s policies also dramatically differ from Trump’s because he is still letting hundreds of thousands more people in legally, through his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/23/us/biden-immigration-humanitarian-parole.html">new</a> legal<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/20/nyregion/biden-adams-migrants.html"> pathways</a>, and is protecting many already here from deportation (when Trump has promised an unprecedented crackdown). Biden is still trying to seek a middle ground. But overall, his border policy has been a case study in the difficulties of governance.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With the 2024 campaign underway, <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/fact-checking-trumps-speech-crime-and-immigrants">politicians</a> from both parties have been <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/03/12/crime-democrat-states-republican">sounding the alarm</a> about <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/24139552/crime-rates-falling-tough-laws-mass-incarceration">rising crime</a> rates.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the <a href="https://publicaffairs.northeastern.edu/articles/us-crime-rate-during-pandemic/">pandemic-era spike</a> in crime actually seems to have subsided. The first three months of 2024 showed <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/new-fbi-stats-show-historic-declines-violent-crime-rate-murder-showing-rcna156573#">a historic decline</a> in crime rates compared with the same period last year, according to the latest data from the FBI. Murder, for example, is down 26 percent, and robberies dropped 18 percent. Crime rates now look more like they did pre-Covid, steadily declining as they <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/04/24/what-the-data-says-about-crime-in-the-us/#:~:text=Per%20BJS%2C%20the%20U.S.%20violent,in%20some%20years%2C%20including%20recently.">had been since the 1990s</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet, the majority of Americans still believe that crime is only getting worse. A 2023 Gallup poll showed that <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/544442/americans-crime-problem-serious.aspx#:~:text=More%20than%20three%2Dquarters%20of,readings%20in%20the%20respective%20trends.">77 percent of Americans</a> believed that crime was increasing across the country. That might help explain why <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/24139552/crime-rates-falling-tough-laws-mass-incarceration">lawmakers have been overreacting</a> to the short-lived rise, taking a tough-on-crime approach to public safety, including <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/segments/lawmakers-pass-harsher-penalties-shoplifting-despite-lack-data-on-the-media">imposing harsher penalties</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-york-subway-fare-evasion-policing-crackdown-7c004e19a41a4739af12103366486082">increasing police surveillance</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The big disconnect between public perception of crime and the reality isn’t new. In fact, since 2002, the same annual poll has repeatedly shown that the majority of Americans — often over 60 percent — believe that crime is on the rise even when it’s falling. <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/poll-crime-rate-trump_n_5f2305efc5b656e9b098da70">Other polls</a> have <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/03/07/state-of-the-union-2024-where-americans-stand-on-the-economy-immigration-and-other-key-issues/">found similar results</a>, showing that many <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/poll-crime-rate-trump_n_5f2305efc5b656e9b098da70">Americans believe</a> crime is a serious national problem, one that voters consistently <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/03/07/state-of-the-union-2024-where-americans-stand-on-the-economy-immigration-and-other-key-issues/">consider to be among their chief concerns</a> come election time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s hard to explain why Americans feel the way they do about crime. Part of the answer might be that Americans aren’t entirely ignoring reality: The United States is, after all, a more violent&nbsp;country than its peers, having <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1374211/g7-country-homicide-rate/">the highest homicide rate among affluent nations</a>.&nbsp;</p>

</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Gallup’s annual poll might be telling us something deeper: that fear of crime is deeply embedded in American society, and positive news about falling crime rates won’t simply make that fear go away.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most of us tend to think of crime in the abstract — not as something that is happening to us but something we read about in the news, see on social media, or hear about from politicians running for office every cycle. According to the same Gallup poll, about 3 percent of Americans report being victimized by a violent crime. And while <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/544442/americans-crime-problem-serious.aspx#:~:text=More%20than%20three%2Dquarters%20of,readings%20in%20the%20respective%20trends.">17 percent of Americans</a> believe that crime is an extremely or very serious problem in their neighborhoods, 63 percent believe it’s an extremely or very serious problem in the country as a whole.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So what could be driving the big, consistent gap between public perception and reality? Here are three theories:&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Fearmongering “law-and-order” campaigns are a constant in American politics</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the major drivers that shapes public opinion about crime is “what folks with the biggest platforms and megaphones say, and that is the politicians, especially in an election,” said <a href="https://www.vera.org/people/insha-rahman">Insha Rahman</a>, vice president of advocacy and partnerships at the Vera Institute of Justice. “And we’re basically perennially in election season.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In each of his three presidential campaigns, former president Donald Trump has spent a considerable amount of time on the trail talking about crime, lawlessness, and public disorder, vowing to put tough policies in place to bring an end to the supposed chaos. And much of his rhetoric focuses on cities, which he has claimed are “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/louder-and-more-hateful-big-city-leaders-say-trumps-attacks-on-baltimore-are-escalation-of-his-strategy-to-denigrate-diverse-liberal-areas/2019/07/28/45448ad0-b16a-11e9-951e-de024209545d_story.html">crime-infested</a>,” “<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/506632-trump-calls-new-york-city-hellhole-after-court-upholds-subpoena-from/">hellholes</a>,” and “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/14/republican-tough-on-crime-us-elections-2010">cesspools of bloodshed and crime</a>” that are “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/15/politics/reality-check-donald-trump-atlanta-john-lewis/index.html">falling apart</a>.” In 2020, Trump painted the George Floyd protests as an example of urban lawlessness, going so far as to <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2020/5/29/21274754/racist-history-trump-when-the-looting-starts-the-shooting-starts">tweet the segregationist phrase</a> “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” encouraging police to use violent force against protesters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump followed the mold of the quintessential <a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2020/0902/From-Goldwater-to-Trump-the-long-history-of-Law-and-Order-politics">“law-and-order” campaign</a>, drumming up fear about supposed crime, leaning on racist tropes and dog whistles, and conjuring a picture of cities that residents wouldn’t recognize.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For decades, American politicians — and especially Republicans — have run political campaigns that put crime front and center, even when crime rates are on the decline. This style of campaigning dates back to the 1960s, when Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater launched a “law-and-order” presidential campaign against Lyndon Johnson and used crime as a way to implicitly talk about race.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Vesla Weaver, a political scientist at Johns Hopkins, <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/10/07/what-trump-really-means-when-he-tweets-law-order">told the Marshall Project in 2020</a>, when it started becoming unpopular to explicitly oppose equal rights for Black people, politicians instead started “talking about the urban uprisings—Blacks’ response to political and economic exploitation—they start attaching it to street crime, to ordinary lawlessness.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Republican presidents like <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2018/11/05/law-order-campaign-that-won-richard-nixon-white-house-years-ago/">Richard Nixon</a>, George H. W. Bush, and Donald Trump all focused on urban crime as a way to stir up white suburban voters in particular. Bush, for example, ran the now-infamous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC9j6Wfdq3o">Willie Horton ad</a> in 1988, which focused on the story of a Black man who, while on furlough from prison, raped a white woman. Horton was in Massachusetts, where Bush’s Democratic opponent, Michael Dukakis, was governor. Bush’s move, a direct challenge that Democrats were “soft on crime,” essentially put Democrats <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/takeaway/segments/crime-reshaped-criminal-justice">on the defensive </a>ever since.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When she was first lady in the 1990s, Hillary Clinton <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/analysis-how-media-created-superpredator-myth-harmed-generation-black-youth-n1248101">helped amplify the panic</a> around the since-debunked “superpredator” myth: that crime was going to explode because of a growing, largely Black and brown urban youth population that was supposedly responsible for a significant portion of violent crime.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">National media — especially opinion and commentary publications — also took the theory and ran with it. <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/11/20/superpredator-the-media-myth-that-demonized-a-generation-of-black-youth/#g-sp-anchor">According to the Marshall Project</a>, the country&#8217;s leading newspapers and magazines used the term &#8220;superpredator&#8221; nearly 300 times between 1995 and 2000, when crime had started to decline. The majority of times, the term was used uncritically.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s a vicious cycle,” Rahman said. “There’s a latent concern about crime — it always sits there as a second-tier issue for voters. And if you play upon that as a politician, and you campaign and you really spark fear around the issue, you watch it grow as a top voting issue. That’s absolutely what happens.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, “law-and-order” campaigns aren’t limited to presidential hopefuls. Candidates for local and statewide office routinely emphasize or overstate crime, and that includes Democrats as well. Eric Adams, the Democratic mayor of New York City, for example, was elected in 2021 after running a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e1004e86-9af0-4765-839a-f09659db6c4c">campaign that focused on crime</a> and vowed to beef up law enforcement. Since then, both he and Kathy Hochul, the Democratic governor of New York, have emphasized crime as a very serious problem, imposing tough-on-crime policies, even <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/24139552/crime-rates-falling-tough-laws-mass-incarceration">though crime has been declining in the city</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Adams’s 2021 campaign “was centered on one thing and one thing alone, which was crime,” Rahman said, adding that his rhetoric caused media mentions of crime to skyrocket. “It literally tracked with voter surveys about voters’ concerns about crime.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, as the campaign went on, crime became increasingly salient, eventually becoming <a href="https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/decision-2021/2021/06/07/crime-takes-center-stage-in-mayor-s-race--fueling-support-for-eric-adams">the single most important issue</a> for Democratic primary voters in that race. Between April and May of that year, the share of voters who considered crime and public safety to be their top concern rose by 14 percentage points, <a href="https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/decision-2021/2021/06/07/crime-takes-center-stage-in-mayor-s-race--fueling-support-for-eric-adams">according to a NY1/Ipsos poll</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Media coverage of crime often distorts reality</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When politicians repeatedly bring up crime, the media inevitably responds by covering it. But news outlets, and local media in particular, also often focus a lot of their attention on crime.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“One of the challenges, historically, with the way that we have covered crime is that we usually just cover individual incidents, and there’s very little context for how crime trends are moving overall in our communities,” said <a href="https://www.journalism.cuny.edu/faculty/cheryl-thompson-morton/">Cheryl Thompson-Morton</a>, director of the Black Media Initiative for the Center for Community Media at the City University of New York’s journalism school.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Media outlets dedicate entire sections to coverage of crime, making it a significant part of Americans’ news digest. While journalists should certainly cover crime in their communities, the way that it’s often so prominently featured and prioritized might make people feel like it’s a constant problem that never subsides. Today, there’s also the added layer of social media.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One recent example is the shoplifting panic. A perceived spike in shoplifting — bolstered by <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/12/08/national-retail-federation-report-inaccurate/">faulty data</a> — received a lot of media attention. <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/07/01/the-shoplifting-epidemic-taking-over-america/">Story</a> after story in media outlets called the supposed phenomenon an <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/07/01/the-shoplifting-epidemic-taking-over-america/">epidemic</a>, and alleged that shoplifting was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/americas-shoplifting-epidemic-cities-theft-retail-cvs-national-retail-federation-small-business-crime-11649455129">becoming normalized in many US cities</a>. Viral videos of people brazenly shoplifting without facing any consequences likely helped fuel the panic, making it seem like that kind of petty theft is extremely common. Those kinds of videos also often drew news outlets’ attention, resulting in even more <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/after-san-francisco-shoplifting-video-goes-viral-officials-argue-thefts-n1273848">stories</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As more data was collected, however, it became clear that while there may have indeed been an increase in shoplifting, it was <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24025691/shoplifting-scare-criminal-justice-reform">hardly as severe</a> as the reports suggested. In fact, in many places, <a href="https://counciloncj.org/shoplifting-trends-what-you-need-to-know/">shoplifting seems to have been declining</a> just as these news reports were coming out.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By the time it was clear that the shoplifting wave had been overstated, it was already too late.&nbsp; Despite an effort by many media outlets to correct the record, many Americans had already formed an impression it was a problem that was spinning out of control. And after years of progressive criminal justice reforms — which included lowering penalties for petty crimes and, in some cases, <a href="https://www.vera.org/news/what-happened-when-boston-stopped-prosecuting-nonviolent-crimes">choosing not to prosecute those cases</a> — many politicians <a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/trump-claims-mobs-500-people-222643822.html">seized on the panic</a> showing a dramatic increase in shoplifting to promote tough-on-crime policies similar to those passed in the 1990s, including <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/11/organized-retail-crime-nine-states-pass-laws-to-crack-down-on-theft.html">by lowering the threshold</a> for what constitutes a felony.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Covering these individual incidents of crime often, as we typically do, often do not help make people feel safer,” Thompson-Morton said.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>When crime is sensationalized, Americans can’t look away</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One problem with the way politicians talk about crime and with the way the media covers it is that they often focus on incidents that will grab people’s attention. That’s likely why the Bush campaign, for example, chose to exploit the Willie Horton case — precisely because it played to people’s fears about prisoners and old racist tropes about Black men.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When crimes that might be relatively rare are given outsized weight in the media, people start to believe that they’re more common than they actually are. It also leads to a vicious feedback loop: Tough-on-crime politicians repeatedly talk about a case, media outlets cover it, and people become extremely interested in it, encouraging politicians to continue exploiting the case and more media coverage.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Take <a href="https://apnews.com/article/laken-riley-university-georgia-death-nursing-student-a88e92600ab4dcce1a88e121b7b9c722">the case of Laken Riley</a>, a 22-year-old nursing student who was killed earlier this year. The story played into Republicans’ narrative about immigration — Trump started his 2016 campaign talking about how people crossing the southern borders were criminals and rapists — because the alleged killer <a href="https://nbc24.com/news/nation-world/immigration-status-of-suspected-nursing-student-killer-roils-border-security-debate-university-of-georgia-jose-ibarra-larke-hope-riley-illegal-immigration-undocumented-migrants-national-security-supplemental-james-lankford-joe-biden-border-patrol">had entered the United States illegally</a>. The case became so prominently featured in Republican campaigns that President Joe Biden <a href="https://apnews.com/article/laken-riley-biden-speech-immigration-d756dbe1c499c6fd0fc53be04290b371">mentioned it in his State of the Union address</a>, after Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene confronted him about it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Studies show, however, that immigrants <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/debunking-myth-migrant-crime-wave">aren’t more likely to commit crimes</a> than native-born citizens. In fact, some studies show that immigrants <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/us/border-migrants-crime-cec/index.html">might be less likely to commit crimes</a> than people born in the US. But when one horrific incident like Laken Riley’s is sensationalized, it can quickly affect public opinion: One poll, for example, showed that the majority of Americans <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/02/15/how-americans-view-the-situation-at-the-u-s-mexico-border-its-causes-and-consequences/">believe that migration</a> is leading to more crime, despite all evidence that points to the contrary.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So while law-and-order campaigns feed off sensationalizing crime, they are often actually about something else: stirring up fear of a changing society.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Crime is likely to keep coming up as a 2024 campaign issue</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As with his previous campaigns, Trump has spent <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/06/15/trump-black-church-detroit-crime/#">a lot of time talking about crime</a>, despite falling crime rates, and he’s likely to bring it up during his debates with Biden.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Regardless of where crime rates actually stand, the fact that so many people believe that crime is not only a serious problem but one that’s actively getting worse has resulted in Republicans and Democrats trying to prove their tough-on-crime bona fides. Even officials in the Biden administration, for example, have told progressives that they <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/23/white-house-oregan-turn-towards-center-00159588">went “too far” on criminal justice reforms</a> and that they should look for a more “sensible approach.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That means that between now and November, and potentially beyond,&nbsp;both parties are likely to push for tougher laws and harsher enforcement.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But whatever candidates will say about combating crime, one thing is clear: Crime isn’t actually getting worse – even if the majority of Americans think it is.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Two very old, often ineloquent white men will get into a lengthy argument in Atlanta on Thursday night — and, quite possibly, change the course of American history.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some may doubt that <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/355910/ask-vox-politics-policy-team-questions-first-presidential-debate">the first debate of the 2024 presidential election</a> has such high stakes. There are indeed many reasons to think that this week’s oratorical showdown between Joe Biden and Donald Trump will be of no real consequence. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For one thing, some academic research suggests that presidential debates have little to no impact on election outcomes. A <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26572/w26572.pdf">2019 paper</a> from economists at HEC Montréal and Harvard Business School tried to gauge the electoral relevance of 56 debates televised during 31 election seasons in the US, Canada, and five other countries. To do this, they analyzed data from surveys that asked voters whom they supported shortly before or after the debates, and then contacted those same voters after the election to find out whom they ultimately backed. The researchers found that, across all political systems they studied, there was no evidence that debates led undecided voters to settle on a candidate, or other voters to switch allegiances. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is not entirely surprising. Previous <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/T/bo13948250.html">research</a> from the political scientists Robert S. Erikson and Christopher Wlezien also found that, in every election featuring a debate from 1960 through 2008, the impact of debates on the respective candidates’ poll numbers appeared small to nonexistent.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is also a theoretical reason to doubt the influence of debates on election outcomes: The voters <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/presidential-debates-have-shockingly-little-effect-on-election-outcomes/">most likely to watch</a> a presidential debate — or to consume large amounts of news coverage about that debate — are those who are most interested in politics. Voters who consume lots of political media tend to be strong partisans, and therefore have little interest in reconsidering their loyalties.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In certain respects, this Thursday’s debate might seem liable to matter even less than a typical presidential debate. After all, both candidates are already extremely well-known to the electorate,<strong> </strong>having already debated twice in 2020. And given the unusual timing of this year’s first debate — which comes before the major party conventions instead of after, as had heretofore been standard — whatever impact the event does have on voter impressions could fade out long before Election Day. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Recall that, just one month before the 2016 election, the Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html">published a video</a> in which Trump bragged about grabbing women by the genitals. Hillary Clinton’s advantage over the Republican in <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2016/trump-vs-clinton">RealClearPolitics’s polling average</a>  jumped from 4.7 points to 7.1 points within a week only to crash back down to 3.2 points by Election Day, a finding that overstated her ultimate share of the national popular vote.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But wait! Don’t decide to tune out Vox’s comprehensive coverage of the 2024 presidential debates just yet! If there is cause to believe that Thursday’s proceedings won’t matter, there are also reasons to think that they will. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Specifically, there are (at least) four reasons to suspect that Trump and Biden’s impending rematch could be one of the rare debates that actually does have a significant impact on voters’ decisions.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>1) The race is very close</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First and foremost, the debates do not have to matter much to influence the election’s outcome. As of this writing, in FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/">polling average</a>, Biden leads Trump by a margin of 40.8 percent to 40.7 percent — a statistical tie.<strong> </strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Polls in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — the three most closely contested battleground states, which could collectively determine the Electoral College’s victor — are similarly tight. In RealClearPolitics’s polling average, Trump <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/michigan/trump-vs-biden">leads Biden</a> in Michigan by 0.2 percent while <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/pennsylvania/trump-vs-biden">besting</a> him in Pennsylvania by 2.8 percent. In Wisconsin, meanwhile, the two candidates <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/wisconsin/trump-vs-biden">are tied</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In this context, an event that changes the voting intentions of a tiny sliver of the electorate could be of decisive importance. And debates can sometimes achieve that much, according to some researchers. As the communications scholars Mitchell S. McKinney and Benjamin R. Warner note <a href="https://pci.missouri.edu/assets/doc/research/mckinney--warner-2013.pdf">in a 2013 review of the empirical literature</a> on debate effects, while there is generally “very little change in voting intention following exposure to general election presidential debates,” some studies “have found that among undecided, conflicted, or weakly committed voters, debates do help form voting preference or even change candidate selection.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These studies appear less comprehensive than the more recent research cited above, as they focus on a much smaller number of elections. Nevertheless, they suggest that there may be some contexts in which debates can have a real impact on outcomes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And the 2024 election could be one such context because it features a plenty of weakly committed voters. Many Americans <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/06/04/nx-s1-4977784/double-disapprovers-focus-group-biden-trump">disapprove of both Trump and Biden</a>. In the New York Times’s polling, there was a small but significant group of Biden 2020 voters who now supported Trump over the president — but said they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/upshot/kamala-harris-biden-voters-polls.html">would support Kamala Harris over Trump</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is not hard to imagine that such voters might revert back to their conventional partisan allegiances in the face of a strong debate performance from Biden, or conversely, that they might grow firmer in their support for Trump, were the presumptive GOP nominee to dominate Thursday’s event.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>2) The “lol, nothing matters” theory of politics has taken a hit in recent weeks</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the 2020 election, Donald Trump has fomented <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/1/6/22217657/us-capitol-breach-trump-rally-presidential-election">an insurrection against the US government</a>, been found civilly <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23717295/donald-trump-verdict-e-jean-carroll-rape-sexual-assault-battery-defamation">liable for sexual abuse,</a> faced <a href="https://www.vox.com/trump-investigations/2023/8/17/23832734/trump-indictment-democracy-paradox">indictment</a> on a wide range of criminal charges, and been <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/352465/trump-convicted-felon-elections">convicted of 34 felonies</a>. And yet, he is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/">more popular</a> with the American public today than he was for <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/">much of his presidency</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given this reality, it’s&nbsp;tempting to conclude that more or less nothing can poison Trump’s image with voters who remain in his corner. If Trump didn’t lose these folks by siccing a mob on his own vice president, how could he lose them with a subpar debate performance?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet in recent weeks, we’ve seen that novel information can put a dent in Trump’s poll numbers — albeit a small one.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the day that he was <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/352465/trump-convicted-felon-elections#">convicted in a New York</a> court for falsifying business records, Trump led Biden by 1.7 points in FiveThirtyEight’s national polling average. Ten days later, that lead had fallen to 1 percent. Now, it has been completely erased.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Recontact surveys — in which pollsters re-interview respondents they’d polled shortly before the conviction, to see if Trump’s legal woes had changed their minds — yielded <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/354234/trump-conviction-polls-voters">similar results</a>, with Trump’s margin over Biden shrinking by 2 percentage points in polls from the New York Times and Echelon Insights.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Correlation is not causation. It is conceivable that other, less conspicuous factors eroded Trump’s support over the past month. Regardless, it is apparent that a potentially decisive segment of voters lacks firm allegiances to either candidate and are liable to shift their preferences in response to major news events. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And this week’s debate will be one of the biggest political news events of the year thus far. All major networks will broadcast Biden and Trump’s rematch, and news outlets will spend days picking over its most memorable moments. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Were voters completely dug into partisan camps and/or impervious to new information about the candidates, then the substance of the debate coverage wouldn’t matter. But the polling shift since Trump’s conviction suggests that this is not the case.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>3) The debate gives Biden a unique opportunity to combat the impression that he is too old – or reinforce it</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent polls, Biden has <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/20/joe-biden-underperforming-democrats-polls-00164156">performed significantly worse</a> than down-ballot candidates in his party. This suggests that Biden’s personal attributes — as opposed to his policy positions — are leading some independent voters to withhold their support.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The president’s advanced age — he would be 82 years old at his second inauguration — appears to be one such attribute. In <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/poll-americans-on-biden-age/story?id=107126589">an ABC News poll</a> from February, 86 percent of voters said that Biden was too old to serve another term. That is broadly in line with other pollsters’ findings on the subject.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden has had other opportunities to demonstrate his vitality. As the political blogger Kevin Drum <a href="https://jabberwocking.com/raw-data-public-interest-in-joe-bidens-age/">has noted</a>, the president’s State of the Union address in March appeared to abruptly dampen search interest in questions about his age.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the State of the Union attracts a much smaller audience than general election debates: Biden’s address <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/news-center/2024/2024-state-of-the-union-address-draws-over-32-million-viewers/">attracted 32 million viewers</a> while his first debate with Trump in 2020 <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/06/26/presidential-debate-ratings-biden-trump/74154809007/#">drew 73 million</a>. More critically, responding extemporaneously to questions and attacks in the form of clear and concise soundbites fit for clipping is a much more cognitively demanding task than reciting a pre-written speech.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is not to say that a candidate’s capacity to deftly navigate a televised debate is a good proxy for their capacity to serve as president. The skills necessary for shepherding legislation through Congress or brokering international alliances and those required for dispensing well-calibrated talking points in 90-second batches don’t necessarily overlap. Biden has never been an especially eloquent politician. But he has proven effective at enacting bipartisan legislation and orchestrating international cooperation on the war in Ukraine. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, were Biden to sputter, serially misspeak, ramble, or otherwise project an aura of senescence during Thursday night’s debate, he would very likely reinforce the public’s sense that an octogenarian should not be given a four-year lease on the White House.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Conversely, were Biden to deliver a performance on par with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/12/joe-biden-paul-ryan-debate">his drubbing of Paul Ryan in 2012</a>, he might alleviate swing voters’ concerns about his cognitive well-being and embarrass Republican spin doctors who’ve been falsely accusing him of senility.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>4) The American people have not ingested pure, uncut Trump in years</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the wake of the January 6 insurrection, major social media companies banned Trump from their platforms.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This may have actually redounded to his benefit. One of Trump’s greatest liabilities as a politician was his compulsion to broadcast unvetted thoughts directly to the public over Twitter. This provided the mainstream press — and thus, swing voters — with unmediated access to the demagogue’s (frequently <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/malignant-cruelty-donald-trump/612097/">cruel</a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/16/politics/white-supremacists-cheer-trump-racist-tweets-soh/index.html">racist</a>, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/4/5/18297113/trump-authoritarian-comments-immigration-judges-media">authoritarian</a>) thoughts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now that the ex-president’s posts are confined to his personal social media platform, Truth Social, his incendiary tantrums are much less visible to the general population. Voters who pay little attention to politics outside of presidential election years — a bloc that is exceptionally likely to be undecided — may also lack familiarity with Trump’s recent stump speeches. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Which is almost certainly a good thing for Trump’s campaign. Over the past two years, the Republican’s rhetoric has grown increasingly radical and deranged. He has taken to deriding his political opponents as “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/06/donald-trump-speech-analysis">vermin</a>” and migrants as “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-expected-highlight-murder-michigan-woman-immigration-speech-2024-04-02/#:~:text=GREEN%20BAY%2C%20Wisconsin%2C%20April%202,again%20on%20the%20campaign%20trail.">animals</a>,” while lauding January 6 rioters as “<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-praises-jan-6-rioters-great-patriots-1773808">great patriots</a>.” His descriptions of American life have grown <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/27/magazine/trump-rallies-rhetoric.html">apocalyptic</a>, recently declaring, “Our cities are choking to death. Our states are dying, and frankly, our country is dying.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Above all, though, his extemporaneous remarks have become deeply strange. Trump’s speeches have always been digressive, but lately, the 78-year-old<strong> </strong>candidate’s digressions often fail to sync back up with his actual point, leading instead to still further digressions. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The typical undecided voter has not been exposed to this angry, authoritarian, and scatterbrained version of Trump in a long time, perhaps ever. And in the absence of the actual man, it is surely much easier for Americans to project onto Trump the candidate they wish he was: an unscrupulous but ruthlessly effective businessman who knows how to bring down inflation, get tough on immigration, and run the government more competently than Joe Biden.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Therefore, to the extent that the debate reacquaints the electorate with the actual Donald Trump, it could shift undecided voters in Biden’s direction.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All that said, there is certainly no guarantee that the debate will make a durable impression on the electorate. But given the extraordinary stakes of the 2024 race,&nbsp; Thursday night’s proceedings could mark a turning point in the history of our republic — or, failing that, an engaging (if almost certainly exasperating) spectacle.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Former President Donald Trump could soon make an announcement about his pick for vice president, a choice that could prove to be uniquely consequential this cycle.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In past elections, a nominee’s running mate has been closely watched for a variety of reasons. They may bring experience to balance a nominee’s lack of it (think Barack Obama’s choice of Joe Biden), or they may appeal to a region or demographic that the nominee would like to reach (think Donald Trump’s pick of Mike Pence), or they may amplify a presidential campaign’s message (think Bill Clinton with Al Gore).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The importance of the VP can be overstated, with researchers finding that they typically <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/7/30/21346478/joe-biden-running-mate-vice-president">affect general election outcomes only if they’re extremely popular or polarizing</a>. But as <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/350310/why-trumps-running-mate-could-be-the-most-important-vp-pick-of-our-time">Vox’s Andrew Prokop has explained</a>, Trump’s choice could have particular significance since they may have to step in given his age and legal baggage. Additionally, there are pressing questions about whether the VP Trump names would stand up to him — like Pence did — if he tries to challenge the democratic transfer of office again.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Increasingly, Trump has hinted that he could announce his decision shortly. He <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-says-knows-presidential-selection-will-rcna158457">recently told reporters</a> he had his choice set “in my mind,” and that the person would “most likely” be in the audience for his Thursday debate with Biden.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thus far, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-narrows-vp-search-his-short-list-is-nearly-all-men-2024-06-07/">sources say his top contenders</a> include Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, who famously criticized the former president and then changed course, as well as <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4737404-trump-vp-pick-potential-candidates/">presidential rivals turned allies</a> Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and North Dakota Gov. Doug Bergum. A number of other names have also been floated, everyone from&nbsp; Trump’s former HUD Secretary Ben Carson to House Conference Chair Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although the VP choice may be a moot point for many voters, particularly given how well Trump is known, each of these options would bring something slightly different to the ticket. With the caveat that other names may still come out, here’s what we know about the potential running mates Trump is considering and what they have to offer.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Doug Burgum</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Burgum, 67, is North Dakota’s current governor, a former 2024 presidential candidate, and a businessman. He previously founded a successful software company that he went on to sell to Microsoft for $1.1 billion, and now has an estimated net worth of roughly $100 million, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/doug-burgum-money-how-rich-business-trump-1917110#:~:text=Business%20magazine%20Forbes%20estimated%20last,for%20his%20three%20grown%20children.">according to Forbes</a>. As governor, he’s known for supporting the state’s production of fossil fuels and for signing multiple anti-trans bills into law.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Like several of the people on this list, Burgum has criticized Trump in the past and since changed his tune. He also previously said that Biden won the 2020 election, though he hasn’t directly condemned Trump’s role in January 6 riot.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Burgum has said that he can bring his business expertise and outsider mentality to the ticket, both qualities that Trump has touted about himself. He’s also got a substantial personal fortune that he can contribute to the race. And he’s already taken to the airwaves as a Trump sycophant in an apparent attempt to demonstrate his loyalty. “This guy is tireless, he’s committed, he’s smart, he’s funny. He’s nothing like he’s portrayed in the press,” <a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/potential-trump-vps-sycophantic-claim-092441870.html">Burgum said in a recent Fox News appearance</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">J.D. Vance</h2>

<p><strong>Who is he? </strong>Vance, 39, is a first-term Ohio senator, onetime Trump opponent, and now vocal Trump supporter. He’s also known as the author of <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em>, a memoir that chronicled his experience growing up in a working-class family in the Midwest.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What’s the case for him?</strong> Vance would fully embrace the MAGA agenda as one of Trump’s ardent defenders, as well as add a younger perspective. He would also bring his brief experience in the Senate and some business expertise from his background working in venture capital. Similar to others on this list, he’s a pick that could resonate with the base.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tim Scott</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he?</strong> A three-term, relatively conservative South Carolina senator, Scott, 58, is also the only Black Republican serving in the upper chamber. Scott is known for his own 2024 presidential run, which floundered early on, and his efforts to find a compromise on police reform in Congress. He previously framed much of his candidacy around pushing back against Democrats’ views on race, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/8/25/21400661/tim-scott-rnc-speech-republican-trump">citing his own success</a> as negating the idea that Black Americans are disadvantaged by systemic racism.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him?</strong> Scott is a religious social conservative with political views broadly in line with Trump’s, though his establishment credentials — including refusing to contest the 2020 election results — might assuage some Republicans wary of the former president. Trump has praised Scott, noting that he <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/02/04/trump-vp-pick-tim-scott-kristi-noem">told the South Carolina lawmaker</a>, “You’re a much better candidate for me than you are for yourself.” Choosing Scott could also be an attempt by the Trump campaign to cement the gains that it made in 2020 with a small number of Black voters.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Marco Rubio</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Rubio, 53, is a three-term Florida senator and former presidential candidate. He entered Congress as a Tea Party conservative, but framed himself as more of a “moderate” option when he unsuccessfully ran for president in 2016. Prior to serving in the Senate, he also served in the Florida House of Representatives. Across these roles, Rubio has focused on foreign policy as well as immigration reform.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the past, Rubio has criticized Trump and dubbed him a “con artist,” but in recent years he’s become an ally and adviser.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Rubio could bring legislative expertise in the Senate as well as the relationships he’s built, providing policy chops that Trump lacks on issues like the Ukraine war.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He’d offer a different generational perspective as well as Latino representation, as a Cuban American. In 2020, Trump made some <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/24118911/biden-trump-2024-election-polls-latino-hispanic-voter-outreach">marginal gains with Latino voters</a> in Florida and Texas, and choosing Rubio could potentially help him reach more members of this community.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/gettyimages-2153411839.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.72964951479,100,78.540700970421" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Rep.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Byron Donalds</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Donalds, 45, is a two-term House lawmaker from Florida and was a state representative for a few terms before that. Donalds is one of just a handful of Black Republican members currently in Congress <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/byron-donalds-house-speaker-political-views-rcna64368">and has described himself as</a> “​​everything the fake news media says doesn’t exist: a Trump supporting, liberty loving, pro-life, pro-2nd Amendment black man.” He was recently criticized for comments he made that suggested that <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/byron-donalds-defends-comments-jim-crow-fiery-exchange-joy-reid-rcna155969">Black families were were more “together” during the Jim Crow era</a>, when policies segregated white and Black Americans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Donalds could contribute the legislative experience he’s garnered and add fresh energy to the ticket as a conservative rising star. He could also increase representation on the ticket as the campaign continues to work on its appeal to Black voters.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/gettyimages-2158636685.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.729628998337,100,78.540742003326" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) speaks at the Faith and Freedom Road to Majority conference at the Washington Hilton on June 21, 2024, in Washington, DC." data-portal-copyright="" />
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Elise Stefanik</h2>

<p><strong>Who is she? </strong>Stefanik, 39, is a five-term House Representative and member of House Republican leadership. Once more moderate, she’s pivoted hard to the right in recent years after her upstate New York district swung in favor of Trump. Stefanik has raised her profile in congressional hearings pushing back against <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/11/19/20966940/elise-stefanik-impeachment-hearing-donald-trump-adam-schiff">Trump’s impeachment</a> and in a recent appearance questioning elite university presidents <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/12/15/24001823/antisemitism-college-harvard-penn-mit-free-speech">about antisemitism on campus</a>. She’s also long advocated for growing Republican women’s representation in Congress and backed fundraising and recruitment initiatives to do so.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What’s the case for her? </strong>Stefanik has had about a decade of legislative experience and has increasingly established herself as a prominent conservative voice who could potentially energize base voters. She’s signaled staunch fealty to Trump and would bring gender and age diversity to the ticket, along with strong rhetorical skills.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her stated views are also pretty much consistent with Trump’s. Stefanik was among the House Republicans who voted to overturn the <a data-source="encore" href="https://www.vox.com/2020-presidential-election">2020 election</a> results and has embraced many of the same extreme positions as the former president on issues like immigration.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Ben Carson</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Carson, 72, is the former HUD Secretary and a renowned neurosurgeon. Carson is perhaps best known for performing the first successful procedure to separate conjoined twins. He also ran for the presidency in 2016 and went on to back Trump after dropping out. As HUD Secretary, Carson was criticized for lacking the housing policy expertise needed for the gig, and later <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/178952/trump-hud-housing-policy-disaster">called for budget cuts</a> that would have gutted the work the agency was doing on issues like affordable housing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Carson is known for his medical expertise and more even-keeled persona, which could serve as a complement to Trump. The Trump campaign also saw <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/11/4/21537966/trump-black-voters-exit-polls">marginal gains with Black voters</a>, particularly men, in 2020 and Carson could increase representation and outreach to build on these wins.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the second time in two years, a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-26/us-supreme-court-poised-to-allow-emergency-abortions-in-idaho?srnd=undefined">major Supreme Court abortion decision leaked</a> before the justices officially released it. This time, however, the most likely explanation is a clerical error by someone who manages the Court’s website.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Two years ago, an early draft of Justice Samuel Alito’s opinion in <em>Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization</em>, the case overruling <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/5/3/23054543/supreme-court-roe-wade-abortion-samuel-alito-overruled-draft-politico">leaked to the press</a>. The identity of the leaker remains unknown, as does the leaker’s motive. About two months after the leak, the Supreme Court released its final opinion in <em>Dobbs</em>, which was <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/6/24/23181720/supreme-court-dobbs-jackson-womens-health-samuel-alito-roe-wade-abortion-marriage-contraception">substantially similar to the leaked draft</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Wednesday, another significant abortion opinion leaked — although this time the leak appears to be an accident. According to Bloomberg, the justices’ <a href="https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/rJo5436tVr08/v0">opinions in <em>Moyle v. United States</em></a> were “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-26/us-supreme-court-poised-to-allow-emergency-abortions-in-idaho?srnd=undefined">briefly posted on the court’s website</a>” before being taken down. A Supreme Court spokesperson said that “the court’s publications unit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/26/us/politics/supreme-court-abortion-idaho.html">inadvertently and briefly uploaded a document to the court’s website</a>,” and that the final decision will be “issued in due course.” Bloomberg posted the text of the leaked document <a href="https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/rJo5436tVr08/v0">at this link</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Moyle</em> asks whether states can ignore a federal law which requires most hospitals to provide emergency care to patients who need it — <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2024/4/9/24112845/supreme-court-abortion-emtala-moyle-united-states-idaho-life-health">including abortions</a> if that is the appropriate medical treatment. Specifically, whether Idaho’s near-total ban on abortions prevents doctors from providing medically necessary abortions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Assuming that the leaked document resembles the Court’s final decision, a majority of the justices have decided not to decide the <em>Moyle </em>case. Though the Court has seemingly splintered into four separate concurring and dissenting opinions, none of which garnered a majority of the justices’ support, five justices apparently decided that the Court was wrong to take up this case using an expedited process that bypassed an intermediate appeals court.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The leaked document does contain some good news for abortion rights advocates. Last January, the Court temporarily <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2024/1/5/24027273/supreme-court-trump-abortion-emtala-idaho-emergency">blocked a lower court decision</a>, which held that the state of Idaho cannot enforce its strict abortion ban against patients who need an abortion to save their life or to ward off catastrophic health consequences. In the leaked document, six justices voted to reinstate the lower court’s order — at least for now — which means that Idaho patients who require medically necessary abortions will no longer need to be airlifted to other states.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, the primary effect of the decision, assuming it closely resembles the leaked draft, will likely be to punt the final resolution of this case until after the election. That means that patients outside of Idaho — who may have been hoping a decision in this case would set a precedent requiring ER doctors across the country to follow the federal law requiring care in the event of an emergency — may not be able to obtain abortion care that they need to save their life or to ward off very serious health consequences.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s at stake in <em>Moyle</em></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The federal <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1395dd">Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act</a> (EMTALA) requires all hospitals that accept Medicare funds — which is nearly all hospitals — to provide “such treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical condition” of “any individual” who arrives at the hospital’s ER with an “emergency medical condition.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">EMTALA, moreover, defines an “emergency medical condition” to include not just conditions that threaten a patient’s life, but also conditions that risk “serious impairment to bodily functions,” or “serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part,” among other things. Thus, if a patient’s uterus would be destroyed if they do not receive an abortion, EMTALA generally requires hospitals to provide that abortion even if the patient is likely to survive without it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This federal law conflicts with an Idaho statute, which bans all abortions except when “<a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/title18/t18ch6/sect18-622/#:~:text=Search%20Idaho%20Statutes&amp;text=18%2D622.,the%20crime%20of%20criminal%20abortion.">necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When a federal law conflicts with a state law, the Constitution provides that the federal law “<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/supremacy_clause">shall be the supreme Law of the Land</a>” — and thus the state law is “preempted.” EMTALA also contains a provision stating that state and local laws must give way “<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1395dd">to the extent that the [state law] directly conflicts with a requirement of this section</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So this should be an easy case. EMTALA imposes a broad requirement on nearly all hospitals to provide emergency care, and it does not include an exception for abortions. The statute, moreover, explicitly says that state laws must give way when they directly conflict with EMTALA.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But, in this Court, nothing involving abortion can ever be easy.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How <em>Moyle</em> seems to have divided the justices</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Court’s three Democratic appointees, Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson, all argue in two separate leaked opinions that EMTALA means what it actually says — though they appear to have split on a procedural question.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ordinarily, the Supreme Court waits until at least one appeals court has weighed in on a case before taking it up. In <em>Moyle</em>, however, the Court invoked an unusual process known as “certiorari before judgment” to bypass the appeals court that was supposed to hear this case. Kagan, joined by Sotomayor, argues that the case should be sent back to the appeals court that should have heard <em>Moyle</em> in the first place.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jackson, meanwhile, argues that the Court should rule immediately that EMTALA means what it says. As she writes in the documents Bloomberg published, doctors “observing the different legal thresholds for action under state and federal law” will “surely be cowed into not providing abortion” that is required by federal law — especially because of the risk that they could be prosecuted under state law. A decision by the Supreme Court holding that EMTALA trumps state law would allow doctors to perform medically necessary abortions with certainty.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the Court’s rightward extreme, Alito, in a leaked opinion joined in whole by Justice Clarence Thomas and in part by Justice Neil Gorsuch, argues for an abortion exception to the EMTALA statute. Alito primarily points to several provisions of the law which use the phrase “unborn child” (these provisions primarily require hospitals to offer stabilizing care to a pregnant patient’s fetus), suggesting that a statute which uses that phrase must not be read to permit abortions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Alito also makes a <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2024/4/9/24112845/supreme-court-abortion-emtala-moyle-united-states-idaho-life-health">novel constitutional argument</a>, claiming that the state of Idaho must consent before its abortion ban can be preempted by EMTALA.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That leaves Justice Amy Coney Barrett, writing for herself, Chief Justice John Roberts, and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, in the middle.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Barrett’s opinion, as it’s published in the Bloomberg leak, leaves nearly every important question raised by <em>Moyle</em> unresolved. She agrees with Kagan that the case should be sent back down to the lower court, thus creating a majority for that result. And she writes that Alito’s constitutional argument is “difficult and consequential” without taking a position on that argument.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The thrust of Barrett’s opinion is that there is no longer a need to bypass the appeals court and decide this case on an expedited basis because of concessions made by lawyers on both sides. The Biden administration, which argues for EMTALA to be read according to its plain text, conceded that EMTALA could not be used to authorize abortions because a patient has a mental health condition. And it also conceded that federal laws permitting hospitals or doctors with moral objections to abortion to opt out of providing them still apply even under EMTALA.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Idaho’s lawyers, meanwhile, claimed that its state law permits abortions for some medical conditions “even if the threat to the woman’s life is not imminent.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to Barrett, the “parties’ positions are still evolving” in this case, and thus it makes sense for those positions to be refined in a lower court before the Supreme Court has the final word.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So the good news for abortion rights supporters is that emergency room patients in Idaho will have the full benefit of EMTALA, at least while this case is working its way through the appeals court and back up to the justices. The bad news is that the leaked <em>Moyle</em> decision does nothing to help those same patients in the other 49 states.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And that’s a serious problem for abortion rights generally. As Jackson notes in her opinion, one problem that’s emerged since <em>Dobbs</em> is that, while even the most anti-abortion states typically permit abortions in some cases — such as if the life or health of a patient is threatened — there are often <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/12/12/23998301/kate-cox-texas-supreme-court-abortion-ken-paxton">no court precedents</a> explaining when abortions are allowed and when they are not. That means that doctors cannot know, and their lawyers cannot advise them, on when it is legal to perform a medically necessary abortion.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And that has created a reality where those exceptions are “exceptionally difficult — in some states, nigh impossible — to qualify for,” <a href="https://www.vox.com/explainers/356314/abortion-laws-roe-wade-dobbs-decision-mifepristone-supreme-court">as my colleague Nicole Narea reported</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">Kate Cox, a Texas woman, was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/06/politics/kate-cox-texas-abortion/index.html">notably denied</a> an abortion even though her fetus was diagnosed with a rare and terminal genetic condition and forced to travel out of state to obtain one. Other women have been <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/02/health/florida-abortion-term-pregnancy/index.html">forced to carry to term</a> fetuses doctors know will die shortly upon birth, or been <a href="https://link.vox.com/click/35616768.71438/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9wdWJsaWMtaGVhbHRoLzIwMjQvMDYvMDQvaG93LWEtY291cGxlLWZvdW5kLXRoZW1zZWx2ZXMtdGFuZ2xlZC1pbi10ZXhhcy1zdHJpY3QtYWJvcnRpb24tbGF3cy1hZnRlci1taXNjYXJyaWFnZS8_dWVpZD03MmRmM2EwM2IzMzFmNDQyZDllZjQ2M2VhMGVhYzE2OQ/60917b99ac7e007ef63c6b67Bd5b18d70">denied abortion care even after experiencing a miscarriage</a> that leaves them in medical distress. The Texas Supreme Court also ruled against a group of 20 women who claimed that they had been <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/05/31/texas-supreme-court-zurawski-abortion/#:~:text=The%20court%20ruled%20against%2020,the%20law%20were%20broad%20enough.">denied medically necessary abortions</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <em>Moyle</em> lawsuit was an effort to solve this problem by allowing federal courts to develop precedents stating when EMTALA creates a right to an abortion. But that process cannot begin until the courts agree that EMTALA means what it says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thus, if the leaked <em>Moyle</em> decision proves to be authentic, that means it may be months or even years before the federal courts can start generating the precedents that hospital lawyers need to advise their clients — and that’s assuming that Alito doesn’t ultimately have the votes to write an abortion exception into EMTALA.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When a fan asked Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/4/24166297/nvidia-jensen-huang-computex-signing">sign her chest</a> earlier this month, that might have been a sign that the hype around the chipmaker may have reached unsustainable heights.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the past few years, Nvidia’s computer chips — which have some technical capabilities that make them well suited to AI applications — catapulted the company to new echelons of profitability. Last week, Nvidia briefly became the world’s most valuable company; three days later, it lost that title amid a days-long sell-off of its shares. While its stock price has since recovered somewhat, it’s now the world’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/25/tech/nvidia-stock-fall-worlds-third-biggest-company/index.html">third most valuable</a> company with a market capitalization of <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/nvda">$3.1 trillion</a>, after Microsoft and Apple. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The sell-off came amid concern that Nvidia is overvalued. Recently, financial research strategist Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank warned of “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/25/tech/nvidia-stock-fall-worlds-third-biggest-company/index.html">signs of over-exuberance</a>” about Nvidia, and Nvidia executives have <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/as-nvidia-executives-sell-stock-heres-what-investors-need-to-know-58761d64#:~:text=Chief%20Executive%20Jensen%20Huang%20and,shares%20NVDA%2C%20%2D1.64%25%20.">even sold off</a> some of their holdings in the company.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are still many reasons to be excited about Nvidia: The company has established itself as an industry-leading chipmaker, reaping the benefits of an early bet on AI that has paid off as chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT have brought broader public attention to the technology. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It&#8217;s very early in the AI race,” said Daniel Newman, CEO of the Futurum Group, a tech research and analysis firm. “But everyone who has been building AI up to this point probably has done at least some of their most important work on Nvidia.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The stock market has responded accordingly. Nvidia is part of the so-called “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/wall-street-stocks-magnificent-seven-a6e1da1a8c85c0a56f9e9c85e001ebff">Magnificent Seven</a>” tech stocks that accounted for a majority of stock market growth last year. Its stock price had risen <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/nvda">nearly 155 percent</a> since January as of the market closing on Wednesday.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But whether Nvidia can continue to replicate that kind of growth depends on advancements in AI, as well as to what extent — and how quickly — businesses will adopt it. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">How Nvidia became one of the world’s most important chipmakers</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nvidia has long been considered the premier producer of graphics cards for gaming. However, its graphics processing units (GPUs), the main component of graphics cards, gained popularity amid a rise in cryptocurrency mining, a process that involves solving complex mathematical problems to release new cryptocurrency coins into circulation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s because Nvidia GPUs are highly optimized for what’s called “parallel processing” — basically, dividing up a computationally difficult problem and assigning the various parts to thousands of processor cores on the GPU at once, solving the problem more quickly and efficiently than traditional computing methods.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As it turns out, generative AI also relies on parallel processing. Whenever you query ChatGPT, for example, the AI model has to parse big data sets — the sum total of the world’s text-based online content as of ChatGPT’s last knowledge update — to answer you. To do so in real time and on the scale that companies like OpenAI hope to build out requires parallel processing performed at data centers that house thousands of GPUs. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nvidia realized what it stood to gain from the GPU needs of generative AI early on. Huang has referred to 2018 as a “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/nvidia-ceo-we-bet-the-farm-on-ai-and-no-one-knew-it/">bet the company moment</a>” in which Nvidia reimagined the GPU for AI, well before ChatGPT came on the scene. The company structured its research and development and mergers and acquisitions strategies to benefit from a coming AI boom.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“They were playing the game when nobody else was,” Newman said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition to offering GPUs optimized for that purpose, Nvidia created a programming model and parallel computing platform called the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) that has become the industry standard. This software has made the capabilities of Nvidia GPUs more accessible to developers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So even as Nvidia’s competitors like AMD and Intel have come to introduce similar offerings, even at lower price points, Nvidia has retained the lion’s share of the GPU market for businesses, in part because developers have gotten used to CUDA and don’t want to switch.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“What [Nvidia] understood very early on is if you want to win in hardware, you got to win in software,” Newman said. “A lot of the developers that are building apps for AI have built them and been comfortable building them using CUDA and running it on Nvidia hardware.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of that has positioned Nvidia to capitalize on the ever-growing needs of generative AI.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Can Nvidia keep the good times rolling?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nvidia’s competitors likely don’t pose any immediate threat to its status as an industry leader.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“In the long run, we expect tech titans to strive to find second sources or in-house solutions to diversify away from Nvidia in AI, but most likely, these efforts will chip away at, but not supplant, Nvidia’s AI dominance,” Brian Colello, a strategist for Morningstar, wrote in a recent report. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, Nvidia’s ability to sustain the level of growth it has seen in the last year is tied to the future of generative AI and to what extent it can be monetized.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Anyone can currently access ChatGPT for free, though a $20 monthly subscription fee will give you access to its latest and greatest version. But individual subscribers are not currently where the real money is. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rather, it’s with businesses. And at this point, it’s anyone’s guess how companies will integrate generative AI into their business models in the coming years.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Nvidia’s growth to be sustainable, major companies like Salesforce or Oracle — which sell software to enterprises — will have to offer new software that will “consume tons of AI” to the point that these large companies are signing annual contracts that give them access to the greatest amount of computing power, Newman said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Otherwise, that central thesis of standing up these massive megawatt data centers all over the world full of GPUs becomes a bit of a risk.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So should you buy Nvidia stock? It depends on how bullish you are about AI and its ability to penetrate the economy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We think Nvidia’s prospects will be tied to the AI market, for better or worse, for quite some time,” Collelo writes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On a 6-3 party-line vote, the Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that state officials may accept “gratuities” from people who wish to reward them for their official actions, despite a federal anti-corruption statute that appears to ban such rewards.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote the opinion in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-108_8n5a.pdf"><em>Snyder v. United States</em></a> for the Court’s Republican-appointed majority. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote the dissent on behalf of the Court’s three Democratic appointees.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Snyder</em> turns on a distinction between “bribes” and “gratuities.” As Kavanaugh writes, “bribes are payments made or agreed to <em>before</em> an official act in order to influence the official with respect to that future official act.” Gratuities, by contrast, “are typically payments made to an official <em>after</em> an official act as a token of appreciation.” (Emphasis added.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If that seems like a negligible difference, the facts of this case will probably only underscore that sentiment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The case involves James Snyder, a former mayor who accepted a $13,000 gratuity from a truck company after the city purchased five trash trucks from that company for $1.1 million. Snyder claims that the money was a consulting fee, but federal prosecutors nonetheless charged him with violating an anti-corruption statute.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That statute prohibits state officials from “corruptly” accepting “anything of value from any person, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-108_8n5a.pdf">intending to be influenced or rewarded</a>” for an official act.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Jackson writes in her dissent, the most natural reading of this statute is that it targets both bribes (payments that “influenced” a future decision) and gratuities (payments that “rewarded” a past decision). As Jackson writes,</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">Everyone knows what a reward is. It is a $20 bill pulled from a lost wallet at the time of its return to its grateful owner. A surprise ice cream outing after a report card with straight As. The bar tab picked up by a supervisor celebrating a job well done by her team. A reward often says “thank you” or “good job,” rather than “please.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jackson argues that the statute should be read to prohibit “rewards corruptly accepted by government officials in ways that are functionally indistinguishable from taking a bribe,” much like the payment at issue in this case appears to be.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kavanaugh’s majority opinion, meanwhile, relies heavily on policy arguments and other claims that go beyond the statute’s text. He does attempt to make a textual argument — Kavanaugh notes that the statute at issue in <em>Snyder</em>, like a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/201">different statute that only concerns bribes</a>, uses the word “corruptly” — but his best arguments are atextual.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kavanaugh’s strongest argument is that the law makes it a very serious crime, punishable by up to 15 years in prison, for a federal official to accept a bribe, but federal officials who accept gratuities only risk two years in prison. Meanwhile, the statute at issue in <em>Snyder</em>, which only applies to state officials, applies a 10-year sentence across the board. So Kavanaugh argues that it would be odd to read the law to draw a sharp distinction between bribes and gratuities given to federal officials but to make no distinction when state officials accept a gift.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In any event, the decision in <em>Snyder </em>is narrow. It does not rule that Congress could not ban gratuities. It simply rules that this particular statute only reaches bribes. That said, the Court’s Republican majority also has a long history of <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/558/310/">imposing constitutional limits</a> on the government’s ability to fight corruption and restrict money in politics.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also notable that neither Justice Clarence Thomas nor Justice Samuel Alito, both of whom have <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/samuel-alito-luxury-fishing-trip-paul-singer-scotus-supreme-court">accepted expensive gifts</a><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-harlan-crow-private-school-tuition-scotus"> </a><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-harlan-crow-private-school-tuition-scotus">from politically active Republican billionaires</a>, recused themselves from the case. Thomas and Alito both joined Kavanaugh’s opinion reading the anti-corruption statute narrowly.</p>

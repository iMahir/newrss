<p class="has-text-align-none">Bill Gates <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2373372/#:~:text=Gates%20Foundation%2C%20founded%20in%201994,Learning%20Foundation%2C%20founded%20in%201997.">helped launch a global health revolution</a> at the turn of the 21st century, one in which multilateral humanitarian efforts <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/363716/africa-hiv-aids-sub-saharan-progress">arrested</a> the AIDS crisis in Africa and began to make strides against longtime killers like <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24128530/tuberculosis-vaccine-efficacy-solutions-tb-bcg">tuberculosis</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/9/10/20857132/malaria-eradication-2050-gene-drive-lancet-study">malaria</a>. People in the Global South were <a href="https://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/august-2022/healthy-life-expectancy-africa-rises-almost-ten-years">living longer</a>. A more equitable future appeared within our grasp.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But that progress has since stalled. Between 2000 and 2020, the worldwide child mortality rate <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/goalkeepers/report/2024-report">fell</a> by 50 percent, but it has remained stagnant over the past four years. Global development funding to support health efforts grew by 6.6 percent a year on average from 2000 to 2020, increasing less than $15 billion annually to about $50 billion. But that growth has slowed with the pandemic, falling to just 2.3 percent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/goalkeepers/report/2024-report">a new report from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a> projects global health investments could actually decline over the rest of the decade.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The stinginess comes at a particularly bad time. We are in a critical fundraising cycle for the major global health organizations. <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/358800/gavi-biden-vaccine-congress-foreign-aid">Gavi, the vaccine alliance</a> that provides immunizations to people in low-income countries, is currently seeking $9 billion to replenish its funds for the next five years. <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/1/13/23544865/congress-hiv-malaria-global-fund-replenishment">The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria</a>, which supports prevention and treatment for those diseases in developing countries and was seeded with a donation from the Gates Foundation, will begin its replenishment drive next year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there are real and growing concerns that these groups may fail to reach their fundraising targets.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a result, the world could lose ground against <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/1/15/24036314/us-global-public-health-infectious-disease-covid-19-hiv-aids-pepfar">infectious diseases</a> and especially <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/2/1/24055829/gaza-israel-conflict-hunger-famine-starvation-sudan">child malnutrition</a>, and those challenges are only set to grow in the future. Climate change threatens humanity’s food supply and thus its ability to feed itself. Without intervention, the number of children in the world who experienced stunting is expected to grow by 40 million by 2050 and the number who experience wasting will increase by 50 million.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How can the world get back on track? Gates, as the chair and chief funder of a foundation that has delivered nearly <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/foundation-fact-sheet">$78 billion in grants</a> chiefly for global health programs since 2000, is one of the most influential people trying to figure that out. In a recent interview with Vox, Gates conceded the challenges facing global health advocates, offered his own explanations for why investments have fallen off, and previewed the developments in the field he thinks hold the most promise for regaining the momentum of the early 21st century.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.</em></p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Dylan Scott   </h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You framed the report around the stalled investment in global health that coincided with the pandemic. There seems to be a real realignment within the public and among policymakers in the US and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-66378364">in other countries</a>, the countries that have driven a lot of global health investment. So what is your theory of why that is? How do you change people’s minds back if their views are starting to shift on this issue?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Bill Gates</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The world committed itself to keep making progress in reducing childhood death through <a href="https://www.undp.org/sustainable-development-goals">the UN sustainable development goals</a> that were set in 2015. We were spoiled during that period, between 2000 and 2015, because helping Africa, cutting the childhood death rate, it really had a lot of attention.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There was some low­-hanging fruit in that vaccines were being given in rich countries that we were able to reduce the cost of dramatically and we got Gavi to finance and get them distributed out to a very high percentage of all the world’s children. That’s why we got the childhood mortality cut by a factor of two, from 10 million kids a year dying to under 5 million.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If it was just the pandemic, then getting back on track actually wouldn’t be that hard because the pandemic’s over. The things that are happening alongside that are, first of all, that the African countries <a href="https://www.advocacyinternational.co.uk/featured-project/jubilee-2000">got cleared of their debts around the turn of the century</a>. And that was a super­-worthy cause that predates the foundation. Over these years, though, they’ve built up debts. Now, as macroeconomic conditions have changed, the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/un-chief-warns-africas-inadequate-access-debt-relief-is-recipe-social-unrest-2024-09-05/">interest rates on those debts have gone up a lot</a>, particularly for them because they’re risky borrowers. So African countries are now spending more on interest payments than on health and education combined.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s a pretty dramatic thing. Then the aid levels coming out of the rich countries have actually gone down. That’s a surprise. Rich country budgets are squeezed by wanting to raise defense spending, wanting to help Ukraine, having aging populations with higher health costs, and not wanting to raise taxes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So there’s a squeeze in the rich countries’ budgets, even though aid is <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-every-american-should-know-about-u-s-foreign-aid/">well under</a> 1 percent of the US government budget. We’ve seen cuts in the UK, in Germany, in France, and the European Union.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That is really tragic because the assumption was that as these Asian countries — Vietnam, Indonesia, India —&nbsp;graduated from being aid-eligible because of their economic growth, we’d have more money per person to put into the low-­income countries that remain, which are mostly in Africa. But that has not turned out to be the case.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-text-align-left"><blockquote><p>When somebody says to me the old arguments don’t work, I’m like, “Wow, we don’t care about children dying anymore?” I mean, it seems like, “Oh my God, what the hell?”</p><cite>BILL GATES</cite></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I want to help get those aid budgets up so we can provide the debt relief, so we can fund Gavi. Even Gavi is going to have a tough time raising as much money as it did five years ago. The Global Fund raises every three years, so next year, they’ll be going around. And I don’t know if they’ll be able to raise as much.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s despite the fact that whether you see it through the moral lens or the climate adaptation lens or stopping pandemics before they get to rich countries or global stability — whatever it is, these are the best investments possible.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Dylan Scott</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Does the global health movement need to find a new argument, as we expect these new countries to make more investments?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Bill Gates</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lots of countries have transitioned from low-­income to middle-­income: Brazil, Mexico, and Indonesia, India, Vietnam. Very few countries have transitioned from middle-­income to high-­income. South Korea is this famous example. Depending on where you set the threshold, you could say Chile or Poland are examples. But there’s not that many.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As you move from low-income to middle-, you are self­-sufficient, so you’re not drawing on whatever the aid budget is. As you move from middle- to high-, which China’s right on the threshold of, then hopefully you become a donor in some way. But we haven’t gotten too many new donors. We’re still extremely reliant on five countries: Japan, Germany, France, the UK, the US.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s like 70 percent of the aid right there, even though you have a few like Sweden and Norway who <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/08/foreign-aid-these-countries-are-the-most-generous/">by the percentage of their economy</a> are the most generous at about 1 percent each. But the big money is in the Big Five. But the cuts there are so gigantic, we won’t make up for them with new donors.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When somebody says to me the old arguments don’t work, I’m like, “Wow, we don’t care about children dying anymore?” I mean, it seems like, “Oh my God, what the hell?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I admit that the way that we get to people, including the younger generation, is changing. I think we have to renew our energy and how we connect on this. There’s no substitute for getting people to go see this and come back and bear witness to it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But we are challenged and we admit our message isn’t landing, so we’ve got work to do.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Dylan Scott</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Your report outlines some solutions. You’ve got new technology to increase dairy productivity. You’ve got financing through the Child Nutrition Fund. You’re focusing on making sure food is actually nutrient-­rich. You’ve got prenatal vitamins.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If I were to force you to pick the first action item, keeping in mind this idea that we just don’t have as many resources as we’re used to to accomplish these things, what would you pick?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Bill Gates</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I would say that large­-scale food fortification — where you get people to stick vitamin A or folic acid into foods — the cost of that is super, super low. We have a team that’s expert in that, working with the food makers and really measuring what the vitamin deficits are. That’s a best buy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The idea of these chickens that lay a lot of eggs or cows that make a lot of milk, the beauty of that is once you improve the genetics of the African cows, that’s a gift that keeps on giving. That’s a teaching a man to fish type thing where, as we mix the super productivity of Western dairy cows together with the heat and disease tolerance that African cows have, you can get something that’s 75 percent as productive as a [dairy cow], which is four times the milk productivity of the cows that are in Africa today.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’ll take five years before, say, half the cows in Africa get that, but that’s a gigantic thing because that’s income for women, that’s milk for the kids where malnutrition, vitamin deficiency, and protein deficiency are gigantic. Cheap eggs, cheap chickens, and cheap milk are a big part of this.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We’ve already cut the cost of eggs in Ethiopia in half. We see the poorest households actually using twice as many eggs as they used before because they’ve become a lot more affordable. Those egg factories and milk factories, getting those into Africa in the hands of the smallholder farmers, that’s pretty powerful.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-text-align-right"><blockquote><p>Once you improve the genetics of the African cows, that’s a gift that keeps on giving. That’s a teaching a man to fish type thing.</p><cite>BILL GATES</cite></blockquote></figure>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Dylan Scott</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We are learning more all the time about <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/8/25/6050199/microbiome-human-gut-project-bacteria-probiotics">our gut bacteria</a> and how that influences our digestion and physical health. What potential interventions are in the works to improve the microbiomes of children in the Global South?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Bill Gates</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The probiotic stuff, that’s at an earlier stage. We have to prove out the impact, and we have to get the cost of that down a lot. It’s in our R&amp;D work. If it works as well as we think, if we reduce the cost as much as we think, then we might even want to grow the size of the <a href="https://www.childnutritionfund.org/">Child Nutrition Fund</a> [a UNICEF-led program on child hunger] and add that as an intervention.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We’ve been the biggest funder of research in [microbiomes], including <a href="https://source.washu.edu/2013/01/gut-microbes-at-root-of-severe-malnutrition-in-kids/#:~:text=A%20study%20of%20young%20twins,School%20of%20Medicine%20in%20St.">the original study</a> where we took Malawi twins. We saw that one of them would be on the growth path, one would be off, and then we would look at stool samples or have them swallow capsules and figure out, “Okay, what is the makeup of a healthy microbiome?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The kid whose growth was faltering, what we saw was their microbiome was very different [from their twin] and very inflammatory. Their ability to absorb nutrition was limited, and then you get on a negative path because as you get weaker, you can’t get out of that condition.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One way to intervene is to put the good bacteria in and have them outcompete the bad bacteria, but we don’t know how much we’ll be able to reduce the costs of that. The ideal thing would be to come up with a food-based intervention that’s cheap. We have a trial going on studying <a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/choline/">choline</a>, a nutrient that the good microbacteria thrive on and that the bad microbacteria don’t. It’d be a lot cheaper and more scalable if it turns out that choline, which we can make super cheap and add to vitamin supplements, pushes you toward this non­inflammatory set of microbiota species.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We know that protein pushes you in the right direction, but just saying, “Hey, every kid in the world should have lots of milk and eggs,” that’s way too expensive. We know we can make probiotics way cheaper than that.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Dylan Scott</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’ve been hearing that the global health field itself is changing, emphasizing systems more and specific diseases or conditions less. We used to focus on one problem at a time: PEPFAR being focused on AIDS is maybe the best example of that. People thought, “We’re going to try to address this disease,” or, “We’re going to try to address this particular problem.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But I’ve sensed that there’s been a shift toward supporting systems and supporting institutions. Investing in health system infrastructure, for example, instead of starting a campaign focused on a specific disease. I’m curious if your own thinking about not only how to deliver aid most effectively, but also what type of aid is most likely to lead to a lasting impact, has shifted.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Bill Gates </h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s no doubt that the long-run solution is economic development. Economic growth that allows the government to collect more taxes and therefore fund more health, more education, more infrastructure, that’s the magic thing that India, Vietnam, Indonesia have shown is the way to get to self­-sufficiency. They’ve reduced their malnutrition a lot.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-text-align-center"><blockquote><p>How do we help Africa get on an economic growth path? We need healthier children so that they can go to school and can be productive. </p><cite>BILL GATES</cite></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But you have to say, “Okay, what enables economic growth? Why is Africa in a <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/why-so-much-world-stuck-poverty-trap">poverty trap</a>?” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We know that parents choose to have enough children to have a 90 percent chance of having at least two survive to adulthood. As you reduce childhood death rates, fertility rates <a href="https://ccpr.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Child-Mortality-and-Fertility-Decline_-Does-the-Barro-Becker-Model-Fit-the-Facts_.pdf">go down</a> almost in lockstep. There’s this weird paradox that if children survive, population growth goes down, which is the opposite of the commonsense view.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So how do we help Africa get on an economic growth path? We need healthier children so that they can go to school and can be productive. We need to reduce population growth, and reducing the death rate is your biggest lever to do that. And as you educate girls, that becomes another factor in <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/health/female-education-and-childbearing-closer-look-data">driving that fertility rate down</a>, as is making a contraception widely available.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So these are all areas that the foundation works in. We want to enable economic growth. If you want to reduce children’s deaths, it’s not about some big health system; don’t think hospitals. Africans do not need doctors. They are born, they live, they die, and the majority never meet a doctor, or what the US would call a doctor. You have to look at: What’s killing these kids? What’s causing them to be malnourished?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Four things get you 85 percent of those deaths: malaria, pneumonia, diarrhea, and then a bunch of things that can kill you in your first 30 days. Those are the categories. We’ve made huge progress on malaria, diarrhea, and pneumonia. We haven’t made as much on those first 30 days, and there’s still a lot more to do on that.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No one disagrees that economic development is the end goal. But these very basic health things, that’s how for just $10 per citizen per year, you get yourself to a position where the kids are doing well at school. You’re moving off of the farms into services and manufacturing, and you will no longer be dependent on aid.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">My basic theory has been refined in terms of, “Okay, why did this work so well in Asia and what’s missing in Africa?” But the overall idea of “help them help themselves” is still pretty much the same.</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the past two days, the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah has been targeted with an attack as sophisticated and audacious as it is brutal, with the devices in their own pockets turned into deadly weapons.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Tuesday, <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/372399/pager-explosions-lebanon-syria-hezbollah-israel-gaza">hundreds of pagers</a> distributed by Hezbollah to its members and associates in Lebanon and Syria exploded, killing at least 12 people, including two children, and injuring nearly 3,000. Then, in a follow-up attack on Wednesday, thousands of two-way radios used by the group exploded, killing nine <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/09/18/israel-detonates-hezbollah-walkie-talkies-second-wave-after-pager-attack">people and wounding some 300</a>, some of whom had been attending the funerals of those killed in the earlier attack. There have also been reports of solar energy systems exploding in <a href="https://apnews.com/live/lebanon-syria-pagers-hezbollah-updates">several areas of Lebanon</a>, but few details have been reported about these incidents.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah quickly blamed Israel for the attack. While the Israeli government has not yet commented — it rarely comments on covert actions abroad — experts and media reports are generally assuming it was responsible. It’s hard to think of another regional actor with the ability and motivation to carry out such an unprecedented operation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The attack has stunned former intelligence operatives with both its scale and sophistication. “This is a hell of an opp,” Marc Polymeropoulos, a former CIA counterterrorism specialist now with the Atlantic Council, told Vox. “It’s probably the most impressive kinetic intelligence operation I’ve ever seen.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyond demonstrating the prowess of the Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence agency, what’s less clear is what this tells us about Israel’s overall strategic goals, not to mention how Hezbollah will respond or how this will impact the outcome of this conflict or conflicts in the future. Here are a few of the biggest outstanding questions and what we know about the answers.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">How did they do it?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The emerging consensus from experts and media reports is that small amounts of explosive material were placed inside the pagers. Some <a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-s-mossad-rigged-pager-batteries-with-explosives-before-they-reached-hezbollah-media/3333013">reports have suggested</a> the explosive was detonated by malware that raised the temperature of the batteries in the pagers, but US officials told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-pagers-explosives.html">New York Times that the devices were </a>also implanted with switches that detonated the explosive remotely. According to the Times, the pagers received simultaneous messages on Tuesday that appeared to be from Hezbollah’s senior leadership, but instead caused the devices to beep for several seconds and then explode. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The pagers were from a shipment of 3,000 that Hezbollah says they ordered from Gold Apollo, a Taiwanese company. But Gold Apollo says they were actually made by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gold-apollo-says-it-did-not-make-pagers-used-lebanon-explosion-2024-09-18/">BAC Consulting, a company</a> based in Hungary, and that the Taiwanese firm merely licensed its design and trademark. Reporters have so far been unable to contact BAC, and former intelligence officials who spoke with Vox said it’s questionable whether the company even makes pagers. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah had reportedly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/pagers-drones-how-hezbollah-aims-counter-israels-high-tech-surveillance-2024-07-09/">switched from using cellphones to old-fashioned pagers</a> several months ago to avoid Israeli surveillance. Communications are generally a point of vulnerability for militant groups. Earlier this week, the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/the-crude-system-of-coded-messages-keeping-hamass-leader-alive-c387b580?mod=hp_lista_pos2">Wall Street Journal reported </a>that Hamas’s top leader, Yahya Sinwar, has abandoned electronics entirely and now relies on a system of human couriers and coded handwritten messages for communication.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The attack comes several weeks after the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, reportedly by a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html">bomb that had been planted by Israeli agents</a> in a guesthouse in the Iranian capital months earlier. It also comes several days after a rare raid by Israeli ground forces in Syria that destroyed an <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/09/12/israel-syria-raid">alleged underground Iranian missile factory</a>.   </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“What we have seen over the past two months shows that Israel and its intelligence apparatus have completely infiltrated the most sensitive echelons of the entire Axis of Resistance,” said Charles Lister, senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, referring to the informal name for Iran’s network of proxy militias throughout the Middle East. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It was only a year ago when the reputation of Israel’s intelligence services took a major hit with <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/12/13/23998928/hamas-taliban-isis-attacks-terrorism-extremist-groups-israel-palestine">the failure to anticipate the October 7 attacks</a>, despite abundant signs that Hamas was preparing for a major operation. It’s worth noting that while the operations in Lebanon and Iran were likely carried out by the Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence service, Israeli-occupied Gaza is the responsibility of the Shin Bet, the domestic security service. The Shin Bet official responsible for Southern Israel and Gaza <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/shin-bet-official-in-charge-of-south-resigns-over-oct-7-failures-a-duty-to-apologize/">resigned over that failure</a>, as have <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/idf-commander-unit-8200-yossi-sariel-resigns-7a9d58da">two senior military intelligence officials</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Polymeropoulos said that while October 7 damaged the reputation of Israel’s vaunted spy services, “they have now restored that notion of deterrence based on fear, this notion that Israel has eyes everywhere.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Why did they do it?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Emily Harding, a former CIA analyst and director of the Intelligence, National Security, and Technology Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, noted that prior to October 7, Israel had shifted many of its intelligence resources away from Hamas toward Iran and regional proxy groups like Hezbollah. Over the past year, attention has obviously shifted to Gaza, she said, “but at the same time, they’ve clearly decided they’re not going to tolerate an imminent threat on their northern border” with Lebanon. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even as the war in Gaza has raged, Israel and Hezbollah have been <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24153755/hezbollah-israel-lebanon">exchanging fire over the Israel-Lebanon border,</a> displacing tens of thousands of civilians on both sides. While Israel reportedly backed away from plans to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/how-biden-averted-a-second-front-by-convincing-israel-not-to-attack-hezbollah-on-oct-11-e14a0a3b">launch a major preemptive strike</a> against Hezbollah in the early days of the war, senior Israeli officials, most notably <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-gaza.html">Defense Minister Yoav Gallant</a>, have repeatedly said that a military assault will be needed to deal with the threat on Israel’s northern border.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Earlier this week, Israel’s security cabinet added restoring security to the north as one of its <a href="https://www.abc3340.com/news/nation-world/israel-security-cabinet-updates-war-goals-to-include-stopping-hezbollah-attacks-israel-hamas-war-gaza-airstrikes-lebanon-conflict-hostages-cease-fire-humanitarian-aid-netanyahu">primary war aims</a>. Without referring specifically to the pager and walkie-talkie attacks, Gallant said on Wednesday that a <a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1svmcoar">“new phase”</a> of the war with Hezbollah had begun.   </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The question now is whether the attacks were launched as preparation for some major military action, or whether — contradictory as it may seem — this was conceived as a way to de-escalate tensions by putting Hezbollah on its heels, at least for a little while. For the moment, this second possibility looks more likely. Despite Gallant’s declaration, Israel doesn’t appear to be taking advantage of the chaos in Lebanon to launch a military invasion.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also possible that the timing of the attack wasn’t intentional at all. The Middle East-focused news site<a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/09/exclusive-hezbollah-suspicions-forced-israel-expedite-lebanon-pager-attack?token=eyJlbWFpbCI6Impvc2h1YWVrZWF0aW5nQGdtYWlsLmNvbSIsIm5pZCI6IjY2NjM2In0%3D&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Ungrouped%20transactional%20email&amp;utm_content=Ungrouped%20transactional%20email+ID_6eff8eb5-7544-11ef-b731-b859b7e75d67&amp;utm_source=campmgr&amp;utm_term=Access%20Article"> Al-Monitor reported</a> on Tuesday that Israel had intended to wait longer to detonate the devices but was “forced” to move more quickly by reports that some Hezbollah members were starting to think there was something odd about their pagers.   </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">How will Hezbollah respond?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah has <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/middle-east-updates-new-devices-blast-in-southern-lebanon/live-70244929">vowed to retaliate</a>, saying Israel would receive its “fair punishment for the attacks.” The militia’s leader Hassan Nasrallah says he will give a speech on Thursday to address the “latest developments.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Hezbollah’s ability to strike back may be limited by the state of chaos it currently finds itself in. “They almost certainly have little to no communication or the infrastructure to be able to coordinate not just an initial round of a retaliation, but whatever would come next,” said Lister.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harding predicted that Hezbollah’s next move is likely to be a “big internal mole hunt to try to figure out where their vulnerabilities are.” After the follow-up explosions on Thursday, “they can&#8217;t trust anything that they have right now.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Iran, whose ambassador to Lebanon was among those injured by the blasts — not a huge surprise given the close links between Iran and Hezbollah — has also claimed the <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/iran-says-it-reserves-right-to-respond-after-ambassador-wounded-in-lebanon-blasts/">right to respond</a>. The question is whether this would go beyond the missile strike it launched in April in response to Israel’s bombing of the Iranian consulate, which killed two senior generals. Though that barrage was unprecedented in scale, most of the missiles were intercepted by Israel’s defenses, with the assistance of several other countries including the US, and the attack caused little damage. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Iran President Masoud Pezeshkian also said the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/18/hezbollah-promises-reckoning-for-israel-after-pager-explosions">US shared responsibility</a> for the attack, given its support for Israel, though Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US had no advance knowledge of the operation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">What does it mean for the future of conflict — and is my phone safe?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Washington Post’s David Ignatius wrote on Wednesday that the attacks <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/09/17/pager-attack-israel-hezbollah-lebanon/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9">mark the start</a> of a “very dangerous era in cyberwarfare” in which “any device that is connected to the internet can potentially be transformed into a weapon.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But some perspective is needed. The devices themselves were not weapons. Hackers have <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/mobile/08/05/miller.apple.battery.hacks/index.html">warned in the past</a> that it’s possible to use malware to remotely tamper with or even detonate a device’s battery, but to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/pager-explosion-hezbollah/">cause the kind of damage</a> seen this week, you need old-fashioned explosives. As a matter of technology, this isn’t a huge advance over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/06/world/palestinian-believed-to-be-bombing-mastermind-is-killed.html">Israel’s killing of Hamas bomb maker Yahya Ayyash</a> using an exploding cellphone in 1996. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From a technical point of view, what was impressive was Israel’s apparent ability to “hack” the supply chain and insert explosives into so many devices. There probably aren’t that many situations other than this one where that’s possible. As Axios’s Colin Demarest <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-future-of-defense-thought-bubble-fedbbaa0-75b8-11ef-9608-6bb026eca3bc">writes</a>, referring to worries that the US could be vulnerable to such an attack, “the Pentagon is unlikely to buy thousands of C-4-laden pagers for top brass.” Your iPhone is probably safe, too. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But this week’s attacks represent something radically new in terms of tactics, if not technology. In international law, “booby traps” are <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/100193/law-war-exploding-pagers-lebanon/">prohibited under many circumstances</a>, and given how many devices were detonated and the fact that civilians, including children, were injured and killed, there are questions about whether the attack met international legal standards. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And then there’s the issue of whether other actors — either nation-states or militant groups — might now attempt something similar in the future.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Colin Clarke, director of research at the Soufan Group, a think tank focused on counterterrorism, compared the attack to the early use of deadly drone strikes by the US. Once mainly the provenance of the US, killer drones have <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024/1/29/24055046/jordan-drone-strike-troop-deaths-proliferation">now spread widely</a> to both state and non-state actors.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wars like the current conflict in the Middle East are “often laboratories of innovation for all sides,” Clarke said. “We’re going to see militant groups developing new tricks and trying to leverage emerging technologies in new ways.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given the vast number of connected devices now in homes and businesses all over the world, there’s no lack of potential targets. Even if it would be difficult for anyone to pull off another similar attack of this scale, Clarke said it’s the sort of precedent-setting example that “could give bad people good ideas.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Few things spread faster than innovative ways to kill people in war.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ukraine’s military <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-targets-western-russian-regions-with-drones-russian-officials-says-2024-09-18/">apparently launched a drone attack against a weapons depot</a> in Russia’s Tver region Wednesday, causing a blast detectable from space.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The large-scale attack occurred near the village of Toropets, about 240 miles west of Moscow, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-targets-western-russian-regions-with-drones-russian-officials-says-2024-09-18/">Russian military bloggers</a>. <a href="https://iz.ru/story/udar-vsu-po-mnogoetazhnomu-domu-v-belgorode">According to Russian state media</a>, the attack was so intense the town of Toropets had to be evacuated. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Tver attack follows another showy Ukrainian operation on Russian soil: August’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/russia-ukraine/367298/ukraine-russia-incursion-kursk-war-putin-zelenskyy-crimea">shock offensive into Russia’s Kursk region</a> that has captured <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-kursk.html">about 500 square miles of territory</a>. Both are likely efforts by Ukraine to put itself in a better position to end Russia’s two-and-a-half-year war, which has devastated parts of the country — particularly in the south and east. While no peace talks are currently scheduled, Ukraine’s strategy could theoretically put it in a stronger negotiating position should talks happen, while also damaging Russia’s morale, ability to resupply, and its ability to launch devastating strikes within Ukraine. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ukraine has long argued it could achieve more battlefield victories if the Biden administration would allow the military to use US-made long-range weapons to strike targets further in Russia.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Tver strike and the Kursk incursion are likely meant to send a signal to allies that despite the war grinding on, Ukraine isn’t beaten, and that its allies aren’t backing a lost cause. That’s especially important in the leadup to the November US election, when a change in the White House could affect US political and material support for Ukraine, as <a href="https://punchbowl.news/article/foreign-policy/gop-split-screen-ukraine-war/">former President Donald Trump and other Republican candidates</a> have signaled a coolness to continued material support for the war effort.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Essentially, Ukraine’s message is: We’re doing well in the fight against Russia, and would do even better with more advanced weapons. However, despite Ukraine’s flashy successes since the Kursk offensive, it’s unclear —&nbsp;and possibly unlikely — that the Biden administration will give Ukraine both the materiel and the go-ahead to use it the way they want.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ukraine’s trying to make the most of limited resources, but the US is in a tricky position</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The target of the drone attack, according to Ukrainian sources <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68933778">cited in reporting</a>, was a weapons depot that held conventional weapons like artillery shells and ballistic missiles. Those weapons, as well as the fuel tanks reportedly stored at the depot, could account for the explosive visuals being circulated on Telegram, a favorite platform for Russian military bloggers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Experts note that though the Tver attack has attracted attention due to the size of the explosion, it’s not an isolated strike: “Ukrainian forces are conducting a consistent drone strike campaign into rear areas of Russia, targeting oil refineries and military airfields, military ammunition depots, and logistics facilities,” <a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/press-media/staff-bios/riley-bailey">Riley Bailey</a>, a senior researcher on Russia at the Institute for the Study of War, told Vox. “This one just seems to be very effective.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The successful drone attacks, Bailey said, could <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-strikes-russian-military-base-in-occupied-south-as-offensive-looms-cce9606a">disrupt Russian military logistics</a> within Russia — as longer-range <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA2033-1.html">Ukrainian missile attacks did against Russian military installations within Ukraine in summer 2022</a>. Disrupting logistics and resupply within Russia could,  over time, hamper Russia’s ability to defend itself from attacks on its own soil; mount offensive campaigns within Ukraine; and force the military to rebuild and rearrange its supply capabilities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If there was this persistent threat of Ukrainian forces being able to achieve similar effects at several logistics facilities like this, then that would impose the same kind of operational pressure that Russian forces faced back in the summer of 2022,” Bailey said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ukraine has always been outgunned and outmanned against Russia; without continued US and NATO support, the Ukrainian military can’t continue to fight. But, Ukrainian leadership has long argued, they could do much more significant damage to Russian supplies and strategy if the US allowed them to use long-range weapons to hit targets deep into Russian territory.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The apparently successful Tver attack comes as <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-victory-plan-ready/">Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</a> is set to present his victory plan to US President Joe Biden during a visit to the US later in September. <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/369339/ukraine-zelenskyy-russia-putin-war-biden-sanctions-weapons-negotiations">Though details are scarce, that plan</a> seems intent on using military force to push Russia into negotiations to end the war. A pillar of the plan likely depends on continued weapons support and looser permissions around how those weapons are used. The US has been hesitant to grant those permissions in order to not be seen as <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/sweden-finland-not-to-prohibit-ukraine-from-striking-russia-with-its-weapons-amid-putins-threats-to-nato/">directly involved</a> or escalating the conflict — and therefore <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/369035/kursk-nuclear-escalation-zelenskyy-putin">inviting Russia to do the same</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, fears about escalation haven’t played out on the battlefield, <a href="https://www.rand.org/about/people/c/courtney_william.html">Amb. William Courtney</a>, an adjunct senior fellow at the RAND Corporation, told Vox. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Russian reaction, generally, has not been to escalate,” he said. “It’s been to adapt and try to counter.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But even if the Biden administration allowed Ukraine to use longer-range missiles in its arsenal to attack Russian positions, it might not have a major impact, according to <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/people/jennifer-kavanagh?lang=en">Jennifer Kavanagh</a>, senior fellow and director of military analysis at Defense Priorities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There are not that many Russian military targets in range of even the longer range missiles with additional permissions, and Russia can move valuable assets elsewhere, further reducing any losses from Ukrainian strikes,” she said. Plus, Ukraine wouldn’t be able to get enough of those weapons to mount the kind of sustained attacks that would make a long-term difference in the war.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, Ukraine appears to be pressing ahead with its strategy and <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/us-reassures-but-sense-of-urgency-questioned-by-ukraine-as-6-billion-military-aid-hangs-in-the-balance/">hoping that the Biden administration gets on board with the plan for victory</a> —&nbsp;and that even if long-range capabilities aren’t the key to winning the war, they’ll at least make Russia’s war increasingly difficult and costly to execute.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Islamist militant organization and Lebanese political party, has been in conflict with Israel since its founding decades ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The intensity of the hostilities has waxed and waned, hitting a relative low point before the war in Gaza broke out. The months since October 7, though, have brought a dangerous escalation in fighting that increasingly risks engulfing Hezbollah, Lebanon, and the broader region in all-out war.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire since the war in Gaza started. Hezbollah has vowed not to relent until a ceasefire is reached in Gaza, where more than&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-820486">41,000 Palestinians</a> have been killed. The hostilities have primarily taken the form of airstrikes and have deepened as ceasefire negotiations have stagnated, displacing more than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-war-impact.html?smid=url-share">more than 100,000 people</a> who face daily tit-for-tat attacks on both sides of Lebanon’s border with Israel.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah is allied with Hamas, the Gaza-based group behind the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Both Hamas and Hezbollah have vowed to destroy Israel, have ties to Iran, and are considered terrorist organizations by many countries. While Israeli forces may have significantly weakened Hamas’s capabilities, however, it would likely be much more costly for Israel to go to war with Hezbollah, which is generally considered the most formidable militia group in the region.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah boasts a vast weapons arsenal, including as many as <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/9/20/hezbollah-to-israel-precision-missiles-now-obtained">120,000 missiles</a>, and has deployed it with increasing success inside Israel’s borders since the war in Gaza began. It has demonstrated advanced military tactics such as <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/hezbollah-introduces-new-weapons-tactics-against-israel-as-war-in-gaza-drags-on">using drones to fire missiles at key Israeli targets</a> and effective intelligence capabilities including <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/tool-of-first-resort-israel-hamas-war-in-cyber/">digital espionage</a>. It also has the support of not just Iran’s autocratic regime, but also Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad after it helped him stay in power during the country’s ongoing civil war.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, Israel has exposed some of Hezbollah’s weaknesses. Apparently infiltrating the group’s communications network, Israel reportedly <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/372399/pager-explosions-lebanon-syria-hezbollah-israel-gaza">planted explosives</a> in pagers and walkie-talkies used by members of Hezbollah, detonating them from afar and killing some of its members in Lebanon and Syria. Israel has also assassinated <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-08-13/hezbollah-israel-assassinations">top Hezbollah commanders</a> over the course of the war in Gaza. Deputies of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah have <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/top-hezbollah-official-vows-bloody-revenge-for-attacks-says-nasrallah-will-reveal-all-tomorrow/">signaled that the group will retaliate</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But even so, it’s not clear that Hezbollah wants to be responsible for starting a regional war, especially after the group’s last war with Israel, in 2006, led to such heavy casualties. If anything can be learned from that war, it’s that conflict between Hezbollah and Israel would lead to much bloodshed on both sides as well as challenges for their international allies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nasrallah previously <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-hezbollah-hamas-palestinians-israel-5e09b939ca225562370f779360af62d3">held talks</a> with senior Hamas and Palestine Islamic Jihad leaders in which they concluded that they share a goal of seeking “a real victory for the resistance in Gaza and Palestine” and stopping Israel’s “treacherous and brutal aggression against our oppressed and steadfast people in Gaza and the<a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/11/20/18080034/west-bank-israel-palestinians"> West Bank</a>,” according to a statement they released after. But the groups did not elaborate further on their intentions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a delicate moment for Hezbollah, an organization whose primary goal is eliminating the state of Israel but that has also amassed significant political power in Lebanon that it is fearful of losing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“They can take the whole region into a very hard war,” said <a href="https://english.tau.ac.il/profile/abedkan">Abed Kanaaneh</a>, a professor of Middle Eastern studies at Tel Aviv University and author of <em>Understanding Hezbollah: The Hegemony of Resistance</em>. “But they have their own interests, and they need to sustain their popularity in Lebanon. So they have their own calculations to make.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hezbollah’s origins and ideology, briefly explained&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah was founded in Lebanon in 1982 by men inspired by former Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini’s radical brand of Shia theology. The organization was among many that resisted Israel’s invasion of Lebanon that year following an assassination attempt on the Israeli ambassador to Britain orchestrated by Palestinian militants. Though the assassination was carried out by a rebel offshoot of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), a militant group, Israel sought to eliminate all Palestinian militant groups operating from Lebanon.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Following bloody fighting that left <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1982/09/03/war-casualties-put-at-48000-in-lebanon/cf593941-6067-4239-a453-71bdcaf9eba0/">more than 17,000 dead</a>, Israel succeeded in driving out those militants through a US-brokered agreement in 1983, which brought an official end to the war and allowed the PLO to relocate to Tunisia. But Israel continued to occupy Lebanon, creating a militarized security zone in the south that it maintained until 2000 with the stated purpose of protecting Israelis from attacks by Lebanese militants. The occupation, however, “creat[ed] conditions for the establishment and proliferation of Hezbollah,” by angering and radicalizing the local Shia community, wrote Augustus Richard Norton in his book, <em>Hezbollah: A Short History.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Early Hezbollah supporters rally outside the bombed US embassy in 1986, listening to speeches by political and religious leaders.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel<a href="https://ciaotest.cc.columbia.edu/olj/meria/meria997_eisenberg.html"> set up permanent infrastructure</a> in the security zone — military bases, new roads, road signs in Hebrew, and detention camps that Norton notes became notorious for their brutality. When militant groups, including a fledgling Hezbollah, tried to drive out the Israeli forces, civilians were caught in the crossfire.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile,<a href="https://www.vox.com/iran"> Iran</a> was nurturing Hezbollah, offering it training, funding, and weapons. The Iranian government saw Hezbollah as a vehicle to indirectly attack Israel, which it regarded as an<a href="https://www.stimson.org/2023/what-drives-israel-iran-hostility-how-might-it-be-resolved/"> illegitimate state</a> and encapsulation of<a href="https://theconversation.com/the-long-history-of-iranian-distrust-of-the-west-4480"> Western imperialism</a>, as well as a promising group that could<a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/hezbollahs-record-war-politics"> spread their ideas of Shia Islamic revolution</a> across the Middle East. The willingness of Hezbollah’s early leaders to<a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-hezbollah#:~:text=Hezbollah%20bills%20itself%20as%20a,allegiance%20to%20Iran's%20supreme%20leader."> pledge loyalty</a> to Iran’s then-leaders helped facilitate bonds as well.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah shares Iran’s Shia revolutionary ideology, and they both support Palestinians and oppose Israel. But there is disagreement among experts as to how much Iran is really calling the shots with Hezbollah. Some say Hezbollah is an Iranian proxy;<a href="https://tcf.org/experts/thanassis-cambanis/"> Thanassis Cambanis</a>, director of Century International and author of <em>A Privilege to Die: Inside Hezbollah’s Legions and Their Endless War Against Israel</em>, said their relationship can be described as “very closely allied and ideologically aligned with a lot of shared interests,” but Hezbollah also has a “great deal of its own autonomy” and “shouldn’t be understood as a traditional proxy.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Iran has continued to fund Hezbollah over the years, and while it’s unclear exactly how much the organization has received, the US State Department estimates it at<a href="https://www.state.gov/reports/country-reports-on-terrorism-2021/"> hundreds of millions of dollars</a> annually. Most of that goes to Hezbollah’s military wing, and that figure includes weapons supplied by Iran, including an arsenal of drones and rockets. But Hezbollah also has other revenue sources, both legal and illegal: through the Lebanese state, smuggling, money laundering, and other forms of organized crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah laid out its ideology in a 1985 document addressed to the “Downtrodden in Lebanon and in the World.” It identified the United States and the Soviet Union as being among “the countries of the arrogant world” that inflict suffering on those less powerful, and explicitly rejected both the East and the West. It accused the US of using Israel as a “spearhead” against Muslims in Lebanon, and justified fighting the US, often by violent means, as an exercise of its “legitimate right to defend our Islam and the dignity of our nation.” It laid out a vision for Lebanon as an Iranian-style theocracy, though it emphasized the goal of Lebanese self-determination.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And finally, it opposed any attempts to negotiate with Israel, seeking the country’s withdrawal from Lebanon as the first step toward “its final obliteration from existence and the liberation of venerable Jerusalem from the talons of occupation.” The document made clear Hezbollah saw (and still sees) Israel’s existence as a threat to Muslims throughout the region. In that sense, it found common ground with Sunni Muslim militant groups like Hamas, though Hamas’s reasons for wanting Israel destroyed were slightly different, focusing less on regional factors than on the establishment of an independent state in historical <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Palestine">Palestine</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah has hewed closely to this agenda in the years since, even as it has evolved from a guerrilla group to a more professionalized resistance organization, political party, and provider of social services in Lebanon. It did, however, temper its Islamist rhetoric somewhat in<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-hezbollah/hezbollah-cuts-islamist-rhetoric-in-new-manifesto-idUSTRE5AT3VK20091130"> an updated 2009 manifesto</a>, noting that making diverse Lebanon into a state that follows Islamic law is an unrealistic goal and affirming a commitment to “the achievement of true democracy.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At present, Hezbollah has some<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10703"> 20,000 estimated active members</a> and is popular among the Shia, who represent about a third of the Lebanese population. The most heavily armed non-state actor in the world, Hezbollah has a<a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/security-aviation/2023-10-23/ty-article-magazine/150-000-rockets-and-missiles-the-weapons-israel-would-encounter-in-a-war-with-hezbollah/0000018b-573d-d2b2-addf-777df6210000"> large arsenal</a> of long-range missiles that can reach well within Israel’s borders, as well as a comprehensive air defense system and commando force. It has refused to give up its arms despite<a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20091111-hezbollah-warns-new-government-avoid-arms-issue"> repeated</a> domestic and international calls for disarmament, arguing that it<a href="https://mepc.org/journal/rethinking-hezbollahs-disarmament"> needs its weapons</a> so long as Israel continues to occupy what it claims is Lebanese territory in the Golan Heights (territory that Israel annexed in a move that has been recognized only by the US and no other country).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, Hezbollah faces the challenge of balancing its revolutionary aims with governance — and Nasrallah, who has been at the helm of Hezbollah since 1992, has at times been criticized within Lebanon and the greater Arab world for putting too much weight on the former. But Nasrallah has also proved a charismatic leader and orator who has bolstered Hezbollah’s legitimacy through a sophisticated communication strategy and has overcome harsh criticism before.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“They are cosmopolitan and seasoned professionals, even in pursuit of problematic goals,” said Cambanis<em>.</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is Hezbollah a militant group, a political party, or both?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US designated Hezbollah as a foreign terrorist organization in 1997. Many other countries and organizations have followed suit, though some, including the<a href="https://www.vox.com/european-union"> European Union</a>, distinguish between Hezbollah’s political and militant arms.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some argue that’s a distinction without a difference. Unlike Hamas — in which the political and military leadership are separate and operate out of different locations — Hezbollah is a “very centrally controlled, unified organization,” Cambanis said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Their political leaders all have a military background,” he said. “Their resistance structure, to use their term, necessitates the armed struggle and the political struggle being inextricable.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah became associated with terrorism in the 1980s, during a time when it rejected the notion of participating in Lebanese politics. It viewed the political system, which was designed to split power between the country’s largest religious groups based on their size at the end of France’s dominion, as irredeemably corrupt and unfair. So Hezbollah dedicated itself to pursuing the objective of replacing the secular government with an Islamist one.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Its first step was ridding Lebanon of the foreign influences it believed to be the source of political strife: France and the US. Both countries had deployed peacekeeping forces to Lebanon amid the 1982 Israeli invasion and outbreak of civil war. From the US perspective, the most devastating <a href="https://www.vox.com/terrorism">terrorist attack</a> was a 1983 suicide bombing on its military barracks in Beirut, an event that killed more than 300 American and French troops and Lebanese civilians. The Americans blamed Hezbollah for the attack and pulled all of their forces from the country. There was also the June 1985 hijacking of TWA flight 847 to Beirut, in which militants who later escaped without being captured killed a passenger and threatened to kill more unless Israel released hundreds of Lebanese prisoners. (Hezbollah denies involvement in either incident.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Between 1982 and 1992, Hezbollah took more than 100 foreign hostages, mostly Westerners, seemingly with the aim of winning concessions from Western countries. In one such incident, known as the Iran-Contra affair, then-US President Ronald Reagan traded weapons to Iran, which was then subject to an arms embargo, for the release of hostages held by Hezbollah. Hezbollah also kidnapped Israeli soldiers, conducted cross-border raids on the Israeli border, and fired rockets and missiles into Israel, again with the goal of ending Israel’s occupation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those tactics continued through the 1990s, even as Hezbollah changed its strategy and decided to enter politics. Hezbollah members were elected to the Lebanese Parliament for the first time in 1992, following the end of the 15-year Lebanese civil war that had seen various religious and secular subgroups clash. It was then that Lebanese leaders associated with Hezbollah came to recognize the “need to come to a modus vivendi with the state rather than remain outside the political system and judge it as abhorrent in strictly Islamic terms,” Norton wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Interestingly, Hezbollah built its political following on non-religious themes, which Norton identifies as “battling economic exploitation and underdevelopment, inequities in the political system, personal freedom and opportunity, and, of course, security.” But it wasn’t until after 2000, when Israel finally withdrew from the security zone it had established in southern Lebanon, that Hezbollah really gained popularity.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though Israeli leaders insisted that their withdrawal from Lebanon was a unilateral political decision,<a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/twenty-years-after-the-israeli-withdrawal-from-lebanon-hezbollah-faces-host-of-challenges/"> many Lebanese credited Hezbollah</a> with driving out the army by stepping up its attacks. That — along with Hezbollah’s investment in schools, clinics, youth programs, and other social services — drove up the organization’s profile in Lebanon. It went on to progressively gain seats in Parliament over the years and to run a coalition government alongside its sometimes political rival Amal, which also draws its power from Lebanon’s Shia community. In the most recent Lebanese elections in 2022, Hezbollah won 13 of 128 seats, though the party and its allies lost their majority.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, Hezbollah’s emergence as a political force didn’t mean that the group abandoned its violent tactics, at times undermining its authority as a resistance group. For instance, the United Nations found that four Hezbollah members were responsible for the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in a car bombing that also killed 21 bystanders. And in 2006, the organization killed three Israeli soldiers and kidnapped two others in a cross-border raid. It failed to anticipate the disproportionate Israeli response and the ensuing war, which claimed the lives of more than 1,000 Lebanese and 160 Israelis. Neither side won; a UN-brokered ceasefire ended the conflict after a little over a month.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah has also proved willing to enact violence at the<a href="https://www.mei.edu/publications/hezbollahs-regional-activities-support-irans-proxy-networks"> behest of Iran’s proxy networks</a>, especially following its involvement in the Syrian civil war defending the Assad regime and after the 2020 assassination of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commander Gen. Qassem Soleimani. Hezbollah has deployed militants to other countries — including Iraq and Yemen — to train these proxy groups and fight alongside them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Along with Iran, Hezbollah is closely linked to Syria, though their relationship has been more one of convenience than shared ideology. Syria has long served as a conduit for weapons supply lines between Iran and Syria. As a result and at<a href="https://www.mei.edu/publications/hezbollahs-regional-activities-support-irans-proxy-networks"> Iran’s urging</a>, Nasrallah committed Hezbollah to “<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10703">do everything in [its] power”</a> to protect dictator Bashar al-Assad’s government from largely Sunni rebel groups after civil war broke out in 2011.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah helped turn the tide of the war in Assad’s favor. When they withdrew most of their forces from Syria in 2019, they left <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/israel/2019-03-08/will-hezbollahs-rise-be-its-downfall">arguably stronger militarily</a> than they were before — raising concerns that they could pose a formidable foe should they enter the conflict with Israel.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hezbollah’s standing — domestically and internationally — is not what it once was&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although Hezbollah’s military wing came out of the last two decades of conflict battle-hardened, its violent adventurism has caused its political wing a lot of harm.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah lost some of its luster domestically and regionally as a result of the 2006 war’s death and destruction. In addition to the many casualties, Israeli attacks led to<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-war-cost/factbox-costs-of-war-and-recovery-in-lebanon-and-israel-idUSL0822571220070709"> $2.8 billion in direct damage</a>. While Hezbollah (using funding from Iran)<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-war-reconstruction/lebanons-postwar-reconstruction-far-from-complete-idUSL0922501920070709"> poured hundreds of millions</a> of dollars into compensation and rebuilding efforts, Lebanon<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/broken-lebanon-cannot-afford-war-hezbollah-knows-it-2023-10-26/"> still took years to recover</a>. The organization’s involvement in Syria <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-hezbollah#chapter-title-0-6">hurt it politically</a>, too. In Lebanon, voters believed that foreign intervention had come at the expense of their domestic concerns, and throughout the region, Sunnis expressed great disillusionment with Hezbollah; they saw the group as having propped up Assad, a vicious leader who routinely oppresses his people.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent years, Hezbollah’s political capital has been further reduced by political issues.<a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2020/1/19/21073004/beirut-lebanon-protests-300-injured"> Mass protests spurred by economic troubles</a> undermined support for Hezbollah and the country’s political elites in 2019.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah’s popularity<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/is-hezbollah-overplaying-its-hand-inside-lebanon/"> again took a hit</a> following the<a href="https://www.vox.com/world/21451455/beirut-port-explosion-lebanon-political-crisis-hezbollah"> 2020 explosion of a Beirut port</a>, which the organization controlled.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even before these issues, Hezbollah was a polarizing force in Lebanese society. The organization has solidified Shia support by being effective in local government and supporting social services but has often struggled to expand its sphere of influence. Lebanon is a fractured society, with different religious and secular groups jockeying for power, and Hezbollah is hated by those who oppose its worldview, with little room for a middle ground.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“They are successful at winning very deep loyalty from their supporters,” Cambanis said. “And they’re successful at being able to violently coerce and intimidate their opponents.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a<a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52750dd3e4b08c252c723404/t/618dbc443f3402756b4b3f35/1636678726963/Lebanon+2021+FINAL.pdf"> 2021 Zogby/NC State University poll</a>, 52 percent of Lebanese said they did not think Hezbollah promotes stability, though significant majorities of Shia, Druze, and Christians — all groups with leaders who’ve partnered with Hezbollah in the past — said that it did. The question is whether these cracks in Hezbollah’s support can be contained as the organization faces the prospect of an all-out war with Israel.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Lebanese are okay with the limited war that Hezbollah is [waging] against Israel right now, but if it will become total war or much deeper war, I can say that Hezbollah’s support will drop off,” Kanaaneh said.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Will Hezbollah enter the Israel-Hamas war?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah has been reluctant to engage Israel in open combat since the devastating 2006 war, but the situation in Gaza appears to have changed that. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah has “built their own narrative and public image of being part of the resistance axis” around the Palestinian cause, Kanaaneh said. While it was previously reluctant to declare war against Israel in part because of the suffering it would inflict on Lebanon, the situation in Gaza has become dire.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel has decimated Gaza as well as the ranks of Hezbollah’s Sunni ally in Hamas, its link to the broader Islamic world. The fighting has already had a destabilizing effect on life in Lebanon, with tens of thousands of civilians displaced by the conflict and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/5/lebanese-grapple-with-fear-rage-and-tough-choices-as-regional-war-looms">living in fear</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah and Israel have <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/coming-conflict-hezbollah">exchanged thousands of attacks</a>, mostly in the form of airstrikes concentrated on both sides of Lebanon’s border with Israel. Hezbollah has also deployed forces and fired anti-tank guided missiles at Israel from this border region in <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/coming-conflict-hezbollah">violation of a United Nations resolution</a> passed after the 2006 war. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel has responded with targeted assassinations of Hezbollah leaders. That notably included top Hezbollah commander <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/how-israel-killed-a-ghost-73e6db68?mod=hp_lead_pos7">Fuad Shukr</a>, who was drawn onto the seventh floor of his building in Beirut after receiving a mysterious phone call and killed in a missile strike. The group <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2024-07-09/pagers-and-drones-how-hezbollah-aims-to-counter-israels-high-tech-surveillance">stopped using cellphones after his death</a>, but that move backfired when Israel reportedly targeted thousands of their pagers and walkie-talkies, <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/372399/pager-explosions-lebanon-syria-hezbollah-israel-gaza">hiding explosives inside and detonating them</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Hezbollah opens up a full-scale war against Israel, it could play out much like the 2006 conflict where there were no victors, though it could potentially be even bloodier. In 2006, Hezbollah was estimated to have 12,000 missiles; now, it is thought to have 10 times that. Its troops have far more experience, including in urban combat, than they did before.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Regardless of how any fighting turns out, “everybody will lose from this,” Kanaaneh said. That could include Kanaaneh himself: When we spoke last October, he was living in Israel near the Lebanese border. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rich Johnston, a father of two school-aged children in Atlanta, thought AOL Instant Messenger was bad enough. Johnston recently told me that “away messages screwed with people’s brains,” stressed them out. The self-identified elder millennial also loves the fire hose of information that is X, formerly Twitter, and yes, he knows that’s weird.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Now we’ve got Snapchat and TikTok and Instagram, and that’s got to be worse in 10 years,” he said. “That’s the terrifying part of bringing a kid up in this environment.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He’s not the only one who feels this way. There’s now a nationwide and rather panicked push to keep smartphones out of kids’ hands and teens off of social media, <a href="https://www.vox.com/24127431/smartphones-young-kids-children-parenting-social-media-teen-mental-health">pointing to a correlation</a> between young people spending more time online and an increase in mental health problems. US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/355795/technology-should-social-media-come-with-a-warning-label">even called for warning labels</a> on social media platforms earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This week that panic reached a tipping point.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Congress on Wednesday <a href="https://www.axios.com/pro/tech-policy/2024/09/18/energy-and-commerce-advances-kids-online-safety-bills">came one step closer</a> to passing <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/364127/kosa-social-media-teen-health-anxiety">the Kids Online Safety and Privacy Act (KOSPA)</a>, as tech companies scramble to get ahead of what would be the most significant internet regulation in decades. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And just a day before that bill was set to be marked up in the House, Meta <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/technology/instagram-teens-safety-privacy-changes.html">announced it was revamping Instagram</a> with a new effort called Teen Accounts, which makes accounts of users under 18 private by default, restricts notifications at night, and gives parents options to supervise their kids. It’s not exactly taking Instagram away from teens, but it could dramatically change how they use it. This is the latest move by social media companies to make their platforms a bit less, well, terrifying for parents. YouTube and Snapchat <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/09/17/teen-accounts-parental-controls-setup-instagram/">made similar announcements</a> this month.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether these developments will actually be good for kids remains an open question.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-megaphone-fm wp-block-embed-megaphone-fm"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div><iframe title="Your phone is banned, fellow kids by Today, Explained" src="https://player.megaphone.fm/VMP9434449812" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is all happening against a backdrop where seven states <a href="https://www.kff.org/mental-health/issue-brief/a-look-at-state-efforts-to-ban-cellphones-in-schools-and-implications-for-youth-mental-health/">have passed bans in schools</a>, and another 14 are considering bans. There’s also a wave of cultural pressure, <a href="https://www.vox.com/24127431/smartphones-young-kids-children-parenting-social-media-teen-mental-health">intensified by NYU professor Jonathan Haidt</a>, whose latest book, <em>The Anxious Generation</em>, <a href="https://www.anxiousgeneration.com/pdfs/four-norms.pdf">rallies parents to work together</a> to “swim against the tide of ever-increasing screen time.” One of his collaborators, psychologist Jean Twenge, was one of the first to sound the alarm about the link between youth mental health and time online back in 2017 when she asked in an Atlantic essay, “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/">Have smartphones destroyed a generation?</a>”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To be clear, researchers like Haidt and Twenge aren’t suggesting we simply ban kids from ever touching a smartphone or scrolling through a social media feed. We don’t actually know how such bans or even changes in policy would affect youth mental health. Meanwhile, the school phone bans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/technology/school-phone-bans-indiana-louisiana.html">that have been sweeping the nation</a> don’t govern what parents do at home. We are, however, starting to use the phrase “phone ban” a lot more than we used to.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I hear that talk of a ban as a kind of howl of despair, really, that we’ve lost control,” said <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/media-and-communications/people/academic-staff/sonia-livingstone">Sonia Livingstone</a>, a professor of social psychology at the London School of Economics, who has been studying kids and tech for decades. “We’ve lost control of the feed from the companies, and we’ve lost control of our education and our health and our family life by accepting — as part of whatever kind of Faustian contract — the infrastructure of commerce.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In other words, we’re letting the tech companies win.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Companies like Meta make money by getting their users to engage more with their products, so they can collect data about them and sell targeted ads accordingly. Instagram’s new Teen Accounts might make parents feel like they have a bit more control over how their kids factor into these transactions, but their kids’ attention is still the product.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">KOSPA, however, targets the business models of social media platforms. The legislation, which combines the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) and the Children and Teen’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (COPPA 2.0), would ban targeted advertising to minors, allow users to turn off algorithmic sorting in their feeds, and bumps the minimum age requirement for online accounts from 13 to 17. It would also create a so-called “duty of care” for social media companies that would make them liable for harmful content on their platforms. The definition of what constitutes harmful content <a href="https://publicinterestprivacy.org/2024-09-17-kosa/">is still being hammered out in the bill’s language</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We don’t yet know the fate of KOSPA. Its predecessor, KOSA, passed the Senate in July with a vote of 93 in favor, 3 opposed. Tech companies and their lobbyists <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/09/social-media-lgbtq-teens-harms/679798/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">have been arguing against it</a>, as have free speech advocates who believe it will <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/revised-kids-online-safety-act-is-an-improvement-but-congress-must-still-address-first-amendment-concerns">open the door to censorship</a>. Combined with whatever self-regulation social media platforms decide to do, such sweeping legislation could make it a little less terrifying to raise kids in our increasingly digital world. But it hardly guarantees an end to the youth mental health crisis.</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Kids can learn healthy media habits — and you can too</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">The internet, like parenting, does not come with an instruction manual. There are, however, <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/359987/smartphone-boundaries-kids-tech-social-media-bark-screen-time">resources available to help parents and children</a> develop healthy media habits.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has an entire <a href="https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/media-and-children/center-of-excellence-on-social-media-and-youth-mental-health/?srsltid=AfmBOopLJEwl5MmlEoBYlRzhq7-MEwW0FwkRVqC8vx2mpriHQ_l8oiHt">portal dedicated to kids and tech</a>. A good starting point is the <a href="https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/media-and-children/center-of-excellence-on-social-media-and-youth-mental-health/5cs-of-media-use/">5 Cs of Media Use</a> — Child, Content, Calm, Crowding Out, and Communication — that help you evaluate the specific needs of your child. The AAP <a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/Media/Pages/kids-and-screen-time-how-to-use-the-5-cs-of-media-guidance.aspx">points out</a> that although we’re accustomed to safety standards for childrens’ products, such regulations don’t currently exist for tech. “This means that kids are using platforms and apps that might have been <a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/Media/Pages/social-media-design-4-things-parents-should-know.aspx">designed</a> for adults — not kids at their different stages of development,” according to the AAP.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Parents should also follow <a href="https://www.apa.org/topics/social-media-internet/healthy-technology-use">basic guidelines for healthy digital media use</a>, like turning off notifications, avoiding screens before bed, limiting social media use, and just putting your phone away sometimes. You can live without looking at it for longer than you think.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To do that, Livingstone told me, we should study the causes of youth mental health problems, rather than focus on the consequences of screen time. <a href="https://www.wcwonline.org/Active-Researchers/linda-charmaraman-phd">Linda Charmaraman</a>, founder and director of the Youth, Media, and Wellbeing Lab at Wellesley College, pointed to the surgeon general’s call for warnings on social media platforms as a sign of “a little bit of a hysterical panic.” She also said that solving the mental health problem will require more than a crackdown on smartphone use.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“People want something to stop that rise of mental illness as if this was going to be the magic bullet,” Charmaraman said. “I think it could actually cause people to not look at the other root causes of mental illness.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not just the kids, after all, who are having a hard time navigating life online. Surgeon General Murthy in August <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/priorities/parents/index.html">issued an advisory on the mental health and well-being of parents</a>, and with it, the hand-wringing over kids and tech <a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/parents-are-the-anxious-generation">starts to resemble an ouroboros of anxiety</a>. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/28/opinion/surgeon-general-stress-parents.html?unlocked_article_code=1.GU4.S_UV._LQOgX5BhAXf&amp;smid=url-share">a New York Times essay</a> about the advisory, Murthy even points to “the impact of social media on youth mental health” as a source of mental health challenges for parents.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Stress, loneliness and exhaustion can easily affect people’s mental health and well-being,” Murthy wrote. “And we know that the mental health of parents has a direct impact on the mental health of children.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No wonder everyone’s feeling panicky. As Congress bands together to take aim at kids’ safety online and give parents more control over what their children see and do online, parents are stuck in a feedback loop. They’re stressed out by <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/9/27/23356278/the-pandemic-child-care-inflation-crisis">the child care crisis</a> that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024/5/14/24155209/child-care-cliff-daycare-moms-mothers-labor">Congress still won’t solve</a>. They’re <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/5/3/23707936/surgeon-general-loneliness-epidemic-report">suffering through a loneliness epidemic</a> with <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/366620/loneliness-epidemic-coping-demographics-america-social-connection-mental-health">no end in sight</a>. A <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b7c56e255b02c683659fe43/t/64ac08af6f3dc8123d9b3c45/1688996016873/Caring+for+the+Caregivers_final.pdf">2022 Harvard study found</a> that 20 percent of mothers and 15 percent of fathers reported anxiety, compared to 18 percent of teens. And almost 40 percent of teens said they were “somewhat worried” about their parents’ mental health.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We don’t yet know how changing the way social media works for kids will affect their mental health. There’s a chance that turning off algorithmic feeds will reduce the risk that they’re exposed to harmful content. It’s certainly possible that getting rid of targeted ads will have a positive effect. Better privacy is bound to keep kids safer from strangers online. If nothing else, we’ve at least started talking more about how these platforms work and could work better. And how we could feel better online and off.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“You can&#8217;t protect them from it forever,” Johnston, the dad from Atlanta, said. “So you’ve got to train them how to use it in a smart, safe, non-panic-inducing fashion as best you can.”</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/instagram-teen-accounts/">announced Tuesday</a> that it would begin rolling out measures that restrict what kind of content young people can access, who they can talk to, and how much time they spend on special media. The new measures will begin with an Instagram rollout <a href="https://www.ttclabs.net/report/how-research-and-consultation-informed-instagram-teen-accounts-a-new-protected-experience-for-teens-guided-by-parents">that began September 17 in the US</a>, but will eventually be implemented on Facebook and WhatsApp, too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The new policies include automatically making Instagram accounts of users 16 and under private, limiting who can contact teen accounts or tag them in posts, muting certain words associated with online bullying, and defaulting to the most restrictive content access, as well as encouraging young people to spend less time on the app.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The new protocols come after years of discourse regarding the effect of social media use on young people, with pundits and politicians arguing that social media and smartphones are to blame for a decline in teenagers’ well-being.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Legislation and lawsuits have blamed social media for issues ranging from bullying and suicidal ideation to eating disorders, attention problems, and predatory behavior. Meta’s new policies <a href="https://www.ttclabs.net/site/assets/files/12047/how_research_and_consultation_informed_instagram_teen_accounts-1.pdf">gesture toward those concerns</a>, and some may have positive effects, particularly those geared toward privacy.&nbsp;But they also&nbsp;address <a href="https://apnews.com/article/congress-social-media-kosa-kids-online-safety-act-parents-ead646422cf84cef0d0573c3c841eb6d">the rhetoric of</a> <a href="https://www.naag.org/press-releases/attorneys-general-urge-facebook-to-abandon-launch-of-instagram-kids/">politicians rather than</a> teenagers’ well-being and come even as some experts caution that there’s no causal relationship between youth social media use and those poor outcomes.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Meta is trying to address lots of criticism about its effect on teens</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meta and other social media companies have been subject to intense scrutiny for their perceived ill effects on the mental health and well-being of young people. Cyberbullying, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039">eating disorders</a>, anxiety, suicidal ideation, poor academic outcomes, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/22/us/takeaways-instagram-child-influencers.html">sexual exploitation</a>, and addiction to social media and technology are all concerns that <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/instagram-teen-accounts/">Meta’s new Instagram protocols</a> were&nbsp;designed to address.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent years, reporting — like the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039">Wall Street Journal’s 2021 series Facebook Files</a> — has explored how Meta’s leadership knew that Instagram could be toxic for teen girls’ body image, yet did not try to mitigate the risks to vulnerable users. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy has also placed the blame for increasing rates of depression and anxiety on social media use; <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/sg-youth-mental-health-social-media-advisory.pdf">his office released a report last year</a> warning that social media use was a leading contributor to a decline in young people’s mental well-being.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The report says that up to 95 percent of American children ages 13 to 17 use social media, and nearly 40 percent of children ages 8 to 12 do, too. “At this time, we do not yet have enough evidence to determine if social media is sufficiently safe for children and adolescents,” the report’s introduction states, and cites excessive use, harmful content, bullying, and exploitation as the main areas for concern.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Murthy also called for a surgeon general’s warning label on social media — similar to the one on cigarette packs and alcohol bottles warning about those products’ risk to health — in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/opinion/social-media-health-warning.html">New York Times op-ed</a> in June. The op-ed also called for federal legislation to protect children using social media.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such legislation is already making its way through Congress —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/11/9/23952361/meta-whistleblower-kosa-instagram-teens-congress">the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA)</a>. KOSA passed the Senate in July and is headed to the House for markup Wednesday; it’s not clear whether any version of the bill will end up passing both chambers, but <a href="https://apnews.com/article/congress-social-media-kosa-kids-online-safety-act-parents-ead646422cf84cef0d0573c3c841eb6d">President Joe Biden has indicated</a> that he would sign such a bill if it did.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The version of KOSA that passed earlier this summer would require companies to allow children or teen accounts to turn off targeted algorithmic features and limit features that reward or enable sustained use of the platform or game in question. It would also require companies to limit who could communicate with minors, as Meta’s new policies do; “prevent other users [&#8230;] from viewing the minor’s personal data”; and mitigate and prevent harms to teen mental health.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Senate-approved version of KOSA goes further than Meta’s new teen account policies do, particularly when it comes to young people’s data privacy, and it’s unclear what effect the Instagram Teen accounts will have, if any, on legislation surrounding young people’s social media use.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Who are the new protocols for, and will they make teens’ lives better?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The language in Meta’s press release is geared toward parents’ concerns about their children’s social media use, rather than young people’s online privacy, mental health, or well-being.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The reality is that Meta’s teen accounts, as well as the <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/352251/kosa-congress-online-child-safety-bill-explained">KOSA legislation</a>, can only do so much to address cultural and political fears about what social media does to children’s well-being because we simply don’t know that much about it. The <a href="https://substack.com/@mikemales/p-148585887">available data</a> does <a href="https://www.vox.com/24127431/smartphones-young-kids-children-parenting-social-media-teen-mental-health">not show</a> that social media use has more than a negligible outcome on teens’ mental health.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“A lot of things that are proposed to fix social media are not really questions of scientific rigor, they’re not really questions about health or anxiety or depression,” Andrew Przybylski, a professor of human behavior and technology at Oxford University, told Vox. “They’re basically matters of taste.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Stetson University psychology professor Christopher Ferguson, who studies the psychological effect of media on young people, said that in his view the uproar over social media’s effect on kids’ well-being has all the makings of&nbsp; “a moral panic,” echoing earlier generations’ concerns that radio, television, the role-playing game Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and other new media would ruin the minds and morals of children.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s unclear exactly what metrics Meta plans to use to decide whether the new rules are helping children and parents; when asked about those metrics, Meta spokesperson Liza Crenshaw only told Vox that the company would “iterate to ensure Teen Accounts work” for Instagram users. Crenshaw didn’t respond to follow-up questions by publication time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“These all look like good-faith efforts,” Przybylski said. “But we don’t know if it’s going to work.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now that inflation has cooled, the Federal Reserve announced Wednesday that it is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/18/fed-meeting-interest-rate-cut-decision-live-fomc/">cutting interest rates</a> by half a percentage point.<strong> </strong>That should be welcome news for all Americans in need of a loan: business owners, college students, and anyone looking to buy a home.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Until&nbsp;March 2022, the US enjoyed <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/interest-rate">historically low interest rates</a>. This allowed Americans to lock in an <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/historical-mortgage-rates/#rates-over-time">average mortgage interest rate</a> of just under 3 percent in 2021 — a record low. Today, the mortgage interest rate is over 6 percent.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That high mortgage rate made it harder for many Americans to buy a home. It meant that fewer homeowners wanted to sell and, as a result, buyers were competing for fewer homes while also often facing higher monthly mortgage payments.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because of high mortgage rates and a tight housing market, <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/existing-home-sales/">home sales plummeted</a> from almost 6.5 million in January 2022 to a low of less than 3.8 million in December 2023. Those numbers have only recovered slightly in the months since and remain well below normal levels. Low inventory helped <a href="https://www.wsj.com/economy/housing/u-s-home-prices-hit-record-in-june-for-second-consecutive-month-cbe00c76">drive up median home prices</a> to $426,900 in June, their highest level ever.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, however, many would-be buyers who have been waiting for interest rates to drop may start shopping for a home. But lower interest rates aren’t necessarily going to result in lower prices. In fact, some economists think there is a possibility that home prices — and even rent prices — could actually increase.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There’s a lot of pent-up demand right now from first-time home buyers, so I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if we don’t see a big shift in prices right after the rate cut because there are a lot of people waiting on the sidelines,” said Julia Fonseca, a finance professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.&nbsp;</p>

<iframe frameborder="0" height="200" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP3898315447" width="100%"></iframe>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Why home prices might not come down soon</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In expectation of lower interest rates, mortgage interest rates had already come down from over 8 percent. They could decrease even more if the Fed signals further rate cuts later this year beyond what financial analysts are expecting. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This could lower Americans’ monthly mortgage payments. But housing costs are affected by&nbsp;factors beyond just interest rates. They are also based on availability, and lower interest rates won’t immediately fix this issue. Buyers, especially first-time buyers — who are often competing for a limited supply of starter homes in urban areas — will likely still find that houses are still in short supply.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Part of that is because many homeowners who locked in low rates didn’t want to give those rates up. According to a <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w32781">recent paper</a> by Jack Liebersohn, an economics professor at the University of California Irvine, and his co-author Jesse Rothstein at the University of California Berkeley, higher interest rates meant that homeowners with mortgages were 16 percent less likely to move in 2022 and 2023 than in 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There does seem to be some basis for that hesitation:&nbsp;Lu Liu, a finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania, and Fonseca found that homeowners with a <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4399613">4 percent locked-in mortgage rate</a> save an estimated $50,000 compared to what they would pay with a new mortgage of the same value at a rate of 7 percent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As interest rates come down, it should become easier for homeowners to justify selling because they can obtain a comparable mortgage rate on a new home. This might help increase inventory, but perhaps not to a sufficient degree or quickly enough to make up for what is expected to be a big spike in demand from buyers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Caitlin Gorback, a finance professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said that economic research suggests that, on average, home prices increase by 5 to 10 percentage points for every 1 percentage point decrease in interest rates. Given that, she said, “it is unlikely house prices come down with a rate cut.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What will happen to rental prices?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The forces at play in the housing market also have implications for renters. Liu, Fonseca, and their co-author Pierre Mabille of INSEAD suggest in <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4874654">another recent paper</a> that rents could go up if would-be buyers continue to be shut out of the market.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There is some chance that price pressure is also going to be felt in the rental market,” Liu said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there are some long-term factors that could alleviate this pressure. For one, construction of multi-family housing has slowed considerably because of high interest rates, Liebersohn said. Lower interest rates should make it more affordable for developers to get a bank loan to build apartment buildings.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I&#8217;m really hoping that lower interest rates lead to a surge in multifamily construction,” he said. “That won&#8217;t have an immediate effect on rents, but it will in the long run, and that could be really important.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many apartment building owners also have to get a new loan to finance their properties every 10 years. If they can get new loans at a lower interest rate, some may eventually pass some of the savings down to tenants by not raising their rents as much as they would otherwise.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Both of those factors may be slow-moving, but overall, “it means that if the path of interest rates going forward is lower, then renters will benefit,” Liebersohn said.</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Sen. JD Vance has fashioned himself as a different kind of Republican.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He is an “<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/07/18/jd-vance-world-view-sources-00168984">anti-regime</a>,” “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZbsiKEhy-8">anti-elitist</a>” populist who believes that America’s social order is “tilted toward the few.” He has decried traditional economic conservatism as <a href="https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2023/12/04/jd-vance-ohio-catholic-values-246559">an ideology</a> that “subordinates human life and community to a false ideal of the market somehow existing independent of our society.” His conception of a just economy is purportedly informed <a href="https://thelampmagazine.com/blog/how-i-joined-the-resistance">by Catholic social teaching</a> — specifically, the imperative to be “sympathetic with the meek and poor of the world without treating them primarily as victims” and “protective of children and families and with the things necessary to ensure they thrive.” In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8TlBHRtrvM">his address to the Republican National Convention</a>, Vance suggested that Trump holds similar priorities, lauding him for narrowing the “divide between the few, with their power and comfort in Washington, and the rest of us.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet, many of the Republican ticket’s actual policies bear little trace of this skepticism of markets or concern for the left-behind.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is especially true of Trump’s newly revealed health care plan —&nbsp;or, at least, what the campaign has revealed of it. On Sunday, Vance <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-health-plan-charge-more-preexisting-conditions-concept-plan-j-d-vance.html">disclosed</a> that the new, “anti-regime” Republican Party’s plan for fixing America’s medical system is … to deregulate the health insurance market so that insurers can refuse coverage to those who need treatment the most.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The GOP ticket’s dismally familiar health care plan tells us two things about the party’s ascendant populism. First, it is much more novel in its rhetoric than its governing priorities. And second, even where it plausibly privileges “the many” over “the few,” it does not prioritize the weak over the strong.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Trump’s health care policy privileges the healthy over the sick</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&nbsp;At last week’s presidential debate, Trump conceded that he did not have a health care plan so much as “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/opinion/trump-harris-concepts-obamacare.html">concepts of a plan</a>.” This admission was a political liability: If a candidate who’s been promising to replace Obamacare for <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/249697-trump-replace-obamacare-with-something-terrific/">a decade</a> is still brainstorming his alternative, he might not make the most diligent or decisive commander in chief.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet actually spelling out what the right (still) believes about health care policy might be even more damaging. Or so <a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1835322314923053187">Vance’s remarks</a> on <em>Meet the Press </em>Sunday would suggest.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On that program, NBC’s Kristen Welker asked Vance to explain what — if anything — Trump planned to change about America’s health care system. The Republican VP nominee replied, “He, of course, does have a plan for how to fix American health care, but a lot of it goes down, Kristen, to deregulating insurance markets, so that people can actually choose a plan that makes sense for them.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance proceeded to say Trump would protect people with preexisting conditions and ensure everyone has access to the doctors they need. But he did not specify how Trump would do this. More pertinently, the one concrete policy Vance did detail would actually involve making health care coverage less affordable for those with chronic illnesses. Here’s the relevant part of Vance’s answer:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>[Trump would] </em><em>implement a deregulatory agenda so that people can pick a health care plan that fits them. Think about it: A young American doesn’t have the same health care needs as a 65-year-old American. And a 65-year-old American in good health has much different health care needs than a 65-year-old American with a chronic condition.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>We want to make sure everybody is covered, but the best way to do that is to actually promote more choice in our health care system and not have a one-size-fits all approach that puts a lot of the same people into the same insurance pools, into the same risk pools, that actually makes it harder for people to make the right choices for their families.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance’s sunny rhetoric here disguises his plan’s inegalitarian moral priorities.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is true that the young and healthy have different medical needs than the old and sick. And before the Affordable Care Act’s regulations, the former could sometimes procure cheaper insurance tailored to their (currently) limited needs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But this came at a social cost. Insurers were able to offer cheap health coverage to those who barely needed it by screening out those with preexisting conditions. In Vance’s terminology, they constructed low-risk pools: By only including people who were unlikely to require expensive treatments in their plans, they could profitably provide low-premium insurance to the young and well.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, sick and/or older Americans on the individual insurance market either went without coverage or were forced to pay dramatically higher premiums in order to cover the high cost of their care. Some state governments tried to defray this cost somewhat by subsidizing high-risk pools. But enrollees still paid <a href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/issue-brief/high-risk-pools-for-uninsurable-individuals/">much higher premiums</a> than the typical market rate, and their coverage often excluded the treatments they needed most.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Affordable Care Act effectively forced the healthy to subsidize the sick. It required insurers to include those with preexisting conditions in their plans and cover all medically necessary procedures. To guarantee that insurers could still turn a profit and that coverage remained (at least somewhat) affordable for all, the government provided consumers with insurance subsidies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The upshot of all this was that coverage became a little more expensive for some healthy people, while growing much cheaper for the old and seriously ill. If one believes that we live in a society — in which certain communitarian obligations take precedence over individual freedom — then this would seem like a good trade. Better to make a healthy 27-year-old pay a slightly higher premium than force a cancer-stricken 55-year-old to forgo treatment, or incur massive debts to finance chemotherapy — especially since the former can, at any moment, find themselves in the latter’s predicament.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Notably, Americans already accept this arrangement as common sense when it comes to employer-based insurance, which covers a slight <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/323076/share-of-us-population-with-employer-health-insurance/#:~:text=Percentage%20of%20U.S.%20population%20with%20employment%2Dbased%20health%20insurance%201987%2D2022&amp;text=In%202022%2C%2054.5%20percent%20of,insurance%20from%201987%20to%202022.">majority</a> of the population. A company’s older or sicker employees do not generally pay higher premiums than their younger or healthier colleagues. Instead, all pool their risks together, with the medically fortunate subsidizing those who aren’t as blessed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet, for the minority of Americans who purchase insurance on the individual market, Vance wants to unwind this compulsory solidarity. He aims to increase the entrepreneurial freedom of insurers, and discretion of consumers, at the expense of the needy. Some would say this sounds a lot like a policy that “subordinates human life and community to a false ideal of the market.” Vance evidently disagrees.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Vance and Trump are for the populism of the privileged</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance’s vision for health care policy helps clarify the character of the right’s burgeoning “populism.” On trade and immigration, Vance’s ideology may prize a nationalistic conception of the common good above free markets. But on most economic questions, its iconoclastic rhetoric belies its fealty to conservative orthodoxy — and thus, to “<a href="https://thelampmagazine.com/blog/how-i-joined-the-resistance">the ruling class</a>” whom Vance loves to deride.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Trump’s running mate, Vance is campaigning on <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/07/16/2024/trump-backs-a-corporate-tax-cut-which-jd-vance-opposed-two-months-ago">tax cuts for corporations</a> and the wealthy and deregulation for health insurers. The rest of Trump’s economic agenda is rather hazy. But if his first term is any guide, it would also involve <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/unprecedented-the-trump-nlrbs-attack-on-workers-rights/">curtailing workers’ collective bargaining rights</a>, <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/09/trump-trumka-afl-cio-labor-day-15-ways-hurt-american-worker-populism.html">reducing workplace safety standards</a>, and attempting to <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/05/biggest-outrage-of-trumpcare-continues-to-be-medicaid-cuts.html">throw millions off of Medicaid</a>. Vance has not seen fit to criticize any aspect of this record.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All this raises the question of what, precisely, Vance means when he decries “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2022/01/04/jd-vance-hillbilly-elegy-radicalization/">neoliberalism</a>” and says he wishes to serve the many and not the few. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In my estimation, he offered a clue to his intentions the day before his appearance on <em>Meet the Press</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance’s main preoccupation in recent weeks has been the Haitian immigrant community of Springfield, Ohio, and its <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/371466/trump-haitians-dogs-cats-pets-springfield-alt-right">fictional attacks</a> on longtime residents’ pets. On Saturday, the left-wing commentator <a href="https://x.com/krystalball/status/1835034805303464317">Krystal Ball</a> <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1835080971596841396">took exception</a> to Vance’s hateful rhetoric, which had helped <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/371855/trump-vance-springfield-ohio-racist-conspiracy-theories-haitian-immigrants">inspire bomb threats in Springfield</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance replied to Ball’s critique by <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1835080971596841396">accusing her</a> of believing that “20,000 cheap laborers should be dropped on a small Ohio town.” To Vance, Ball’s intolerance for his demonization of Haitian immigrants proved that she was not really a “populist,” but rather (perhaps unwittingly) a proponent of “neoliberalism.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That latter term is used to describe a <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/7/18/15992226/neoliberalism-chait-austerity-democratic-party-sanders-clinton">multitude of different beliefs</a>. But used pejoratively, neoliberalism denotes a commitment to unfettered capitalism above all else.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Vance, deregulating insurance markets at the expense of the vulnerable is not neoliberal or anti-populist. But arguing that politicians should not spread incendiary lies about immigrants is.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Populism, so construed, is not about supporting the weak in their conflicts with the powerful. “The few” it takes aim at are not the economic elite (whom it wishes to shower in tax relief and regulatory favors), but rather, certain categories of the disadvantaged.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Foreign-born immigrants from poor countries comprise a small minority of the US population. And the same is true of the chief beneficiaries of the ACA’s regulatory reforms. According to <a href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/issue-brief/high-risk-pools-for-uninsurable-individuals/">a 2017 report</a> from the Kaiser Family Foundation, “in any given year, the healthiest 50% of the population accounts for less than 3% of total health care expenditures, while the sickest 10% account for nearly two-thirds of population health spending.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Vance suggests that the interests of native-born Americans take absolute precedence over those of Haitian immigrants — or that the healthy should not have to pool their insurance risks with the sick — he is technically arguing for the many, not the few. (Of course, the idea that immigrants and native-born Americans cannot mutually prosper is contradicted by more or less the entirety of the nation’s history. And the concept of denying health care to the old and sick <a href="https://www.vox.com/21502189/preexisting-conditions-trump-republicans">is deeply unpopular</a>.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Republican ticket’s problem with free markets, meanwhile, is less that they reinforce privilege than that they sometimes erode it. To the invisible hand, the Haitian worker is not morally distinguishable from the native-born one. To Vance, however, the American-born worker who wishes to improve his station through toil and risk-taking is a hero — while the Haitian immigrant who wishes to do the same is a “cheap laborer” and social menace.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To be sure, Vance has occasionally advocated for “populist” policies that <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361417/jd-vance-rnc-trump-vice-president-economy-business">aren’t inegalitarian</a>. But in allying with Trump, he’s whittled his populism down to a reactionary core. The GOP is for the many over the few only insofar as they are for the privileged over the disadvantaged. Vance can call that “anti-regime” post-neoliberalism. I’d call it establishment conservatism.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A few months ago, I <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24131207/kidney-donation-compensation-tax-credit-end-kidney-deaths-act">wrote about a proposal</a> called the <a href="https://www.modifynota.org/end-kidney-deaths-act-summary">End Kidney Deaths Act</a>, which seeks to make sure that every one of the <a href="https://usrds-adr.niddk.nih.gov/2023/end-stage-renal-disease/1-incidence-prevalence-patient-characteristics-and-treatment-modalities">more than 135,000 Americans</a> who get diagnosed with kidney failure every year has access to a kidney transplant.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Its method is simple: a federal tax credit worth $10,000 a year for five years, paid to anyone who donates a kidney to a stranger. It’s the kind of thing that would’ve helped a lot <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/4/11/12716978/kidney-donation-dylan-matthews">when I donated a kidney back in 2016</a>. Elaine Perlman, a fellow kidney donor who leads the <a href="https://www.modifynota.org/">Coalition to Modify NOTA</a>, which is advocating for the act, estimates the measure will save 100,000 lives over the first decade it’s enacted, based on conversations with transplant centers on how many surgeries they can perform with their current resources. Polling has shown this kind of measure has overwhelming public support, with <a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.20180568#page=13">at least 64 percent of Americans supporting a system</a> where a government agency compensates donors.</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">This story was first featured in the <a href="https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup">Future Perfect newsletter</a>.</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Sign up <a href="https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup">here</a> to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since we last covered it, the Act has taken some huge strides forward. It has been introduced in the House of Representatives with two Republicans (Reps. <a href="https://malliotakis.house.gov/media/press-releases/malliotakis-introduces-bipartisan-end-kidney-deaths-act">Nicole Malliotakis</a> of New York and <a href="https://x.com/RepDonBacon/status/1833927860601462914">Don Bacon</a> of Nebraska) and two Democrats (Reps. <a href="https://harder.house.gov/media/press-releases/harder-introduces-bill-to-increase-kidney-donations-and-save-thousands-of-lives">Josh Harder</a> of California and <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/9275/cosponsors">Joe Neguse</a> of Colorado) in support of it. Dozens of supporters took to the Hill last week for a lobby day, meeting with staff for over 50 other senators and representatives.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it’s also started to generate some real opposition. This is to be expected. In the half-century or so that organ donation has been a safe and reliable procedure, many people, including those running some kidney care advocacy groups, have <a href="https://aakp.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/JOINT-PRINCIPLES-STATEMENT-AAKP-ASTS-AST-FINAL.pdf">expressed opposition to the idea of compensating kidney donors</a> for our work. Compensation has been banned ever since the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984, the law Perlman’s coalition seeks to modify. Admitting we’ve made a mistake for 40 years and counting is hard. Each year, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109830152201957X">about 47,000 people die prematurely</a> due to the kidney shortage. Over 40 years, the death toll reaches into the millions. Failing to pay donors has killed a whole lot of people.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Surveying the whole landscape of anti-compensation arguments could fill up a whole book (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ethics-Transplants-Careless-Thought-Costs/dp/019957555X">and has</a>!), so I’ll only address a few here. But none of them are persuasive, and members of Congress weighing the bill should reject these arguments in favor of paying donors fairly for the work we do to prevent deaths from kidney failure.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3 bad arguments against paying kidney donors</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>1) Kidney donation is too dangerous to pay people to do: </strong>This would be a very good argument against donation if it were true — but it’s wildly false. While kidney donation comes with risks, they’re quite small. A <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2822922#google_vignette">just-released study</a> found that the donor’s risk of death in the actual surgery, which was already very low, has dropped by two-thirds over the past decade. For the decade from 2013 to 2022, which includes <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/4/11/12716978/kidney-donation-dylan-matthews">my donation in 2016</a>, there were 58,656 living kidney donors in the US. Five died within 90 days of the operation. That’s a mortality risk of 0.9 per 10,000.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For comparison, in 2022, there were over <a href="https://www.bls.gov/charts/census-of-fatal-occupational-injuries/civilian-occupations-with-high-fatal-work-injury-rates.htm">100 deaths from work injuries for every 100,000 working loggers in the US</a>, a death rate every year that’s about 10 times larger than the one-time risk of kidney donation. Roofers, fishers, and truck drivers all had annual death rates at least twice as high as the risk of death from kidney donation. For sure, these workers deserve better safety protections, just as even five deaths among donors is five too many. But no one would credibly argue for banning the practice of roofing because it’s too dangerous. Why should that argument work for kidneys?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>2) Kidney donation exploits or coerces the poor: </strong>This argument takes a number of forms, but it’s based on the intuition that offering money to donate will disproportionately push poor people to become donors and that this constitutes exploitation because they would not have donated without compensation, and thus are donating in part because of their own financial deprivation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Oxford philosopher Janet Radcliffe Richards notes that this argument, like the one above, proves too much. “It applies to just about all paid work,” she writes in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ethics-Transplants-Careless-Thought-Costs/dp/019957555X"><em>The Ethics of Transplants</em></a>, “Unless you would do your job for no payment … anyone who employed you or bought what you offered for sale would in this sense be exploiting you.” While the idea that all wage labor is exploitative is <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/exploitation/#PreMarxAccoExplUnjuTrad">hardly new</a>, it would be silly to draw the conclusion that wage labor should be banned and that workers should not be allowed to be paid.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A similar but distinct argument is that this kind of payment is not exploitative but coercive: The lure of cash actively forces people to donate, like a blackmailer or extortionist does. This just isn’t what the word “coerced” means. Coercion means using threats or force to limit a person’s options so they do what you want. Paying for kidney donation expands options, rather than limiting them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The late philosopher Alan Wertheimer, who literally <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691637143/coercion?srsltid=AfmBOopbROATQe83H-HW_gKaW_YmpFe8i2MYRfXQAeMKw_3EP3uLTyw2">wrote the book on coercion</a>, puts it bluntly: “Genuine offers do not coerce. Period.” The End Kidney Deaths Act’s offer of money for donors is a genuine offer. It cannot be coercive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I should note that the End Kidney Deaths Act could be altered to avoid this concern. It could be written so that only wealthy people (perhaps those making $400,000 or more) are eligible for the tax credit, so we can be sure they were not exploited. Is that better? Or does it offensively cut off poor people from a valuable benefit? I think the latter.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>3) We’ll get fewer kidney donations if donors are compensated because it will no longer feel altruistic</strong><em>: </em>This is known as the “crowding out” hypothesis, and it was the argument longtime compensation critic <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/08/26/nx-s1-5086459/theres-a-severe-kidney-shortage-should-donors-be-compensated">Alexander Capron made to NPR</a> in their piece on the End Kidney Deaths Act: “When something goes from being something which people give to being something that is bought, the givers stop giving.” The problem is that Capron has no evidence for it. (I emailed him asking for some and never heard back.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When it comes to blood donation, the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0887796321000559">most recent meta-analysis</a> on the topic found that the bulk of estimates point to cash or cash-like incentives increasing it, not decreasing it. In the case of <a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/bloody-well-pay-them-the-case-for-voluntary-remunerated-plasma-collections/">blood plasma</a>, which is more time-consuming and physically draining to donate than whole blood, monetary incentives have proven dramatically and obviously more effective than altruistic ones. The United States and Germany compensate plasma donors, while Canada, the UK, and Australia do not.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sure enough, the latter three countries import a majority of the blood plasma they use from countries where donors are paid. In a shocking twist, paying people for their work results in more work being done.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the kidney case, the same would likely be true. A recent survey conducted by the National Kidney Donation Organization (which represents living kidney donors) of 288 of its members, shared privately with Vox, found that 97.9 percent said they would’ve been as likely or even likelier to donate had they gotten a tax credit.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you believe kidney donors, incentives work. The <a href="https://brieflands.com/articles/num-87026#A87026REF14">country with the shortest kidney waitlist in the world is Iran</a>, which not coincidentally is the only country that currently allows compensation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More to the point, the whole theory that paying people to donate blood or kidneys would make them less likely to do so is sufficiently bizarre that it’s hard to see how it even theoretically could be true, except perhaps at <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2586896">very low levels of compensation</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s no other area of human life where we assume that monetary incentives are actively counterproductive. We do not worry that paying salaries to doctors and nurses will “crowd out” their altruistic reasons for working in health care, or that letting firefighters accept wages “crowds out” their natural desire to save people from burning buildings.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The correct response to “people donate more blood when they’re paid to donate blood” is “well, duh.” And the correct expectation to have about paying people to donate kidneys is that they’ll donate more kidneys.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Enough thought experiments, it’s time for real experiments</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I studied philosophy in college, and I enjoy dissecting the meanings of concepts like “exploitation” and “coercion” and “commodification” as much as the next dork. But I must admit I find the tendency of some philosophers to use kidneys as a kind of playground for thought experiments about the limits of markets to be borderline offensive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Their arguments aren’t just theoretical. They lend respectability to policy statements from practitioners like the jaw-droppingly inane <a href="https://www.declarationofistanbul.org/">Declaration of Istanbul</a>, a joint statement by various transplant doctor and nephrologist organizations that states compensating donors “leads inexorably to inequity and injustice.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The document offers exactly zero empirical evidence for this statement because there is none. “There is no argument whatsoever here, only smoke and mirrors,” Radcliffe Richards rightly notes. “For a major international statement, widely endorsed, this is appalling.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It <em>is</em> appalling, and it has contributed to a situation where each year in the US sees only about 25,500 kidney transplants but over 135,000 new end-stage kidney disease diagnoses. That means some 110,000-odd people, each year, who plausibly could use a kidney donation cannot receive one because there is not enough supply. The way you increase labor supply, in any field, is to raise the wage.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.nursingworld.org/practice-policy/workforce/">Not enough nurses</a>? Pay nurses more. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/02/03/worker-shortage-restaurants-hotels-economy/">Not enough waiters</a>? Pay your waiters more. Not enough kidney donors? Here’s a crazy idea: Pay us.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Correction, September 18, 1:15 pm: </strong>A previous version of this article misstated the Coalition to Modify NOTA’s estimation of how many lives the End Kidney Deaths Act would save. It is now estimated to be 100,000.</em></p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Earlier this month, Nevada’s Supreme Court ruled that <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A262/325988/20240913163035975_Nevada%20Green%20Party%20Application%20Appendix.pdf">the Green Party must be removed from that state’s 2024 ballot</a> because of a paperwork error.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevada law requires people who collect petition signatures seeking to place a “minor party” on the ballot to “verify that they believe each person signing the petition is a registered voter in the county of his or her residence.” The Greens did not comply with this requirement, so a majority of the state supreme court ruled that they cannot appear on the ballot this year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is, however, a slight complication.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When the Green Party originally submitted documents to the Nevada secretary of state’s office announcing its intention to start gathering signatures, they were given improper instructions. An employee of the Secretary of State responded to this submission, and said the party should use a specific form to gather signatures. Unfortunately, this employee attached the wrong signature collection form to that email — the attached form was the form that is used to collect signatures for a ballot initiative (that is, a vote to change Nevada law), not to collect signatures to place a minor party on the ballot.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And so the Green Party is now in the US Supreme Court, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A262/325988/20240913162957159_Nevada%20Green%20Party%20Supreme%20Court%20Application%20for%20Vacatur.pdf">claiming that their constitutional rights were violated</a> because they complied with this employee’s instructions, and were later removed from the ballot because they did so. The case in the Supreme Court is known as <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/24a262.html"><em>Nevada Green Party v. Aguilar</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Notably, the Greens are represented in the Supreme Court by Jay Sekulow, a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/2/3/21120659/trump-impeachment-trial-jay-sekulow-mark-zaid-coup-whistleblower">former lawyer to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump</a>. Sekulow is one of the better lawyers in Trump’s orbit — he’s <a href="https://jaysekulow.com/index.html">argued a dozen cases in the Supreme Court</a>, mostly on behalf of Christian Right causes — and his presence on this case suggests that Republicans are eager to put the Greens back on the ballot in a key swing state.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And why wouldn’t they be? The Green Party is largely a vehicle for leftier-than-thou candidates who <a href="https://dailyorange.com/2020/11/howie-hawkins-unsurprised-election-results-hopeful-green-party/">rarely garner even one percent of the popular vote</a>. To the extent that the Green Party matters at all, it’s because they might attract enough voters who would otherwise support Democrats to swing a very close election. (And the race in Nevada is expected to be <em>very</em> close: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/nevada/">Polling averages</a> currently have the presidential candidates separated by less than a percentage point.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For this reason, it probably won’t surprise anyone to learn that the plaintiff in the lawsuit that kicked the Greens off the Nevada ballot was the state’s Democratic Party. Both major parties are quite aware of the potential that a Green Party presidential candidate could act as a spoiler in this November’s election. The Republicans want to help make that happen; the Democrats want to avoid it at all costs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But what does the law actually say about the Green Party’s bid to appear on Nevada’s ballot?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The short answer is that, if there were no procedural obstacles to the Supreme Court ruling in the Greens’ favor, then they would have a plausible — but not, exactly, airtight — case. In his <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A262/325988/20240913162957159_Nevada%20Green%20Party%20Supreme%20Court%20Application%20for%20Vacatur.pdf">brief to the justices</a>, Sekulow cites some precedents which are helpful to the Green Party, but that hardly compel the conclusion that the party has a right to appear on Nevada ballot.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, there are many procedural obstacles in this case that could prove fatal to the Green Party’s claims. Among other things, Nevada is <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A262/326182/20240917155213549_SCOTUS%20Opposition%20NGP%20v.%20Aguilar-Final.pdf">racing to meet a September 21 deadline</a> to mail ballots to overseas military personnel — a deadline that is set by federal law. If the Supreme Court orders Nevada to change those ballots so close to this deadline, it will probably be impossible for the state to meet it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, it’s always dangerous to bet that this Supreme Court, with its 6-3 Republican supermajority, will rule against the interests of Donald Trump. This is, after all, the same Court that recently said that <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship">Trump has sweeping immunity from prosecution</a> for crimes he committed using the official powers of the president — a form of immunity that has no basis in the Constitution.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are the legal issues in <em>Nevada Green Party</em>?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sekulow’s strongest argument is that the Green Party cannot be removed from the ballot for complying with a state employee’s instructions. In an email to the Green Party, Sekulow claims, a state employee told them to “<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A262/325988/20240913162957159_Nevada%20Green%20Party%20Supreme%20Court%20Application%20for%20Vacatur.pdf">Please use the documents attached to begin collecting signatures</a>.” The Green Party then used the attached document to collect signatures, only to discover later that they’d used the wrong form.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This argument has some superficial appeal — it does, at the very least, seem unfair to punish a party that complied with a government employee’s instructions. Many of the Supreme Court’s past decisions, however, cut against Sekulow’s argument. As the Court said in <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/467/51/"><em>Heckler v. Community Health Services</em></a><em> </em>(1984), “those who deal with the Government are expected to know the law, and may not rely on the conduct of Government agents contrary to law.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sekulow does cite <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14251472317142949199&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr">two</a> <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/379/536/">cases</a> that suggest that someone cannot be charged with a crime if they acted consistently with the government’s instructions. But the Green Party is not accused of criminal activity. The only issue in this case is whether it may appear on the 2024 ballot in Nevada.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At best, in other words, Sekulow is asking the Supreme Court to extend these two criminal cases to a new context, and hold that the Constitution also protects political parties that comply with a government employee’s instructions regarding ballot access from being kicked off the ballot. But there are several very good reasons why the Court should not extend those precedents in this case.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One is that, while the state did provide the Green Party with the wrong form, it should have been obvious to the party that it was sent this form by mistake. The correct form requires petition circulators to certify that they believe each signatory is a registered voter in the county where they live. The form that the Green Party actually used, by contrast, was the correct form to collect signatures for ballot initiatives and referendums. It requires circulators to attest that signatories “had an opportunity before signing to <a href="https://casetext.com/regulation/nevada-administrative-code/chapter-295-initiative-and-referendum/section-295020-requirements-for-individual-documents-of-petitions-for-initiative-or-referendum">read the full text of the act or resolution on which the initiative or referendum is demanded</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It appears, in other words, that the Green Party’s petition circulators all attested, under penalty of perjury, that their petition signatories had an opportunity to read the full text of a ballot initiative that doesn’t actually exist.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Additionally, there are procedural reasons why the Green Party’s request to be put back on Nevada’s ballot should fail. One is the Supreme Court’s conclusion in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/06-375"><em>Purcell v. Gonzalez</em></a> (2006) that federal courts should be cautious about altering a state’s election rules as the election draws close, out of concern that late-breaking changes to those rules could foster confusion about how the election should be conducted.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This Court has not always applied <em>Purcell</em> consistently — frankly, it has historically applied it much more aggressively <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/2/8/22922774/supreme-court-merrill-milligan-alabama-brett-kavanaugh-racial-gerrymandering-voting-rights-act">when lower court decisions benefit Democrats</a> than it has <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/368310/supreme-court-rnc-mi-famila-vota">when they benefit Republicans</a> — but it’s hard to imagine a more compelling case for invoking <em>Purcell</em> than the <em>Nevada Green Party</em> case. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevada is trying to make a Saturday deadline, set by federal law, to deliver ballots to overseas military personnel. It’s now Wednesday. If the Supreme Court gets involved now, it will almost certainly be impossible for Nevada to meet its obligation under federal law.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, according to Nevada Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar, at least one Nevada county has <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A262/326182/20240917155213549_SCOTUS%20Opposition%20NGP%20v.%20Aguilar-Final.pdf">already mailed out military ballots that do not include the Green Party</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s also another, closely related reason why the Supreme Court should rule against the Green Party. The Court has long held that a party forfeits certain relief, even if it otherwise would be entitled to it, if it shows a “<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5537667947736700885&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr">lack of diligence</a>” in asserting its rights, such as by waiting so long to assert a legal claim that the delay itself harms the opposing party. Yet the Green Party <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/nevada-green-party-v-aguilar/">waited an entire week</a> from the Nevada Supreme Court’s September 6 order removing it from the ballot to file its case in the US Supreme Court, rather than doing so immediately.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thus, one of the reasons why it would likely be impossible for Nevada to comply with both the federal deadline governing military ballots, and a US Supreme Court order requiring it to place the Green Party on the ballot, is that the Green Party ran out the clock before seeking relief from the justices.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of which is a long way of saying that, while the Nevada employee’s misleading instructions to the Green Party should raise some eyebrows, a Supreme Court order putting the Green Party on the ballot would be inappropriate.</p>

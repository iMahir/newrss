<p class="has-text-align-none">That momentum — which has grown <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2795948">rapidly</a> in recent years —&nbsp;<a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/07/26/mdma-psilocybin-fda-ptsd/">was widely expected</a> to culminate in the FDA’s approval of MDMA therapy this summer, which would have allowed health care professionals to prescribe supervised MDMA therapy sessions to people with PTSD. Until things went sideways.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead, the FDA declined to approve the new treatment submitted by <a href="https://lykospbc.com/about-us/mental-health-trailblazers/">Lykos Therapeutics</a>, an organization that develops innovations to “transform mental healthcare,” according to a <a href="https://news.lykospbc.com/2024-08-09-Lykos-Therapeutics-Announces-Complete-Response-Letter-for-Midomafetamine-Capsules-for-PTSD">statement published by Lykos</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The FDA is requesting Lykos conduct an additional Phase 3 study, as the agency couldn’t approve the treatment “based on data submitted to date.” In addition, piling on the drama, the day after the FDA’s decision, the journal <em>Psychopharmacology</em> <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/08/11/mdma-ptsd-lykos-maps-retractions/">retracted</a> three studies on MDMA therapy that had been organized by Lykos. The retraction letter cites ethical misconduct at a research site that was <a href="https://maps.org/2019/05/24/statement-public-announcement-of-ethical-violation-by-former-maps-sponsored-investigators/">reported</a> to the FDA and in a public statement in 2019, but not to the journal in particular.   </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The decision will have far-reaching ripple effects. Some psychedelic advocates will have to put celebrations they’ve been planning for decades on pause; others will rejoice at dodging the bullet of Lykos’s spiritually inflected <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/355687/fda-mdma-therapy-maps-lykos-cult">therapy protocol</a> being the one that breaks the dam of psychedelic treatment. The millions of Americans suffering from PTSD will have to wait for a reformulated attempt at MDMA therapy to pass. And the broader momentum of the psychedelic revival will continue teetering on the edge of mainstream acceptance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Overall, though, the decision amounts to more of a delay than a death blow to psychedelic therapy.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">The last-minute drama that derailed Lykos’s MDMA therapy, briefly explained</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lykos Therapeutics <a href="https://news.lykospbc.com/2024-02-09-Lykos-Therapeutics-Announces-FDA-Acceptance-and-Priority-Review-of-New-Drug-Application-for-MDMA-Assisted-Therapy-for-PTSD">received</a> priority review from the FDA back in February, which <a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review/priority-review">fast-tracked</a> the potential treatment for a decision within six months. Even the Biden administration was <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/07/26/mdma-psilocybin-fda-ptsd/">anticipating</a> its approval. If accepted, Lykos’s application would have likely only gained approval for their <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsomega.1c05520?ref=pdf">proprietary formulation</a> of MDMA, not the illicit form of the drug that’s currently considered a <a href="https://www.dea.gov/drug-information/drug-scheduling#:~:text=Schedule%20I%20drugs%2C%20substances%2C%20or,)%2C%20methaqualone%2C%20and%20peyote.">Schedule I substance</a>. That means Lykos’s version of MDMA could have been used in prescribed treatment environments, but general MDMA, or “ecstasy,” would remain illegal outside of medical environments.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, even approval of a pharmaceutical product including MDMA would solidify the idea that MDMA — a drug that carries <a href="https://newyorklegaldefense.com/practice-areas/new-york-drug-crime-lawyers/ecstasy-charges/#:~:text=An%20arrest%20for%20possession%20of,offender%20could%20face%209%20years.">federal penalties</a> of up to three years in jail and a $5,000 fine — can be a real medicine, challenging its designation as having “no currently accepted medical use” by the Drug Enforcement Administration. So FDA approval wouldn’t spell the end of the psychedelic prohibition that began in 1970, but it would provide ammunition for broader efforts to reschedule psychedelics and expand access.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the optimism around approval began to sour in late March, when the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), a nonprofit that evaluates evidence for health care interventions, published a <a href="https://icer.org/news-insights/press-releases/icer-releases-draft-evidence-report-on-treatment-for-post-traumatic-stress-disorder/">report</a> that called Lykos’s clinical trial design into question. They also shared concerns about unreported adverse events and <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/07/19/mdma-for-ptsd-fda-concerned-lykos-clinical-trial-misconduct-claims/">ethical misconduct</a> by therapists during treatment sessions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those concerns reached a crescendo during <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/353752/mdma-fda-approval-hearing-lykos-blinding-misconduct-allegations">an FDA advisory committee meeting</a> on June 4, where a panel of independent experts convened to review Lykos’s evidence and advise the FDA on its ultimate decision. During the nine-hour meeting, panelists expressed significant misgivings about the clinical trial designs, focusing on how difficult it is to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/06/psychedelics-mdma-ptsd-fda-placebo/678588/">establish placebo controls</a> in psychedelic studies. By “blinding” people as to whether they received the active drug or an inactive placebo, they help prevent people’s expectations from biasing their response to treatment, isolating the effects of the drug. But&nbsp;people tend to know whether or not they’ve taken MDMA or magic mushrooms pretty quickly.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Concerns around failed placebo controls, or “functional unblinding,” <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/06/psychedelics-mdma-ptsd-fda-placebo/678588/">are not unique</a> to psychedelic science. But the advisory committee felt these issues cast significant doubt across the positive findings. Beyond the concerns with study design, three members of <a href="https://www.psymposia.com/">Psymposia</a>, a non-profit research and media organization that focuses on psychedelic science and harm reduction, went so far as to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/355687/fda-mdma-therapy-maps-lykos-cult">accuse Lykos of being a “therapy cult”</a> bent on furthering mystical and utopian goals. Ultimately, the advisory committee voted almost unanimously that there was insufficient evidence to support the treatment, and that the benefits do not outweigh the risks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite the criticisms, experts <a href="https://themicrodose.substack.com/p/the-psychedelics-world-reacts-to">across the psychedelics world</a> felt that the functional unblinding issues that concerned the advisory committee had already been discussed in detail by the FDA and Lykos when they <a href="https://news.lykospbc.com/2024-06-13-Lykos-Therapeutics-Statement-on-FDA-Advisory-Committee-Meeting">collaborated</a> on the Phase 3 trial design back in 2017. That included the FDA <a href="https://maps.org/news/media/press-release-fda-grants-breakthrough-therapy-designation-for-mdma-assisted-psychotherapy-for-ptsd-agrees-on-special-protocol-assessment-for-phase-3-trials/">signing off</a> on the methodology to handle placebo controls. The FDA typically follows advisory committee recommendations, but hopes remained that this time would be different.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It was not.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">How to (almost) turn MDMA into a legal therapy</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Classical psychedelics like psilocybin and LSD were made illegal by the <a href="https://www.dea.gov/drug-information/csa">Controlled Substances Act</a> (CSA) in 1970. MDMA was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/01/us/us-will-ban-ecstasy-a-hallucinogenic-drug.html">added to the list</a> in 1985, shortly after it began <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/09/electronic-dance-music-s-love-affair-with-ecstasy-a-history/279815/">spreading</a> across the electronic dance music scene. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/01/us/us-will-ban-ecstasy-a-hallucinogenic-drug.html">felt</a> that MDMA abuse had become a nationwide problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Banning MDMA triggered Rick Doblin, a 32-year-old doing informal psychedelics research, to found <a href="https://maps.org/">MAPS</a> in 1986, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies. He figured that even though it could take decades, the surest way to undo psychedelic prohibition was through FDA approval.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">MAPS began as a non-profit, but <a href="https://maps.org/news/bulletin/a-wholly-public-benefit-model/">launched</a> a separate for-profit arm in 2014, called the MAPS public benefit corporation. The corporation was dedicated to winning FDA approval for MDMA, and eventually, bringing it to market. In early 2024, the MAPS public benefit corporation <a href="https://psychedelicalpha.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/amy-emerson-ceo-letter.pdf">rebranded itself</a> as Lykos Therapeutics, largely because it was pretty awkward to have the original non-profit that still does drug decriminalization advocacy work share a name with a highly regulated for-profit pharmaceutical company focused only on medical treatments.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Two major aspects of Lykos’s submitted treatment plan —&nbsp;using MDMA rather than other psychedelics, and focusing on PTSD rather than other conditions —&nbsp;were calculated decisions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, PTSD affects about <a href="https://www.ptsd.va.gov/understand/common/common_adults.asp#:~:text=About%205%20out%20of%20every,some%20point%20in%20their%20life.">13 million</a> Americans, or 5 percent of the US population. It’s been <a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2017.17080955#:~:text=Pharmacotherapy%20for%20PTSD&amp;text=As%20a%20result%20of%20the,PTSD%20(51%2C%2052).">25 years</a> since the last FDA-approved treatments for the disorder: the antidepressants sertraline and paroxetine. But only about 60 percent of patients <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3278188/">respond to treatment</a> at all, and just 20 to 30 percent shake the disorder altogether. The current <a href="https://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/treat/txessentials/overview_therapy.asp">gold-standard treatment</a> is trauma-focused psychotherapy, where dropout rates <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32284816/">are high</a>, and many patients still retain their symptoms <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2422548">after treatment</a>. Veteran organizations like the Department of Veterans Affairs have been <a href="https://theintercept.com/2024/05/20/va-veterans-mdma-ptsd/">looking to MDMA therapy</a> to help treat PTSD and stem the growing <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/veterans/2022/09/17/veterans-suicide-rate-may-be-double-federal-estimates-study-suggests/">suicide crisis</a> among veterans, creating an opportunity for politicians across the aisle to <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/07/14/ptsd-psychedelic-therapy-research-congress/">work together</a> toward approval.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We had to choose which psychedelic and which patient population would be most likely to be successful from a political perspective,” Doblin <a href="https://www.bostonmagazine.com/health/2019/09/10/rick-doblin/">told Boston Magazine</a> in 2019. “We don’t really do science; we do political science.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While MDMA does pose some physiological risks that classical psychedelics don’t, like <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/substance-use/mdma-effects-on-heart">raising</a> heart rates and blood pressure, the actual subjective experience of being on MDMA is generally euphoric. MDMA helps release a slew of neurotransmitters, like serotonin (<a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22572-serotonin">dubbed</a> the “feel-good hormone”) and oxytocin (“<a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/oxytocin-the-love-hormone">the love hormone</a>”). The rush of positive feelings has always made MDMA a popular club drug. But paired with psychotherapy, MDMA can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7046795/">boost tolerance</a> to traumatic memories by dialing down the mind’s tendency to avoid them, opening a window to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278584617308655">reconsolidate memories</a> that hold fear.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, tripping on the “classical psychedelics” — psilocybin, LSD, DMT, or mescaline — runs a much wider spectrum of possible experiences. Varieties of euphoria are <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2451902224000843">still common</a>. But slipping into a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0293349">long</a> and <a href="https://bulletin.hds.harvard.edu/a-theological-reckoning-with-bad-trips/">hellish nightmare</a>, like an existential thorn in your grip on the world that never dislodges, can happen too, even if only in rare cases. <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23954347/psychedelics-bad-trips-ketamine-mdma-psilocybin-lsd-risks">Bad trips</a> are comparatively less of a concern with MDMA, and therefore can pose less of a public health risk.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By itself, MDMA does not, however, guarantee a good time. Since it can kick up painful memories we normally avoid, MDMA is not immune to bad trips. That’s why Lykos insists on pairing MDMA with therapists who can help support people through difficult experiences, especially in vulnerable populations suffering from depression or PTSD.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Having attending therapists is definitely a good harm-reduction strategy. But they can’t fully eliminate the risks, either. At least one participant in MAPS’s studies reported an increase in suicidal ideation after their treatment sessions, and <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/24/mdma-treatment-ptsd-fda-asked-to-probe-adverse-events/">some controversy has erupted</a> around why that didn’t show up in the published results. And since MDMA can make people <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/39/2/307">more suggestible</a>, the safety and efficacy of the actual therapy protocols are <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2802941">just as important</a> as the drug itself.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But as the former director of the National Institute of Mental Health, Thomas Insel, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/07/25/fda-mdma-ptsd-ruling-shows-need-for-psychotherapy-drug-combined-approval/">recently wrote</a>, “the U.S. regulatory system is not optimized for mental health care,” precisely because we lack a federal agency charged with reviewing the safety and efficacy of psychological interventions, like MDMA’s companion therapy. So MAPS developed <a href="https://maps.org/mdma/mdma-resources/treatment-manual-mdma-assisted-psychotherapy-for-ptsd/">its own therapy protocol</a>, and held it constant throughout its trials to try and isolate the drug effects, which are technically the only part of this treatment the FDA actually regulates.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">MAPS ran two Phase 3 clinical trials, each turning up pretty positive results. The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01336-3">first trial</a>, published in 2021, found that MDMA therapy successfully treated 67 percent of participants, reducing their symptoms to the point where they no longer met the criteria for PTSD. In the placebo group, that number was 32 percent. The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02565-4">second trial</a>, published in 2023, found similar results: 71 percent from the treatment group no longer met PTSD criteria, compared to 48 percent from the placebo group. (Note, however, that even though people likely knew when they were in the placebo group, which just received drug-free psychotherapy, they hit impressive <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062599">treatment rates</a>.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the FDA declined to approve Lykos’s new drug application today, organizations developing similar treatments are <a href="https://psychedelicalpha.com/data/psychedelic-drug-development-tracker">close behind.</a> And even among those who’ve advised against approving MDMA therapy, there’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/353752/mdma-fda-approval-hearing-lykos-blinding-misconduct-allegations">a sentiment</a> that it should <em>eventually</em> get approved. Just not yet, and not like this.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I don’t think we’re quite there yet,” said Kim Witczak, a consumer representative who voted against MDMA therapy during the advisory committee meeting. In an <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240620-fda-advisors-voted-against-mdma-therapy-researchers-are-still-fighting-for-it">email</a> to the BBC, she added: “The time to be cautious is now, not afterwards.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">What happens next</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a <a href="https://news.lykospbc.com/2024-08-09-Lykos-Therapeutics-Announces-Complete-Response-Letter-for-Midomafetamine-Capsules-for-PTSD">press release</a> Friday, Lykos announced receipt of a complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA, which includes details as to why the agency declined to approve the treatment. The letter isn’t available to the public, but Lykos states that the letter echoes many of the same concerns that were raised in the June 4 advisory meeting, and requests an additional Phase 3 clinical trial to study safety and efficacy. Lykos will request a meeting to ask the agency to reconsider, but if they don’t, another trial “would take several years,” the company writes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The FDA request for another study is deeply disappointing, not just for all those who dedicated their lives to this pioneering effort, but principally for the millions of Americans with PTSD, along with their loved ones, who have not seen any new treatment options in over two decades,” said Amy Emerson, CEO of Lykos. “While conducting another Phase 3 study would take several years, we still maintain that many of the requests that had been previously discussed with the FDA and raised at the Advisory Committee meeting can be addressed with existing data, post-approval requirements or through reference to the scientific literature.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But then, the next day, the journal <em>Psychopharmacology</em> <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-024-06665-y">retracted</a> three studies on MDMA therapy funded by MAPS and organized by Lykos, citing protocol violations and unethical conduct during Phase 2 trials at a particular study site in Canada. A number of authors on the papers were affiliated with either MAPS or Lykos.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the “MP4” study site in Vancouver, a therapist treating participants on MDMA during the trial <a href="https://qz.com/1809184/psychedelic-therapy-has-a-sexual-abuse-problem-3">entered into a sexual relationship</a> with a participant after the dosing sessions had ended, but while still providing treatment. The participant later <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/08/11/mdma-ptsd-lykos-maps-retractions/">sued the unlicensed therapist</a> for alleged sexual assault in civil court (the case was later <a href="https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/23-court-dismissed.pdf?_gl=1*1dceqsv*_ga*MTg0ODAyMjY2NS4xNzIzNDk3MzY2*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyMzU1ODA5Mi4yLjEuMTcyMzU1OTQxOS42MC4wLjA.">dismissed</a>). Shortly after the allegations went <a href="https://maps.org/2019/05/24/statement-public-announcement-of-ethical-violation-by-former-maps-sponsored-investigators/">public</a>, MAPS <a href="https://maps.org/2019/05/24/statement-public-announcement-of-ethical-violation-by-former-maps-sponsored-investigators/">submitted reports</a> about the incident to the FDA, cut ties with the therapist, and incorporated a new code of ethics that explicitly forbids sexual contact between patients and therapists in their training program.<strong> </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The retractions don’t affect the Phase 3 trial results that Lykos’s submission to the FDA rested on. But they do contribute to rising skepticism around the strength of MAPS’s data and conduct. While MAPS reported the incident to the FDA in 2019, they didn’t report directly to <em>Psychopharmacology</em> that data gathered from the site of the incident was included in their papers. Some authors disagree with the retraction and feel a correction that gave updated results without including data from that particular site would have been appropriate. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Overall, while no new details about the incident that went public in 2019 have come to light, the timing of the retraction does add to a growing cloud of concerns around whether the internal <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mdma-therapy-maps-lykos-rick-doblin-fda-legalization-trials-2024-5">culture of evangelism</a> at MAPS creates tension with high standards of scientific integrity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whatever happens next with Lykos,<strong> </strong>other companies are moving toward their own new drug applications. One of the <a href="https://psychedelicalpha.com/news/late-stage-psychedelic-trials-a-brief-review-of-the-two-most-mature-psychedelic-drug-development-programs">most likely</a> next applicants, the biotech company Compass Pathways, is pairing psilocybin with “psychological support,” which looks like a more hands-off version of Lykos’s approach to therapy. Meanwhile, states can continue passing <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/360200/how-to-buy-psychedelics-lsd-shrooms-stores">a variety of legislations</a>, from decriminalization to legalizing supervised <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/03/health/psychedelic-drugs-mushrooms-oregon.html">adult use models</a>, like Oregon’s approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Alongside state legislation, psychedelic research in academia will continue its expansion from medical applications, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23972716/psychedelics-meaning-science-psychedelic-mushrooms-ketamine-psilocybin-mysticism">consciousness science</a>, all the way out to <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1082933/full">humanities scholars</a>. Religious groups can continue seeking legal exemptions for their use of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/12/us/psychedelic-drugs-church-religion.html">psychedelics as sacraments</a>. And the psychedelic underground will continue providing access (for both better and worse) to those who manage to find it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The decision will likely put a dent in the valuation of some psychedelic start-ups, and bring on a wave of skeptical press. But Lykos’s failure may actually increase the odds that subsequent psychedelic treatments pass the FDA approval process. Applicants now know where the FDA is going to focus, and how to strengthen their applications in response.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Both <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05624268">Compass Pathways</a> and the nonprofit <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06308653?term=NCT06308653&amp;ra=">Usona Institute</a> have Phase 3 clinical trials — the last step before putting together a new drug application for FDA consideration&nbsp;— underway for psilocybin as a treatment for depression. And a <a href="https://psychedelicalpha.com/data/psychedelic-drug-development-tracker">very long list</a> of organizations have Phase 2 trials ongoing for psychedelics ranging from LSD to 5-MeO-DMT (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/20/us/toad-venom-psychedelic.html">found</a> in the poisonous secretions of a Sonoran Desert toad). More are on the horizon.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So the prospects for psychedelic therapy remain good, if a little frazzled. But at the same time, FDA approval of a pharmaceutical product that can exclusively be used in medical settings will not put an end to the psychedelic prohibition. At least, not in the way that many advocates have been hoping for decades.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Doblin founded MAPS in 1986, Lykos’s ancestor, the idea wasn’t just to eventually produce a new type of prescribable therapy. As journalist Anna Silman recently <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mdma-therapy-maps-lykos-rick-doblin-fda-legalization-trials-2024-5">reported</a>, Doblin envisioned MAPS as a Trojan horse to rekindle the psychedelic renaissance that <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/independentpremium/long-reads/optimism-hippies-sixties-history-hollywood-zen-a9156511.html">crashed and burned</a> in the 1960s by routing it through the FDA. Once approved as a medicine, psychedelics could rise from the underground into mainstream acceptance, opening the door for expanded access outside of a doctor’s office.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But some critics have long <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23721486/ketamine-dmt-lsd-psychedelics-magic-mushrooms-legalization-recreation-psilocybin">been wary of medicalization</a> as the best path toward an equitable psychedelic revival that ever escapes the medical ambit to make the most of their diverse potentials. Psychedelics —&nbsp;used responsibly — can contribute to our perennial <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23972716/psychedelics-meaning-science-psychedelic-mushrooms-ketamine-psilocybin-mysticism">search for meaning</a>, scientific <a href="https://centerforminds.org/">innovation</a>, and even <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1082933/full">expanding</a> our cultural imagination. But those aspects will be undermined if psychedelics get stuck as medicines, and medicines alone.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For a true psychedelic renaissance to kick in, they need to be removed from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. FDA approval is one strategy that could support that process, while treating people in significant need along the way. We’ll see if the next application gets enough escape velocity to not only clear FDA approval, but the medical establishment altogether.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Who are the loneliest people in America?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">American men were said to be in a “<a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/commentary/american-men-suffer-a-friendship-recession/">friendship recession</a>,” with a survey finding the number of men without any close friends increased fivefold since 1990. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gPGxB2FqEc">resurfaced comments</a> from Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. J.D. Vance complaining that the government was being run by “childless cat ladies” who are unhappy they don’t have children drew widespread condemnation from <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jennifer-aniston-jd-vance-childless-cat-ladies/">across</a> the <a href="https://fox40.com/news/national-and-world-news/fox-news-host-challenges-jd-vance-on-childless-cat-lady-remarks/">political spectrum</a>. Last year, the US Surgeon General <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf">released an advisory</a> underscoring the seriousness of loneliness and isolation. While <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/350424/self-care-isolation-loneliness-epidemic">long-term data on loneliness is lacking</a>, recent surveys have found <a href="https://newsroom.thecignagroup.com/loneliness-epidemic-persists-post-pandemic-look">increases</a> in <a href="https://www.psypost.org/massive-meta-analysis-finds-loneliness-has-increased-in-emerging-adults-in-the-last-43-years/#google_vignette">loneliness</a> that predate the pandemic.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the answers to who loneliness afflicts — and the solutions to this complex social problem — are not nearly as straightforward as you might think.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Loneliness is more than just isolation: It’s the subjective experience of craving more social interaction than you currently have. It isn’t binary, either, and no one is immune. Loneliness exists on a continuum, says <a href="https://julianneholtlunstad.byu.edu/julianne-holt-lunstad">Julianne Holt-Lunstad</a>, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Brigham Young University. Most people <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/23744304/how-much-social-interaction-do-you-need-loneliness-burnout">experience loneliness</a> at some point in their lives and labeling people as lonely can be stigmatizing. “It can make you feel bad about yourself, and then make you even less likely to want to socialize with others [out of] fear of rejection,” Holt-Lunstad says, “but it can also then influence how you perceive the world and social situations that can lead to a negative spiral.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Chronic loneliness has severe negative physical and mental effects: Loneliness is just as much of a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316">health risk factor</a> as smoking (one of Holt-Lunstad’s most publicized findings likened <a href="https://www.julianneholtlunstad.com/15-cigarettes">lacking social connection to smoking 15 cigarettes a day</a>) and alcohol consumption; it has <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/JAHA.122.026493">negative effects</a> on cardiovascular and brain health, and may be <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-023-17435-4">linked to</a> an increased risk of <a href="https://evidence.nihr.ac.uk/alert/loneliness-strongly-linked-depression-older-adults/">depression</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rather than point to certain populations as explicitly lonely, understanding what increases someone’s risk for loneliness can help address it on a population level.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">No one is immune from loneliness</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Classic stereotypes of loneliness — like unmarried women or elderly people — fail to capture the myriad experiences contributing to loneliness. Life circumstances have a greater impact on loneliness than other demographic categories. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38687352/">Studies</a> have <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fdev0000117">found</a> levels of self-reported loneliness peak in early adulthood, fall in midlife, and rise again late in life. A 2024 American Psychiatric Association survey found that <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/news-releases/new-apa-poll-one-in-three-americans-feels-lonely-e">30 percent of Americans</a> aged 18 to 34 said they were lonely at least several times a week. The 2023 University of Michigan National Poll on Healthy Aging found that <a href="https://www.healthyagingpoll.org/reports-more/report/trends-loneliness-among-older-adults-2018-2023">37 percent of US adults</a> aged 50 to 80 reported a lack of companionship over the last year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are substantial life changes during emerging adulthood and old age that account for higher levels of loneliness. As young adults graduate from college, move to new cities, begin their careers, and establish their lives, there is a natural culling of relationships, says <a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/for-journalists/faculty-experts/expert/eileen-k-graham">Eileen Graham</a>, an associate professor of medical social sciences at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine, who co-authored a recent study that found loneliness peaks in young adulthood and old age.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Most people experience loneliness at some point in their lives and labeling people as lonely can be stigmatizing</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Young adults are more likely to earn lower incomes; a 2023 Gallup poll also found those in households earning <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/473057/loneliness-subsides-pandemic-high.aspx">less than $24,000 a year</a> said they were lonelier than those earning more. As these young people form adult friendships and romantic partnerships, get married, and start families, there are more opportunities for social contact. By retirement age, people’s social networks begin to wane again: children move out of the house, older adults lose touch with colleagues after they leave the workforce, chronic health conditions may limit one’s ability to leave the house, and loved ones die.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/02654075211059193">Other research</a> has shown that infrequent contact with family, friends, and neighbors may lead to higher levels of loneliness in young adulthood and midlife. Having a local support network helped keep loneliness at bay for older adults.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although gender has perhaps gotten the most attention recently for its connection to loneliness, it’s not as straightforward an indicator as you might think when it comes to lack of social connection. In her study, Graham found women tend to report higher levels of loneliness than men. A 2021 Cigna and Morning Consult survey found that about the <a href="https://newsroom.thecignagroup.com/loneliness-epidemic-persists-post-pandemic-look">same number of men and women</a> said they were lonely; a 2019 meta-analysis reported similar findings — that men and women report <a href="https://pure.manchester.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/135977571/EJP_Gender_Postprint_AAM.pdf">equal levels of loneliness</a> throughout their lives. Following the pandemic, men experienced a greater dropoff in their friendship circles compared to women, with 15 percent reporting <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/why-mens-social-circles-are-shrinking/">having no close friends</a>, which may have <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/18/health/male-loneliness-epidemic-wellness/index.html">contributed to a narrative about a uniquely male loneliness crisis</a>. However, just because men may be physically isolated does not mean they are more lonely.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similarly, marital status is an imperfect predictor for a lack of satisfying social connections. While marriage has been <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2566023/">linked with</a> a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10074686/">lower risk of mortality</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19213848/">married people can experience loneliness</a> when they do not receive emotional support from their spouse, a 2009 study found. Poor-quality romantic relationships can indeed be damaging to well-being, Holt-Lunstad says.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Parenthood can also be an equally isolating stage of life. Nearly <a href="https://newsroom.thecignagroup.com/loneliness-epidemic-persists-post-pandemic-look">two-thirds of parents and guardians</a> are considered lonely, compared to just over half of non-parents, according to the Cigna/Morning Consult survey. Single parents and mothers are more likely to be lonely, the survey found. <a href="https://mcc.gse.harvard.edu/reports/loneliness-in-america">Over half of mothers with young children</a> feel serious loneliness, per a 2021 Harvard report. However, the stage of the child’s life can impact parent loneliness. The newborn phase can be alienating for parents, while adult children may be a source of camaraderie and support.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">People who live alone do <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/25663/social-isolation-and-loneliness-in-older-adults-opportunities-for-the">tend to report</a> higher levels of loneliness, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr199.pdf">research</a> shows. “But those same people are also tending to seek out other sources of social contact,” Graham says. “So just because you live alone, if you’re not married or you don’t have kids in the house, people often are looking to seek out social situations beyond what would be considered the traditional, baked-in sources of contact with other humans.” Alternatively, married people with kids and a rich social life are <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/24006316/feeling-lonely-social-emotional-existential-loneliness-epidemic">not immune to loneliness either</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Physical and mental health also contribute to feeling socially connected. Mental health conditions, like anxiety, substance abuse disorder, depression, and suicidal ideation <a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1262-x">have been</a> linked <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00127-019-01778-8">to loneliness</a>. Regardless of age, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/02654075211059193#bibr22-02654075211059193">having a physical disability</a> is a risk factor for loneliness. “People who have a lot of functional limitations, making it difficult for them to get out of the house,” Graham says, “and people who have more chronic conditions, those also come with age, but we do find that all of those factors are related to being high in loneliness persistently.”</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Loneliness is a wake-up call, a signal to seek social interaction</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another major contributor to loneliness is social marginalization. The Cigna/Morning Consult poll found that 75 percent of Hispanic adults and 68 percent of Black adults <a href="https://newsroom.thecignagroup.com/loneliness-epidemic-persists-post-pandemic-look">were considered lonely,</a> compared to 58 percent of the general adult population. Fewer Black, Hispanic, and Asian adults reported having a <a href="https://www.kff.org/mental-health/poll-finding/loneliness-and-social-support-networks-findings-from-the-kff-survey-of-racism-discrimination-and-health/#:~:text=The%20Prevalence%20of%20Loneliness&amp;text=Among%20adults%20of%20all%20ages,lonely%20in%20the%20past%20year.">strong social support system</a> compared to white adults, per the 2023 KFF Racism, Discrimination and Health Survey. The survey also found that LGBT adults were about twice as likely to feel lonely compared to non-LGBT adults. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analysis found that over half of bisexual and transgender adults in 26 states <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7324a1.htm#contribAff">reported feeling lonely</a>. “What the data suggests is that there is variability even among those classifications, in terms of sexual orientation and identity as well as race and ethnicity,” Holt-Lunstad says.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to address loneliness</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because loneliness can affect everyone, we shouldn’t look to eliminate the experience completely, Holt-Lunstad says. Loneliness is a wake-up call, a signal to seek social interaction. Without that alarm, we would wither in isolation. Paying attention to our social needs and identifying when we’re lacking in support and connection is the first step to addressing loneliness.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Once you recognize you’re feeling lonely, try to pinpoint <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/24006316/feeling-lonely-social-emotional-existential-loneliness-epidemic">what form of social interaction you’re craving</a>: A heart-to-heart with a close friend? An evening mingling with acquaintances at a party? Maybe it’s just to observe strangers in a crowded bar.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Research has found that people were happiest when they <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/23744304/how-much-social-interaction-do-you-need-loneliness-burnout">interacted with a variety of people</a>, from family members and best friends to coworkers and strangers. Make an effort to talk to as many different kinds of people as possible, Holt-Lunstad says. Other <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/28/1/zmac026/6825471">research suggests </a>having a face-to-face, meaningful conversation with someone you love helps stave off loneliness.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because everyone has different social needs — one person may need constant connection to not feel lonely while another is satisfied with a daily phone call with a friend — we need to support our loved ones whenever we can, Graham says. Whether it’s a neighbor who lives alone or a single parent, reach out to those who may be at highest risk for loneliness. “Knowing that there’s somebody there might be enough to mitigate any potential loneliness,” she says. “You have to know your people.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, some good news: In an otherwise polarizing and divisive election, there’s at least one policy proposal that’s emerging as a unifying issue. The bad news is that most experts think it’s a terrible idea.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The proposal in question is to abolish federal taxes on tips. Donald Trump originally <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/07/no-taxes-tips/678971/">floated the idea</a> at a campaign rally in June, and it gained enough traction that “No tax on tips” signs started making regular appearances at Trump campaign events and the Republican National Convention. Now, even his opponent Vice President Kamala Harris has endorsed the idea. “It is my promise to everyone here: When I am president, we will continue our fight for working families of America, including to raise the minimum wage and eliminate taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers,” she <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/harris-supports-eliminating-federal-taxes-tips-rcna166124">told a crowd</a> over the weekend.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a series of social media posts, Trump accused Harris of stealing his idea, <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112948746752564485" rel="nofollow">saying that</a> “she sounds more like Trump than Trump, copying almost everything.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the surface, exempting tips from being taxed might sound like a pro-worker proposal with populist appeal, potentially boosting take-home pay for service sector workers who rely on tips to make a living. But the policy doesn’t really hold up under any scrutiny. And that’s because at best, “no tax on tips” looks a lot less like a tax cut for low- and middle-income families, and a lot more like a subsidy for big businesses.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I’m not at all saying that workers won’t get anything,” said Heidi Shierholz, president of the Economic Policy Institute. “But I think that a meaningful share of the [federal] expenditures on a tax exemption like this will go to the employers of tipped workers.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That might be why industry lobbyists have backed the proposal. “It’s not a surprise that the National Restaurant Association loves this,” Shierholz said, referring to <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/food/2022/02/national-restaurant-association-relief-revitalization-fund-pandemic-mcdonalds-subway-nra/">the lobbying group that represents</a> many of the country’s major restaurant chains.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At worst, the tax policy might even put a downward pressure on service sector wages by allowing employers to keep their workers’ baseline pay low because the tax cut could instead raise the workers’ take-home pay.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think there is no question that it would” weigh wages down,&nbsp; Shierholz said. The only question, she says, is just how much.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So while “no tax on tips” might make for a good sound bite or campaign slogan, it doesn’t necessarily translate to wise policymaking.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tipped workers don’t need a tax cut. They need a raise.</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The problem with tipped wages is not that they are taxed too heavily; it’s how little they tend to pay, and how much tipped workers have to rely on the kindness of strangers to make ends meet. In 2023, for example, the median annual wage for waiters was just below $32,000, <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes353031.htm">according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In fact, <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/untipped-why-trumps-tax-cut-promise-would-hurt-many-service-workers">as the Tax Policy Center put it</a>, eliminating income taxes on tips would do little, if anything, for many tipped workers whose earnings are so low that they are already exempt from paying federal income taxes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s very hard to dispute that the vast majority of moderate and low-wage workers are left out,” said Brendan Duke, senior director of economic policy at the Center for American Progress. “We know that <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/sen-ted-cruzs-no-tax-on-tips-act-does-little-for-low-and-moderate-wage-workers-but-opens-door-to-tax-abuse-by-wealthy/">95 percent of low- and moderate-wage workers</a> don’t get tips, and only about a third of those tipped workers pay income taxes and would benefit from this.” (Duke was specifically talking about <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/sen-ted-cruzs-no-tax-on-tips-act-does-little-for-low-and-moderate-wage-workers-but-opens-door-to-tax-abuse-by-wealthy/">Texas Senator Ted Cruz’s proposed legislation</a> on this issue.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Part of the reason that tipped workers are paid so poorly is that the federal government only guarantees them a <a href="https://webapps.dol.gov/elaws/faq/esa/flsa/002.htm?_ga=2.203883920.166662675.1723482644-1762443955.1723482644">subminimum wage of $2.13 per hour</a>. If along with tips, a worker’s earnings are still below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, then employers have to make up the difference. (Many states and municipalities have wage requirements above the federal minimum, but those <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/state/minimum-wage/tipped">also often include carve-outs</a> with lower hourly minimums for tipped workers.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s why a handful of states have <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/07/donald-trump-proposal-no-tax-tips/">abolished the subminimum wage</a> for tipped workers altogether. Because by allowing employers to pay tipped workers less, businesses essentially pass their payroll burden directly onto their customers. And while most Americans are used to paying tips, those who don’t — or those who at least threaten to not tip — create a hostile environment for workers and make it harder for employees to make a fair wage. Some <a href="https://www.eater.com/a/case-against-tipping">studies have also shown</a> that tipped wages encourage workers to discriminate against people of color, providing them with worse service because of racist stereotypes about who is more likely to leave a generous tip.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Eliminating taxes on tips is a handout for businesses, not workers</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the biggest concerns about doing away with federal taxes on tips is that it would discourage businesses from offering more competitive wages. That’s because if workers’ take-home pay increases because of a tax cut, employers wouldn’t need to provide tipped workers a higher base-line wage. In effect, it’s a tax cut that might mostly subsidize businesses’ payroll costs, not workers’ cost of living. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It will reduce employers’ needs to raise wages,” Shierholz, of the Economic Policy Institute, said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s also the fact that creating a tax carveout for tipped employees could create a major loophole for employers looking to pay people less. Some sectors, for example, can simply become part of the tipped economy, making more of their workers rely on tips rather than a minimum wage.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The policy would “incentivize employers to have more workers be in tipped occupations,” Shierholz said. “[Employers] could reduce the base wages they pay their workers under the guise of doing something for the workers. They could say, ‘We’re making you tipped because you won’t have to pay taxes’ and then in the fine print, it’s like, ‘Oh also, you’re going to be making $2.13 an hour in base wages.’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s why pursuing other policies, like abolishing the subminimum wage, would do much more to increase workers’ pay than eliminating taxes on tips would. The poverty rate for tipped workers in states without a subminimum wage, for example, <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/ending-tipped-minimum-wage-will-reduce-poverty-inequality/">is lower than that in states</a> with a subminimum wage.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If you really want to help tipped workers, there are other ways that are far, far better,” Shierholz said, adding that federal dollars would be better directed toward programs like the Child Tax Credit or the Earned Income Tax Credit, which would be much better at targeting workers who need it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So if politicians are looking to tout a pro-worker agenda, they should point to policies that can actually raise people’s wages, as Harris did by also endorsing raising the minimum wage. Otherwise, they might just be pushing for yet another tax cut for the rich. After all, that might be why <a href="https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-colleagues-introduce-no-tax-on-tips-act">major business lobbying groups</a> have endorsed “no tax on tips” — to avoid actually raising workers’ wages.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When you look at what the right’s rising leaders are saying, it’s clear that conservatives have become increasingly <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/363543/pronatalism-vance-birth-rates-population-decline-fertility">obsessed with the fate of the American family</a>. From Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance assailing “<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/dear-j-d-vance-childless-cat-ladies-are-people-too.html">childless cat ladies</a>” to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-elon-musk-population-collapse-baby-push/#:~:text=In%202022%20he%20tweeted%20that,a%20bang%20or%20a%20whimper%3F">Elon Musk fretting about a birth rate apocalypse</a>, there is a deep and abiding sense that the family is in dire need of defense.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Recently, a loose group of conservatives has emerged with a solution: that the family can be defended by boldly reasserting the importance of old-school gender roles. The movement tells men to be strong and women to have babies without overtly insisting that women must submit to their husbands or stay at home. It’s an effort to revive an older model of gender relations without the explicitly sexist baggage (though it often resurfaces in a more subtle form).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I call this loose movement “neopatriarchy,” and have come to believe that it is at the root of both some of the modern right’s biggest ideas and its most interesting internal conflicts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Concerns about the family’s health are hardly new on the right. Speaking in 1977, <a href="https://imprimis.hillsdale.edu/the-little-platoon-we-belong-to-in-society-november-1977/">influential conservative writer Russell Kirk</a> claimed that <a href="https://www.npr.org/transcripts/497850292">a nearly enacted universal daycare bill</a> threatened to disintegrate the family and substitute the state.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We would be foolish to ignore a drift in what we call ‘the West’ toward the supplanting of the family by the Universal Orphanage,” Kirk said, warning that the daycare bill specifically “would have encouraged even affluent mothers to consign their little children to the baby-bin and spend their days at bridge-clubs.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kirk’s fears reflected the central conservative preoccupation of the time: the threat from communism and the ever-growing powers of the modern state. It was “compulsory collectivism,” for Kirk, that threatened to tear familial bonds apart.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Modern neopatriarchy begins from the opposite fear; the concern is not communist collectivism, but liberal individualism.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The neopatriarchs believe we live in an age where people prioritize self-actualization and fulfillment above all else. Young adults, they argue, live in extended adolescence, lost in some combination of video games, drugs, and casual sex; as they age, raw hedonism is replaced by single-minded foci on money and career. According to neopatriarchs, this liberal social model fails men and women alike, funneling them toward a spiritually empty existence that all but guarantees disappointment and depression, and it fails society by discouraging the production of children who are quite literally required if the country is to have a future. (Immigration, needless to say, is not seen as an acceptable solution.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The solution, for neopatriarchs, is to return to the past. Men need to rediscover the old John Wayne vision of masculinity, making traditional male gender markers (including acting as fatherly provider) into defining aspects of their identity. The state should play a role in encouraging this reversion, primarily by changing policy to cultivate “masculine” virtues and incentivizing marriage and child-rearing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In his recent book <em>Manhood</em>, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2023/05/18/manhood-josh-hawley-review/">urges men</a> to embrace strength and stoicism as routes for self-improvement, calling on them to take on the roles of “warrior” and “builder” in their everyday lives. The psychologist Jordan Peterson has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/jordan-peterson-is-on-a-crusade-to-toughen-up-young-men-its-landed-him-on-our-cultural-divide/2018/05/02/c5bafe48-31d6-11e8-94fa-32d48460b955_story.html">long dispensed similar advice</a>, helping turn him into a conservative guru. In his forthcoming book <em>Dawn’s Early Light</em>, Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts argues that <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/kevin-roberts/forthcoming-book-heritage-president-rails-against-birth-control-ivf-abortion">contraceptive technologies</a> “break the most basic functioning elements of civilization” by liberating individuals to have consequence-free sex out of wedlock. Vance, who wrote the forward to Roberts’s book, has mused about <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/08/04/no-fault-divorce-jd-vance-women/">eliminating no-fault divorce</a> for similar neopatriarchal reasons.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Neopatriarchy can be distinguished from straight-up patriarchy primarily through its treatment of women. Unlike some Christian fundamentalists or <a href="https://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2023/02/what-is-the-longhouse">alt-right scribblers</a>, neopatriarchs do not assert that women are <em>obligated</em> to be homemakers as a result of divine commandment or natural law. All they insist on explicitly is that women have lots of children, and that choosing to focus primarily on raising said children is <em>no worse</em> than having a career.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s obvious why liberals and leftists would have problems taking this seriously. If Americans are supposed to be having more kids, and American men are supposed to be more traditionally masculine, then who’s supposed to be doing the work of raising all of these kids? The answer, of course, is wives (as it’s certainly not immigrants). Neopatrarichy may not explicitly call for a reversal of the feminist revolution, but that’s basically what it’s going for.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, neopatriarchal writing rarely floats the idea that more men should be homemakers&nbsp;— and <a href="https://ifstudies.org/blog/are-stay-at-home-mothers-really-miserable">often suggests</a> that women are <a href="https://x.com/BradWilcoxIFS/status/1673843339471233024">happier at home</a>. The choice to work is theoretically left up to women, but the traditional option is at the very least suggested. The neopatriarchal vision for women is thus most clearly expressed through popular “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/27/us/tradwife-1950s-nostalgia-tiktok-cec/index.html">tradwife</a>” and <a href="https://www.vox.com/23960702/big-family-ballerina-farm-hannah-neeleman-dougherty-dozen-instagram-tiktok-influencers">big-family</a> TikTok influencers: women who became social media evangelists for a family-first lifestyle, occasionally giving up formal careers in order to do so.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it’s not just feminists who have problems with neopatriarchy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s a class of conservatives, mostly men, who despise the left primarily because it tells them what to do: that it’s offensive to ogle women or use male pronouns for a transgender woman. This group, famously termed “<a href="https://theweek.com/articles/964006/rise-barstool-conservatives">Barstool conservatives</a>” after the bro-y Barstool Sports website, enjoys partying and casual sex&nbsp;— and resents people telling them to knock it off.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This has led to some real skepticism about neopatriarchal ideas. When Vance’s comments calling for non-parents to pay a higher tax rate came to light, Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy called Vance a “<a href="https://x.com/stoolpresidente/status/1816933121884856689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1816933121884856689%7Ctwgr%5Eee54b39f9b04128b26d92126a1259d3808bd4af8%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fpolitics%2Fjd-vance-slaps-back-at-dave-portnoy-after-barstool-founder-says-trumps-vp-sounds-like-a-moron%2F">moron</a>” in a post on Twitter/X.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“You want me to pay more taxes to take care of other people’s kids? We sure this dude is a Republican?” Portnoy asked. “If you can’t afford a big family don’t have a ton of kids.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With Republicans out of the White House, these divisions have <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/1/10/24024341/calendargate-conservative-civil-war">largely</a> been confined to posting wars. But should Trump retake the presidency, his administration would likely include prominent neopatriarchical voices —&nbsp;including Vance himself. That would launch a high-stakes national debate over an issue some may have thought settled: whether the state should favor families with traditional gender roles.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Trump campaign claims it was hacked by Iran —&nbsp;though what information the accused hackers actually obtained, if anything, is unclear. The FBI is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fbi-says-it-is-investigating-hack-trump-campaign-blamed-iran-2024-08-12/">reportedly looking into the matter</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s what we know for sure: <a href="https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/content/microsoftcorp/microsoft/final/en-us/microsoft-brand/documents/5bc57431-a7a9-49ad-944d-b93b7d35d0fc.pdf">In a report released last Friday, Microsoft</a> claimed it caught a group with ties to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) using a “compromised email account” to try to gain access to the system of a “high-ranking official of a presidential campaign.” The company did not name the presidential campaign and did not elaborate on whether the attempt was successful.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Saturday, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/10/trump-campaign-hack-00173503">Politico</a> published a report that detailed documents it received from a mysterious AOL email address from someone going by the name Robert. The materials seemed to be from the Trump campaign, and included a draft of what appeared to be the vetting profiles of potential vice presidential pick Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and the campaign’s actual pick, Ohio <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360283/jd-vance-trump-vp-vice-president-authoritarian">Sen. JD Vance</a>. Sunday, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/us/politics/trump-campaign-hacking-iran.html">New York Times said</a> it had received what appeared to be the same documents, from a person claiming to also be the Politico source.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Shortly after Politico published its Saturday piece, the Trump campaign <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/10/trump-campaign-hack-00173503">gave Politico a statement</a> claiming “foreign sources hostile to the United States” stole the documents from them; the statement went on to suggest that Iran was behind the outreach to Politico. Former President Donald Trump then made that suggestion explicit Saturday night, writing on <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112941157610530127" rel="nofollow">Truth Social</a>, “We were just informed by Microsoft Corporation that one of our many websites was hacked by the Iranian Government &#8211; Never a nice thing to do!”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Monday, the FBI announced it is investigating Trump’s claim.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A great deal of uncertainty remains around the supposed hack, and foreign efforts to meddle in the 2024 elections. But here are some other key things to know.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What do we know about Iranian hackers and the Trump campaign?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though the Trump campaign is explicitly stating that it was the target of an Iranian attack, Microsoft has yet to be so blunt.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to the Microsoft report, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has been operating a wide-scale hacking campaign involving at least four groups — Cotton Sandstorm, Lemon Sandstorm, Mint Sandstorm, and Peach Sandstorm — over the past few election cycles. Microsoft says its <a href="https://www.applytosupply.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud/services/624967260377296#:~:text=The%20Microsoft%20Threat%20Analysis%20Center,Microsoft%20and%20its%20customers%20globally.">Microsoft Threat Analysis Center</a>, a department tasked with protecting both the company and its user base from cybercrimes, noticed that someone “sent a spear phishing email in June to a high-ranking official on a presidential campaign from the compromised email account of a former senior advisor.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Spear phishing is when a hacker or hacking group tries to gain access to a specific individual or organization’s digital space by placing a malicious link in a message, that when the recipient clicks through, can install malware on a machine that allows hackers access to information it contains. Microsoft said in a <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2024/08/08/iran-targeting-2024-us-election/">blog post</a> that it has “notified those targeted” in the spear phishing attempt.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though the MTAC report isn’t explicit about the success of Mint Sandstorm’s spear phishing attempt, it does outline other ways the IRGC appears to be planning to influence the election, including by setting up fake news sites that contain polarizing content about the Israel-Hamas conflict and LGBTQ rights, as well as the presidential candidates themselves.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Iran is behind the phishing attempt, and if the country did share documents with US journalists, that could suggest an effort to sway voters away from Trump. The former president has claimed his Iranian policy to be better, and harsher, than that of Democrats.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">His first administration did practice “maximum pressure” on the Islamic Republic. And he ordered the assassination of IRGC commander Qassem Soleimani in January 2020, which was both a practical and ideological blow to Iran. Soleimani was a revered figure in the country and a central force behind external groups affiliated with the regime, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and Shia militias in Iraq and Syria.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump also nixed a 2015 nuclear deal which would have, among other things, eased sanctions in return for greater international oversight over and the winding down of Iran’s nuclear weapons development program. That allowed Iran to <a href="https://www.vox.com/23002229/return-iran-nuclear-deal-vienna-explained">accelerate its weapons development</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What does this mean for the 2024 campaign?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The documents the journalists received don’t appear to have any campaign-altering bombshells.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But this whole saga is a reminder that online attempts to sway voters, similar to Russian efforts in the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2023/1/20/23559214/russia-2016-election-trolls-study-email-hack">2016</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/9/21/21401149/russia-2020-election-meddling-trump-biden">2020 elections</a>, are at play this time around, too. Russia and China are both also attempting to influence the current election, <a href="https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/content/microsoftcorp/microsoft/final/en-us/microsoft-brand/documents/5bc57431-a7a9-49ad-944d-b93b7d35d0fc.pdf">according to Microsoft</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such efforts seem to include Chinese programs that leverage social media to inflame tensions over such issues as the campus protests that happened this spring. Much of Russia’s efforts seemingly focus on sowing disinformation about Ukraine and its involvement with the US intelligence apparatus, as well as inflaming polarization online, particularly about immigration.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With just under three months to go before the elections, it’s likely we will see more attempts from Iran, but also Russia and China, to interfere with US elections.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The 2024 Olympics are officially done, but there’s one bronze medal that’s still hanging in the balance.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That medal was initially awarded to American gymnast Jordan Chiles. Chiles, who won gold with the US team in Paris, placed third in the floor event finals on August 5 — what feels like eons ago in Olympic time. But this past Saturday, on the eve of the final day of the Games, the International Olympic Committee asked Chiles to give back her bronze, giving it to runner-up Romanian Ana Barbosu.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Olympic officials asking an athlete to give their medal back is an uncommon occurrence, but what makes Chiles’s case even more bizarre is that it’s largely the judges’ fault. Chiles was initially underscored, then scored properly, and then told nearly a week later that her correct score shouldn’t count because her coaches didn’t catch the error within one minute. That’s the simple reason why her medal is now being taken away.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This kerfuffle isn’t going to do any favors for the credibility of gymnastics, a sport that’s already scored subjectively. The fact that Team USA is appealing the decision will only draw out this negative press. Unfortunately for Chiles, she’s now caught in a crossfire that’s become much nastier and uglier as this bronze medal saga unfolds.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The current status of Jordan Chiles’s bronze medal</h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If there’s one thing to understand about Chiles’s bronze medal saga, it’s that it has barely anything to do with the level of gymnastics Chiles or her competitors performed at the floor event finals last week. Chiles’s powerful tumbling passes, landings, and leaps on the apparatus are all secondary to the technicalities.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During the event finals for floor, Chiles was originally given a score of 13.666. Team USA and Chiles’s coach, Cecile Landi, filed an inquiry with a judging panel arguing that they had incorrectly scored the routine and didn’t give Chiles credit for a split leap called a “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Gymnastics/comments/1el9o6t/someone_explain_to_this_amateur_a_gogean_v_tour/">tour jete full</a>.” The judges reviewed and agreed with that inquiry, and upped <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAvrnZdw1sE">Chiles’s score to 13.766</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The 13.766 was high enough to get Chiles a bronze, pushing Romanians Barbosu and Sabrina Maneca-Voinea off the podium (both gymnasts scored 13.700, but Barbosu won the tiebreaker).&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/gettyimages-2164952116.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Jordan Chiles during the women’s floor exercise final on August 5. | Daniela Porcelli/Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Daniela Porcelli/Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">While the Romanian team fielded multiple inquiries, including one about <a href="https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40767718/romania-appeals-sabrina-maneca-voinea-floor-exercise-score">Maneca-Voinea’s score</a>, the major dispute that triggered this medal debacle is about the<a href="https://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/CAS_Media_Release_ParisOG_15-16.pdf"> timing of Team USA’s scoring inquiry</a>. The official rules state that Landi’s inquiry of Chiles’s score had to be filed within one minute of her score. Romania argued that Landi made the inquiry one minute and four seconds after getting Chiles’s score. Those four seconds, Romania argued, put the US over the time limit and should have nullified Chiles’s new score.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled in Romania’s favor. <a href="https://www.gymnastics.sport/site/news/displaynews.php?urlNews=4268100">Officially and as of this moment</a>, Barbosu’s score of 13.700 is credited as the third-place bronze medal finish and Chiles’s score has been pushed back down to 13.666. To reflect the ruling, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) ordered Chiles to return her bronze medal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In response to the IOC’s ruling, Team USA announced that it had submitted additional evidence to the CAS that the inquiry was filed within the time limit — not once, but twice. “The time-stamped, video evidence submitted by USA Gymnastics Sunday evening shows Landi first stated her request to file an inquiry at the inquiry table 47 seconds after the score was posted, followed by a second statement 55 seconds after the score was originally posted,” the federation <a href="https://x.com/USAGym/status/1822724122951991331">said in a statement</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Monday, USA Gymnastics said in a statement that it was notified by the CAS that its “rules do not allow for an arbitral award to be reconsidered even when conclusive new evidence is presented.” USA Gymnastics said it would continue to pursue additional avenues for an award for Chiles. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The latest on Jordan Chiles: “USA Gymnastics was notified by the Court of Arbitration for Sport on Monday that their rules do not allow for an arbitral award to be reconsidered even when conclusive new evidence is presented.” <a href="https://t.co/xa8noSiraz">pic.twitter.com/xa8noSiraz</a></p>&mdash; philip lewis (@Phil_Lewis_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Phil_Lewis_/status/1823103007598223634?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s worth remembering that the fundamental flaw in Chiles’s score is a judge’s error, an error that judges admitted to. Chiles’s correct score is Chiles’s correct score. Gymnastics isn’t track and field and scores aren’t determined by clock, but there are set criteria — including the execution of included moves — that need to be evaluated in a final score. Arguing that it took four seconds too long to fix an error that the judges themselves actually introduced feels more at home in some kind of retail customer service death spiral than an allegedly prestigious Olympic sport where judges and official timekeepers should be able to follow the predetermined protocol.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">People can’t stop being racist toward Jordan Chiles&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This mess, of course, doesn’t happen in a bubble.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In fact, this medal kerfuffle undoes an Olympic milestone: Chiles, her teammate Simone Biles, and Brazil’s Rebecca Andrade were the first all-Black podium in the games’ history. While that was a triumph for many and seen as <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/gymnast-jordan-chiles-talks-bronze-medal-all-black-podium">growth for the sport</a>, it’s not exactly a coincidence that <a href="https://x.com/daily_romania/status/1822300075273367600">racists</a> and far-right personalities have latched onto the story of the rescinded bronze.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Like many sports, gymnastics itself has a thorny history of racism and treatment of Black athletes. It wasn’t too long ago that <a href="https://www.vox.com/22575301/simone-biles-olympics-scoring-explained-gymnastics-yurchenko-double-pike">Biles faced racist attacks</a>, ranging from belittling her skills to coded talk about how the multiple gold medal winner made the sport less elegant with her power. Black female <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/3/11/8189679/serena-williams-indian-wells-racism">athletes like Serena Williams</a> have also faced similar discrimination in their sports.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The aforementioned right-wing personalities and racists<strong> </strong>are now peddling narratives about how the Olympics cheated white gymnasts out of medals, or saying that Black athletes like Chiles are cheaters themselves. Pundit Matt Walsh <a href="https://x.com/MattWalshBlog/status/1821369204827709948">called</a> the 2024 games “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNzMU7CH3k">the DEI Olympics</a>.” It didn’t take long for those sentiments to metastasize into disgusting behavior, as racists began personally attacking Chiles.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Amid the medal returning saga, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/jordan-chiles-olympics-social-media-b2594527.html">Jordan said</a> she was taking a break from social media. Chiles’s mom Gina posted on Twitter that her daughter was receiving racist attacks:&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The racist disgusting comments are still happening in 2024. I&#039;m tired of people who say it no longer exists. My daughter is a highly decorated Olympian with the biggest heart and a level of sportsmanship that is unmatched&#8230;and she&#039;s being called disgusting things.</p>&mdash; Gina Chiles (@gina_chiles) <a href="https://twitter.com/gina_chiles/status/1822021561928364090?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 9, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Seeing Chiles receive these attacks and have to shut down her public accounts is just depressingly bleak. Medal or no medal, Chiles’s Olympics — a once-in-a-lifetime experience, twice if you’re as fit and skilled as Chiles — will be marred by the racism and bigotry she faced following the judges’ mistakes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All Jordan Chiles did was compete, and she did so under the impression that she would be judged fairly. The people running Olympic gymnastics didn’t allow her that opportunity.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Update, August 12, 2024, at 5:20 pm ET:</strong> This story was published on August 12 and has been updated with news that the CAS will not be entertaining Team USA’s appeal.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Violent crime levels have dropped significantly in the first half of the year, according to a new report from the <a href="https://majorcitieschiefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MCCA-Violent-Crime-Report-2024-and-2023-Midyear.pdf">Major Cities Chiefs Association</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Overall, violent crime dropped by 6 percent and homicides fell by 17 percent in 69 cities compared to the same period last year. Columbus, Ohio, saw the biggest drop in violent crime at <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/08/12/violent-crime-harris-trump-election">41 percent</a>, according to an Axios data analysis. But cities including Miami, Washington, DC, and Austin, Texas, also saw large declines. Notably, New York City was not included in the data, though <a href="https://www.fox5ny.com/news/nyc-march-2024-crime-statistics">other reports</a> have indicated that violent crime is falling there, too. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s hard to say exactly what’s causing the decline, which comes after a major Covid-19 crime wave. It may be partially due to policies aimed at tackling crime at the federal, state, and local levels. But it may also just be a symptom of the fact that normal life in America has resumed post-pandemic — or a combination of those and other factors.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Republicans have long tried to use concerns about crime as a political cudgel against President Joe Biden’s administration. While former President Donald Trump doesn’t appear to be giving up on that attack strategy just yet, Democrats can now use the new data as a defense. Whether that will be effective, however, is far from certain.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">What’s driving the decrease?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/08/10/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-record-decrease-in-crime-in-first-half-of-2024/">statement on Saturday</a>, President Joe Biden credited the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/3/10/22320350/biden-sign-stimulus-bill-covid-19">$1.9 trillion economic stimulus bill</a> that Congress passed in 2021, which allocated $15 billion toward public safety and violence prevention efforts, for helping bring down crime levels. He also cited bipartisan gun control law that expanded background checks and encouraged states to adopt “red flag” laws to prevent people who pose a danger to themselves or others from obtaining a gun. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But while those laws may have helped, some experts are highly skeptical of attributing the decrease to specific government initiatives.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think it’s early to know exactly why murder and violent crime are going down now,” said Jeff Asher, a crime researcher who runs a crime database at <a href="https://www.ahdatalytics.com/about-us/">AH Datalytics</a>. “Generally, I’m skeptical of political actions causing crime to go up or crime to go down, especially at the federal level.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, the pandemic crime was such an outlier in terms of the speed and degree to which it took hold that Asher said it’s possible that government spending on public safety helped interrupt such an acute increase in violence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other social and psychological factors may have also contributed. <a href="https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/anna-harvey.html">Anna Harvey</a>, a crime researcher at New York University, said that there is a “<a href="https://www.vitalcitynyc.org/articles/does-nothing-stop-a-bullet-like-a-job#:~:text=The%20best%20available%20evidence%20suggests,populations%20like%20people%20exiting%20prison.">robust body of evidence</a>” showing that violent crime is often driven by emotion, such as stress or anger, as well as opportunity and the threat of getting caught.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The Covid pandemic appears to have directly increased levels of stress potentially contributing to higher rates of violent crime during the pandemic period and decreasing levels as the pandemic abated,” she said. “The pandemic also affected the probability that violent crime would be observed by others and reported to the police, affecting the ‘Will I get caught?’ aspect of decision-making.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She said the probability of getting caught went down given that foot traffic in cities sharply decreased and recovered slowly during and after the pandemic, with many choosing to work from home or move away from cities. Using cellphone location data, researchers at the University of Toronto <a href="https://downtownrecovery.com/death_of_downtown_policy_brief.pdf">found</a> that the downtowns of many northern cities in particular struggled to return to pre-pandemic levels of activity through at least November 2022.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The trend is a gradual recovery in foot traffic, mirroring the gradual decrease in violent crime rates,” Harvey said.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What it means for the election</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This year, crime may not rank as the <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx">top issue</a> on most voters’ minds. Similar shares of voters — between 1 and 4 percent — said crime was the most important issue facing the country in <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx">Gallup surveys</a> every month this year, even as crime went down. But it’s still a big concern: In a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/642887/inflation-immigration-rank-among-top-issue-concerns.aspx">March Gallup poll</a>, 53 percent said that they worry a “great deal” about crime and violence. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has sought to capitalize on that by linking Harris, a former federal prosecutor and attorney general of California, to the movement to “<a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/112949462599544301" rel="nofollow">defund the police</a>.” He’s also campaigned by <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112950008791292542" rel="nofollow">stoking fear about the criminal threats posed by undocumented immigrants</a>, linking the issue of crime to Biden’s unpopular handling of the US-Mexico border.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKb9-eaEkkw">pushed back against</a> those attacks, recently releasing a new ad identifying her as a former “border state prosecutor” who has spent “decades fighting violent crime.” Trump’s attacks related to immigration also just aren’t based in fact: Unauthorized border crossings have been <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/unlawful-border-crossings-drop-5th-straight-month-lowest-level-since-september-2020/">declining for five straight months</a> and have returned to levels not seen since Trump was in office. <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/10/18/crime-fbi-mexico-border-homicides">FBI crime data also shows</a> that border cities tend to have some of the lowest levels of crime in the country. And other research has shown that US-born citizens are more than two times <a href="https://www.ojp.gov/library/publications/comparing-crime-rates-between-undocumented-immigrants-legal-immigrants-and">more likely to be arrested for violent crimes</a> than undocumented immigrants. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That doesn’t necessarily neutralize the political threat posed by Republican attacks claiming Democrats are weak on crime. Public perception often lags behind the stats, and it may be difficult for the party to change opinions after the Covid-era crime wave. But the&nbsp;next time Trump claims crime is out of control, the Harris campaign will have new evidence to point to.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vice President Kamala Harris is potentially on the verge of becoming one of the most powerful people on Earth. At the same time, in part because her rapid ascent to the Democratic presidential nomination didn’t involve the sustained public attention of a long presidential primary, she’s more of a cipher to many Americans than major party presidential nominees typically are. So who is Kamala Harris? In this video, we hand that story over to four reporters who have covered her at different points in her career. <br><br>Kamala Harris first entered public life as the elected district attorney of San Francisco. She tried to distinguish herself from her predecessor, known for taking a progressive approach to crime, by calling herself “smart on crime.” She spoke more clinically and quantitatively than ideologically; she talked about numbers, not ideas or politics. That continued in her next role as California’s attorney general, in which she was often hard to pin down ideologically and reluctant to take political stances. But that role also made her a household name in California, and after six years as attorney general, she won the state’s US Senate race. <br><br>Harris quickly became a well-known senator, but not for speeches or policy. Instead she found fame as the Democratic Party’s chief cross-examiner in the Senate, grilling Trump administration officials in confrontations that excited Democratic voters and sparked a movement for her to run for president in 2020. However, the Democratic Party had by that point become more ideologically progressive, and her record of being “smart on crime” no longer played as well with those voters. She struggled to find a political lane in the Democratic primary, and her run was short-lived. But when Democrats ultimately chose Joe Biden as their nominee, Biden vowed to pick a woman as his running mate. And after a summer in which the death of George Floyd and the massive ensuing protests sparked a national reckoning around race, Harris rose to the top of his list. <br><br>As vice president, Harris struggled to find a role in the administration. Biden tasked her with an unenviable job: solving the “root causes” of undocumented immigration to the US. It was neither her area of expertise nor her ideological strong suit, and after a disastrous TV interview, she retreated from public view. But after the US Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion, things started to change. Harris had an expertise and authority on reproductive rights that Biden lacked, and she became the administration’s spokesperson on the topic, finding her voice and footing in public life again. <br><br>In July 2024, an unpopular and visibly aged President Joe Biden withdrew from his reelection campaign, endorsing Kamala Harris as his successor. Lively and articulate by comparison, Harris quickly captured the enthusiasm of the Democratic Party, gaining momentum in the race against former President Donald Trump. Her continued success will depend on whether she can grow into the role of a galvanizing, inspirational political figure that she’s struggled to fill in the past.<br><br>You can find this video and all of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA"><strong>Vox’s videos on YouTube</strong></a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many of us like to think our moral values are stable. We imagine that we’ve each got a moral compass inside us, with the needle reliably pointing us north — toward our sense of right and wrong.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But according to <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2313428121">a new study</a> published in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, our deepest moral values are not some fixed point we’re magnetically drawn to. They fluctuate depending on whether it’s spring, summer, fall, or winter.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We already know that seasonal changes affect our mood (I’m looking at you, seasonal affective disorder). And research also shows they influence everything from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4801294/">our attention to our memory</a>, to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27859560/">color preferences</a> to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/6/17/5818432/lock-your-doors-crime-is-worst-in-the-summer">crime rates</a>. But our morality?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It was definitely surprising to me,” lead author <a href="https://ubc-emotionlab.ca/people/ian-hohm/">Ian Hohm</a> of the University of British Columbia told me in an interview.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hohm said he didn’t expect morality to shift “because it’s not a behavior, and it’s not a kind of transient emotion. It’s a fundamental part of how people make decisions about what’s good and bad and right and wrong.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet when he and his coauthors analyzed survey responses from more than 230,000 Americans over the span of a decade, they found that people embraced certain values — purity, loyalty, and respect for authority — more strongly in spring and fall, compared to summer and winter.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Psychologists call those “binding values” because they tend to promote social cohesion. They’re a double-edged sword, however: Their upside is that they increase cooperation among members of an in-group, but they can also increase prejudice against out-groups. (The study authors also investigated care and fairness, sometimes known as “individualizing values,” but found no consistent seasonal pattern there.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The findings raise some big questions. First, why do people embrace binding values more in the spring and fall? And second, given that binding values are strongly <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19379034/">associated with political conservatism</a>, what are the implications for how we run a society —&nbsp;including major court cases and elections?&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The role of anxiety </h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s something else that peaks in spring and fall: self-reported anxiety.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The study authors noticed this trend when they analyzed more than 90,000 questionnaire responses. They hypothesize that the higher anxiety they found in spring and fall drives people to put a higher premium on binding values and their manifestations, like close-knit social groups and long-running traditions. That sort of stuff makes us feel safe and comforted —&nbsp;exactly what you want when you’re feeling anxious.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The authors also analyzed survey data from Canada and Australia, and found that there, too, people embrace binding values more strongly in spring and fall. Endorsement of those values dips in the summer —&nbsp;and by looking at respondents’ zip codes, the authors found that the dip is extra sharp in areas where the weather changes dramatically from one season to the next. But, interestingly, the winter dip wasn’t related to the weather itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“So the summer effect might be some kind of sunshine effect — you know, your anxiety goes down because you’ve got nice weather outside,” Hohm said. Whether it’s because we’re getting more daylight, more time in nature, more exercise, or more socializing, lots of us notice an improved mood in summertime.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“But the winter effect, we think, is about some sort of cultural practice, like the changes in people’s activities and motivations around the holiday season.” In other words, you might be less anxious in December because you’ve got time off work or school and you’re hanging out with family and friends.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, this isn’t true for every single person. And individuals who do see a change aren’t experiencing massive shifts in their moral values every time the seasons turn.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The effects on people’s moral values at the individual level are quite small,” Hohm told me. “If you’re looking at individuals, this effect probably isn’t going to explain much. But when it comes to human populations in the aggregate, when everybody is endorsing these values a little bit more, that can have large consequences.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Which brings us to…</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What does this mean for society and politics?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The study argues that these findings could have wide-ranging social implications.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We know that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19379034/">conservatives</a> endorse binding values more than liberals do. So, one possible implication is that if we hold elections when people are endorsing binding values more, that could make on-the-fence voters slightly more inclined to opt for a conservative candidate than they would’ve been at other times of year. “The timing of political elections (whether they are scheduled to occur in the summer or the autumn, for instance) might plausibly have some subtle effect on election results,” the study argues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Research also shows that people who more strongly endorse binding values tend to be <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28150974/">more punitive</a> toward norm violators. So, conceivably, there could be some seasonal variation in legal decision-making.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, since binding moral values emphasize group cohesion, there might also be seasonal variation in prejudices against people — like immigrants, racial minorities, or LGBTQ people — who are viewed as outsiders. (The study authors have begun looking into this, and although their research is still in progress, Hohm told me prejudice “does seem to increase at the same time of the year when people are endorsing binding values more.”)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are important limitations to the study. For one, it doesn’t analyze nationally representative samples of people, but a more self-selecting crew that chose to answer survey questions online. Plus, it’s not a longitudinal study —&nbsp;different people responded to the survey at different times. We’d get a fuller picture by assessing the values endorsed by the same people across different seasons.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One more wrinkle: the findings are not generalizable to every country. Although the authors found a similar seasonal cycle in moral values in the US, Canada, and Australia, they did not find it in the United Kingdom, and they don’t know why.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, the study challenges the popular view that each person’s values are stable.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The idea that people’s moral values can change with the seasons is consistent with a growing body of research highlighting just how much moral values — which are typically thought of as fixed and immutable — can change based on subtle or seemingly mundane features of people’s environment,” said <a href="https://www.danielyudkin.com/">Daniel Yudkin</a>, a social psychologist not involved in the new study.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With apologies to your moral compass, the takeaway here is: There is no moral North Pole. Your sense of right and wrong might not be a static point, but something that’s subject to seasons of change — literally. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For roughly half of humans, one thing is as certain as death and taxes: If you menstruate and live long enough, your ovaries will stop releasing eggs, and your menstrual cycle will end.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/22462996/menopause-symptoms-hot-flashes-supplements-40-50">Menopause</a> is weird, biologically speaking. People, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/13/science/whale-menopause.html">five species of whales</a>, and <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add5473">maybe chimpanzees</a> are the only animals that seem to live beyond their reproductive years. Menopause doesn’t have a lot of evolutionary value: beyond the hot flashes and night sweats, the loss of estrogen increases the risk of many of the chronic diseases we keep track of, including <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/managing-the-risk-of-dementia/additional-treatments-for-dementia-risk/hormones#:~:text=Alzheimer's%20disease%20is%20more%20common,when%20oestrogen%20levels%20are%20decreased.">Alzheimer’s disease</a>, <a href="https://www.endocrine.org/patient-engagement/endocrine-library/menopause-and-bone-loss">osteoporosis</a>, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3615462/#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20during%20the%2010,cardiovascular%20risk%20factors%20in%20women.">stroke</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite their obvious importance, scientists are only just beginning to understand how ovaries work, and how their rapid aging affects the rest of the body. Traditionally, longevity researchers have relied on lab animals to study aging biology because humans live too long to study. If we can use a human organ as a proxy for other human tissues, identifying potential anti-aging treatments that translate to the real world could get a little easier. Because ovaries biologically age faster than other human tissues, they’re a perfect testing ground for scientists to <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/24121932/anti-aging-longevity-science-health-drugs">study the process of aging</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Studying reproductive longevity could help jumpstart an anti-aging industry that, despite loads of hype, has struggled to make progress. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mkaeberlein/">Matt Kaeberlein</a>, a longevity researcher and CEO of health care tech company <a href="https://www.optispan.life/">Optispan</a>, said that if everything we know about the biology of aging could be drawn on a map, it would look like a map of the Earth drawn in 500 BC. It would be helpful, but if you sail too far, you’ll fall off the edge and plummet into the unknown.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Deeply rooted <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35687931/">sex biases</a> in academic science stalled the study of reproductive aging for a century. But <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05836025">an ongoing clinical trial</a> in New York City may be onto something big: A drug we already know is generally safe could be used to delay menopause and extend the healthy lifespans of people with ovaries. <a href="https://gero.usc.edu/labs/benayounlab/">Bérénice Benayoun</a>, a scientist studying sex differences in aging at the University of Southern California’s Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, is optimistic about the study’s potential. “For most women, delaying menopause will be nothing short of a health miracle.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ovaries age really quickly. We don’t know why.</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In sixth grade, my biology teacher passed out sheets of paper with <a href="https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/healthwellbeing/hse-education-programme/junior-cycle-sphe-training-resources/rse/handout%201%20-%20female%20reproductive%20system.pdf">illustrations of the female reproductive system</a>, featuring the ovaries as polka-dotted balloons flanking the uterus. We learned that they hold eggs, and one by one, month by month, eggs pop out until there aren’t any left. That’s all ovaries were to me: bags of eggs that mattered only insofar as they carry baby-making material.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But despite what people may think, ovaries matter for more than just reproduction. Jennifer Garrison, professor at the <a href="https://www.buckinstitute.org/lab/garrison-lab/">Buck Institute for Research on Aging</a>, thinks of ovaries as the master architects of health for people assigned female at birth. (Trans men, intersex people, and nonbinary people can have ovaries, too.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Essentially, we have allowed women’s health as a whole to be pigeonholed through the lens of fertility,” she said. But the ovaries sit at the center of a complex molecular signaling network that doesn’t just guide the creation of new life; Garrison views them as “the pacemaker for aging in women’s bodies.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last year, a study found that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06802-1#Abs1">individual organs age at different rates</a> — organs that accumulate more aging-related proteins are more likely to cause problems down the line.  No matter the cause, “the fact that [ovaries are] aging faster than the rest of our tissues is a real problem,” Garrison said. While testes also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8619877/">change with age</a>, releasing less testosterone over time, their decline is slow and gradual. It is <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/mens-health/in-depth/male-menopause/art-20048056#:~:text=Debunking%20the%20male%20menopause%20myth&amp;text=This%20is%20known%20as%20menopause,or%20age-related%20low%20testosterone.">far from the sudden hormonal chaos</a> of perimenopause, the transitional period leading up to menopause. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By the time someone is 40-something years old, their ovaries start <a href="https://www.endocrine.org/patient-engagement/endocrine-library/menopause">behaving erratically</a>, producing fluctuating levels of estrogen and progesterone until they restabilize around a much lower baseline. This transition period can last for a few months or even years.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Estrogen (which is naturally produced by both males and females) appears to play an important role in biological functions that go well beyond puberty and reproduction. Estrogen is a hormone, a chemical messenger that travels through the bloodstream to send information to cells throughout the body. While many of its specific functions are still unclear, estrogen seems to help maintain <a href="https://www.endocrine.org/patient-engagement/endocrine-library/menopause-and-bone-loss#:~:text=Since%20estrogen%20helps%20prevent%20bones,seen%20in%20women%20experiencing%20menopause.">bone structure</a>, keep cardiac cells healthy, and <a href="https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/74/7/837">even act as a neurotransmitter in the brain</a>. Since it does so much, estrogen’s decline increases a slew of health risks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a result, Benayoun said, “Women live longer than men, but they usually do so in a much more frail state.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The search for anti-aging drugs&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)01377-0">At the cellular level</a>, aging is basically the same across the animal kingdom. As we get older, gene expression starts to go off the rails, and the resulting DNA damage makes it harder for cells to work properly. As cells become less effective at making proteins, getting rid of waste, and repairing damage, they stop working altogether, making it <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/does-cellular-senescence-hold-secrets-healthier-aging#:~:text=As%20a%20result%2C%20cellular%20senescence,%2C%20mobility%2C%20and%20thinking%20ability.">harder for the body to recover</a> from stress, illness, and injuries.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/24121932/anti-aging-longevity-science-health-drugs">Longevity researchers</a> have spent decades hunting for specific genes and proteins to target in anti-aging treatments. While literally extending the human lifespan or maintaining eternal youth is still far-fetched, improving <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/24121932/anti-aging-longevity-science-health-drugs">healthspan</a> — the number of years one can live in good health, without pain or chronic disease — is a more realistic target. But the aging process is complicated, with lots of cellular changes happening at once, and scientists have historically overhyped the potential of anti-aging targets.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For example, <a href="https://www.aaas.org/news/science-compound-red-wine-may-help-treat-age-related-diseases#:~:text=A%20new%20study%20confirms%20that,used%20to%20make%20red%20wine.">proteins called sirtuins</a> had a moment in the aughts. Directly activated by a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/red-wine/art-20048281">compound found in grape skin</a>, sirtuins inspired too-good-to-be-true reporting that the secret to a long, healthy life is <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2011/09/21/140669655/whats-in-that-wine-glass-may-not-prevent-aging-after-all">drinking red wine</a>. But <a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/speaking-illusions-sirtuins-and-longevity">according to Science</a>, the early sirtuin data was “a steaming pile of artifactual results, overinterpretation, and publication bias.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kaeberlein, one of sirtuins’s <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18590685/">earliest advocates</a>, will be the first to tell you that it doesn’t seem to be the miracle target scientists once thought it was. Data across many different labs over the past couple decades points toward a different, more promising protein: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00416-y">mTOR</a>, part of a signaling pathway that tells cells all over the body when to grow and when to save energy. As we age, mTOR activity changes, leading to increased risk of immune problems and damaged cells.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A drug called rapamycin, derived from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9634974/#:~:text=It%20is%20well%20known%20by,et%20al.%2C%202006">bacteria found in the soil of Easter Island</a>, tempers mTOR activity. Rapamycin is great at soothing an overactive immune system; today, it is <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/99/21083A.cfm">approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</a> as an immunosuppressant, and is commonly prescribed to people after an organ transplant. Researchers have found that rapamycin <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1617233114">prevents activation of primordial follicles</a> — or immature egg reserves — in lab mice, prolonging ovarian function. The drug’s mTOR-suppressing qualities may also <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568(23)00258-1/fulltext#:~:text=Rapamycin%20and%20its%20derivatives%20are,of%20lymphangioleiomyomatosis%20and%20tuberous%20sclerosis.">improve symptoms of age-related chronic diseases in humans</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The evidence supporting rapamycin’s anti-aging potential is strong, but longevity and wellness research is also rife with noise. Beyond sirtuins, wellness-obsessed millionaires <a href="https://time.com/6315607/bryan-johnsons-quest-for-immortality/">like Bryan Johnson</a> try everything from strict supplement regimens to cryotherapy chambers in the pursuit of eternal life. All the researchers I spoke with agreed that eternal life isn’t the goal of longevity research — it probably isn’t possible, anyway. After decades of experiments, Kaeberlein believes that the mTOR pathway and rapamycin are still “the gold standard when it comes to targeting the biology of aging.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And while rapamycin almost certainly won’t make anyone live forever, it holds particular promise for slowing down the aging of ovaries.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Can rapamycin extend ovarian health?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Scientists have used many different animals as a model of aging in the lab, from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1740675718300343">microscopic worms</a> and <a href="https://www.genengnews.com/topics/translational-medicine/aging-biology-revealed-by-studying-short-lived-african-killifish/">African fish</a>, to <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/two-research-teams-reverse-signs-aging-mice">mice</a>,<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28729086/"> macaques, and marmosets</a>. But the best model organism may have been inside us all along.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When it comes to aging, Kaeberlein said ovaries are “the canary in the coal mine.” They age quickly enough to study within a grant’s typical three-year project period, and as far as we know, every single person with ovaries will experience menopause in one way or another, should they live long enough. The precise connections between age, number and quality of eggs, menopause, and healthspan are still uncertain, but <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778126">the correlations exist, and they’re strong</a>. “What is clear,” Garrison said, “is that if we can preserve the endocrine function of ovaries, that will hopefully have a positive impact on female health care.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">About one in five birthing parents have their first child <a href="https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2022/07/having-kids-later-life#:~:text=About%2020%25%20of%20women%20in,life%2C%20many%20concerns%20are%20manageable.">after they turn 35</a>, the age at which doctors start labeling pregnancies as higher risk. People are increasingly waiting until their mid-30s or later to have kids, whether due to financial constraints, higher education, or simply wanting to enjoy childless adulthood longer. Delaying ovarian aging by a few years could preserve fertility for prospective parents, in addition to staving off the side effects of menopause. However, Benayoun said, it wouldn’t necessarily prevent eggs from accumulating damage over time. Just as older sperm comes with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7803514/#:~:text=On%20the%20other%20hand%2C%20old,chromosome%20disorders%20in%20their%20offspring.">higher chances of birth defects</a>, older eggs mean greater genetic risks. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.yousinsuhlab.org/our-team">Yousin Suh</a>, a reproductive aging researcher at Columbia University, has led her research team in studying cells from human ovaries, sampled from people in their 20s through their early 50s. In a <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.18.492547v1">preprint currently undergoing peer review</a>, they reported that ovarian cells from people between 49-54 showed signs of aging that are usually seen in the organs of much older people, including DNA damage and overactive mTOR. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the past year, Suh and <a href="https://www.obgyn.columbia.edu/profile/s-z-williams-md">Zev Williams</a>, chief of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, have been running a <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05836025">clinical trial</a> in women between 35 and 45 years old to test whether low-dose rapamycin can slow ovarian aging. The Validating Benefits of Rapamycin for Reproductive Aging Treatment (VIBRANT) study is still actively recruiting participants, but preliminary data from the first 34 participants is “very, very exciting,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jul/22/drug-women-fertility-study-rapamycin">Suh told The Guardian</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Early results suggest that the drug might slow ovarian aging by about 20 percent. If those results hold up, rapamycin could delay menopause by five years and help people stay healthier longer, and keep the option of having children more open. “In a way, our results are too good to be true,” she said, “except, because rapamycin is so well-studied, we know they are true.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While Suh and Williams intend to include over 1,000 participants in their study, their <a href="https://www.nyp.org/advances-womenshealth/pilot-study-evaluates-weekly-pill-to-slow-ovarian-aging-delay-menopause#:~:text=Rapamycin%20appears%20to%20slow%20down,Williams%20explains.">pilot study</a> was mainly designed to make sure rapamycin doesn’t have any unintended side effects. At the high dose taken by transplant patients, rapamycin could stop ovulation, potentially reducing fertility rather than prolonging it. But VIBRANT participants only took a weekly dose of rapamycin, and that dose was less than half what a transplant patient would take in a day. No serious problems have been reported, paving the way for future research.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The scientific justification for it is very strong,” said Kaeberlein, who was not involved in the study. Final results from the first phase of VIBRANT should be published in two years, and will be followed by a study with a much larger group of people. Benayoun is optimistic that, since rapamycin is already FDA-approved, promising clinical trial results could translate into real-world treatments “in a matter of years, not decades.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Research in women’s health is just getting started</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given rapamycin’s well-established success in the lab, one might wonder why we aren’t already taking low-dose rapamycin pills. If the drug can make us live longer, healthier lives, and has limited side effects at the right dose, why aren’t we shouting about it from the rooftops?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Part of the problem is the lack of clinical trial data demonstrating its anti-aging potential. It’s really hard to study longevity in humans: We live a long time compared to lab mice or worms, and the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) only funds research projects for a few years at a time. And because rapamycin is cheap and already on the market, it doesn’t offer much of a business opportunity&nbsp; for the pharmaceutical companies and venture capitalists that usually <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK50972/#:~:text=The%20principal%20investors%20in%20drug,pharmaceutical%20companies%20or%20venture%20capitalists.">fund the final stages of drug development</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s been very challenging to get any funders to step forward to support clinical trials with FDA-approved drugs for longevity or healthspan because of the lack of profit incentive,” Kaeberlein said. Ideally, the government would fund this kind of research, he added, but “the NIH has dropped the ball.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Historically, the NIH has <a href="https://report.nih.gov/funding/categorical-spending#/">underfunded reproductive aging research</a> compared to disease-specific fields like cancer. Worse, it has often <a href="https://www.aamc.org/news/why-we-know-so-little-about-women-s-health">ignored women’s health altogether</a>. “With half of the human population eventually experiencing menopause, it’s astounding that there aren’t more studies trying to defer its impacts,” Benayoun said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It wasn’t until the <a href="https://orwh.od.nih.gov/toolkit/recruitment/history">NIH Revitalization Act</a> passed in 1993 that, barring extenuating circumstances, clinical trials were required to include women. Before 1993, no such rule existed; researchers often excluded women from clinical studies out of fear that their menstrual cycles would muck up the data. Similar concerns about hormone fluctuations (and other lab-animal-specific concerns, like mating and fighting) still inform a lot of preclinical animal research. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Until 2009, most studies in fields like physiology and pharmacology <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3008499/">only used male lab animals</a>, or didn’t report the sex of their animals at all. It wasn’t until 2016 that the <a href="https://orwh.od.nih.gov/sex-gender/orwh-mission-area-sex-gender-in-research/nih-policy-on-sex-as-biological-variable">NIH began requiring</a> grantees to perform preclinical experiments in both male and female animals. This deeply rooted sex bias stalled research progress for decades, Garrison said. “If you don’t study females, you’re not going to learn anything about their physiology.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When females were considered in research, it was usually regarding reproduction and fertility — often with the goal of <a href="https://www.nifa.usda.gov/grants/programs/animal-programs/animal-reproduction">bolstering livestock breeding programs</a>. “Reproductive biology has really been focused on women as incubators,” Garrison said. Only in the last few years have scientists like Garrison started to reframe the age-related functional decline of ovaries as a health issue — not just a fertility issue. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But after so many years of underfunding, “there’s a lot of basic research still to be done in this field,” Kaeberlein said, and not many scientists getting grants to pay for it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The NIH is like a battleship,” Garrison said. “Getting it to turn takes a long time.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More studies like VIBRANT are finally on the horizon. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/02/21/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-first-lady-jill-biden-to-announce-the-100-million-arpa-h-sprint-for-womens-health/">Jill Biden announced</a> that the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) <a href="https://arpa-h.gov/engage-and-transition/sprint">would invest $100 million</a> in women’s health research. In March, <a href="https://irp.nih.gov/catalyst/32/3/president-biden-requests-12b-for-research-on-womens-health">President Joe Biden also asked Congress</a> for a $12 billion investment in women’s health research. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While Congress likely won’t fork that money over anytime soon, Garrison said “the fact that we’re even having this conversation — that it’s being had on that level — is pretty impactful and dramatic.”</p>

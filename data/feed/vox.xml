<p class="has-text-align-none">It started with a coconut tree. Sorry — actually it starts with the context of what came before.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re an active internet denizen, you might already know what I’m referencing: a viral clip of Vice President Kamala Harris delivering a speech while repeating a question that she says her mother often posed to her: “‘You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But if you’re fortunate enough not to live online, this is your guide to catching up on all the Kamala Harris memes. Many have been percolating for months (or even longer). Now that President Joe Biden has announced he will <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361827/biden-drops-out-2024-kamala-convention">step off the Democratic ticket</a> and endorse Harris as his preferred presidential nominee, the memes are everywhere.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The coconut line is more than a year old: from a swearing-in ceremony that Harris led in May 2023 in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. But it’s also a stand-in for how the vice president is often perceived in pop culture, in mainstream media, and online: as a bit of a punchline, someone lacking serious power and with a perplexing political track record, and as the closest we’ll get to recreating Julia Louis-Dreyfus’s character in HBO’s <em>Veep.</em></p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>President Joe Biden endorsed Kamala Harris for president. Here’s what to know about her.</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Vice President Kamala Harris could replace Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket in 2024.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/361750/biden-drop-out-harris-endorse-polls-against-trump-democrats-dnc">Does Harris give Democrats a better chance in 2024?</a></li>

</ul>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Call it ironic or unironic #<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/7/25/20697783/khive-twitter-kamala-harris-2020-candidate-doug-hive">KHive</a> posting, being “Kamalapilled” or “coconutpilled,” or simply feeling “unburdened” (I’ll get to that in a second). The surge in Harris memes after Biden&#8217;s <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357746/biden-trump-debate-democrats-replace-dnc">disastrous debate</a> performance was<strong> </strong>a symptom of the angst and uncertainty many Americans were feeling as the country and the Democratic Party navigated yet another crisis. Now, it appears to be a more earnest excitement and bewilderment by the internet&#8217;s denizens as the Democratic Party moves to nominate the first woman of color to be a major party presidential nominee.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, to guide you through this discourse, I’ve rounded up a few of the most popular memes, starting with the foundational one.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>“Coconut trees” and the context of what came before</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When the vice president referred to her mom’s question about falling out of a coconut tree, she was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JWR29RT5sw">recounting a lesson</a> about the importance of history. Speaking to government appointees who would work on economic and education equity for Hispanic Americans, she emphasized that their task would be to aid not only young people, but also their parents, grandparents, teachers, and communities, “because none of us just live in a silo. Everything is in context.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And she <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/05/10/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-at-swearing-in-ceremony-of-commissioners-for-the-white-house-initiative-on-advancing-educational-equity-excellence-and-economic-opportunity-for-hispanics/">continued</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">“My mother used to — she would give us a hard time sometimes, and she would say to us, ‘I don’t know what’s wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?’&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, the takeaway is clear enough, something that’s been said for centuries: No person is an island.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it was her delivery that turned it into a meme: in a joking voice, with exaggerated hand and arm gestures, and with a signature Kamala Harris laugh.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the time, social media users and right-wing accounts <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/fell-out-of-a-coconut-tree">accused</a> her of behaving strangely: “Obviously drunk,” one <a href="https://x.com/Rifleman4WVU/status/1656441274906320896">viral tweet</a> said, while others used clips of the speech to describe being intoxicated or inebriated (which itself is <a href="https://twitter.com/slimjosa/status/1808303666203697643">another Harris meme</a>).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Being “unburdened by what has been”</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Around the time of the most recent return of the coconut tree clip, another of Harris’s quotes began to circulate: not a memorable one-off, but a catchphrase she uses over and over.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It was a <a href="https://x.com/KamalaHarris/status/1310607188566724610">go-to line</a> during her 2020 presidential primary campaign and into the general election as Biden’s running mate: “What can be, unburdened by what has been.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And thanks to a <a href="https://x.com/RNCResearch/status/1736468129528602811">Republican Party supercut</a> of all the times Harris has used the phrase in speeches, interviews, and appearances, the phrase went viral again. “Four straight minutes of ‘what can be, unburdened by what has been.’ It’s incredible. I had no idea she used it this much,” one Republican staffer <a href="https://x.com/thejcoop/status/1806867772988625316">said</a> as he reshared the clip in the aftermath of the first presidential debate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The literal meaning of this catchphrase varies from speech to speech, but it’s often used in the context of Harris’s trailblazing career, marking historic firsts as a woman of color in elected office and carrying the weight of history, or as a call to arms to dream bigger and leave the past behind.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a way, this quote contradicts Harris’s coconut tree line. As one <a href="https://x.com/Sturgeons_Law/status/1807513289330450566">X user</a> put it: “How are you supposed to exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you AND be, unburdened by what has been at the same time? Waiting for her 3rd great revelation that synthesizes these two.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The “significance of the passage of time”</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Speaking at an <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?518860-1/vice-president-harris-remarks-affordable-broadband-access">event in Louisiana</a> to announce millions of dollars in funding for broadband access, Harris referenced touring a library and reflected on historical inequities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We were talking about the significance of the passage of time, right? The significance of the passage of time. When you think about it, there is a great significance in the passage of time in terms of what we need to do to lay these wires.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She repeated the phrase a few more times, as noted in a clip widely <a href="https://x.com/EndWokeness/status/1808533077271990424">shared online</a>, and especially by right-wing users in the last few days.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The wheels on the bus </strong><strong><em>do</em></strong><strong> go round and round</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When seeing her campaign tour bus for the first time in 2019 during the Democratic presidential primaries, another video of Harris being a little awkward was shared on social media.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As the camera pans 180 degrees around her, she walks across a lawn and onto the bus as she giggles and sings “the wheels on the bus go round and round,” slightly <a href="https://x.com/drmistercody/status/1808229682825122190">off-key</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">The vice president does impressions</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More recently, clips of Harris showing another kind of less polished persona have also reappeared online: one from the ceremonial swearing-in of senators in January 2023, when <a href="https://x.com/_natemorris/status/1610652197968089088">Harris imitates</a> Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet’s deep booming voice, and another from 2019, when she <a href="https://x.com/GraduatedBen/status/1808276737005916267">imitates</a> her husband’s parents’ voices <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtAPOKDV-nY">during an interview</a> at the 92<sup>nd</sup> Street Y in New York City.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>There are plenty more</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You might remember other classic Harris deliveries — or you might be encountering them for the first time:&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/we-did-it-joe">“We did it, Joe.”</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://x.com/findareaction/status/1588718308060168193">“I love Venn diagrams.”</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://x.com/TheMemesArchive/status/1557191149424713728">“I love good news.”</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How she <a href="https://x.com/CapehartJ/status/1595526310335586305">seasons a turkey</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://x.com/SirajAHashmi/status/1794818668200608070">“Do not come.”</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris’s stint as vice president has often been pretty unremarkable, but it has provided a rich vein of memes, in part because she can be an awkward communicator.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s part of what fueled critical media coverage of her during the first year of her tenure, and which led the White House to largely sideline her during the first half of the Biden presidency.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other Kamala memes are rooted in the hokey nature of a lot of modern political speech: derived from aphorisms and pseudo-philosophical diction in the hope of echoing something like former President Barack Obama’s oratory.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As the first female, Black, and South Asian vice president, Harris was always doomed to receive an extraordinary amount of scrutiny and bias — and emphasized her persona as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuEZcAgOQs0">“joyful warrior”</a> in part to combat some of those stereotypes. The joyful warrior, it seems, is sometimes a goofy one too. Harris delivers many of these lines in a genuinely funny way, with an affect unlike many politicians (described sometimes as just <a href="https://x.com/Chelsea_Fagan/status/1591478294444400640">vibing</a> along).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, all this talk about being KHive pilled, or coconutpilled<strong>,</strong> especially from people who were skeptical or critical of the vice president just a few weeks ago<strong> </strong>speaks to the uncertainty of this moment. Plenty of people were wondering whether Biden would still be the Democratic nominee by the end of the summer. They’re meme-ing their way to a new celebration of Harris — unburdened by what has been. </p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Just a few hours before President Joe Biden announced that he will not seek a second term in the White House, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/21/biden-johnson-2024-elections-laws-00169973">threatened lawsuits</a> to try to force Biden to appear as the Democratic candidate on at least some state ballots.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Every state has its own system,” Johnson told ABC News, “and in some of these, it’s not possible to simply just switch out a candidate.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a system governed by the rule of law, Johnson’s threats are empty. Though Biden was the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee until he decided to withdraw from the race, he would not legally have become the Democratic nominee until he was formally nominated by delegates to the party’s convention, which is <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/21/when-is-dnc-convention-chicago-2024/74491378007/">scheduled to begin August 19</a>. So there’s no need to “switch out” Biden for another candidate because Biden was never formally on any state’s 2024 ballot.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, the world we live in is post-<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf"><em>Trump v. United States</em></a><em> </em>(2024), the Supreme Court decision holding that former President Donald Trump is immune from prosecution for any crimes he committed using his official authority as president. That decision had <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/359206/supreme-court-incompetent-abortion-trump-immunity">no more basis in law</a> than a decision forcing Democrats to run Biden for president would have. So the possibility that a GOP-controlled Supreme Court will make up some reason to sabotage Democrats’ chances of holding the White House cannot be entirely ruled out.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Court would struggle to justify such sabotage, in part because its own decisions benefiting Trump undercut the kind of lawsuits envisioned by Johnson. The Supreme Court’s recent decision in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-719_19m2.pdf"><em>Trump v. Anderson</em></a> (2024), which reversed Colorado’s attempt to remove Republican Donald Trump from the 2024 ballot because of Trump’s role in the January 6 insurrection, also cuts against allowing any state to overrule the Democratic Party’s choice of candidate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Anderson</em> relied heavily on <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/514/779/"><em>US Term Limits v. Thornton</em></a> (1995), which held that “powers over the election of federal officers had to be delegated to, rather than reserved by, the States.” That means that, even if a state wanted to remove the Democratic presidential nominee (who will almost certainly be Vice President Kamala Harris) from the ballot and replace her with Biden, it would have to point to a federal constitutional provision or law permitting it to do so.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>State laws generally do not prevent Democrats from putting Harris on the ballot instead of Biden</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though Speaker Johnson did not identify which state laws might prevent Democrats from nominating Harris instead of Biden as their presidential candidate, the Heritage Foundation, a far-right think tank closely aligned with the GOP, published a memo claiming that three states — <a href="https://x.com/OversightPR/status/1805239354505257196">Georgia, Nevada, and Wisconsin</a> — may have laws that will frustrate the Democratic Party’s transition from Biden to Harris.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But none of these states’ laws should be read to prevent Harris from appearing as the Democratic Party’s nominee on the 2024 ballot.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Georgia law does require some presidential candidates to file a “notice of candidacy” in early July, but that same law <a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2022/title-21/chapter-2/article-4/part-1/section-21-2-132/">exempts the nominees of political parties</a> that held “a national convention and therein nominated candidates for President and Vice President of the United States.” In case there is any uncertainty about what the Georgia law means, Gabriel Sterling, a high-ranking state elections official, confirmed on X (formerly known as Twitter) Monday morning that <a href="https://x.com/GabrielSterling/status/1815370759985856541">whoever Democrats choose at their August convention</a> will appear on the Georgia ballot.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similarly, in Nevada, regulations promulgated by the secretary of state’s office provide that “each major political party must provide the names of the party’s respective candidates for president and vice president of the United States to the secretary of state by <a href="https://www.nvsos.gov/sos/home/showpublisheddocument/13075/638446205331930000">not later than 5 pm on the first business day of September</a> of the year of a presidential election.” The first business day of September has not happened yet.</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race. Catch up on this story.</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">President Joe Biden surrendered to pressure from top Democrats and campaign donors who urged him to step aside amid concerns over his age and low polling numbers against Donald Trump.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/358559/biden-harris-whitmer-newsom-shapiro-buttigieg-alternative-nomination-candidate-2024">Do other Democrats actually poll better against Trump than Biden?</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.vox.com/joe-biden/361991/361991biden-campaign-funds-after-drops-out">What happens to Biden’s campaign cash?</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357955/biden-age-democrats-nominee-kamala-harris">How did Democrats get here?</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/358084/biden-drop-out-lbj-harry-truman">What can we learn from incumbents who stepped aside</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/362062/biden-drop-out-republicans-accuse-democrats-coup">Why Republicans are accusing Democrats of a &#8220;coup&#8221;</a></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wisconsin law, meanwhile, provides that “nominees chosen at a national convention” must be certified “<a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/8/16/7#:~:text=The%20state%20or%20national%20chairperson,(2)%20(a).">no later than 5 pm on the first Tuesday in September preceding a presidential election</a>.” So, much like in Georgia and Nevada, Biden was never certified as the Democratic Party’s 2024 nominee, and the party has plenty of time to choose a different candidate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So that should be the ball game. In all three states flagged by Heritage, major party presidential nominees are determined after each party’s convention takes place. So there is no need to switch the Democratic Party’s nominee from Biden to Harris because Biden never formally became the Democratic nominee.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, there is one possible vehicle the Supreme Court could use to sabotage Harris. The normal rule is that state Supreme Courts have the final word on all questions of state law, so the US Supreme Court should play no role in deciding which candidate qualifies for each state’s ballot. In <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-1271_3f14.pdf"><em>Moore v. Harper</em></a> (2023), however, the Supreme Court said that it could overrule a state court’s interpretation of a state election law if a majority of the justices thought that the state court’s decision “<a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/6/27/23775378/supreme-court-moore-harper-john-roberts-independent-state-legislature-north-carolina-bush-gore">exceed[s] the bounds of ordinary judicial review</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Court, however, has never actually invoked this self-given power, and it’s unclear how the justices would defend a decision overruling state law.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Republican lower court judges could wreak havoc before the Supreme Court weighs in</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One risk Democrats should be prepared for is that a lower court judge closely aligned with the Republican Party might issue a court order forcing Biden’s name back on the ballot. It’s far from clear what the legal basis of such a decision would be, but there are judges — think of figures like <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/12/17/23512766/supreme-court-matthew-kacsmaryk-judge-trump-abortion-immigration-birth-control">Christian Right crusader Matthew Kacsmaryk</a> or Aileen Cannon, the trial judge who has <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/6/13/23757893/aileen-cannon-donald-trump-jack-smith-indictment-mar-a-lago-maga">behaved like a member of Trump’s criminal defense team</a> — who’ve shown an extraordinary willingness to bend the law to achieve Republican goals.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also trivially easy for Republicans to bring a lawsuit before a friendly judge. Any lawsuit filed in Amarillo, Texas, for example, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/5/24/23725897/abortion-planned-parenthood-matthew-kacsmaryk-supreme-court-medical-progress-medicaid">automatically lands in Kacsmaryk’s courtroom</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Would the Supreme Court affirm a decision by someone like Kacsmaryk or Cannon which sought to rig the 2024 election for Donald Trump? Again, such a decision would require an unusual amount of cynicism by the justices, even by the standards of this unusually cynical Supreme Court.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even if everything works out for the Democratic Party in the end, Democrats should at least be ready for a Trump-aligned judge to temporarily throw the election into chaos.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361827/biden-drops-out-2024-kamala-convention">Following President Joe Biden’s exit from the 2024 presidential race</a>, and his endorsement of <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360327/vice-president-kamala-harris-joe-biden-nominee">Vice President Kamala Harris</a> as his choice for the Democratic nominee, one of the next big questions that’s emerged is who could potentially be her running mate. Though Harris is not the nominee yet, Biden’s backing gives her a significant boost ahead of <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357936/biden-harris-buttigieg-newsom-whitmer-pritzker-convetion-debate-2024">other potential contenders</a>, fueling speculation about who else could join the ticket.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Historically, vice presidents have been selected to complement the main candidate. Biden chose Harris because she would bring youth, diversity, and legal experience. And former President Donald Trump chose Vice President Mike Pence because he was a traditional conservative and offered legislative expertise that he didn’t have.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>President Joe Biden endorsed Kamala Harris for president. Here’s what to know about her.</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Vice President Kamala Harris could replace Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket in 2024.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/359620/kamala-harris-2020-president-campaign-2024-failure-lesson">What happened last time Harris ran for president</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/361750/biden-drop-out-harris-endorse-polls-against-trump-democrats-dnc">Does Harris give Democrats a better chance in 2024?</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.vox.com/kamala-harris/359072/kamala-harris-coconut-tree-context-unburden-meme-khive">Why is everyone talking about Harris and coconut trees?</a></li>

</ul>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What might Harris look for? Based on that history, there are a few guesses: Her pick could be someone from a purple or red state, who offers geographic diversity given her roots in California. And — to assuage voters who still hold sexist or racist attitudes, as President Barack Obama did with Biden in 2008 — it might be a white man.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Below is a rundown of some of the possible candidates who might be considered — and what they’d bring to the ticket.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/gettyimages-2159037882_26f6dd.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Gov. Roy Cooper, in a navy suit, speaks from a podium to a large crowd holding Biden-Harris campaign signs." title="Gov. Roy Cooper, in a navy suit, speaks from a podium to a large crowd holding Biden-Harris campaign signs." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper speaks before President Joe Biden at a post-debate campaign rally on June 28, in Raleigh, North Carolina. | Allison Joyce/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Allison Joyce/Getty Images" />
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Gov. Roy Cooper</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Cooper, 67, is the governor of North Carolina, a battleground state that Trump won narrowly in 2020 and 2016 that offers <a href="https://www.ncsbe.gov/about-elections/electoral-college">16 electoral votes</a> (of the 270 needed to win). He’s known for winning repeatedly statewide even as other Democratic candidates have struggled to do the same for roles like the Senate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As governor, he’s also vetoed Republican bills on abortion and guns, and has strong approval <a href="https://abc11.com/post/2024-elections-could-governor-roy-cooper-replace-president/15011995/">ratings overall</a>. Prior to becoming governor, he served as the state’s attorney general and in the state legislature.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Cooper could help improve Democrats’ chances in a battleground state, though it will still likely be an uphill battle given past contests in North Carolina. He’s also been pretty popular in his role, and has secured backing from some moderates and Republicans.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He previously collaborated with Harris while they each served as their states’ AG, meaning they have experience working alongside one another. And more recently, Harris and Cooper <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsVNTI1BqZo">have campaigned together</a> in the wake of <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357788/biden-trump-debate-winners-losers">Biden’s disastrous June debate</a>, during which the governor cautioned against the return of “Donald Trump’s America.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/gettyimages-2150001600_c3763f.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.736744421098,100,78.526511157804" alt="Gov. Josh Shapiro, in glasses and a navy suit jacket, waves at reporters and a crowd." title="Gov. Josh Shapiro, in glasses and a navy suit jacket, waves at reporters and a crowd." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro arrives to deliver remarks at a building trades union conference on April 24, in Washington, DC. | Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images" />
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Gov. Josh Shapiro</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Shapiro, 51, is the governor of Pennsylvania, another likely battleground state (with <a href="https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/allocation">19 Electoral College votes</a>), which Biden won in 2020 and which former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton lost in 2016.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He was elected in 2022, the same year that freshman Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) was elected to the Senate. Shapiro ran far ahead of Fetterman, <a href="https://www.politico.com/2022-election/results/pennsylvania/">winning 57 percent of the vote, to Fetterman’s 51 percent</a>. Shapiro has established himself as a moderate who helped negotiate bipartisan deals when he was in the state legislature, and is also known for his work as attorney general, when he secured settlements for victims of sexual abuse by the Catholic Diocese. He’s also been a vocal supporter of Israel amid the country’s devastating military offensive in Gaza, following Hamas’ brutal October 7 attack.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him?</strong> Like Cooper, he’s the popular Democratic governor of a swing state and could help the party improve their chances there. He’s also seen as more of a centrist who could appeal to moderate voters and independents, though his staunch backing of Israel could turn away progressive Democrats.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/gettyimages-2161807297_5538e2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Gov.

Andy Beshear speaks to reporters following a ribbon-cutting ceremony in Hazel, Kentucky, in October 2023. | Lexington Herald-Leader/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Lexington Herald-Leader/Getty Images" />
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Gov. Andy Beshear</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Beshear, 46, is the governor of Kentucky and <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/11/7/23950792/election-day-2023-kentucky-governors-race-results-democrats-republicans">has won twice in a red state that previously overwhelmingly voted for Trump</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As governor, he’s been praised for his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic as well as multiple crises in the state, including <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/4/11/23679512/louisville-kentucky-shooting-workplace">a mass shooting at a bank</a> and severe flooding. Prior to this role, he also served as Kentucky’s attorney general.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Beshear is the rare Democrat who has been able to win multiple times in a red state and could offer additional appeal to some swing voters. In addition to the support he’s received for his leadership during various crises, he’s also touted infrastructure and private sector investment in the state during his tenure.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unlike other possibilities, though, he probably wouldn’t increase Harris’s chances of winning his home state, which is solidly GOP.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-2160763179.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Gov. J.B.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Gov. J.B. Pritzker</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he? </strong>J.B. Pritzker, 59, is the governor of Illinois, a Democratic state that Biden and Clinton both won in 2020 and 2016. Before becoming governor, he was a businessman and philanthropist, and is a scion of the family behind Hyatt hotels, who’ve also been consistent and influential Democratic donors.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As governor, Pritzker has established a modest national profile, including remarks he’s given attacking Trump and calls he’s made for more federal resources to address immigration in Illinois.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Pritzker has already built some name recognition as a fixture on cable news, and has proven to be a vocal Trump antagonist. Pritzker’s personal wealth could also potentially be a boon to the campaign, though his own state is not a battleground that would expand the Democratic map.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-2160744008_a0c39e.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Sen.

Mark Kelly (D-AZ) is questioned about the candidacy of President Joe Biden after a Senate luncheon on July 9. | Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images" />
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Sen. Mark Kelly</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Kelly is the junior senator of Arizona — a swing state with <a href="https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/allocation">11 Electoral College votes</a> — <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/11/5/21537670/senate-2020-results-arizona-mark-kelly-winner">who was elected in 2020</a> by framing himself as a candidate willing to work across the aisle. Previously, Biden won Arizona in 2020, while Clinton lost the state in 2016. Kelly is also known for his career as an astronaut alongside his twin brother Scott Kelly, and as the husband of gun control advocate and former US Rep. Gabby Giffords.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Kelly has a higher profile than some of the other names on this list, and is respected both for his scientific expertise and contributions as an astronaut in addition to his time in the Senate. He’s been a prominent gun control advocate alongside Giffords and made pushing these policies a priority.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given his efforts to appeal to both Republicans and independents in Arizona, he’d be another option who could help with trying to reach those voters. Arizona also continues to be an important battleground this time around, including in its <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings">Senate race</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-1394802139.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Pete Buttigieg, in a navy suit and white shirt, is shown from the side, while pinning an index card onto a wall full of similar cards with handwritten notes. " title="Pete Buttigieg, in a navy suit and white shirt, is shown from the side, while pinning an index card onto a wall full of similar cards with handwritten notes. " data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg attends a White House correspondents’ brunch on April 30, 2022, in Washington, DC. | Paul Morigi/Getty Images for White House Correspondents Insider" data-portal-copyright="Paul Morigi/Getty Images for White House Correspondents Insider" />
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Secretary Pete Buttigieg</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he?</strong> Buttigieg, 42, is the secretary of transportation who rose to prominence as a former 2020 presidential candidate. He’s staked out more moderate positions and was previously mayor of South Bend, Indiana.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He’s become known for his media savvy and strong television appearances as an advocate for the Biden-Harris administration. He’s also had to respond to crises including the train accident and <a href="https://www.vox.com/science/2023/2/18/23603471/east-palestine-ohio-derailment-water-contamination-health">chemical spill in East Palestine</a>, Ohio, as well as the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024/1/8/24030677/boeing-alaska-airlines-plane-737-max-door-plug">Alaska Airlines mishap</a> when a door plug dropped out of a plane.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Buttigieg has been a strong spokesperson for the Biden-Harris White House and is well-established among the Democratic electorate. He’s among the youngest of possible choices, would contribute more representation from the Midwest,<strong> </strong>and could appeal to centrist voters. He’d also become the first openly LGBTQ person to be on a presidential ticket.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/gettyimages-2161013764_474f9c.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752616398754,100,78.494767202492" alt="Gov.

Gavin Newsom speaks during a press conference in Oakland, California, on July 11. | Stephen Lam/San Francisco Chronicle/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Stephen Lam/San Francisco Chronicle/Getty Images" />
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Gov. Gavin Newsom</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Newsom, 56, is the governor of California, and a longstanding political personality. He’s been a vocal advocate for more progressive policies, and for Democrats to more directly confront Republicans.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Prior to being governor, he was also lieutenant governor and mayor of San Francisco.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Newsom has already made clear that he wants to be a fighter for Democrats and has supporters who are interested in his approach. He’s also used opportunities like a debate against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to make some splashy points for the party and to get more attention, and could do the same for a possible campaign.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As governor of California, however, he wouldn’t bring additional geographic diversity to the ticket, and he also wouldn’t help with delivering a swing state, as his own is solidly Democratic.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Out of the running</h2>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-1247112367.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Gov.

Gretchen Whitmer, in a snakeskin-patterned blouse, speaks into a set of microphones, smillng, with the state seal of Michigan behind her." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer speaks at a press conference about an electric-vehicle battery plant in February 2023 in Romulus, Michigan. | Bill Pugliano/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Bill Pugliano/Getty Images" />
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Gov. Gretchen Whitmer</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is she? </strong>Whitmer, 52, is the governor of Michigan, a key swing state with <a href="https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/allocation">15 Electoral College votes</a> that Biden won in 2020 and that Clinton lost in 2016.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She’s been a popular leader in this role, and was initially known for how much she emphasized infrastructure and “fixing the damn roads.” Since then she’s been an outspoken advocate for abortion rights and for gender equity, speaking openly about how she was sexually assaulted in college. Prior to being governor, Whitmer was a member of the state legislature and the first woman to become the Democratic leader of the state Senate. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What was the case for her? </strong>She’s among the members of the list who have strong and positive national recognition, and who could help raise Democrats’ chances in a pivotal swing state. Whitmer has also focused on issues including infrastructure and health care, which could broaden Democrats’ appeal to moderate voters. And if Harris and Whitmer were on the same ticket, they would form a groundbreaking all-woman ticket — something that neither major party has run before.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Why she won&#8217;t be the new VP:</strong> Less than 24 hours after Biden endorsed Harris, Whitmer emphatically told reporters that she has no desire to be vice president. “I’m not planning to go anywhere,” <a href="https://x.com/kenvogel/status/1815417822056755621">she said, adding</a>, “I am not leaving Michigan; I&#8217;m proud to be the governor of Michigan.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Update, July 22, 2024, 12:58 pm ET:</em></strong> <em>This piece was originally published on July 21 and has been updated to include Gov. Whitmer’s remarks on her unwillingness to serve as vice president.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Correction, July 21, 2024, 11:59 pm ET: </strong>A previous version of this story misstated Gabby Giffords’s position on guns. She is a gun control advocate.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After weeks of intense media speculation and sustained pressure from Democratic lawmakers, major donors, and senior advisers, President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/21/us/biden-withdraw-letter.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has announced</a> that he is bowing out of the presidential race. He is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/07/21/us/biden-drops-out-election" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first sitting president to step aside so close to Election Day</a>. “I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus entirely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,” Biden said in a letter on Sunday. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris, to take his place. “Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year,”&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/JoeBiden/status/1815087772216303933" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">he said</a>&nbsp;in another statement. Not long after, Harris announced via the Biden campaign that she intends to run for president. “I am honored to have the president’s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/21/kamala-harris-running-for-president-00170067" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">she said</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During his term, President Biden managed to shepherd a surprising number of major policies into law with a razor-thin Democratic majority in the Senate. His crowning achievement is signing the <a href="https://grist.org/politics/one-year-in-the-inflation-reduction-act-is-working-kind-of/">Inflation Reduction Act</a>, or IRA — the biggest climate spending law in US history, with the potential to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions up to 42 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. In announcing his withdrawal, Biden called it “the most significant climate legislation in the history of the world.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite his legislative successes, the 81-year-old Democrat couldn’t weather widespread blowback following a debate performance in June in which he appeared frail and struck many in his party as ill-equipped to lead the country for another four years. He will leave office with a portion of his <a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/biden-administration-tracking-climate-action-progress" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proposed climate agenda unpassed</a> and the US <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/hope-dims-that-the-u-s-can-meet-2030-climate-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still projected to miss</a> his administration’s goal of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/20/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-catalyze-global-climate-action-through-the-major-economies-forum-on-energy-and-climate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reducing emissions by at least 50 percent by 2030</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Former President Donald Trump has vowed to undo many of the policies Biden accomplished if he becomes president, <a href="https://www.taxnotes.com/featured-news/ill-scrap-ira-tax-credits-day-1-trump-says/2023/09/28/7hdjq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including parts of the IRA</a>. And scores of his key advisers and former members of his presidential administration contributed to <a href="https://grist.org/politics/what-project-2025-would-to-do-climate-policy-in-the-us/">a blueprint</a> that advocates for scrapping the vast majority of the nation’s climate and environmental protections. Whichever Democrat runs against Trump has a weighty mandate: protect America’s already tenuous climate and environmental legacy from Republican attacks.</p>

</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With Biden’s endorsement, Vice President Harris, a <a href="https://scorecard.lcv.org/moc/kamala-harris" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">former US senator from California</a>, is the favored Democratic nominee, but that doesn’t mean she will automatically get the nomination. There are fewer than 30 days until the Democratic National Convention on August 19. The thousands of Democratic delegates who already cast their votes for Biden will either decide on a nominee before the convention or hold an open convention to find their new candidate — something that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/21/open-convention-democrats-biden-drop-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hasn’t been done since 1968</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As vice president, Harris <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/16/politics/kamala-harris-inflation-reduction-act-climate-change/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">argued</a> for the allocation of $20 billion for the Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, aimed at aiding disadvantaged communities facing climate impacts, and frequently promoted the IRA at events, touting the bill’s investments in clean energy jobs, including installation of energy-efficient lighting, and replacing gas furnaces with electric heat pumps. She was also the highest-ranking US official to attend the international climate talks at <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/kamala-harris-at-climate-cop28-summit-world-must-fight-those-stalling-action/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COP28 in Dubai last year</a>, where she announced a US commitment to double energy efficiency and triple renewable energy capacity by 2030. At that same conference, Harris <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/02/politics/kamala-harris-cop28-saturday/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a $3 billion commitment to the Green Climate Fund to help developing nations adapt to climate challenges, although <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/kamala-harris-at-climate-cop28-summit-world-must-fight-those-stalling-action/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Politico reported</a> that the sum was “subject to the availability of funds,” according to the Treasury Department. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Vice President Harris has been integral to the Biden administration’s most important climate accomplishments and has a long track record as an impactful climate champion,” Evergreen Action, the climate-oriented political group, said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris caught some flak for using a potentially overstated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/white-house-puts-1-trillion-price-tag-on-climate-efforts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“$1 trillion over 10 years”</a>&nbsp;figure to describe the Biden administration’s climate investments. She got that sum from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/white-house-puts-1-trillion-price-tag-on-climate-efforts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adding up all of the administration’s major investments over the past four years</a>, some of which are only vaguely connected to climate change.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a presidential candidate in 2019, Harris <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/04/politics/kamala-harris-climate-plan/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proposed</a> a $10 trillion climate plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045 on the campaign trail, including 100-percent carbon-neutral electricity by 2030. Under the plan, 50 percent of new vehicles sold would be zero-emission by 2030; and 100 percent of cars by 2035. But that proposal, like similarly ambitious climate change proposals released by other Democrats during that election cycle, was nothing more than a campaign wishlist. A better indicator of what her plans for climate change as president would look like — better, even, than her record as vice president, as much of her agenda was set by the Biden administration — could be buried in her record as San Francisco’s district attorney from 2004 to 2011 and as California’s attorney general from 2011 to 2017. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As district attorney, Harris&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/SAN-FRANCISCO-D-A-creates-environmental-unit-2666667.php" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">created</a>&nbsp;an environmental justice unit to address environmental crimes affecting San Francisco’s poorest residents and&nbsp;<a href="https://calepa.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2016/10/Enforcement-Orders-2009yr-UHComplaint.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">prosecuted</a>&nbsp;several companies including U-Haul for violation of hazardous waste laws. Harris later touted her environmental justice unit as the first such unit in the country.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.leefang.com/p/kamala-harris-greenwashed-justice" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">An investigation</a>&nbsp;found the unit only filed a handful of lawsuits, though, and none of them were against the city’s major industrial polluters.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As attorney general, Harris secured an $86 million settlement from Volkswagen for rigging its vehicles with emissions-cheating software and investigated ExxonMobil over its climate change disclosures. She also&nbsp;<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-sues-phillips-66-and-conocophillips-over" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">filed</a>&nbsp;a civil lawsuit against Phillips 66 and ConocoPhillips for environmental violations at gas stations, which eventually resulted in a $11.5 million&nbsp;<a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-environmental-violations-settlement-20150508-story.html#:~:text=ConocoPhillips%20and%20Phillips%2066%20agreed,settle%20a%20California%20civil%20complaint.&amp;text=Texas%20energy%20companies%20ConocoPhillips%20and,anti%2Dpollution%20laws%20since%202006." rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">settlement</a>. And she&nbsp;<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-announces-indictment-plains-all-american" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">conducted a criminal investigation</a>&nbsp;of an oil company over a 2015 spill in Santa Barbara. The company was found guilty and&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-98c6da87a0f8469a8d401ace5196ff12" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">convicted on nine criminal charges</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We must do more,”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/kamala-harris-at-climate-cop28-summit-world-must-fight-those-stalling-action/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Harris said</a>&nbsp;late last year at the climate summit in Dubai. “Our action collectively, or worse, our inaction will impact billions of people for decades to come.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We’re <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2022/10/24/universal-basic-income/">flooded</a> by guaranteed income pilot experiments that offer some promising results, but <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/21/23882353/child-poverty-expanded-child-tax-credit-census-welfare-inflation-economy-data">don’t seem</a> to be moving us any closer to actual federal policy. Yet findings published today from the largest randomized basic income experiment in the US to date, backed by Sam Altman and OpenAI, should get your notice.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The study, held from November 2020 through October 2023, gave 1,000 recipients $1,000 per month, no strings attached. It’s one of the biggest and longest trials ever run on direct cash giving. Many other <a href="https://guaranteedincome.us/">basic income pilots</a> have given people $500 or less, and rarely for more than a year or two.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the study was run by a group of academics, it was <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/basic-income">set in motion</a> by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. For years, Altman has been publicly worrying that basic income will become necessary as AI eliminates traditional jobs while creating huge stockpiles of wealth held by a few. “If public policy doesn’t adapt accordingly, most people will end up worse off than they are today,” <a href="https://moores.samaltman.com/">he wrote</a> in 2021. (Disclosure: Vox Media is one of several publishers that have signed partnership agreements with OpenAI. Our reporting remains editorially independent.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Altman isn’t alone. Many major figures in the tech world, from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-universal-basic-income-ubi-ai-automation-unemployment-quotes-2024-6">Elon Musk</a> to the “godfather of AI,” <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnd607ekl99o">Geoffrey Hinton</a>, believe AI will usher a wave of technological unemployment, and basic income will become necessary to keep us all afloat.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On this, I’m conflicted. In general, unconditional cash can be <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23965898/child-poverty-expanded-child-tax-credit-economy-welfare-phase-ins">an effective anti-poverty policy</a>, but the extensive list of small experiments and accumulating evidence doesn’t seem to be furthering the case of basic income to becoming a reality. So maybe any press is good press, and all the attention AI leaders are bringing to basic income will help it along. Spreading the fear of AI stealing all our jobs seems to garner much more enthusiasm for basic income than continually <a href="https://www.economicpossibility.org/reports/basic-income">pointing at the evidence</a>. (Just look at Andrew Yang’s<a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/10/18/20919322/basic-income-freedom-dividend-andrew-yang-automation"> 2020 presidential campaign</a>, which centered on universal basic income as a response to automation.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But hitching <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/17/15364546/universal-basic-income-review-stern-murray-automation">the case for basic income</a> to fears of rapid AI progress makes it far more vulnerable than it needs to be. If there’s no great wave of AI-driven unemployment, if the AI <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-18/goldman-s-top-stock-analyst-is-waiting-for-ai-bubble-to-burst">bubble bursts</a> and turns out to be <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/7/18/23794187/telephone-operator-switchboard-automation-att-feigenbaum-gross">hardly any different</a> than cycles of innovation and technological unemployment in the past, support for basic income would fall, too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet the arguments for some kind of basic income are strong, no matter what happens with AI. There could be absolutely no further progress, AI could come to a complete and eternal standstill, and the case for basic income would remain as strong as ever: unconditional cash can be a simple and flexible way to style income-support policies that actually reach everyone in need (at the trade-off of higher taxes).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The basic income movement might be better off severing ties with speculations about AI altogether. Then, the conversation could focus on what basic income can actually be: an effective anti-poverty tool that would neither stave off dystopia nor usher in a leisurely paradise, but instead, just <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/10/13/23914745/basic-income-radical-economy-poverty-capitalism-taxes">a world with less poverty</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">News from the largest randomized study of basic income in the US to date</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many cash transfer advocates feel that the movement is <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/4/28/23044957/ubi-guaranteed-income-baltimore-new-york-mississippi">overdue to graduate</a> from research to actual policy. But the “Unconditional Income Study,” as this three-year endeavor by the nonprofit <a href="https://www.openresearchlab.org/approach">OpenResearch</a> has been dubbed, added some welcome substance to the otherwise slim pile of research on big cash transfers over long periods of time. (OpenResearch is not affiliated directly with OpenAI, but it grew out of the tech accelerator Y Combinator when Altman ran it, and has received a combined $24 million from Altman and OpenAI’s nonprofit organization.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The study gave out monthly checks to people between the ages of 21 and 40 living in Texas and Illinois. To qualify, their 2019 household income had to be less than 300 percent of the federal poverty line: that would mean $77,250 for a <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines/prior-hhs-poverty-guidelines-federal-register-references/2019-poverty-guidelines">family of four</a>, or $37,470 for an individual. The average participant’s household income in 2019 was about $30,000. One thousand people were randomized into the treatment group and received the full $1,000 per month, while another 2,000 were part of a control group that got $50 per month.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The results are coming out in batches, with <a href="https://www.openresearchlab.org/studies/unconditional-cash-study/study">two papers</a> out today — one on <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w32719">employment effects</a> and another on <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w32711">health outcomes</a> — and another on consumption still in the works. So far, the results are kind of scrambled, refusing to neatly fit into any particular view on basic income.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Recipients spent an average of $310 more per month, mostly on housing, food, and car expenses. Overall, however, their incomes fell by about $125 per month, excluding the transfers.<strong> </strong>The drop in earnings was largely driven by people choosing to work a little less (since the transfers meant they still came out ahead). In total, labor market participation declined by 2 percent, cashing out as working about 1.3 hours less per week, or roughly eight fewer days of work over the course of a year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At first glance, this finding is somewhat at odds with <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w24337">other basic income experiments</a> in the US, and challenges <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23965898/child-poverty-expanded-child-tax-credit-economy-welfare-phase-ins">the narrative advocates</a> have been pushing that unconditional cash won’t make people choose less work. Sometimes, maybe it will. But eight fewer days of work per year doesn’t exactly look like the doomsday scenario of everyone choosing to live out their remaining days on welfare, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2265291">surfing</a>, or playing video games on the taxpayer’s dime.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The cash’s impact on health was a little more straightforward: it didn’t seem to do much. Despite detailed data, including blood samples from some participants and nutritional intake, “We find essentially no evidence of improvements in physical health due to the transfers,” the paper states, “and can rule out even small improvements.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There were short-lived improvements in mental health, mostly through reductions in stress. But they faded by the end of the first year. Recipients also showed a major increase in food security during year one, which also faded by the second year. If there was any silver lining in the paper on health, it was that recipients went to hospitals, doctors, and dentists more often, and spent about $20 more per month on medical care as a result of the transfer, which the authors note could translate into indirect benefits in the long term.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The appeal of cash transfers lies in the freedom that they give beneficiaries to make their own choices about what type of consumption to prioritize,” the authors conclude. “However, the nature of that freedom means that cash transfers are a blunt instrument for improving health and reducing health disparities specifically.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The results suggest that policymakers interested in improving particular health outcomes might be better off pursuing more targeted interventions, like expanding Medicaid eligibility, reducing prescription drug costs, or making it easier to make primary care appointments. Targeting health directly, in other words, rather than simple cash.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As the researchers argue, “if policymakers seek to reduce poverty and improve the well-being of low-income groups more generally, cash transfers could still represent an important option, even if they do not improve health outcomes in the near term.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Basic income restored a little bit of capitalism’s forgotten promise: the freedom to choose more leisure time</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the most controversial and politically <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/04/manchin-wont-support-enhanced-child-tax-credit-without-work-requirement.html">charged</a> parts of the basic income debate is how it would affect work. Among critical economists and policy wonks, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/20/opinion/child-tax-credit-basic-income.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">concern</a> isn’t that we’ll need basic income because there won’t be any jobs left after AI, but that basic income could itself be the thing that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/02/opinion/child-allowance-credit-romney.html">wipes away</a> our desire to work.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether these results support that fear depends on how deeply you read into the details. The results clearly show that people do work a little less. But going a bit deeper, the employment effects were concentrated among young, single parents. Does the option for single parents to choose an extra eight days off per year constitute a policy failure — or success?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The project also captured pretty detailed time-use data, letting researchers figure out where recipients were re-allocating their newly chosen time away from work. Though 1,000 people obviously made a variety of choices over the course of three years, the dominant trade was clearly toward more leisure time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’ve <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/24065976/economists-post-scarcity-abundance-industrial-revolution-socialism-capitalism">previously written</a> about how, until recently, Americans across the political spectrum used to see the promise of capitalism as exactly that: delivering people the choice of cashing in economic progress for more leisure time. Getting an economic boost and subsequently choosing to work a little less was not seen as a policy failure, but <a href="https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/mike-konczal-tk/">the whole point</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“But for decades, workers haven’t even been getting that choice because, for the most part, productivity growth has ended up as higher profits and more inequality,” sociologist Aaron Benanav <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2023/10/10/23895776/four-day-workweek-leisure-progress-labor-economy-utopia-capitalism-burnout-worker-satisfaction">told me last year</a>. “It takes a political movement to cash that out in terms of a reduced workweek.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Apparently, a generous basic income can at least help nudge that choice back into workers’ lives. After getting an extra $1,000, recipients effectively traded in $125 to get five-and-a-half more hours per month outside of work.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Interviews with participants paint a much brighter picture than the numbers</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition to the survey data, OpenResearch held voluntary interviews with participants after the transfers ended to hear more about their experiences. Though only nine were recorded, I kept hearing variations on a theme that wasn’t captured in the statistics. (All names were changed by OpenResearch to protect the identities of participants.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Alina, a single mom living in Chicago, put it: “My whole mind kinda began to shift &#8230; I had to stop myself so that I could have the mental mind shift, the paradigm shift to say, ok, we can actually engage in system planning.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Or Celene, who lived with her ex-wife and their kids in a friend’s basement before the transfers helped them get their own home: “It helped my mind clear a little bit because I didn’t feel like as much of a failure.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Or Dominic, who lost his job during the pandemic: “The biggest thing it did was allow me a time of peace of mind so I could explore what I really wanted out of life.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Everyone seemed to mention how getting unconditional cash was literally changing their minds for the better.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The mechanism doesn’t have to be all that mysterious. Everyone faces their own challenges, and people with low incomes especially so. But woven through all the differences is at least one shared consequence: stress. And we already know that stress can literally warp the mind, <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/24065976/economists-post-scarcity-abundance-industrial-revolution-socialism-capitalism">especially around scarcity</a>. Giving people cash comes with the flexibility to address whatever sources of stress are loudest in their lives, freeing up the mind.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet, according to the numbers, the sharp reductions in stress that recipients had in the first year didn’t last, even though they shared these powerful stories after the third year. Which raises an interesting tension: Why is there such a big difference between the extremely positive stories that people are telling about their experiences, and the story that the numbers tell, which basically amounts to a shrug?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Part of it could be sampling bias: since the interviews were voluntary, maybe only people who had powerful and positive experiences opted in to the voluntary interviews to talk more about them. More broadly, though, there are parts of the human experience —&nbsp;and more specifically, the experience of being a participant in a basic income experiment — that statistics either fail to capture, or even conceal.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When I spoke with Elizabeth Rhodes, who has a joint doctorate in social work and political science, and directed the study for OpenResearch, she explained that all the variation across how people used the money, or what a “good outcome” actually is based on someone’s particular circumstances, made them difficult to capture in top-line statistics.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One person might wind up finding <a href="https://www.economicpossibility.org/insights/stockton-basic-income-employment">better work and taking on more hours</a> thanks to the cash, while another might scale back their hours to spend more time with their kids. Both cases can be good outcomes to the individuals involved, but “as an average treatment effect, where one person worked a lot more, while another worked less, it all kind of averages out.” she said.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">We should insulate the case for basic income from any potential AI bubbles</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite receiving funding from much of the tech world where talk of AI is everywhere, none of the papers published from the Unconditional Income Study mentioned AI at all. That’s a good thing, because as I mentioned earlier, we should insulate the case for basic income from the volatility and unknowns of AI.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Against the backdrop of all the “changing the world as we know it” talk, a number of analysts are beginning to think the AI <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-18/goldman-s-top-stock-analyst-is-waiting-for-ai-bubble-to-burst">bubble</a> is already <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2024/7/9/the-ai-summer">beginning</a> to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/13/from-boom-to-burst-the-ai-bubble-is-only-heading-in-one-direction">burst</a>. Maybe it will, and then it’ll inflate again. And maybe one of these go-rounds will actually lead to changes that go beyond the cycles of innovation and technological unemployment <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/7/18/23794187/telephone-operator-switchboard-automation-att-feigenbaum-gross">we’ve weathered for centuries</a>. Or maybe they won’t. Who knows!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The strongest arguments for unconditional income don’t need to rest on speculation. We have a <a href="https://basicincome.stanford.edu/research/ubi-visualization/">lot of evidence</a>. We have real-world experience from <a href="https://guaranteedincome.us/">a ton of pilot experiments</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23965898/child-poverty-expanded-child-tax-credit-economy-welfare-phase-ins">lapsed national policies</a>. And we already have <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23792854/poverty-mortality-study-public-health-antipoverty-america-deaths-poor-life-expectancy">an urgent need</a> for better anti-poverty policies, even if there wasn’t an iota more of AI development.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Breaking the link between basic income and automation would also force us to consider what — if not UBI — actually would be a good policy response to major technological unemployment. Because if we really do all lose our jobs to AI, $12,000 per year isn’t going to cushion the blow much. This is a persistent confusion in debate around basic income: if you’re talking about unconditionally giving people enough to live on indefinitely, you’re either imagining a society of monks, that everyone lives in rural West Virginia, or you aren’t actually talking about basic income at all, at least as it exists in any viable form.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The average living wage for a family of four in the US is about $104,000 per year, according to the MIT <a href="https://livingwage.mit.edu/articles/103-new-data-posted-2023-living-wage-calculator#:~:text=An%20analysis%20of%20the%20living,in%20the%20United%20States%20is">Living Wage calculator</a>. Even if a guaranteed income on the scale of this study gave the full amount to children (which most proposals do not), the same family would only get $48,000 per year, less than half the living wage. There is no realistic guaranteed income proposal that could serve as a substitute for wages altogether.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Altman himself <a href="https://moores.samaltman.com/">has argued</a> for something more nuanced in the past: taxes on AI companies and land values that feed into a <a href="https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/projects/social-wealth-fund/">social wealth fund</a> where every citizen holds an equal share, receiving a dividend that rises or falls with the fund value.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s basically a version of UBI that’s styled away from guaranteeing an end to poverty, and toward being able to adapt to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24108787/ai-economic-growth-explosive-automation">runaway economic growth</a>. In addition, maybe we’ll need to consider <a href="https://pavlina-tcherneva.net/the-case-for-a-job-guarantee/">job guarantees</a>. Or maybe compulsory employment is an iron cage we’ll finally break by more deeply <a href="https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/a-world-without-work/">democratizing</a> the economy, and whatever diminishing pools of work remain.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Either way, basic income advocates are left with a choice. You can welcome fears around AI as an incredibly effective marketing tool to spread awareness for basic income, and then try to jiu-jitsu that attention toward sturdier motivations, like <a href="https://jainfamilyinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/reweaving-the-safety-net-12.15.20.pdf">more effectively reducing poverty</a> than a patchwork of means-tested programs. Or, like me, you can try shouting into the void that we shouldn’t associate basic income and automation in the first place, since it sets the case for unconditional cash on shaky foundations, while there’s <a href="https://www.economicpossibility.org/reports/basic-income">an empirically sturdy basis</a> already established.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With the OpenResearch studies, that basis continues to grow. Whether or not that’ll lead to any policy breakthroughs before AI flops, fades into being just another new technology that shifts things around for a bit, or really does transform the economy, who knows?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In his 1924 novel <em>The Magic Mountain</em>, the German writer Thomas Mann used an idyllic alpine sanatorium as a metaphor for the torpor and self-delusion of the European elite in the years leading up to the cataclysm of World War I.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I couldn’t help but think about the book a little while attending this year’s <a href="https://www.aspensecurityforum.org/">Aspen Security Forum</a>, which was held in the tony Colorado mountain town during one of the busiest and most destabilizing news weeks in recent memory, one that&nbsp;included the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, the selection of arch-populist Sen. J.D. Vance as Trump’s running mate, and polls showing the <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-biden">increasing likelihood</a> that Trump will return to office.<strong> </strong>It took place just <em>before </em><a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361888/biden-drops-out-kamala-harris-endorsement-dnc-democratic-nominee">President Joe Biden dropped out of the race</a>, though questions about the future of the ticket were a constant backdrop to the conference. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unlike Mann’s somnambulant Europeans, of course, the international government officials, military officers, and corporate executives attending the annual gathering in the Rockies weren’t just there for their health and the mountain air, but for discussions on a range of pressing security topics from Gaza and Ukraine to the militarization of space and the role of AI in war.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, as attendees watched the sessions with one eye on their iPhones to keep up with developments from the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, it was hard to avoid the assessment that the future trajectory of many of the issues under discussion hinges significantly on the election’s outcome in November — an election that, with Biden out, is more uncertain than ever before. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Trump contrast</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President Biden had premised his case for reelection significantly on the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/abc-news-anchor-george-stephanopoulos-exclusive-interview-biden/story?id=111695695">sort of accomplishments</a> promoted and celebrated at gatherings like Aspen: the expansion of NATO, the multilateral response to the invasion of Ukraine, and the building of a network of alliances in the Pacific to counter China. Vice President Kamala Harris enters the race with less foreign policy experience than Biden, though she <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361635/kamala-harris-border-czar-immigration-mexico-guatemala-rnc" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vox.com/politics/361635/kamala-harris-border-czar-immigration-mexico-guatemala-rnc">has been involved</a> in the administration’s diplomatic efforts in the Middle East and Central America, and would presumably draw her circle of advisers from either Biden’s current team or other names that Aspen attendees and speakers are very familiar with. A major shift from Biden’s approach in Europe, China, and the Middle East seems unlikely with a Harris presidency.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump, by contrast, has promised to quickly end the war in Ukraine — a pledge celebrated on placards waved in Milwaukee — most likely by pressuring Kyiv to negotiate away territory to Moscow. He is also a longtime skeptic of European security alliances, including NATO, and recently suggested Taiwan <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/17/donald-trump-taiwan-pay-us-defence-china-national-convention">should “pay us for defense” </a>against an invasion by China, which sent the stock price of the island’s vital semiconductor manufacturers <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tsmc-shares-fall-more-than-2-after-trump-says-taiwan-should-pay-defence-2024-07-17/">falling</a>. Vance, Trump’s new running mate, is one of Congress’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360283/jd-vance-trump-vp-vice-president-authoritarian">leading skeptics</a> of efforts to defend the “liberal international order,” particularly when it comes to the war in Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race. Catch up on this story.</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">President Joe Biden surrendered to pressure from top Democrats and campaign donors who urged him to step aside amid concerns over his age and low polling numbers against Donald Trump.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361827/biden-drops-out-2024-kamala-convention">What happens now?</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/358559/biden-harris-whitmer-newsom-shapiro-buttigieg-alternative-nomination-candidate-2024">Do other Democrats actually poll better against Trump than Biden?</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.vox.com/joe-biden/361991/361991biden-campaign-funds-after-drops-out">What happens to Biden’s campaign money? </a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357955/biden-age-democrats-nominee-kamala-harris">How did Democrats get here?</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/358084/biden-drop-out-lbj-harry-truman">What can we learn from incumbents who stepped aside</a></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From the stage in Aspen, Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK) pushed back on the idea that the GOP has taken an isolationist turn, describing the <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/2024-republican-party-platform">recently adopted Republican platform</a> as a “Reaganesque peace-through-strength” document that emphasizes building the US defense industry and modernizing the military.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), a close ally of Biden, told me on the sidelines of the conference on Thursday (in between media appearances discussing Biden’s then-undetermined fate)<strong> </strong>that “in his time as president, Trump showed an unevenness and erratic nature in his foreign policy that can make it really hard to persuade our close and trusted allies that we were still a reliable partner.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While administration officials and allies abroad have been discussing what can be done to Trump-proof US foreign policy, there is a limit to those efforts. Even as he touted the Biden administration’s record on support for Ukraine and work to strengthen NATO, Secretary of State Antony Blinken conceded, “Every administration has an opportunity to set its policies. We can’t lock in the future.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Keep calm and carry on</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the most part, the foreign officials who spoke at the conference refused to take the bait when asked if they were concerned about Trump’s return. Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, whose country is likely to be the one most directly impacted by the outcome of the election, told the Aspen audience, “We believe in American leadership and we believe that the American people want their partners and allies to be strong as well &#8230; Whatever will be the outcome, we’ll work with America.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There was a sense from several officials that a Trump presidency was a movie they’d seen before, and they were more prepared for it this time. Singapore Defense Minister Ng Eng Hen told the crowd, “I would remind you that we worked with the Trump administration for meetings in Singapore” — likely a reference to the 2018 summit between the former president and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “He was very happy with Singapore because we have a trade surplus with you … I’m not so concerned.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even less concerned about a new Republican administration were representatives of the defense and technology industries — also heavily represented at Aspen.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think it could potentially be positive to have a Trump administration for a tech company trying to work with” the Department of Defense, said Tara Dougherty, CEO of the defense software company Govini. “They’re already talking about <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/16/trump-ai-executive-order-regulations-military/">Manhattan Projects for [artificial intelligence]</a> which shows they’re serious about the development and adoption of AI for military purposes.” She added that in Vance, Trump had chosen “a running mate who comes from this space.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As with last week’s NATO summit, attendees frequently argued that one of Trump’s main complaints about US allies — that they free-ride on American security guarantees and don’t pay for their own defense — is less applicable today than it was during his term, with defense budgets increasing globally in the wake of the war in Ukraine and concerns about China’s growing power.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This is a different Europe than the Europe we complained about for years,” said Gen. Christopher Cavoli, commander of the US military’s Europe Command. “This is a Europe that recognizes what the burden is and that it’s got to be shared &#8230; This is exactly the moment when American interests will be advanced most by continued participation” in Europe’s defense.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Coming down the mountain</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cavoli’s remarks (he didn’t specifically refer to Trump or the election) were met with applause in a room that didn’t need much convincing of the value of America’s global commitments. But Vance would likely argue that’s precisely the problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a <a href="https://www.vance.senate.gov/press-releases/senator-vance-delivers-a-wake-up-call-to-munich-security-conference/">speech at this year’s Munich Security Conference</a>, a gathering that draws a similar crowd to Aspen, the now-VP candidate described his view that continued military support to Ukraine is a dead end as representing “the majority of American public opinion, even though I don’t represent the majority of opinion of senators who come to Munich.” (For what it’s worth, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/05/08/views-of-ukraine-and-u-s-involvement-with-the-russia-ukraine-war/">recent polls</a> show a majority of Americans still support continuing or increasing aid to Ukraine, though there’s a stark partisan divide.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Speaking to Vox, Coons dismissed the notion that an internationalist foreign policy might be a tough sell to voters. “The strength of our alliances around the world have been the linchpins of our security and our prosperity for decades,” he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But on stage, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, an exemplar of a previous generation of globally-focused Republicans who have now all but vanished, was a bit contrite. “Those of us who were internationalists and believed in globalization” didn’t always take into account the impact it would have on some American communities, she said. “There are unemployed coal miners and unemployed steelworkers and kids who can’t get a decent education who really do wonder why we are doing what we’re doing internationally.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At gatherings like Aspen, there’s always discussion about the importance of winning over international partners to American foreign policy priorities. Increasingly, there’s a sense in these conversations that America itself also has to be won over, whoever is at the top of the Democratic ticket. But as anyone who has read Mann’s book knows, the Magic Mountain can be a tough place to get down from.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President Joe Biden just <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361827/biden-drops-out-2024-kamala-convention">relinquished his claim</a> on the Democratic nomination and handed it to Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since his <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357788/biden-trump-debate-winners-losers">disastrous debate performance</a> last month, it has been clear that Biden could best prevent Donald Trump from retaking power by <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357746/biden-trump-debate-democrats-replace-dnc">withdrawing from the presidential race.</a> More <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/03/us/politics/poll-debate-biden-trump.html">than 70 percent</a> of voters consider Biden unfit to seek another term in office. His poll numbers in swing states have <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/new-polls-show-biden-slipping-further-behind-trump-in-critical-swing-states">fallen sharply</a> in recent weeks, while the Democrats’ <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/rnc-trump-speech-biden-election-2024/card/polling-report-shows-biden-losses-extending-beyond-swing-states-t3KKgzxLEFQqNT5WuCtI">internal data</a> has shown Trump only narrowly trailing in blue states such as Minnesota, New Mexico, and New Jersey.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Plenty of candidates in American history have closed larger polling gaps than Biden’s in a campaign’s last four months. But in recent weeks, the president <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/359160/biden-abc-news-interview-drop-out">repeatedly</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360277/biden-nato-press-conference-democrats">demonstrated</a> a gross inability to effectively communicate, with each public performance generating multiple misstatements or brain freezes that reinforced the public’s doubts about his cognitive functioning.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden was undoubtedly right to step aside, but the wisdom of his decision to immediately endorse Harris — rather than clearing the way for a more open competition for the nomination at next month’s convention — is less clear.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After all, the vice president has many liabilities as a candidate, and the Democrats boast multiple popular swing-state governors whose hypothetical nomination might ease the party’s path to an Electoral College majority. Given the stakes of keeping Trump out of power, Democratic convention delegates may have been justified in picking whichever ticket seemed most likely to bring victory in November.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, I think Biden made the right call. If there were some mechanism for instantly achieving party unity around nominating Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer or Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro — or one of the party’s other top-tier talents — then Democrats would be wise to take it. But no such mechanism exists.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Failing to rally around Harris would have left Democrats bereft of a nominee until late August, giving Trump a month to campaign unopposed. And the vice president would have been highly likely to prevail at that convention anyway, given her official status as Biden’s heir apparent and the democratic legitimacy that comes with it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At this point, it is unlikely that the most promising candidates on the Democratic bench would have chosen to compete, given the risks of alienating key constituencies within the party and the widespread sense that Republicans will be favored to win in November, irrespective of whom the Democrats nominate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden made a mistake in seeking a second term. And he made another by refusing to bow out swiftly once the debate made his unfitness plain. But on Sunday, he did the best he could to reverse some of the damage. It’s now incumbent on Harris — and all other Democrats — to put together a campaign strong enough to reverse the rest.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The (reasonable but probably wrong) case against Kamala</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before examining why endorsing Harris was (probably) the right call, it’s worth taking stock of the case for an open convention.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That argument boils down to three fundamental claims: 1) Harris is not an especially strong candidate, 2) nominating the vice president prevents Democrats from getting a clean break from Biden’s vulnerabilities, and 3) the party has several strong alternative candidates.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All these claims seem right to me.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris currently has a net disapproval rating of <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/">roughly negative 12 percent.</a> And her electoral track record is unimpressive.&nbsp; In her first <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/California_Attorney_General_election,_2010">statewide election in 2010</a>, Harris beat a Republican in the race for California attorney general by less than 1 percentage point (two years earlier, Barack Obama had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_United_States_presidential_election_in_California">bested John McCain</a> by more than 23 points in that state). In 2020, Harris began her run for the Democratic nomination with <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kamala-harris-more-billionaire-donors-than-any-other-democratic-candidate-2019-11">strong fundraising</a> and an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/09/politics/kamala-harris-first-good-month-poll-of-the-week/index.html">early surge in the polls</a>. Yet her campaign collapsed before the primary’s first ballots were cast.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Further, as a Californian whose Senate <a href="https://voteview.com/person/41701/kamala-devi-harris">voting record</a> put her on the left wing of her caucus, Harris is not an ideal figurehead for a party anxious to appeal to Trump-curious Midwesterners.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>President Joe Biden endorsed Kamala Harris for president. Here’s what to know about her.</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Vice President Kamala Harris could replace Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket in 2024.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.vox.com/kamala-harris/359072/kamala-harris-coconut-tree-context-unburden-meme-khive">Why is everyone talking about Harris and coconut trees?</a></li>

</ul>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Making matters worse, Harris’s candidacy did <a href="https://www.vox.com/kamala-harris/359072/kamala-harris-coconut-tree-context-unburden-meme-khive">not fall out of a coconut tree.</a> It exists in the context of her current boss’s unpopularity and conspicuous cognitive decline. For many voters, Biden has become a byword for inflation and infirmity. A Democratic nominee with no connection to the Biden administration would have given the party distance from both of these liabilities: They would have faced much less of a compulsion to defend Biden’s record, while confronting few questions about their own hypothetical complicity in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/joe-biden-age-public-election-campaign-343a47bf">concealing the president’s frailty</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On both these fronts, Harris could find herself saddled with her boss’s baggage.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, the Democrats have some formidable politicians on their bench. Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro and Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer both boast <a href="https://www.wlns.com/news/poll-majority-of-michiganders-approve-of-whitmers-performance/">majority</a> <a href="https://www.abc27.com/pennsylvania-politics/josh-shapiro-pennsylvanias-most-popular-governor-at-this-point-in-term-poll/">approval</a> in their critical swing states.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democrats would likely be better off with one of those governors as their standard-bearer, all else being equal. But this does not mean that the party would have been better off holding a completely open convention.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>An open convention probably would have resulted in Harris’s nomination</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The problems with withholding endorsements from Harris and pursuing an open convention are threefold.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, the Democratic Party is poorly positioned to organize and legitimize a contested convention. It has been more than half a century since the Democrats chose a nominee through convention wrangling, rather than purely through the primary process. In that time, the institutional structure of the party has dramatically changed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the mid-20th century, Democratic delegates consisted in no small part of the leaders of trade unions and urban machines — individuals who were directly accountable to mass constituencies. This made it possible for them to credibly speak on behalf of key Democratic voting blocs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, since contested conventions were routine occurrences in American politics at that time, there was a great deal of institutional knowledge about how to broker such competitions and reach consensus.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, by contrast, Democratic delegates are largely volunteers who speak for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/09/podcasts/transcript-ezra-klein-interviews-jamelle-bouie.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/09/podcasts/transcript-ezra-klein-interviews-jamelle-bouie.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">no one beyond the primary voters</a> in their areas. In this context, a contested convention could be chaotic, and its nominee lacking in democratic legitimacy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To be sure, anointing Harris is not especially democratic either. She was not elected by primary voters, any more than any other non-Biden Democrat. But the US electorate did vote to make her the president’s heir apparent, and this gives her a source of legitimacy that any other selection would lack.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Second, and more importantly, failing to coalesce behind a nominee today would have left Democrats without a standard-bearer for a month. This would inhibit fundraising, at a time when the Trump-Vance ticket is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/20/fundraising-july-election-trump-biden/">taking in serious cash</a>. And it would mean ceding swing-state airwaves to the Republican message — or else, running exclusively negative advertising — for the next four weeks. This is especially risky in a context where Democrats face the challenge of introducing a new nominee to the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Biden’s default replacement, having been elected to fill in for him in the event of his death or disability, Harris was uniquely capable of becoming her party’s consensus nominee in the absence of a protracted process.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, Harris would have been highly likely to win an open convention, anyway. Before Biden dropped out, South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn — a highly influential member of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) — let it be known that he would favor Harris were Biden to drop out.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Due to her uniquely high name recognition, meanwhile, Harris would likely outperform any other individual Democratic candidate in opinion polls. And as such polls, in combination with her title, rendered her the frontrunner for the nomination, various Democratic interest groups would have had an incentive to line up behind her, so as to ensure their influence in the likely Democratic nominee’s hypothetical administration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Assuming that congressional caucuses, Democratic interest groups, and poll respondents did indeed all indicate their preference for Harris, Democratic delegates would almost certainly have felt compelled to back her.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most critically, it seems unlikely that Shapiro, Whitmer, or other top-tier Democratic talents would have entered the fray in any case. For the reasons already stated, any non-Harris candidate would have faced an uphill battle for the nomination. And merely trying to win that nod would have come at the cost of potentially alienating constituencies that they would need to win during a future primary: A white candidate hoping to one day compete in the South Carolina primary might be wise to avoid being the person who tried and failed to block the first African-American vice president from claiming a nomination that was hers to inherit, at least from the perspective of some Black Democratic elected officials.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s more, even if the gamble of challenging Harris paid off initially, the prize would ultimately have been the mixed-blessing of serving as the Democratic nominee in a year when the Republican ticket is favored. We cannot know exactly how polls and betting markets would have shifted had Democrats endorsed Shapiro or Whitmer. But Republicans have long held an advantage over Democrats this cycle <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/511979/neither-party-liked-gop-holds-advantage-issues.aspx#:~:text=GOP%20Holds%20Edge%20for%20Handling%20Americans'%20Top%20Worry&amp;text=Forty%2Dfour%20percent%20say%20the,same%20or%20have%20no%20preference.">on the issues </a>most important to voters, chief of all inflation and immigration.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given the balance of risks and benefits here, an ambitious and promising younger Democrat might prefer to sit back and position themselves for 2028 or 2032. At the very least, no swing-state Democrat let word of their interest in potentially running leak in the weeks since Biden’s bad debate.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Harris may be stronger than she looks</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, although Harris has weaknesses, she is not devoid of political gifts. At 59, she is young by the standards of American politics. She is an able speaker, whose recent appearances have brimmed with more vitality and coherence than either Biden or Trump have mustered in years. Her recent remarks debunking the GOP’s claims of being the party of “unity” were especially effective.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris does have a negative approval rating. But it is nevertheless <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/">better than Biden’s</a>. And the public’s disapproval of her is less strongly held. As the political consultant Sarah Longwell <a href="https://x.com/SarahLongwell25/status/1814649334626971982">has reported,</a> voters in focus groups tend to have a negative impression of Harris — but it is just that, an impression, rather than a deep-seated evaluation. They do not know much about her and are aware of that fact.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, Harris’s political brand is essentially indistinguishable from Biden’s. Many of her detractors may therefore be simply giving pollsters their views of the president. Those who are actually familiar with Harris, meanwhile, may see her through the lens of her 2020 primary campaign, during which she joined many other Democratic candidates in a bidding war for the allegiance of the party’s left wing. Now that she has been vaulted directly into the general election, Harris has the opportunity to reintroduce herself to the public in a manner tailored to the sensibilities of swing voters by, among other things, leaning into her experience as a <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/kamala-harris-wrote-a-good-book-about">“smart on crime</a>” prosecutor.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thus, if she can nail her campaign’s rollout, it is possible that Harris would see her numbers significantly improve.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Put all of this together and the case for uniting around Kamala is clear: Democrats can line up behind Biden’s logical successor today, put an end to their party’s internal chaos, and begin the work of rehabilitating Harris’s image — or they can pursue a path that likely ends with the same outcome, only after a month of internal disorganization, discord, and subpar fundraising.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The former isn’t a perfect option, but it was probably the best decision available to the Democrats at this late date. Joe Biden deserves credit for making it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Not long after President Joe Biden announced he was stepping aside from the presidential race Sunday, pro-Trump social media influencers had settled on one line of attack: that Democrats <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/politics/its-a-coup-maga-world-melts-down-over-biden-dropping-out-of-race/">had carried out a coup</a> against their own president.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden “has now been deposed in a coup,” Trump-backing venture capitalist <a href="https://x.com/DavidSacks/status/1815168526602387674">David Sacks wrote</a>. “Undermining Democracy should never be condoned,” <a href="https://twitter.com/RichardGrenell/status/1815090797668347944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1815090797668347944%7Ctwgr%5E13a36bbb3a548a03601a0d1dfabfab597f4072e8%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fpolitics%2Fits-a-coup-maga-world-melts-down-over-biden-dropping-out-of-race%2F">Trump ally</a> Richard Grenell posted. “The coup is complete,” <a href="https://twitter.com/RepGosar/status/1815086422199767408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1815086422199767408%7Ctwgr%5E13a36bbb3a548a03601a0d1dfabfab597f4072e8%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fpolitics%2Fits-a-coup-maga-world-melts-down-over-biden-dropping-out-of-race%2F">wrote</a> Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“What you just witnessed is proof positive that when the most powerful Democrat institutions and oligarchs unite to topple an American regime, they expect to succeed,” conservative activist <a href="https://twitter.com/charliekirk11/status/1815091854351946189">Charlie Kirk wrote</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From people who support Donald Trump, the man who tried to steal the 2020 election, this is obviously a ridiculous and absurd thing to say. Yet it echoes a self-interested argument made by Biden himself just two weeks ago, when he argued that him dropping out would be tantamount to ignoring democracy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The voters — and the voters alone — decide the nominee of the Democratic Party,” Biden <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/359362/biden-dropout-2024-undemocratic-primaries-voters">wrote in a July 8 letter</a>. “Not the press, not the pundits, not the big donors, not any selected group of individuals, no matter how well intentioned.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s unfolded in the two weeks since has been a steadily intensifying pressure campaign from various members of the press, pundits, donors, and current and former elected officials aimed at making Biden quit. Some of these entreaties were made <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/nancy-pelosi-biden-conversation/index.html">in private</a> — and, when Biden didn’t appear to be listening, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/10/opinion/joe-biden-democratic-nominee.html">more</a> spilled <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/schumer-privately-urged-biden-step-aside-2024-election/story?id=112046011">out</a> into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/18/us/politics/jamie-raskin-biden-letter.html">public</a> view. They argued that he couldn’t win and, eventually, he listened.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There may arguably be something a bit uncomfortable about the role of Democratic power brokers and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/18/us/politics/biden-fundraising.html">donors</a> in pushing Biden aside after his primary win. But while they’re doing this without voters’ explicit say, they’re doing so in an attempt to (belatedly) respond to voters’ beliefs that Biden is too old to serve another term.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So it may be undemocratic in practice, but in a sense it’s democratic in intention. Because the party isn’t avoiding an election, they’re trying to win one, by picking a nominee who (they hope) can win more people’s votes.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How democratic were the 2024 Democratic primaries?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democratic Party elites didn’t just fall out of a coconut tree after the debate. Up until that disaster, they’d been fully behind Biden, and their support of him was one major reason Democratic voters were presented with no credible alternatives in this year’s primaries.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because in reality, Biden won the primaries well before the people got to vote. Back in 2022 and 2023, some polls <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ap-norc-poll-biden-2024-presidential-prospects-c843c5af6775b4c8a0cff8e2b1db03f6">showed</a> a majority of Democratic voters saying he shouldn’t run again. The president never seems to have seriously considered bowing out, though. He ran again and (as is normal for an incumbent) solidly locked down support from Democratic elites. As a result, Democratic rising stars were deterred from challenging Biden, believing they likely would have lost, and then been blamed if Trump won in the general. </p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race. Catch up on this story.</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">President Joe Biden surrendered to pressure from top Democrats and campaign donors who urged him to step aside amid concerns over his age and low polling numbers against Donald Trump.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361827/biden-drops-out-2024-kamala-convention">What happens now?</a></li>

</ul>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, yes, 15 million people did indeed end up voting in those primaries. But how democratic was that process? Biden won the primaries because he won the inside game.&nbsp;It was party elites who determined the (few) options available to voters. Polls showed the voters would in theory have preferred someone else, but they weren’t offered a realistic opposing candidate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Furthermore, asserting that the primary result is all that matters, and that taking anything else into account is “undemocratic,” is a very limited and blinkered definition of democracy. After all, those 15 million people are a paltry sum compared to the 150 million people who may vote in the general election — people who, according to polls, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/01/us/politics/biden-age-democrats.html">overwhelmingly think</a> Biden is too old to serve another term. Many of those people wanted another candidate — shouldn’t their views matter?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The “new information after the primaries” problem</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another issue is that primary voters did not have the information that Biden would perform so poorly in the debate when they cast their votes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And though what key Democratic Party figures just did to Biden is in some ways unprecedented, in other ways it’s very familiar. That is: it’s the standard playbook for how to force out a suddenly scandal-plagued elected official who is believed to be hurting the party.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This playbook involves a ratcheting up of pressure and condemnations as co-partisans gradually condemn or abandon that official, making sure they know that the battering will continue unless they quit — basically what we’ve seen over the past few weeks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">New York Democrats successfully employed it against <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/8/5/22607971/cuomo-impeachment-resignation-scandal">Gov. Andrew Cuomo</a> in 2021, Attorney General <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/four-women-accuse-new-yorks-attorney-general-of-physical-abuse">Eric Schneiderman</a> in 2018, and Gov. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2008/03/12/88134976/spitzer-resigns-after-sex-scandal-pressure">Eliot Spitzer</a> in 2008. Senate Democrats did it against <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/07/franken-resigns-285957">Sen. Al Franken</a> (D-MN) in 2017. (Though it doesn’t always work, as shown in the cases of Virginia Gov. <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/2/15/18224864/ralph-northam-virginia-blackface-apology-protests">Ralph Northam</a>, and 2016 GOP presidential nominee <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/10/08/donald-trump-debate-mike-crapo-mike-lee-barbara-comstock/91784714/">Donald Trump</a>.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Your mileage may vary in how much you view Biden’s bad debate performance as a full-on scandal. But it was certainly new information that wasn’t clear during the primaries. Back then, Biden refused to participate in any debates and skipped some high-profile interview opportunities, leaving it ambiguous how he might perform in a high-stakes setting.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the truth is that party elites didn’t just casually abandon the choice of the voters right after they made that choice. They defected later, because of new information — information that those primary voters did not have.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Party loyalty is a two-way street</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, it is also worth noting that party elites didn’t push Biden off the ticket in an effort to steal the power of the presidency from him. They abandoned him because they fear he is hurting the party’s electoral chances — that is, because he’s lost support from voters.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Party loyalty is a two-way street — it is not, or at least should not be, a blood oath or a cult of personality. Leading Democrats backed Biden when they thought he could win, and they ditched him when they thought he couldn’t.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, they’re trying to substitute a nominee they hope the American public will like a lot better. And there’s something very democratic about that. They are (finally, belatedly) trying to listen to the voters, who, according to polls at least, keep saying they don’t want to support Biden again.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So maybe it would have been nice if Democrats had had an actual presidential primary process rather than this mess. But that didn’t happen — and, considering the options, party officials abandoning Biden to try and nudge him aside in favor of someone who can win was a reasonable response.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361827/biden-drops-out-2024-kamala-convention">dropping out of the 2024 race</a>, President Joe Biden did what we all want our politicians to do: He put his country over his career. Knowing that his party had lost faith in his capacity to beat Donald Trump and that a second Trump term <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/5/13/23708595/trump-second-term-cnn-town-hall">would threaten democracy itself</a>, he chose to do the right thing and step aside.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, it took him a long time to get here. While it’s only been 24 days since the disastrous debate with Trump, we don’t know how long Biden had been in decline prior to that. The earlier that clock starts, the worse it reflects on Biden and his team.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But ultimately, the story isn’t really about Joe Biden as a person. It’s about what he and his party did — and what their actions tell us about the state of American democracy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And what they say is surprisingly hopeful.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a country where many think politicians won’t do the right thing, Biden did (even if he exhausted all other options first). In a country where political parties seem to cower in the face of their own leaders, one party managed to challenge and push out a candidate whose campaign served neither party nor country. And in a country where polarization seemingly ground everything to a standstill, democracy showed it’s still capable of surprising us.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden’s announcement, and the Democratic effort to push him into it, shows America’s institutions might not be as broken as many think.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Biden (ultimately) does the right thing</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For years, voters have been telling pollsters that they thought Joe Biden was too old to serve a second term as president. The race remained competitive because voters were similarly wary of Trump, but there was clear unease about Biden’s future.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden could have chosen to listen to those fears. He could have stepped aside before the primary elections, or encouraged an open convention back when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/16/opinion/ezra-klein-biden-audio-essay.html">the New York Times’s Ezra Klein sounded the alarm bell about age in February</a>. But he didn’t.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And then the disastrous June debate happened, and the chorus became deafening. <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-trump-2024-polls-drop-out-rcna161348">Poll after poll</a> found that large majorities of Americans — and even <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/11/poll-biden-drop-out-election/">majorities of Democrats</a> — had concluded that Biden wasn’t competent to serve a second term. (This speaks to the absurdity of the narrative, popular among some Biden dead-enders and bad faith right-wingers, that the push against Biden is <a href="https://x.com/SpeakerJohnson/status/1815093011669516433">undemocratic</a> or <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-biden-step-down-kamala-harris-chuck-schumer-hakeem-jeffries-donald-trump-363a0701">even a kind of coup</a>.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden was not just heading for defeat. He and his party were confirming nearly every negative stereotype the voters had about the political system: Politicians were selfish, aged fools unable to act in the public interest; political parties were creatures of a corrupt elite entirely out of touch with the public.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In stepping aside, Biden flips the script. He showed that, when push really came to shove, there was something more important to the president than power: the fortunes of the party and the fate of his country. Even if the actual sequence of events followed <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2013/10/28/241295755/a-churchill-quote-that-u-s-politicians-will-never-surrender">the apocryphal quip</a> that “Americans will always do the right thing, only after they have tried everything else,” he did, ultimately, come to the right conclusion.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s enough to make even the most jaded observer a little more optimistic about American democracy — for at least two big reasons.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, it shows that there can still be standards in politics.&nbsp;</p>

</ul>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">American politics isn’t just made up of two parties, wholly owned by party elites, locked in a mortal and uncompromising struggle to the death. At least one of our parties is capable of policing its own: challenging an incumbent president and, ultimately, convincing him to step aside. The contrast with the GOP’s behavior after Trump’s many scandals — from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/28/nyregion/access-hollywood-tape-trump-trial.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/28/nyregion/access-hollywood-tape-trump-trial.html">Access Hollywood tape</a> to the January 6 Capitol riot —&nbsp;is unmistakable.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Second, Biden’s departure shows that unexpected things can still happen.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is hard to prove, but I think so much of the polling showing public distrust in the American government is rooted in a sense that it’s stuck: that what’s happening right now isn’t working and that no one is capable of doing anything surprising to right the ship. But a president abandoning a reelection campaign is nothing if not surprising. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Politicians like Trump, in the United States and elsewhere, thrive on the notion that the system is broken and nothing can be done to fix it. This is a problem not just because those specific politicians are dangerous, but because distrust rots democracy’s foundations.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By showing that the system doesn’t only throw up unappealing options — that politics can be more than just a contest between two unpopular older men —&nbsp;Biden and the Democrats just did real work at repairing those foundations. They showed that a central promise of democracy, that it can self-correct after even grievous errors, remains intact.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fully repairing American democracy will take a lot more work than this, of course. The problems run much deeper than the 2020 election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But this is a big step in the right direction. And as a result, I’m feeling something that might seem unusual in the oft-gloomy world of American politics: hope.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361827/biden-drops-out-2024-kamala-convention">announced</a> Sunday that he is dropping out of the 2024 presidential race and <a href="https://x.com/JoeBiden/status/1815087772216303933">endorsed</a> Vice President Kamala Harris as his choice for the Democratic nominee. A practical question follows: What happens to his campaign funds?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Biden campaign said it had <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-biden-fundraising-democrats-8492425af85796ad77844b77db6d0f30">$240 million in cash on hand</a> earlier this month, compared to former President Donald Trump’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-biden-fundraising-democrats-8492425af85796ad77844b77db6d0f30">$331 million</a>. Campaign finance rules put some limits on what Biden can do with that money now that he’s no longer running for president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The money isn’t just in limbo, however. Though it’s not yet completely certain whether Harris will become the nominee — she’d need Biden’s delegates at the Democratic National Convention to assume the candidacy, though his endorsement certainly <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357936/biden-harris-buttigieg-newsom-whitmer-pritzker-convetion-debate-2024">puts her ahead of any possible competition</a> —&nbsp;she could access Biden’s funds more easily than another Democrat. And the campaign pot only seems to be growing: Major Democratic donors, some of whom had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/12/briefing/biden-donor-pressure-trump-vice-president.html">paused their contributions</a> after Biden’s disastrous debate performance last month due to concerns about his candidacy, reportedly reopened their wallets after Biden’s announcement Sunday.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden and Harris already share funds in a campaign committee under campaign finance laws that allow the president and vice president to run together as one ticket, said Saurav Ghosh, the Campaign Legal Center’s director of federal campaign finance reform. If she were to remain on the ticket as the presidential nominee, “the new ticket would maintain access to all the funds in the campaign committee,” Ghosh added.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That would make Harris’s transition to the top of the ticket seamless — at least when it comes to the money.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What happens to Biden’s campaign funds if Harris isn’t the nominee?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While it currently seems that Harris has a decent chance of being Democrats’ choice for president, not everyone is on board. Some lawmakers have appeared to back an open process of some sort to select the new Democratic nominee, including <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/19/pelosi-support-open-nomination-biden-drop-out-00169893">former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</a> and <a href="https://barackobama.medium.com/my-statement-on-president-bidens-announcement-1eb78b3ba3fc">former President Barack Obama</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It would be difficult for another Democrat to challenge Harris, given that she now has Biden’s endorsement and the support of millions of Americans who already voted for the Biden-Harris ticket. So even if there is an open process either at the Democratic Convention or before it, Harris would have a good shot at winning the nomination.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But if she doesn’t and drops off the ticket entirely, she and Biden couldn’t just transfer their millions to another Democrat. Campaign finance laws impose a limit of only $2,000 per election for transfers from one candidate to another. There are a few potential workarounds, but it is unlikely that any would allow the new candidate to take full advantage of the value of Biden’s campaign coffers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For one, Biden could “offer to refund the money to donors who could then contribute to the new candidate’s campaign,” Ghosh said. But this is an unreliable method: Refunding the money to donors is no guarantee that they will contribute to the Democratic ticket again and relies on them to do the legwork. </p>

</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Alternatively, Biden could transfer all his funds to the Democratic National Committee. As much as <a href="https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/making-disbursements-political-party/coordinated-party-expenditures/coordinated-party-expenditure-limits/#:~:text=As%20detailed%20in%20the%20tables,archived%20limits%20from%20past%20years.&amp;text=For%20House%20nominees%20in%20all%20other%20states%2C%20the%20limit%20is%20%2461%2C800.">$32.3 million of that</a> could be spent in coordination with the nominee, and the DNC could also unilaterally spend the rest of the money to support the new nominee, Ghosh said. That’s in addition to the approximately <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/committee/C00010603/">$65 million in cash</a> the DNC had on hand by the end of May. But that approach has a drawback: The DNC might not necessarily target its investments in the way the campaign would prefer.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden could also potentially <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-biden-fundraising-democrats-8492425af85796ad77844b77db6d0f30">transfer his funds</a> to an independent super PAC if Harris is not on the ticket. But super PACs cannot coordinate with campaigns, and they are typically <a href="https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-biden-fundraising-election-campaign-donations-5709f07420b4f138caa884361653368e">charged more to take out ads</a> than campaigns. That means that the money wouldn’t go as far.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those are the campaign’s best options. Now, campaign finance rules aren’t likely to be the only determining factor in who ultimately succeeds Biden. But those rules do make Harris the most practical choice (at least from a campaign finance perspective) with months to go before the November election.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Does PAC money automatically go to Harris? What about other funding streams?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition to the funds in his campaign coffers, Biden has also <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/09/240-million-who-gets-joe-bidens-campaign-money/74295593007/">relied on several joint fundraising committees</a>, essentially groups that fundraise across allied political organizations, including the Biden Victory Fund, which had about <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/jfc/summary.php?id=C00744946&amp;cycle=2024">$40 million on hand</a> as of the end of June.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These committees have signed agreements with Biden’s campaign fund indicating how the funds they raise together at joint fundraisers will be allocated. So long as all of them agree, those agreements can be changed so that they can support the new nominee.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are also several <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/2024-presidential-race/joe-biden/candidate?id=N00001669">major super PACs</a> currently supporting Biden, including <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/committee/C00669259/">Future Forward</a>, which had about $92 million in cash on hand at the end of May. But since super PACs are independent of campaigns, they can change how their funds are allocated at any point.&nbsp;</p>

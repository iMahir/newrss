<p class="has-text-align-none">The 2024 Olympics are officially done, but there’s one bronze medal that’s still hanging in the balance.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That medal was initially awarded to American gymnast Jordan Chiles. Chiles, who won gold with the US team in Paris, placed third in the floor event finals on August 5 — what feels like eons ago in Olympic time. But this past Saturday, on the eve of the final day of the Games, the International Olympic Committee asked Chiles to give back her bronze, giving it to runner-up Romanian Ana Barbosu. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Olympic officials asking an athlete to give their medal back is an uncommon occurrence, but what makes Chiles’s case even more bizarre is that it’s largely the judges’ fault. Chiles was initially underscored, then scored properly, and then told nearly a week later that her correct score shouldn’t count because her coaches didn’t catch the error within one minute. That’s the simple reason why her medal is now being taken away.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This kerfuffle isn’t going to do any favors for the credibility of gymnastics, a sport that’s already scored subjectively. The fact that Team USA is appealing the decision will only draw out this negative press. Unfortunately for Chiles, she’s now caught in a crossfire that’s become much nastier and uglier as this bronze medal saga unfolds.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The current status of Jordan Chiles’s bronze medal</h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If there’s one thing to understand about Chiles’s bronze medal saga, it’s that it has barely anything to do with the level of gymnastics Chiles or her competitors performed at the floor event finals last week. Chiles’s powerful tumbling passes, landings, and leaps on the apparatus are all secondary to the technicalities. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During the event finals for floor, Chiles was originally given a score of 13.666. Team USA and Chiles’s coach, Cecile Landi, filed an inquiry with a judging panel arguing that they had incorrectly scored the routine and didn’t give Chiles credit for a split leap called a “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Gymnastics/comments/1el9o6t/someone_explain_to_this_amateur_a_gogean_v_tour/">tour jete full</a>.” The judges reviewed and agreed with that inquiry, and upped <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAvrnZdw1sE">Chiles’s score to 13.766</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The 13.766 was high enough to get Chiles a bronze, pushing Romanians Barbosu and Sabrina Maneca-Voinea off the podium (both gymnasts scored 13.700, but Barbosu won the tiebreaker).&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/gettyimages-2164952116.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Jordan Chiles during the women’s floor exercise final on August 5. | Daniela Porcelli/Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Daniela Porcelli/Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">While the Romanian team fielded multiple inquiries, including one about <a href="https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40767718/romania-appeals-sabrina-maneca-voinea-floor-exercise-score">Maneca-Voinea’s score</a>, the major dispute that triggered this medal debacle is about the<a href="https://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/CAS_Media_Release_ParisOG_15-16.pdf"> timing of Team USA’s scoring inquiry</a>. The official rules state that Landi’s inquiry of Chiles’s score had to be filed within one minute of her score. Romania argued that Landi made the inquiry one minute and four seconds after getting Chiles’s score. Those four seconds, Romania argued, put the US over the time limit and should have nullified Chiles’s new score. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled in Romania’s favor. <a href="https://www.gymnastics.sport/site/news/displaynews.php?urlNews=4268100">Officially and as of this moment</a>, Barbosu’s score of 13.700 is credited as the third-place bronze medal finish and Chiles’s score has been pushed back down to 13.666. To reflect the ruling, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) ordered Chiles to return her bronze medal. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In response to the IOC’s ruling, Team USA announced that it had submitted additional evidence to the CAS that the inquiry was filed within the time limit — not once, but twice. “The time-stamped, video evidence submitted by USA Gymnastics Sunday evening shows Landi first stated her request to file an inquiry at the inquiry table 47 seconds after the score was posted, followed by a second statement 55 seconds after the score was originally posted,” the federation <a href="https://x.com/USAGym/status/1822724122951991331">said in a statement</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s unclear how the CAS will respond to Team USA’s video evidence, but it likely won’t make the sport and its governing bodies seem more credible. If the evidence proves true and CAS and FIG affirm it as such, the organizations would seemingly have to reinstate a ruling they had already reversed. They’d also have to explain how and why they entertained and affirmed the Romanian inquiry without properly investigating at the time. If the CAS and FIG rule that the video evidence isn’t sufficient, you can probably expect it to be leaked and examined thoroughly online.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also worth remembering that the fundamental flaw in Chiles’s score is a judge’s error, an error that judges admitted to. Chiles’s correct score is Chiles’s correct score. Gymnastics isn’t track and field and scores aren’t determined by clock, but there are set criteria — including the execution of included moves — that need to be evaluated in a final score. Arguing that it took four seconds too long to fix an error that the judges themselves actually introduced feels more at home in some kind of retail customer service death spiral than an allegedly prestigious Olympic sport where judges and official timekeepers should be able to follow the predetermined protocol. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">People can’t stop being racist toward Jordan Chiles </h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This mess, of course, doesn’t happen in a bubble.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In fact, this medal kerfuffle undoes an Olympic milestone: Chiles, her teammate Simone Biles, and Brazil’s Rebecca Andrade were the first all-Black podium in the games’ history. While that was a triumph for many and seen as <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/gymnast-jordan-chiles-talks-bronze-medal-all-black-podium">growth for the sport</a>, it’s not exactly a coincidence that <a href="https://x.com/daily_romania/status/1822300075273367600">racists</a> and far-right personalities have latched onto the story of the rescinded bronze.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Like many sports, gymnastics itself has a thorny history of racism and treatment of Black athletes. It wasn’t too long ago that <a href="https://www.vox.com/22575301/simone-biles-olympics-scoring-explained-gymnastics-yurchenko-double-pike">Biles faced racist attacks</a>, ranging from belittling her skills to coded talk about how the multiple gold medal winner made the sport less elegant with her power. Black female <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/3/11/8189679/serena-williams-indian-wells-racism">athletes like Serena Williams</a> have also faced similar discrimination in their sports. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The aforementioned right-wing personalities and racists<strong> </strong>are now peddling narratives about how the Olympics cheated white gymnasts out of medals, or saying that Black athletes like Chiles are cheaters themselves. Pundit Matt Walsh <a href="https://x.com/MattWalshBlog/status/1821369204827709948">called</a> the 2024 games “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNzMU7CH3k">the DEI Olympics</a>.” It didn’t take long for those sentiments to metastasize into disgusting behavior, as racists began personally attacking Chiles. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Amid the medal returning saga, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/jordan-chiles-olympics-social-media-b2594527.html">Jordan said</a> she was taking a break from social media. Chiles’s mom Gina posted on Twitter that her daughter was receiving racist attacks:&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The racist disgusting comments are still happening in 2024. I&#039;m tired of people who say it no longer exists. My daughter is a highly decorated Olympian with the biggest heart and a level of sportsmanship that is unmatched&#8230;and she&#039;s being called disgusting things.</p>&mdash; Gina Chiles (@gina_chiles) <a href="https://twitter.com/gina_chiles/status/1822021561928364090?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 9, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Seeing Chiles receive these attacks and have to shut down her public accounts is just depressingly bleak. Medal or no medal, Chiles’s Olympics — a once-in-a-lifetime experience, twice if you’re as fit and skilled as Chiles — will be marred by the racism and bigotry she faced following the judges’ mistakes. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All Jordan Chiles did was compete, and she did so under the impression that she would be judged fairly. The people running Olympic gymnastics didn’t allow her that opportunity.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Violent crime levels have dropped significantly in the first half of the year, according to a new report from the <a href="https://majorcitieschiefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MCCA-Violent-Crime-Report-2024-and-2023-Midyear.pdf">Major Cities Chiefs Association</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Overall, violent crime dropped by 6 percent and homicides fell by 17 percent in 69 cities compared to the same period last year. Columbus, Ohio, saw the biggest drop in violent crime at <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/08/12/violent-crime-harris-trump-election">41 percent</a>, according to an Axios data analysis. But cities including Miami, Washington, DC, and Austin, Texas, also saw large declines. Notably, New York City was not included in the data, though <a href="https://www.fox5ny.com/news/nyc-march-2024-crime-statistics">other reports</a> have indicated that violent crime is falling there, too. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s hard to say exactly what’s causing the decline, which comes after a major Covid-19 crime wave. It may be partially due to policies aimed at tackling crime at the federal, state, and local levels. But it may also just be a symptom of the fact that normal life in America has resumed post-pandemic — or a combination of those and other factors.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Republicans have long tried to use concerns about crime as a political cudgel against President Joe Biden’s administration. While former President Donald Trump doesn’t appear to be giving up on that attack strategy just yet, Democrats can now use the new data as a defense. Whether that will be effective, however, is far from certain.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">What’s driving the decrease?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/08/10/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-record-decrease-in-crime-in-first-half-of-2024/">statement on Saturday</a>, President Joe Biden credited the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/3/10/22320350/biden-sign-stimulus-bill-covid-19">$1.9 trillion economic stimulus bill</a> that Congress passed in 2021, which allocated $15 billion toward public safety and violence prevention efforts, for helping bring down crime levels. He also cited bipartisan gun control law that expanded background checks and encouraged states to adopt “red flag” laws to prevent people who pose a danger to themselves or others from obtaining a gun. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But while those laws may have helped, some experts are highly skeptical of attributing the decrease to specific government initiatives.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think it’s early to know exactly why murder and violent crime are going down now,” said Jeff Asher, a crime researcher who runs a crime database at <a href="https://www.ahdatalytics.com/about-us/">AH Datalytics</a>. “Generally, I’m skeptical of political actions causing crime to go up or crime to go down, especially at the federal level.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, the pandemic crime was such an outlier in terms of the speed and degree to which it took hold that Asher said it’s possible that government spending on public safety helped interrupt such an acute increase in violence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other social and psychological factors may have also contributed. <a href="https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/anna-harvey.html">Anna Harvey</a>, a crime researcher at New York University, said that there is a “<a href="https://www.vitalcitynyc.org/articles/does-nothing-stop-a-bullet-like-a-job#:~:text=The%20best%20available%20evidence%20suggests,populations%20like%20people%20exiting%20prison.">robust body of evidence</a>” showing that violent crime is often driven by emotion, such as stress or anger, as well as opportunity and the threat of getting caught.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The Covid pandemic appears to have directly increased levels of stress potentially contributing to higher rates of violent crime during the pandemic period and decreasing levels as the pandemic abated,” she said. “The pandemic also affected the probability that violent crime would be observed by others and reported to the police, affecting the ‘Will I get caught?’ aspect of decision-making.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She said the probability of getting caught went down given that foot traffic in cities sharply decreased and recovered slowly during and after the pandemic, with many choosing to work from home or move away from cities. Using cellphone location data, researchers at the University of Toronto <a href="https://downtownrecovery.com/death_of_downtown_policy_brief.pdf">found</a> that the downtowns of many northern cities in particular struggled to return to pre-pandemic levels of activity through at least November 2022.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The trend is a gradual recovery in foot traffic, mirroring the gradual decrease in violent crime rates,” Harvey said.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What it means for the election</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This year, crime may not rank as the <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx">top issue</a> on most voters’ minds. Similar shares of voters — between 1 and 4 percent — said crime was the most important issue facing the country in <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx">Gallup surveys</a> every month this year, even as crime went down. But it’s still a big concern: In a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/642887/inflation-immigration-rank-among-top-issue-concerns.aspx">March Gallup poll</a>, 53 percent said that they worry a “great deal” about crime and violence. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has sought to capitalize on that by linking Harris, a former federal prosecutor and attorney general of California, to the movement to “<a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/112949462599544301" rel="nofollow">defund the police</a>.” He’s also campaigned by <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112950008791292542" rel="nofollow">stoking fear about the criminal threats posed by undocumented immigrants</a>, linking the issue of crime to Biden’s unpopular handling of the US-Mexico border.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKb9-eaEkkw">pushed back against</a> those attacks, recently releasing a new ad identifying her as a former “border state prosecutor” who has spent “decades fighting violent crime.” Trump’s attacks related to immigration also just aren’t based in fact: Unauthorized border crossings have been <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/unlawful-border-crossings-drop-5th-straight-month-lowest-level-since-september-2020/">declining for five straight months</a> and have returned to levels not seen since Trump was in office. <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/10/18/crime-fbi-mexico-border-homicides">FBI crime data also shows</a> that border cities tend to have some of the lowest levels of crime in the country. And other research has shown that US-born citizens are more than two times <a href="https://www.ojp.gov/library/publications/comparing-crime-rates-between-undocumented-immigrants-legal-immigrants-and">more likely to be arrested for violent crimes</a> than undocumented immigrants. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That doesn’t necessarily neutralize the political threat posed by Republican attacks claiming Democrats are weak on crime. Public perception often lags behind the stats, and it may be difficult for the party to change opinions after the Covid-era crime wave. But the&nbsp;next time Trump claims crime is out of control, the Harris campaign will have new evidence to point to.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vice President Kamala Harris is potentially on the verge of becoming one of the most powerful people on Earth. At the same time, in part because her rapid ascent to the Democratic presidential nomination didn’t involve the sustained public attention of a long presidential primary, she’s more of a cipher to many Americans than major party presidential nominees typically are. So who is Kamala Harris? In this video, we hand that story over to four reporters who have covered her at different points in her career. <br><br>Kamala Harris first entered public life as the elected district attorney of San Francisco. She tried to distinguish herself from her predecessor, known for taking a progressive approach to crime, by calling herself “smart on crime.” She spoke more clinically and quantitatively than ideologically; she talked about numbers, not ideas or politics. That continued in her next role as California’s attorney general, in which she was often hard to pin down ideologically and reluctant to take political stances. But that role also made her a household name in California, and after six years as attorney general, she won the state’s US Senate race. <br><br>Harris quickly became a well-known senator, but not for speeches or policy. Instead she found fame as the Democratic Party’s chief cross-examiner in the Senate, grilling Trump administration officials in confrontations that excited Democratic voters and sparked a movement for her to run for president in 2020. However, the Democratic Party had by that point become more ideologically progressive, and her record of being “smart on crime” no longer played as well with those voters. She struggled to find a political lane in the Democratic primary, and her run was short-lived. But when Democrats ultimately chose Joe Biden as their nominee, Biden vowed to pick a woman as his running mate. And after a summer in which the death of George Floyd and the massive ensuing protests sparked a national reckoning around race, Harris rose to the top of his list. <br><br>As vice president, Harris struggled to find a role in the administration. Biden tasked her with an unenviable job: solving the “root causes” of undocumented immigration to the US. It was neither her area of expertise nor her ideological strong suit, and after a disastrous TV interview, she retreated from public view. But after the US Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion, things started to change. Harris had an expertise and authority on reproductive rights that Biden lacked, and she became the administration’s spokesperson on the topic, finding her voice and footing in public life again. <br><br>In July 2024, an unpopular and visibly aged President Joe Biden withdrew from his reelection campaign, endorsing Kamala Harris as his successor. Lively and articulate by comparison, Harris quickly captured the enthusiasm of the Democratic Party, gaining momentum in the race against former President Donald Trump. Her continued success will depend on whether she can grow into the role of a galvanizing, inspirational political figure that she’s struggled to fill in the past.<br><br>You can find this video and all of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA"><strong>Vox’s videos on YouTube</strong></a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many of us like to think our moral values are stable. We imagine that we’ve each got a moral compass inside us, with the needle reliably pointing us north — toward our sense of right and wrong.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But according to <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2313428121">a new study</a> published in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, our deepest moral values are not some fixed point we’re magnetically drawn to. They fluctuate depending on whether it’s spring, summer, fall, or winter.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We already know that seasonal changes affect our mood (I’m looking at you, seasonal affective disorder). And research also shows they influence everything from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4801294/">our attention to our memory</a>, to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27859560/">color preferences</a> to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/6/17/5818432/lock-your-doors-crime-is-worst-in-the-summer">crime rates</a>. But our morality?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It was definitely surprising to me,” lead author <a href="https://ubc-emotionlab.ca/people/ian-hohm/">Ian Hohm</a> of the University of British Columbia told me in an interview.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hohm said he didn’t expect morality to shift “because it’s not a behavior, and it’s not a kind of transient emotion. It’s a fundamental part of how people make decisions about what’s good and bad and right and wrong.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet when he and his coauthors analyzed survey responses from more than 230,000 Americans over the span of a decade, they found that people embraced certain values — purity, loyalty, and respect for authority — more strongly in spring and fall, compared to summer and winter.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Psychologists call those “binding values” because they tend to promote social cohesion. They’re a double-edged sword, however: Their upside is that they increase cooperation among members of an in-group, but they can also increase prejudice against out-groups. (The study authors also investigated care and fairness, sometimes known as “individualizing values,” but found no consistent seasonal pattern there.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The findings raise some big questions. First, why do people embrace binding values more in the spring and fall? And second, given that binding values are strongly <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19379034/">associated with political conservatism</a>, what are the implications for how we run a society —&nbsp;including major court cases and elections?&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The role of anxiety </h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s something else that peaks in spring and fall: self-reported anxiety.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The study authors noticed this trend when they analyzed more than 90,000 questionnaire responses. They hypothesize that the higher anxiety they found in spring and fall drives people to put a higher premium on binding values and their manifestations, like close-knit social groups and long-running traditions. That sort of stuff makes us feel safe and comforted —&nbsp;exactly what you want when you’re feeling anxious.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The authors also analyzed survey data from Canada and Australia, and found that there, too, people embrace binding values more strongly in spring and fall. Endorsement of those values dips in the summer —&nbsp;and by looking at respondents’ zip codes, the authors found that the dip is extra sharp in areas where the weather changes dramatically from one season to the next. But, interestingly, the winter dip wasn’t related to the weather itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“So the summer effect might be some kind of sunshine effect — you know, your anxiety goes down because you’ve got nice weather outside,” Hohm said. Whether it’s because we’re getting more daylight, more time in nature, more exercise, or more socializing, lots of us notice an improved mood in summertime.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“But the winter effect, we think, is about some sort of cultural practice, like the changes in people’s activities and motivations around the holiday season.” In other words, you might be less anxious in December because you’ve got time off work or school and you’re hanging out with family and friends.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, this isn’t true for every single person. And individuals who do see a change aren’t experiencing massive shifts in their moral values every time the seasons turn.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The effects on people’s moral values at the individual level are quite small,” Hohm told me. “If you’re looking at individuals, this effect probably isn’t going to explain much. But when it comes to human populations in the aggregate, when everybody is endorsing these values a little bit more, that can have large consequences.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Which brings us to…</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What does this mean for society and politics?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The study argues that these findings could have wide-ranging social implications.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We know that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19379034/">conservatives</a> endorse binding values more than liberals do. So, one possible implication is that if we hold elections when people are endorsing binding values more, that could make on-the-fence voters slightly more inclined to opt for a conservative candidate than they would’ve been at other times of year. “The timing of political elections (whether they are scheduled to occur in the summer or the autumn, for instance) might plausibly have some subtle effect on election results,” the study argues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Research also shows that people who more strongly endorse binding values tend to be <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28150974/">more punitive</a> toward norm violators. So, conceivably, there could be some seasonal variation in legal decision-making.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, since binding moral values emphasize group cohesion, there might also be seasonal variation in prejudices against people — like immigrants, racial minorities, or LGBTQ people — who are viewed as outsiders. (The study authors have begun looking into this, and although their research is still in progress, Hohm told me prejudice “does seem to increase at the same time of the year when people are endorsing binding values more.”)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are important limitations to the study. For one, it doesn’t analyze nationally representative samples of people, but a more self-selecting crew that chose to answer survey questions online. Plus, it’s not a longitudinal study —&nbsp;different people responded to the survey at different times. We’d get a fuller picture by assessing the values endorsed by the same people across different seasons.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One more wrinkle: the findings are not generalizable to every country. Although the authors found a similar seasonal cycle in moral values in the US, Canada, and Australia, they did not find it in the United Kingdom, and they don’t know why.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, the study challenges the popular view that each person’s values are stable.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The idea that people’s moral values can change with the seasons is consistent with a growing body of research highlighting just how much moral values — which are typically thought of as fixed and immutable — can change based on subtle or seemingly mundane features of people’s environment,” said <a href="https://www.danielyudkin.com/">Daniel Yudkin</a>, a social psychologist not involved in the new study.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With apologies to your moral compass, the takeaway here is: There is no moral North Pole. Your sense of right and wrong might not be a static point, but something that’s subject to seasons of change — literally. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For roughly half of humans, one thing is as certain as death and taxes: If you menstruate and live long enough, your ovaries will stop releasing eggs, and your menstrual cycle will end.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/22462996/menopause-symptoms-hot-flashes-supplements-40-50">Menopause</a> is weird, biologically speaking. People, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/13/science/whale-menopause.html">five species of whales</a>, and <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add5473">maybe chimpanzees</a> are the only animals that seem to live beyond their reproductive years. Menopause doesn’t have a lot of evolutionary value: beyond the hot flashes and night sweats, the loss of estrogen increases the risk of many of the chronic diseases we keep track of, including <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/managing-the-risk-of-dementia/additional-treatments-for-dementia-risk/hormones#:~:text=Alzheimer's%20disease%20is%20more%20common,when%20oestrogen%20levels%20are%20decreased.">Alzheimer’s disease</a>, <a href="https://www.endocrine.org/patient-engagement/endocrine-library/menopause-and-bone-loss">osteoporosis</a>, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3615462/#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20during%20the%2010,cardiovascular%20risk%20factors%20in%20women.">stroke</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite their obvious importance, scientists are only just beginning to understand how ovaries work, and how their rapid aging affects the rest of the body. Traditionally, longevity researchers have relied on lab animals to study aging biology because humans live too long to study. If we can use a human organ as a proxy for other human tissues, identifying potential anti-aging treatments that translate to the real world could get a little easier. Because ovaries biologically age faster than other human tissues, they’re a perfect testing ground for scientists to <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/24121932/anti-aging-longevity-science-health-drugs">study the process of aging</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Studying reproductive longevity could help jumpstart an anti-aging industry that, despite loads of hype, has struggled to make progress. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mkaeberlein/">Matt Kaeberlein</a>, a longevity researcher and CEO of health care tech company <a href="https://www.optispan.life/">Optispan</a>, said that if everything we know about the biology of aging could be drawn on a map, it would look like a map of the Earth drawn in 500 BC. It would be helpful, but if you sail too far, you’ll fall off the edge and plummet into the unknown.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Deeply rooted <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35687931/">sex biases</a> in academic science stalled the study of reproductive aging for a century. But <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05836025">an ongoing clinical trial</a> in New York City may be onto something big: A drug we already know is generally safe could be used to delay menopause and extend the healthy lifespans of people with ovaries. <a href="https://gero.usc.edu/labs/benayounlab/">Bérénice Benayoun</a>, a scientist studying sex differences in aging at the University of Southern California’s Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, is optimistic about the study’s potential. “For most women, delaying menopause will be nothing short of a health miracle.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ovaries age really quickly. We don’t know why.</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In sixth grade, my biology teacher passed out sheets of paper with <a href="https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/healthwellbeing/hse-education-programme/junior-cycle-sphe-training-resources/rse/handout%201%20-%20female%20reproductive%20system.pdf">illustrations of the female reproductive system</a>, featuring the ovaries as polka-dotted balloons flanking the uterus. We learned that they hold eggs, and one by one, month by month, eggs pop out until there aren’t any left. That’s all ovaries were to me: bags of eggs that mattered only insofar as they carry baby-making material.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But despite what people may think, ovaries matter for more than just reproduction. Jennifer Garrison, professor at the <a href="https://www.buckinstitute.org/lab/garrison-lab/">Buck Institute for Research on Aging</a>, thinks of ovaries as the master architects of health for people assigned female at birth. (Trans men, intersex people, and nonbinary people can have ovaries, too.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Essentially, we have allowed women’s health as a whole to be pigeonholed through the lens of fertility,” she said. But the ovaries sit at the center of a complex molecular signaling network that doesn’t just guide the creation of new life; Garrison views them as “the pacemaker for aging in women’s bodies.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last year, a study found that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06802-1#Abs1">individual organs age at different rates</a> — organs that accumulate more aging-related proteins are more likely to cause problems down the line.  No matter the cause, “the fact that [ovaries are] aging faster than the rest of our tissues is a real problem,” Garrison said. While testes also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8619877/">change with age</a>, releasing less testosterone over time, their decline is slow and gradual. It is <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/mens-health/in-depth/male-menopause/art-20048056#:~:text=Debunking%20the%20male%20menopause%20myth&amp;text=This%20is%20known%20as%20menopause,or%20age-related%20low%20testosterone.">far from the sudden hormonal chaos</a> of perimenopause, the transitional period leading up to menopause. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By the time someone is 40-something years old, their ovaries start <a href="https://www.endocrine.org/patient-engagement/endocrine-library/menopause">behaving erratically</a>, producing fluctuating levels of estrogen and progesterone until they restabilize around a much lower baseline. This transition period can last for a few months or even years.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Estrogen (which is naturally produced by both males and females) appears to play an important role in biological functions that go well beyond puberty and reproduction. Estrogen is a hormone, a chemical messenger that travels through the bloodstream to send information to cells throughout the body. While many of its specific functions are still unclear, estrogen seems to help maintain <a href="https://www.endocrine.org/patient-engagement/endocrine-library/menopause-and-bone-loss#:~:text=Since%20estrogen%20helps%20prevent%20bones,seen%20in%20women%20experiencing%20menopause.">bone structure</a>, keep cardiac cells healthy, and <a href="https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/74/7/837">even act as a neurotransmitter in the brain</a>. Since it does so much, estrogen’s decline increases a slew of health risks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a result, Benayoun said, “Women live longer than men, but they usually do so in a much more frail state.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The search for anti-aging drugs&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)01377-0">At the cellular level</a>, aging is basically the same across the animal kingdom. As we get older, gene expression starts to go off the rails, and the resulting DNA damage makes it harder for cells to work properly. As cells become less effective at making proteins, getting rid of waste, and repairing damage, they stop working altogether, making it <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/does-cellular-senescence-hold-secrets-healthier-aging#:~:text=As%20a%20result%2C%20cellular%20senescence,%2C%20mobility%2C%20and%20thinking%20ability.">harder for the body to recover</a> from stress, illness, and injuries.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/24121932/anti-aging-longevity-science-health-drugs">Longevity researchers</a> have spent decades hunting for specific genes and proteins to target in anti-aging treatments. While literally extending the human lifespan or maintaining eternal youth is still far-fetched, improving <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/24121932/anti-aging-longevity-science-health-drugs">healthspan</a> — the number of years one can live in good health, without pain or chronic disease — is a more realistic target. But the aging process is complicated, with lots of cellular changes happening at once, and scientists have historically overhyped the potential of anti-aging targets.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For example, <a href="https://www.aaas.org/news/science-compound-red-wine-may-help-treat-age-related-diseases#:~:text=A%20new%20study%20confirms%20that,used%20to%20make%20red%20wine.">proteins called sirtuins</a> had a moment in the aughts. Directly activated by a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/red-wine/art-20048281">compound found in grape skin</a>, sirtuins inspired too-good-to-be-true reporting that the secret to a long, healthy life is <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2011/09/21/140669655/whats-in-that-wine-glass-may-not-prevent-aging-after-all">drinking red wine</a>. But <a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/speaking-illusions-sirtuins-and-longevity">according to Science</a>, the early sirtuin data was “a steaming pile of artifactual results, overinterpretation, and publication bias.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kaeberlein, one of sirtuins’s <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18590685/">earliest advocates</a>, will be the first to tell you that it doesn’t seem to be the miracle target scientists once thought it was. Data across many different labs over the past couple decades points toward a different, more promising protein: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00416-y">mTOR</a>, part of a signaling pathway that tells cells all over the body when to grow and when to save energy. As we age, mTOR activity changes, leading to increased risk of immune problems and damaged cells.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A drug called rapamycin, derived from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9634974/#:~:text=It%20is%20well%20known%20by,et%20al.%2C%202006">bacteria found in the soil of Easter Island</a>, tempers mTOR activity. Rapamycin is great at soothing an overactive immune system; today, it is <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/99/21083A.cfm">approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</a> as an immunosuppressant, and is commonly prescribed to people after an organ transplant. Researchers have found that rapamycin <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1617233114">prevents activation of primordial follicles</a> — or immature egg reserves — in lab mice, prolonging ovarian function. The drug’s mTOR-suppressing qualities may also <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568(23)00258-1/fulltext#:~:text=Rapamycin%20and%20its%20derivatives%20are,of%20lymphangioleiomyomatosis%20and%20tuberous%20sclerosis.">improve symptoms of age-related chronic diseases in humans</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The evidence supporting rapamycin’s anti-aging potential is strong, but longevity and wellness research is also rife with noise. Beyond sirtuins, wellness-obsessed millionaires <a href="https://time.com/6315607/bryan-johnsons-quest-for-immortality/">like Bryan Johnson</a> try everything from strict supplement regimens to cryotherapy chambers in the pursuit of eternal life. All the researchers I spoke with agreed that eternal life isn’t the goal of longevity research — it probably isn’t possible, anyway. After decades of experiments, Kaeberlein believes that the mTOR pathway and rapamycin are still “the gold standard when it comes to targeting the biology of aging.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And while rapamycin almost certainly won’t make anyone live forever, it holds particular promise for slowing down the aging of ovaries.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Can rapamycin extend ovarian health?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Scientists have used many different animals as a model of aging in the lab, from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1740675718300343">microscopic worms</a> and <a href="https://www.genengnews.com/topics/translational-medicine/aging-biology-revealed-by-studying-short-lived-african-killifish/">African fish</a>, to <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/two-research-teams-reverse-signs-aging-mice">mice</a>,<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28729086/"> macaques, and marmosets</a>. But the best model organism may have been inside us all along.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When it comes to aging, Kaeberlein said ovaries are “the canary in the coal mine.” They age quickly enough to study within a grant’s typical three-year project period, and as far as we know, every single person with ovaries will experience menopause in one way or another, should they live long enough. The precise connections between age, number and quality of eggs, menopause, and healthspan are still uncertain, but <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778126">the correlations exist, and they’re strong</a>. “What is clear,” Garrison said, “is that if we can preserve the endocrine function of ovaries, that will hopefully have a positive impact on female health care.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">About one in five birthing parents have their first child <a href="https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2022/07/having-kids-later-life#:~:text=About%2020%25%20of%20women%20in,life%2C%20many%20concerns%20are%20manageable.">after they turn 35</a>, the age at which doctors start labeling pregnancies as higher risk. People are increasingly waiting until their mid-30s or later to have kids, whether due to financial constraints, higher education, or simply wanting to enjoy childless adulthood longer. Delaying ovarian aging by a few years could preserve fertility for prospective parents, in addition to staving off the side effects of menopause. However, Benayoun said, it wouldn’t necessarily prevent eggs from accumulating damage over time. Just as older sperm comes with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7803514/#:~:text=On%20the%20other%20hand%2C%20old,chromosome%20disorders%20in%20their%20offspring.">higher chances of birth defects</a>, older eggs mean greater genetic risks. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.yousinsuhlab.org/our-team">Yousin Suh</a>, a reproductive aging researcher at Columbia University, has led her research team in studying cells from human ovaries, sampled from people in their 20s through their early 50s. In a <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.18.492547v1">preprint currently undergoing peer review</a>, they reported that ovarian cells from people between 49-54 showed signs of aging that are usually seen in the organs of much older people, including DNA damage and overactive mTOR. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the past year, Suh and <a href="https://www.obgyn.columbia.edu/profile/s-z-williams-md">Zev Williams</a>, chief of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, have been running a <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05836025">clinical trial</a> in women between 35 and 45 years old to test whether low-dose rapamycin can slow ovarian aging. The Validating Benefits of Rapamycin for Reproductive Aging Treatment (VIBRANT) study is still actively recruiting participants, but preliminary data from the first 34 participants is “very, very exciting,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jul/22/drug-women-fertility-study-rapamycin">Suh told The Guardian</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Early results suggest that the drug might slow ovarian aging by about 20 percent. If those results hold up, rapamycin could delay menopause by five years and help people stay healthier longer, and keep the option of having children more open. “In a way, our results are too good to be true,” she said, “except, because rapamycin is so well-studied, we know they are true.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While Suh and Williams intend to include over 1,000 participants in their study, their <a href="https://www.nyp.org/advances-womenshealth/pilot-study-evaluates-weekly-pill-to-slow-ovarian-aging-delay-menopause#:~:text=Rapamycin%20appears%20to%20slow%20down,Williams%20explains.">pilot study</a> was mainly designed to make sure rapamycin doesn’t have any unintended side effects. At the high dose taken by transplant patients, rapamycin could stop ovulation, potentially reducing fertility rather than prolonging it. But VIBRANT participants only took a weekly dose of rapamycin, and that dose was less than half what a transplant patient would take in a day. No serious problems have been reported, paving the way for future research.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The scientific justification for it is very strong,” said Kaeberlein, who was not involved in the study. Final results from the first phase of VIBRANT should be published in two years, and will be followed by a study with a much larger group of people. Benayoun is optimistic that, since rapamycin is already FDA-approved, promising clinical trial results could translate into real-world treatments “in a matter of years, not decades.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Research in women’s health is just getting started</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given rapamycin’s well-established success in the lab, one might wonder why we aren’t already taking low-dose rapamycin pills. If the drug can make us live longer, healthier lives, and has limited side effects at the right dose, why aren’t we shouting about it from the rooftops?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Part of the problem is the lack of clinical trial data demonstrating its anti-aging potential. It’s really hard to study longevity in humans: We live a long time compared to lab mice or worms, and the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) only funds research projects for a few years at a time. And because rapamycin is cheap and already on the market, it doesn’t offer much of a business opportunity&nbsp; for the pharmaceutical companies and venture capitalists that usually <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK50972/#:~:text=The%20principal%20investors%20in%20drug,pharmaceutical%20companies%20or%20venture%20capitalists.">fund the final stages of drug development</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s been very challenging to get any funders to step forward to support clinical trials with FDA-approved drugs for longevity or healthspan because of the lack of profit incentive,” Kaeberlein said. Ideally, the government would fund this kind of research, he added, but “the NIH has dropped the ball.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Historically, the NIH has <a href="https://report.nih.gov/funding/categorical-spending#/">underfunded reproductive aging research</a> compared to disease-specific fields like cancer. Worse, it has often <a href="https://www.aamc.org/news/why-we-know-so-little-about-women-s-health">ignored women’s health altogether</a>. “With half of the human population eventually experiencing menopause, it’s astounding that there aren’t more studies trying to defer its impacts,” Benayoun said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It wasn’t until the <a href="https://orwh.od.nih.gov/toolkit/recruitment/history">NIH Revitalization Act</a> passed in 1993 that, barring extenuating circumstances, clinical trials were required to include women. Before 1993, no such rule existed; researchers often excluded women from clinical studies out of fear that their menstrual cycles would muck up the data. Similar concerns about hormone fluctuations (and other lab-animal-specific concerns, like mating and fighting) still inform a lot of preclinical animal research. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Until 2009, most studies in fields like physiology and pharmacology <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3008499/">only used male lab animals</a>, or didn’t report the sex of their animals at all. It wasn’t until 2016 that the <a href="https://orwh.od.nih.gov/sex-gender/orwh-mission-area-sex-gender-in-research/nih-policy-on-sex-as-biological-variable">NIH began requiring</a> grantees to perform preclinical experiments in both male and female animals. This deeply rooted sex bias stalled research progress for decades, Garrison said. “If you don’t study females, you’re not going to learn anything about their physiology.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When females were considered in research, it was usually regarding reproduction and fertility — often with the goal of <a href="https://www.nifa.usda.gov/grants/programs/animal-programs/animal-reproduction">bolstering livestock breeding programs</a>. “Reproductive biology has really been focused on women as incubators,” Garrison said. Only in the last few years have scientists like Garrison started to reframe the age-related functional decline of ovaries as a health issue — not just a fertility issue. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But after so many years of underfunding, “there’s a lot of basic research still to be done in this field,” Kaeberlein said, and not many scientists getting grants to pay for it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The NIH is like a battleship,” Garrison said. “Getting it to turn takes a long time.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More studies like VIBRANT are finally on the horizon. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/02/21/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-first-lady-jill-biden-to-announce-the-100-million-arpa-h-sprint-for-womens-health/">Jill Biden announced</a> that the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) <a href="https://arpa-h.gov/engage-and-transition/sprint">would invest $100 million</a> in women’s health research. In March, <a href="https://irp.nih.gov/catalyst/32/3/president-biden-requests-12b-for-research-on-womens-health">President Joe Biden also asked Congress</a> for a $12 billion investment in women’s health research. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While Congress likely won’t fork that money over anytime soon, Garrison said “the fact that we’re even having this conversation — that it’s being had on that level — is pretty impactful and dramatic.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For most of American history, free speech did not exist in the United States.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dissidents were commonly thrown in prison, often for many years, when the government disagreed with their views. Near the end of World War I, the great union leader Eugene Debs was sentenced to 10 years in prison for giving a speech opposing the draft, and his conviction was <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/249/211/">upheld by a unanimous Supreme Court</a>. In 1951, as Sen. Joseph McCarthy was ramping up his witch hunts against suspected communists, the Supreme Court blessed his and similar efforts by <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/341/494/">upholding the convictions</a> of several individuals who did nothing more than try to organize a (wildly unsuccessful) Communist Party in the United States.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This suppression of free expression wasn’t restricted to unpopular political ideas. Under the federal Comstock Act — which made it a crime to mail any “thing” for “any indecent or immoral purpose” — and similar state laws, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/23678636/supreme-court-anthony-comstock-abortion-mifepristone-matthew-kacsmaryk">anti-sex crusaders prosecuted authors, artists, booksellers, and art gallery owners alike</a> for distributing pretty much anything that touched on the topic of sex. Anthony Comstock, the Comstock Act’s namesake, once successfully brought charges against a gallery owner for selling a reproduction of Alexandre Cabanel’s “The Birth of Venus,” a masterpiece of nude painting that <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/435831">currently hangs in the Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>.<br></p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Alexandre_Cabanel_-_The_Birth_of_Venus_-_Google_Art_Project_2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.9389845081451,100,92.12203098371" alt="Painting of a naked woman lying on a cresting wave while five cherubs float above her body." title="Painting of a naked woman lying on a cresting wave while five cherubs float above her body." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Alexandre Cabanel’s “The Birth of Venus.” | Public domain via Wikipedia" data-portal-copyright="Public domain via Wikipedia" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">All of that is to say the kind of First Amendment freedoms that most Americans take for granted, and especially freedom of speech and the press, aren’t as baked into the law as one might think — and are actually quite fragile. The Supreme Court didn’t meaningfully enforce that amendment until the 1960s, when it handed down a pair of decisions <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/395/444/">protecting political agitators</a> and <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/376/254/">guaranteeing freedom of the press</a>. And the protections enshrined in those decisions could easily disappear overnight if the Court loses its current, pro-free speech majority.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The good news for proponents of free speech is that, based on the Court’s most recent First Amendment decisions, it does <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358326/supreme-court-netchoice-moody-paxton-first-amendment">appear to have a 6-3 majority</a> in favor of preserving the post-1960s understanding of that amendment. The bad news is that there are three justices willing to drastically shrink the protections offered by that amendment. And those three could easily swell to five if former President Donald Trump gets to appoint more justices to the Court.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Justice Sonia Sotomayor, one member of the Court’s pro-free speech majority, is now 70. Chief Justice John Roberts, another member of that majority, will turn 70 shortly after the next president is inaugurated. And there’s always some risk that any justice could experience a catastrophic health event that forces them off the Court.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the Court’s right flank stand two justices, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, who have openly called for <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/376/254/"><em>New York Times v. Sullivan</em></a> (1964), the fount of press freedom in the United States, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/23622299/ron-desantis-first-amendment-press-new-york-times-v-sullivan">to be overruled</a>. Trump also <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/23622299/ron-desantis-first-amendment-press-new-york-times-v-sullivan">called for <em>Sullivan</em> to be overruled</a> in a 2022 court filing. Meanwhile, Justice Samuel Alito, in a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/5/31/23149183/supreme-court-texas-social-media-ruling-netchoice-paxton">pair of</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358326/supreme-court-netchoice-moody-paxton-first-amendment">opinions</a> joined by Thomas and Gorsuch, spent the last two years unsuccessfully fighting in favor of laws that seem designed to challenge the modern understanding of free speech.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These two cases, known as <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21a720_6536.pdf"><em>Netchoice v. Paxton</em></a> (2022) and <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-277_d18f.pdf"><em>Moody v. Netchoice</em></a> (2024), concerned Texas and Florida laws that would essentially allow the Republican governments of those states to seize control of content moderation at major social media outlets like Facebook or YouTube. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These laws, moreover, are just two of many state laws enacted after Trump left office that challenge the Court’s post-1960s understanding of free speech. In Florida alone, others include the state’s infamous <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/3/15/22976868/dont-say-gay-florida-unconstitutional-ron-desantis-supreme-court-first-amendment-schools-parents">“Don’t Say Gay” law</a> (which was <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/what-floridas-dont-say-gay-settlement-changes-and-what-restrictions-remain">eventually weakened</a> by a legal settlement), Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/23036427/ron-desantis-disney-first-amendment-constitution-supreme-court">quizzical battle with Disney</a>, and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/us/politics/supreme-court-florida-law-drag-shows.html#:~:text=A%20federal%20judge%20in%20Orlando,speech%20of%20drag%20queen%20performers.%E2%80%9D&amp;text=The%20Supreme%20Court%20refused%20on,performances%E2%80%9D%20such%20as%20drag%20shows.">law targeting drag shows</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, annual meetings of the Federalist Society, the powerful legal group that played an enormous role in <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/9/20962980/trump-supreme-court-federal-judges">selecting Trump’s judges</a> during his first term in office, have become a <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23457938/supreme-court-federalist-society-whine-first-amendment">showcase of complaints</a> that conservatives are sometimes socially and professionally ostracized for expressing views that many people find offensive — one speaker complained about a student who was allegedly shunned after he claimed that men make different career choices than women for genetic reasons, for example — often paired with reactionary proposals to use the government to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/11/18/22783108/federalist-society-capitalism-woke-corporations-milton-friedman-supreme-court-judiciary-judges">bring cultural institutions like universities and the media to heel</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, only some of these proposals have actually become state law, and some of them will likely never become law. But the Federalist Society wields such an extraordinary amount of influence over Republican judicial appointments that the zeitgeist within the society rapidly makes its way into federal court opinions, and even into Supreme Court opinions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, if Trump wins, and if he gets to fill just two more seats on the Supreme Court, Americans could swiftly lose First Amendment rights that have been secure for nearly six decades.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Two competing visions of free speech</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Chief Justice Fred Vinson wrote in <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/341/494/"><em>Dennis v. United States</em></a> (1951), “no important case involving free speech was decided by this Court prior to <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/249/47/"><em>Schenck v. United States</em></a>” in 1919. <em>Schenck</em>, moreover, offered no hints that Americans would one day live in a nation where art, literature, and political speech all enjoyed robust constitutional protection. It unanimously upheld the convictions of men who distributed anti-draft literature to conscripts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet, while the Court’s earliest First Amendment cases were a disaster for the cause of free speech, early 20th-century Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes eventually developed a framework, albeit in dissenting opinions, which continues to shape First Amendment law to this day: The government must not interfere in what Holmes referred to as “<a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/250/616/">free trade in ideas</a>.” Meanwhile, private companies — including newspapers, Hollywood studios, and newer forms of media like, say, Facebook — would remain free to say what they want and to shun whichever ideas they choose.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The reason for this focus on government regulation of speech is simple. The state has a <a href="https://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/politics_as_a_vocation_extract.pdf">monopoly on the legitimate use of force</a>, and can use the monopoly to crush dissenting voices — in Holmes’s words, to “<a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/250/616/">sweep away all opposition</a>.” Private speakers may be powerful and influential, but they cannot suppress their opposition. If you do not like what you read in the New York Times, you can subscribe to the Wall Street Journal. If you do not like a coworker’s ideas, you are under no obligation to invite them into your home. If that coworker is up for a promotion, their boss is under no obligation to promote them if they also find their ideas abhorrent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Only the government is constrained by the First Amendment, because only the government can arrest, detain, or execute someone for speaking out of turn. And the First Amendment generally prohibits the government from interfering with Holmes’s marketplace of ideas.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <em>Netchoice</em> cases, however, sought to upend this vision. The Florida and Texas laws at issue in those cases were an explicit attempt to use the government to elevate conservative voices. Indeed, the laws’ proponents were <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2024/2/26/24083652/supreme-court-netchoice-paxton-moody-texas-florida-first-amendment-social-media-facebook-youtube">quite open about this fact</a>. As Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said of his state’s law, it was enacted to quash a supposedly “dangerous movement by social media companies to silence conservative viewpoints and ideas.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Under this emerging Republican vision of the First Amendment, in other words, the government may manipulate the marketplace of ideas whenever it determines that one side’s ideas aren’t receiving a big enough platform.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The laws at issue in <em>Netchoice</em> are quite ham-handed, but they were written to give the impression that they were attempts to protect free speech. Texas’s law, for example, forbade the major social media platforms from removing or downgrading content because of the “<a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2024/2/15/24049045/supreme-court-first-amendment-netchoice-moody-paxton-youtube-twitter-facebook">viewpoint</a>” expressed in that content. It also imposed very strict reporting requirements on the platforms, and required them to set up a rapid process that would allow users to appeal removal of content.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But these requirements weren’t just unconstitutional under longstanding Court decisions establishing that <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358326/supreme-court-netchoice-moody-paxton-first-amendment">the government cannot tell media companies what they must print</a>, they were practically impossible to implement. If YouTube cannot engage in “viewpoint” discrimination, for example, that means that it cannot remove a video posted by a literal Nazi who calls for the extermination of all Jews — unless it also removes all content that takes the position that Jewish people should not be exterminated.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This sort of requirement wouldn’t simply destroy the broadly inclusive communities many social media companies hoped to create, it would also destroy their business models. As the Verge’s Nilay Patel <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/28/23428132/elon-musk-twitter-acquisition-problems-speech-moderation">colorfully explained</a>, running a profitable social media company “means you have to ban racism, sexism, transphobia, and all kinds of other speech that is totally legal in the United States but reveals people to be total assholes.” That’s because advertisers don’t want their ads to appear next to a burning cross or a swastika. And if this kind of content is not banned, <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/twitter-traffic-on-downward-trend-since-elon-musks-takeover">advertisers will flee the platform</a>, as they did when the social media site formerly known as Twitter loosened its content policies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similarly, the Texas law’s onerous requirements would have required the platforms to hire a small army of employees. In its brief challenging the Texas law, the social media industry complained that YouTube alone “would need to ‘expand’ its current appeal ‘systems’ capacity <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22-555/291896/20231130135911119_No.%2022-555_NetChoice%20and%20CCIAs%20Brief.pdf">by over 100X</a> — from a volume handling millions of removals to that of over a billion removals.” That’s the kind of hiring mandate that is likely to shut down a company.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In its zeal to prevent social media platforms from banning some right-wing voices, in other words, Texas managed to draft a law that could have shut down an entire industry, totally eliminating the ability of social media users to engage in free trade in ideas. The First Amendment quite obviously cannot tolerate such a law.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">At least two justices would allow red states to shut down newspapers with malicious lawsuits</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thomas and Gorsuch, meanwhile, have a far less subtle plan to roll back press freedom — indeed, under their approach to the First Amendment, authoritarian state governments could quite easily shut down nearly any media outlet.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the 1960s, the New York Times <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/23622299/ron-desantis-first-amendment-press-new-york-times-v-sullivan">published a full-page advertisement</a>, paid for by civil rights activists, which sought to raise money for “the struggle for the right-to-vote” in the Jim Crow South, and to pay for legal representation for Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unfortunately, the ad contained a few minor factual errors, such as misidentifying the song sung by student protesters at a particular protest (they sung “The Star-Spangled Banner” and not “My Country, ‘Tis of Thee”), and overstating the number of times Dr. King had been arrested (he’d been arrested four times, not seven). Pointing to these small errors, a Montgomery police commissioner filed a defamation suit against the Times, and Alabama’s courts awarded him $500,000 — more than $5 million in 2024 dollars.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That decision eventually came before the Supreme Court in the aforementioned <em>New York Times v. Sullivan</em>, which recognized that “erroneous statement is inevitable in free debate, and that it must be protected if the freedoms of expression are to have the ‘breathing space’ that they ‘need to survive.’” If media outlets could be hit with such expensive verdicts because of honest and regrettable mistakes, freedom of the press cannot exist, because every reporter will occasionally make a factual error similar to the ones at issue in <em>Sullivan</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Accordingly, <em>Sullivan</em> ruled that, at least when someone makes a statement about a public figure regarding a matter of public concern, they cannot be sued for defamation unless they knew they made a false statement, or they <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/23622299/ron-desantis-first-amendment-press-new-york-times-v-sullivan">acted with “reckless disregard” for the truth</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More broadly, <em>Sullivan</em> stands for the proposition that state governments cannot use defamation law to maliciously target the press. If a reporter makes a serious error, that reporter may still be liable for defamation. But governments that want to shut down a newspaper cannot simply wait until a reporter misremembers which song was sung at a rally, and then pounce with a multimillion dollar lawsuit.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump, Thomas, and Gorsuch, however, have all called for <em>Sullivan</em> to be overruled. In a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.621239/gov.uscourts.flsd.621239.21.0.pdf">2022 legal filing</a>, for example, Trump made the ahistorical argument that <em>Sullivan</em> should be abandoned because “it seems unlikely” that when the Court handed that decision down in 1964, it “envisioned a news outlet which seek [sic] to indoctrinate its audience rather than inform.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In reality, partisan press has been part of the American landscape from the very beginning. One early American newspaper, for example, falsely (and racistly) labeled then-presidential candidate Thomas Jefferson “<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=lPW3RZLK7dgC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=%22a+mean-spirited,+low-lived+fellow,+the+son+of+a+half-breed+Indian+squaw,+sired+by+a+Virginia+mulatto+father.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ei9TZflG0a&amp;sig=ACfU3U3ljw8DH1v3ucOir3EgL12UjBoMqg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjn5baJkMj9AhVoLFkFHWeKCaQQ6AF6BAgjEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%22a%20mean-spirited%2C%20low-lived%20fellow%2C%20the%20son%20of%20a%20half-breed%20Indian%20squaw%2C%20sired%20by%20a%20Virginia%20mulatto%20father.%22&amp;f=false">the son of a half-breed Indian squaw, sired by a Virginia mulatto father</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, dissenting in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7223071108797999248&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr"><em>Berisha v. Lawson</em></a> (2021), Gorsuch suggested that defamation law “should be ‘almost exclusively the business of state courts and legislatures.’” Had Gorsuch’s view in <em>Berisha</em> prevailed, it would have allowed Alabama to target civil rights activists in exactly the same way they were targeted in the <em>Sullivan</em> case. And it would potentially allow Donald Trump to seek millions of dollars in damages from any reporter or news outlet that makes even a tiny error in a report about him.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So how worried should we be about the future of free speech if Trump wins?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Looming over all of this is the Federalist Society, the powerful association of right-leaning and far-right lawyers that <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/9/20962980/trump-supreme-court-federal-judges">played an enormous role in selecting Trump’s first term judges</a> — and that is likely to play a similar role in any future Republican administration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For many years, the legal right embraced the Holmesian view of the First Amendment. Indeed, if anything, Republican lawyers and judges tended to view the First Amendment even more expansively than their Democratic counterparts, because they often <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/558/310/">used the First Amendment to attack campaign finance laws</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since Trump left office, however, many of the Federalist Society’s conferences and events have descended into <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/5/25/23736141/ron-desantis-2024-florida-legislature-policies">increasingly paranoid complaint sessions about “cancel culture” and “wokeness.”</a> In 2022, the society’s annual lawyer’s convention featured no less than four panels complaining about the fact that Federalist Society members <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23457938/supreme-court-federalist-society-whine-first-amendment">sometimes feel unwelcome</a> at law schools and in various institutions within the legal profession due to their conservative views.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Federalist Society speakers <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/11/18/22783108/federalist-society-capitalism-woke-corporations-milton-friedman-supreme-court-judiciary-judges">warn</a>, in the words of lawyer Ashley Keller at a 2021 event, that “massive corporations are pursuing a common and mutually agreed upon agenda to destroy American freedom,” or as law professor Adam Candeub claimed that same year, that it is inevitable that members of the society will “be de-platformed.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And the society appears eager to use the power of government to ward off this imagined future.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the society’s 2021 gathering, speakers offered policy proposals ranging from legislation like Texas’s and Florida’s unconstitutional social media laws, to repealing bans on race and sex discrimination, to a vague and disturbing plan to “wield in state legislative chambers some degree of power to <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23457938/supreme-court-federalist-society-whine-first-amendment">punish our enemies</a> within the confines of the rule of law.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, while Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch do not currently have a majority on the Supreme Court to roll back First Amendment freedoms, momentum is very much on their side, at least within elite GOP circles. Republicans ranging from Trump to the legislatures of many red states and the organization most responsible for Trump’s judges have all turned away from the Holmesian vision of the First Amendment and toward one where the government plays a much larger role in deciding who is allowed to speak and what media outlets must publish. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As the <em>Netchoice </em>cases show, that might even include using the power of government to order media outlets to publish content that aligns with the government’s political opinions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of this analysis comes with caveats, of course. If Trump wins, he may not get to replace any members of the Supreme Court or he may only get to replace some of his allies who dissented in <em>Netchoice — </em>though he is all but certain to replace hundreds of lower court judges if elected president. In the American system, where justices serve until they retire or die, no one can be sure how much power each president will have to reshape the Constitution.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, a vote for Trump is a vote to roll the dice on a drastically different vision of free speech in the United States — one that bears far more resemblance to the not-so-distant past than it does to anything most modern-day Americans have experienced.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Quick. Think about the state of American politics. We’re polarized — it’s almost cliché to point it out.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But why are we polarized? While there are plenty of reasons (<a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/1/28/21077888/why-were-polarized-media-book-ezra-news">some have even written whole books</a> explaining them), our <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/09/polarization-democracy-and-political-violence-in-the-united-states-what-the-research-says?lang=en">politicians</a> and <a href="https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/polarization-and-the-political-elite">elected</a><a href="https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/documents/working-papers/2012/IPR-WP-12-14.pdf"> officials</a> play a key part.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a political science phenomenon called “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261379418301975">elite polarization,</a>” in which the divides among elected officials spread to their voters, and the public sorts itself into ideological and partisan tribes that mirror what is being signaled from above. That downward messaging then increases what political theorists call “<a href="https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/documents/working-papers/2021/wp-21-27.pdf">affective polarization</a>,” a measure of the level of antipathy people have for members of the opposite political party. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But not all elected officials are polarizing Americans — or at least, not all of them are doing it equally, according to <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/osf/754ah">new research</a> by political scientists Marc Jacob of Stanford University, Yphtach Lelkes of the University of Pennsylvania, and Sean Westwood and Matthew Wetzel of Dartmouth College, which confirms what has long been suspected.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a preprint shared with Vox, the researchers report finding that a handful of “conflict entrepreneurs” in Congress are essentially polluting our national political discourse and worsening the vibes of democracy. They spend more of their time arguing and tossing out personal attacks than they do being productive in elected office. Along the way, they don’t just polarize the country, but also hamper the effectiveness of our government.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What makes a conflict entrepreneur?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The researchers define conflict entrepreneurs as elected officials who “frequently insult and name-call political rivals.” They can be contrasted with “policy-focused representatives” — the kind of folks who just want to get things done. And political division is a whole brand for conflict entrepreneurs, not merely part of their public profile.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Using a new artificial intelligence-powered tool they built, Lelkes and Westwood identified the lawmakers who are doing the most to drive polarization. As opposed to policy advocates in Congress, conflict entrepreneurs spend a lot of their time and energy attacking other representatives, elected officials, or public figures.<strong> </strong>These firebrands “aren’t just uncivil; they employ ‘nasty rhetoric’ which attacks the integrity, morality, and intellect of fellow representatives,” the scholars write.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They tend to be Republicans, more ideologically extreme, and more likely to hold seats in the House of Representatives (as opposed to the Senate). And you can probably guess who some of these folks are: Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, for example, is the second-largest producer of personal attacks, according to the tool. Colorado Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert is the seventh. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here it’s useful to have a quick caveat: Both major political parties have conflict entrepreneurs in their ranks. According to the researchers, though, there are more Republican conflict entrepreneurs than Democratic ones, and all conflict entrepreneurs aren&#8217;t perfectly alike; while the tool measures the frequency and rate at which lawmakers level personal attacks, it doesn&#8217;t track how extreme those attacks are.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet, being a conflict entrepreneur, the researchers found, doesn’t do much to help lawmakers achieve traditional legislative goals. It certainly doesn’t help one pass laws or advance to leadership positions. It does, however, help them get more media coverage: If your goal is to be on Fox News, then being nasty can help you reach that goal. But that viciousness and the resulting media attention doesn’t really pay dividends, unless attention is a goal in and of itself.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Our results suggest that conflict entrepreneurs, relative to policy-focused representatives, do not convert media attention into success: they do not raise more campaign donations, they do not perform better in elections, they are assigned to less powerful committees, and they do not leverage media attention to introduce or co-sponsor legislation,” the researchers write.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In other words, conflict entrepreneurs actually lack legitimate power and influence over government processes. But by getting the most media attention, they can influence the way the public sees government work and experiences politics.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The impact of conflict entrepreneurs has increased as it’s become even harder for the average American to cut through the noise to see how their specific representatives are behaving. The collapse of local news, the shrinking staff of major news organizations, the nationalizing of politics at the local and state level, and the outsized media attention that these congressional rabble-rousers receive all obscure another important conclusion: most elected officials are pretty normal.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The overwhelming majority of federal lawmakers never make a personal attack or do so in a tiny fraction of all their communications in floor speeches, social media posts, and media appearances. Yet a small number of polarizing figures has helped worsen the public’s view of how divided our government and politics are.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The public hears a lot from a very limited number of members of Congress. They hear clips of the same lawmakers making the same kinds of personal attacks, the same kinds of conspiratorial theories over and over and over. But we know very, very little about the other members of Congress,” <a href="https://govt.dartmouth.edu/people/sean-j-westwood">Sean Westwood</a>, one of the Dartmouth co-authors, told me. “What are those other members of Congress doing? Are they also engaged in conflict entrepreneurship, or do they have their heads down? Are they working or policy for their constituents?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That mismatch in attention and knowledge distorts the public’s view of the state and efficacy of government. That feeds into a variety of problems for democracy, breeding cynicism, pessimism, disengagement in national politics and news, and worsening trust in institutions.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Researchers used AI to figure out who conflict entrepreneurs are</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To identify conflict entrepreneurs and help answer the question of how exactly lawmakers are spending their time in office, Westwood and Lelkes, who both lead a joint initiative to study the public’s feelings toward democracy and politics called the Polarization Research Lab, created a tool that uses AI to scan, process, and interpret the speech and rhetoric of all 535 elected federal lawmakers. That <a href="https://americaspoliticalpulse.com/elites/">tool</a>, “America’s Political Pulse,” identifies and classifies lawmakers’ speech into five different categories — “policy discussion,” “constructive debate,” “personal attacks,” “accomplishments,” and “bipartisanship.” The Pulse tool then ranks lawmakers in each category for voters to see how politicians of both major parties spend their time and employ rhetoric online, in media appearances, in committees, and on the House and Senate floors.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The tool can easily identify who the top Democrats and Republicans to engage in personal attacks are: New Jersey Rep. Bill Pascrell and California Reps. Eric Swalwell and Robert Garcia top the list for Democrats; Texas Rep. Lance Gooden, Greene, and Illinois Rep. Mary Miller do so for Republicans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Spokespeople for Pascrell, Swalwell, Gooden, Greene, and Miller did not reply to requests for comment. Garcia said in a statement to Vox that “as the only Democrat to sit on the same three committees as Marjorie Taylor Greene, part of my job is calling out her bullshit. Democrats need to bring the fire and push back on their lies.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can see who is most focused on discussing policy and bipartisanship: Democratic Sens. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Jon Ossoff of Georgia, as well as Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, all talk about policy in more than 70 percent of remarks. The tool breaks down examples of how those elected officials communicate through individual profile pages.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Romney is a particular standout, Westwood told me. Perhaps because he’s not up for reelection and has chosen to retire, “he is almost singularly focused on policy discussion, and when he does so he tends to discuss policy in very positive terms. He’s potentially the least negative senator.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The tool also analyzes and visualizes the places from which these elected officials get political donations, which helps to illustrate who the politician views as their primary audience. Someone like Marjorie Taylor Greene, for example, spends a disproportionate amount of time engaging in personal attacks across all her platforms, but especially on social media — and receives a disproportionate amount of donations from donors outside her home state.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“People are clearly cultivating different profiles based on platform. If you compare Marjorie Taylor Greene on Twitter versus her floor speeches, there&#8217;s a big difference in negativity [online],” Lelkes told me. “So people seem to be in tune to their audience when [engaging in personal attacks]”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the moment, the tool is limited to keeping track of federal legislators, but Lelkes and Westwood told me they are working on expanding it to track local and state legislators’ rhetoric soon. They also hope to expand on the findings they’ve already made, and as the 2024 election ramps up, they hope the tool can be useful to the public, the press, and other politicians to help them better understand the quality of American political rhetoric, and to quantify how a small number of rabble-rousers worsen our collective political vibes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If I asked you to name a historical figure who manages to be both incredibly well-known and universally misunderstood, who comes to mind?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche are obvious candidates. But any list like this has to include George Orwell, the English essayist and the author of two of the most famous political novels of the 20th century: <em>1984</em> and <em>Animal Farm</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether you’ve read any of Orwell’s work or not, you’ve no doubt heard the term “Orwellian” used to describe people and events that are very likely contradictory, which of course is part of the problem with Orwell. He’s been stretched so much that his name is now a floating signifier that conveys just enough information to suggest something vaguely meaningful but not enough information to truly clarify anything.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The supreme irony here is that Orwell’s greatest virtue as a writer was his directness and clarity. He wrote so as not to be misunderstood, and yet he is now perpetually misunderstood. How did that happen? And how should<em> </em>we understand Orwell? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.american.edu/cas/faculty/beers.cfm">Laura Beers</a> is a historian at American University and the author of a new book called <a href="https://www.hurstpublishers.com/book/orwells-ghosts/"><em>Orwell’s Ghosts: Wisdom and Warnings for the 21st Century</em></a>. This is an intellectual biography but it is not, to its credit, a hagiography. Beers takes an honest look at Orwell’s life — the best and the worst of it — and presents a three-dimensional picture.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So I invited Beers on <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> to talk about who Orwell was, his complicated legacy, and how he speaks to this political moment. As always, there’s much more in the full podcast, so listen and follow <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/id1081584611">Apple Podcasts</a>,<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6NOJ6IkTb2GWMj1RpmtnxP"> Spotify</a>,<a href="https://www.pandora.com/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/PC:30793?source=stitcher-sunset"> Pandora</a>, or wherever you find podcasts. New episodes drop every Monday.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p>

<iframe frameborder="0" height="200" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP6310338030" width="100%"></iframe>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Orwell said that one of his great strengths was his “power of facing unpleasant facts.” That’s such an interesting phrase, especially the use of the word “power.” What did he mean by that?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Laura Beers</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, Orwell is writing in the context of the late 1930s, when the left in Britain and across the West felt this need to defend the Soviet Union. And Orwell was in the awkward position of someone who identified throughout his career as a socialist, but who was very clear-eyed about the abuses of Stalinist totalitarianism and was unwilling to toe the general party line in Western Europe by socialists who were very defensive of Stalinist Russia.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For him, this power of facing unpleasant facts is partially a willingness to stand up to most of his colleagues within the political left in Western Europe and call them out for their support of the Soviet Union, and say that we can’t be afraid that it will undermine the cause of socialism to talk about the abuses of power of this ostensibly socialist society in Russia. And that, if we are going to attain a better tomorrow, we have to be honest about the mistakes and missteps on our own side as well as critiquing capitalism and critiquing fascism, and he was a vocal critic of both.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What would you say is the prime value of reading Orwell today?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Laura Beers</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The things that really concerned Orwell, and you can really see them in his final two novels, are the accretion of state power and the accretion of media power so that you have one controlling narrative and little space for dissenting voices within a political conversation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Also, the role of surveillance and the way in which people are constantly being watched and judged. And the importance of disinformation and the manipulation of truth as a vehicle of those who want to seize power and hold power illegitimately. All of those things in different ways are very apparent in our 21st-century moment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the things that makes 2024 different from 1984 is that we are being constantly surveilled, but outside of TikTok or mainland China, it’s principally not a state that is surveilling us so much as large private corporations. In that sense, we’re being watched, and this is the Orwell of the giant eye that you often see on posters or book covers or T-shirts. But we’re also living in an age where you do have a lack of space for dialogue and you do have one dominating, controlling voice for a lot of people. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For some, like in Putin’s Russia or in Xi’s China, that’s through active state censorship. But for other people in the democratic West, it’s about the ways that people consume information and these information vacuums, where you can live in an ostensibly free society but never hear a genuine exchange of opinion and never hear dissenting voices. And Orwell was a real critic of that way of living. He believed in the importance of truth, but he also believed in the importance of a free dialogue and exchange of ideas.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of Orwell’s enduring obsessions was the uses and abuses of language. This is why he was so sensitive to the role of euphemisms in our political language. What did he have to say about that?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Laura Beers</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As he sees it, the problem with euphemisms is that they elide truth, they paper over ugly realities. So, for example, when you talk about “illegal immigrants” as a catch-all phrase, that elides the actual lived experience of a lot of the people who risked their lives to cross the border and the ways in which many of them are victims, many of them are under threat, and gives this sense of menace to an entire group through this term that is meant to obscure as much as it categorizes or clarifies. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So he’s very conscious of the power of language and the narrowing of acceptable political language. He knows that if you can’t talk about ideas, they lose their political power because they’re unable to be articulated. At the end of <em>1984</em>, Orwell had this amazing appendix which his early US editors wanted to cut and he insisted that the book couldn’t be published without it. It’s a short history of Newspeak, which is the language of IngSoc in <em>1984</em>. You can see how it works to reduce language and therefore reduce the acceptable range of political ideas that can be thought and articulated.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He’s always really clear about the ways that language can hide as much as it reveals, and I think one of the great strengths of his writing is the way that he insists on clarity in written and spoken English. He doesn’t like to use passive tense, he doesn’t use too many adjectives. It’s very clear, journalistic writing.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To that point about his clarity, this is part of what makes his shapeless legacy so mystifying. He wrote so clearly and so simply and yet he’s been so effortlessly appropriated by the left and the right. Why do you think he became such a two-dimensional caricature in that way?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Laura Beers</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think, in some ways, that’s the risk of dying young, right? He’s born in 1903 and he died in 1950. He dies before the Cold War really heats up, though he might’ve been the first person to use the term “Cold War” in an essay called “You and the Atom Bomb,” which he wrote shortly before his death. But he passes away before a lot of the political changes that have defined the modern moment.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What do you think Orwell got most wrong?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Laura Beers</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are the things that he realized he got wrong before he passed away. One of those is this idea that, in order for Britain to win the war against Nazism, it would have to reform itself internally, and that doesn’t really happen. A Labor government is elected with a majority [for] the first time in 1945 and there are significant social changes that come along with that, but there is no real effective revolution and the war is won without that. And he recognized his own error, and I think some of his political pessimism in his later years is the result of the thwarting of that feeling of optimism that he had about the potential for social change in the early years of the war.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But I think more fundamentally, from our 21st-century perspective, it’s about what we were talking about earlier. He failed to appreciate the evolution of surveillance and state power. If you’re living in Russia or communist China right now, this is a very serious issue. But if you’re living in the West, your surveillance is not coming from the state for the most part; it’s coming from private corporations. And I think he just didn’t foresee the role that large corporations would play in controlling our access to information and controlling information about us in the 21st century. And I think that’s partly because he was a real technophobe and it comes through in a lot of his writing. He really sees technology as an enemy of culture and is someone who thinks that people should work the land and read books as opposed to playing with mechanical blocks.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I&#8217;ve never heard Orwell described as a “technophobe,” but that helps explain what I’ve always considered his biggest blind spot. Although he diagnosed the 20th century so well, he just didn’t anticipate the 21st century. If you’re looking for prophecy, a book like Aldous Huxley’s <em>Brave New World </em>is the one you want, not <em>1984</em>. Neil Postman sums this up better than anyone else in his book <em>Amusing Ourselves to Death</em>, and it’s worth reading the passage in full:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>What George Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Aldous Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information, Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us, Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture, Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture.&nbsp;</em></p>
<cite>Neil Postman, <em>Amusing Ourselves to Death</em></cite></blockquote>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Laura Beers</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re comparing Huxley and Orwell, what stands out to me is Huxley’s idea that the pleasure principle actually can be something malign. That we could be stupefied into complacency and as a result we lose our will to revolt. Huxley has a much more sophisticated bread-and-circuses view of how people can be dominated and controlled. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Orwell, the ways in which people are dominated and controlled is not through pleasure but through pain. <em>1984</em>, in many ways, is a very graphic tale of someone’s torture and eventual breakdown. So there’s a brutal austerity to the violent mechanisms of control in Orwell. I think that’s partially a reflection of the poverty that he experienced as a social investigator, writing <em>Down and Out in Paris and London</em> and <em>The Road to Wigan Pier,</em> and the poverty that he saw at the ends of empire. He thinks that control is not through pacifying people in such a way that they don’t have the will to revolt, but about violently repressing them in such a way that they don’t have the ability to revolt.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So maybe it’s true that complacency is more of a threat in the 21st century as rising standards of living take away people’s political edge. But there are still an awful lot of people being brutally and violently repressed into conformity in our age as well, so I guess there’s space for both dystopias in 2024.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What would you say is Orwell’s most relevant lesson for the 21st century?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Laura Beers</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think the lesson that those of us in the West could do best to heed is this idea that people need to defend the right to say that two plus two equals four, but that doing this is a responsibility as much as it is a right. Being given the right to speak your truth is also an obligation to have a truth to speak. It’s not a right to say that two plus two equals five, it’s a right to articulate truth in the space of lies and disinformation and to speak out against lies and disinformation. And that was something that Orwell was committed to throughout his own career, in his journalistic writing and in his personal politics. If he does have a legacy for the 21st century, it’s this power of facing unpleasant facts and standing up for truth in a time of disinformation and doublethink. That is his most important legacy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Industry, </em>now in its third season,<em> </em>has lived in the shadow of two HBO juggernauts, <em>Euphoria</em> and<em> Succession</em>, for the past four years. Its similarities with <em>Succession</em> in particular — British creators, corporate settings, despicable characters, acerbic dialogue, gray-toned palettes — have made it difficult for the show about young, ketamine-snorting bankers to capture everyone’s attention. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But now that it’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/27/arts/television/mid-tv.html">been said</a> — including <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/353427/why-does-tv-feel-so-underwhelming-yet-so-overwhelming">on this very website</a> — that the overall quality of scripted television is not what it once was, it seems like a perfect time for an ever-improving show to reset our expectations for what prestige TV can be.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The well-touted notion that <em>Industry</em> is an heir to <em>Succession </em>seems like good marketing. And the show’s writers and co-creators Mickey Down and Konrad Kay have embraced the comparisons with a sense of humor. “If <em>Industry</em> had the same arc [as <em>Succession</em>], me and Mickey would be quite happy,” Kay told <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/industry-creators-break-down-that-wild-season-2-premiere">the Daily Beast</a> in 2022. In the season two finale, they even inserted a winking reference to Kendall Roy. Vulture also released a <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/industry-season-3-sunday-time-succession.html">profile</a> of the show’s casts and creators titled “Can <em>Industry</em> succeed <em>Succession</em>?” as the new season takes on<em> Succession</em>’s former Sunday time slot. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, the suggestion that these two series scratch the same itch or that <em>Industry</em> is aiming to be like<em> Succession</em> feels like critics’ underselling of the show. While <em>Industry </em>has all the markers of a sophisticated, bougie drama, it feels more spiritually akin to a messy teen soap like <em>Gossip Girl</em>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That certainly isn’t a bad thing. In fact, it’s exactly what this overly brooding, monotonous state of television needs. One of the most impressive things about <em>Industry </em>is how it avoids many of prestige TV’s reigning problems. While supposedly high-brow shows have become predictable, with their focus on trauma and grief as main qualities of the human experience, <em>Industry</em> seems to be one of the few shows interested in offering viewers naughtiness and pleasure. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The conventions of “prestige TV” have become limiting … and boring </strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Industry</em>’s first season followed a group of post-graduates — with the exception of protagonist Harper Stern (Myha’la), whose transcript is a little less complete than her bosses understand — vying for permanent positions at the fictional investment bank Pierpoint &amp; Co. in London. Right away, they’re met with abuse and impossible demands from tyrannical bosses and inappropriate colleagues, including the hair-raising sales manager Eric Tao (Ken Leung).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The onscreen depravity isn’t limited to Pierpoint’s higher-ups, though. The show’s promising young bankers — particularly Harper and publishing heir Yasmin Kara-Hanani (Marisa Abela) — play all sorts of mental and sexual games with each other and their peers to climb the corporate ladder. Almost every interaction is deceptive or transactional. Vulnerability can rarely be trusted. </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/myha-la-and-sarah-goldberg.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Actors Myha’la and Sarah Goldberg in &lt;em&gt;Industry&lt;/em&gt; season three. | HBO" data-portal-copyright="HBO" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">On a show about depraved, broken people, it’s refreshing that Down and Kay refrain from relying on a narrative device that’s become a rather tiring cliché in prestige television — the trauma plot. In a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/01/03/the-case-against-the-trauma-plot">2021 New Yorker essay, Parul Sehgal</a> wrote about the prevalent use of a single devastating backstory to easily explain the totality of characters, leaving little mystery and denying consumers a morally complicated experience. “The trauma plot flattens, distorts, reduces character to symptom, and, in turn, instructs and insists upon its moral authority,” she wrote. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This sense of predictability — and simplicity —  has lessened the impact of quite a few shows recently, like the buzzy Netflix miniseries <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24147537/baby-reindeer-who-is-martha-stalking"><em>Baby Reindeer</em></a>. Despite the miniseries’ potential to go into strange and ambiguous directions, it offers a pretty obvious theory in the end about the show’s troubling stalker, Martha — she had a bad childhood. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In other cases, the excessive use of backstory can inhibit plot movement or character development. Take <em>Euphoria</em>, for example, maybe the biggest offender in this regard. For its first two seasons, the show was so concerned with revisiting its characters’ devastating pasts that it had no idea where they were going in the show’s present. As a result, season two was <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-reviews/euphoria-season-2-finale-zendaya-sam-levinson-1235099256/">meandering and motionless</a>, hammering down on the same character details. It wasn’t much of a surprise that Sam Levinson’s follow-up miniseries <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/03/the-idol-finale-review-one-of-the-worst-programmes-ever-made"><em>The Idol</em></a><em> </em>quickly fell apart on much the same basis. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similar comments were made about the latest season of <em>The Bear, </em>which landed as a disappointment among fans and critics. In <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2024/06/the-bear-season-3-fx-hulu-bad.html">a review for Slate</a>, writer Jack Hamilton criticized the season’s “incessant use of flashbacks” to avoid “the show itself actually moving forward.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not that the characters in <em>Industry</em> aren’t deeply troubled by their upbringings and familial relationships. For example, Harper and Yasmin’s colleague Robert Spearing (Harry Lawtey) has vaguely described mommy issues that lead to an inappropriate relationship with a predatory woman client at Pierpoint and probably his submissive sexual dynamic with Yasmin. Harper is the product of an abusive mom. It’s also evident that bad boss Eric’s lust for dominance comes from being perceived and underestimated as a “diversity hire” throughout his career. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The writers never dwell on this information for too long though, nor do they feed us that many details. The story still functions, even if these personal details never completely explain why these reckless 20-somethings and their mean supervisors are the way they are. Instead, they propel the characters forward, leading to exciting plot turns and head-scratching decisions. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The best case of this is the portrayal of Yasmin’s fractured relationship with her father (Adam Levy). A lazier show would spend an inordinate amount of time revisiting the wounds Yasmine accrued from her dad during her childhood. Instead, Yasmine’s daddy issues are an obstacle she has to escape in the present. When she discovers her father’s sexual misconduct in season two, it provides a mirror for a sexual relationship she has with a mentor at Pierpoint and when she embarks on her own power trip as she makes moves within the company. In season three, her father’s legal troubles come back to haunt her, causing her to negotiate her morals once again. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In all of its chaos, <em>Industry</em> hasn’t lost sight of what makes it good </strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tv/hbo-max/industry-season-3-review">critics</a> have <a href="https://www.tvguide.com/news/industry-season-3-review-hbo/">unanimously</a> <a href="https://x.com/thefader/status/1821571666729701804">stated</a>, season three is arguably <em>Industry</em>’s best offering yet. After being ousted from Pierpoint in the second season finale, Harper has a new job and a new manager, Petra Koenig (Sarah Goldberg) to test with her risky, often legally dubious business moves. Meanwhile, at Pierpoint, the company invests in a new client, a green-energy company called Lumi founded by an incompetent CEO Henry Muck (Kit Harington), which triggers an avalanche of problems at the bank. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While Harper is still fighting a one-sided war with Tao and Pierpoint, her former co-workers seem a bit more deflated and disillusioned than in previous seasons. Tao is confronted with how disempowering his new position as a partner at Pierpoint actually is. Yasmin realizes that she can’t overcome the lifelong curse of coming from a messed-up family through her work. Arguably, the best episode of the season is centered on Pierpoint associate Rishi Ramdani (Sagar Radia), whose greed (and dickishness) finally reaches a tipping point. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Overall, Kay and Down have become more skilled at executing plotlines, experimenting with cinematography, and nailing the show’s frenetic pacing. While season two was a little heavy-handed with its commentary on representational politics and “glass ceiling” feminism, season three feels light on its feet. </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/harry-lawtey-kit-harington.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Lawtey and Harington having a conversation." title="Lawtey and Harington having a conversation." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Actors Harry Lawtey and Kit Harington in &lt;em&gt;Industry&lt;/em&gt; season three. | HBO" data-portal-copyright="HBO" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Stress and turmoil may still define these characters’ lives, but watching them navigate their mostly self-inflicted problems is surprisingly more fun and funny this time around. The writers seem more interested in creating amusing (but smart) plotlines for entertainment’s sake rather than hammering down on the show’s already underlying thesis on the pitfalls of capitalism. At the end of the day, <em>Industry</em> is a show about horny, foolish, mostly young adults who desperately need therapy. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The fact that <em>Industry</em> has gotten better over time is a huge relief. At this point, we’ve watched several popular, critically acclaimed shows — <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/358672/the-bear-season-3-review-food-main-character-fine-dining"><em>The Bear</em></a>, <em>Atlanta</em>, <em>Killing Eve</em>, <em>Big Little Lies</em>, etc. — lose their way after one or two good seasons. (I might be the only person who thinks that <em>Succession </em>got worse after season two.) The constraints of streaming have allowed creators to become more self-indulgent in their work. Certain shows have felt more focused on experimenting with structure to the point where it doesn’t feel like they’re interested in making TV anymore — rather, college-level film projects. Others seem to bend to the demands of social media, like <em>Succession</em>, which gradually lost its “eat the rich” bite in favor of sympathizing with fan-favorite characters. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thankfully, <em>Industry</em> hasn’t succumbed to any of these tendencies yet — maybe, in part, because it hasn’t been showered with awards or received a large amount of attention. Instead, the show keeps reflecting what prestige TV still has the potential to be in an era of forgettable television — engrossing characters, smart storytelling, and a respect for the medium as we knew it before Netflix and Twitter.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Humans are simple creatures. Since the dawn of spectator sports, we’ve wanted to watch muscular people fight and do flips. <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/paris-2024-summer-olympics/olympians-viral-tiktok/3450742/">Today, TikTok-friendly</a> high-drama sports like <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/07/simone-biles-usa-womens-gymnastics-finals-viewership-olympics-nbc-1236028346/">women’s gymnastics</a> regularly dominate Olympic viewership on TV networks and streaming platforms. But watching artistic gymnastics isn’t the only way to see ultra-strong people do flips and splits.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pole dancing — the erotic striptease-turned-sport that’s essentially sexy gymnastics on a stick — has all the makings of a perfect Olympic sport. The athleticism of pole performers, whether at a family-friendly competition or a strip club, is undeniable. Even the most basic pole moves are no joke: <a href="https://www.thepolept.com/pole-anatomy/pole-climb-in-4-steps/">Getting off the ground at all</a> is kind of like doing a pull up, a push up, a crunch, and an air squat all at once. At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pyB7SRD84w">the highest level</a>, pole athletes — yes, there are pole athletes — can perform several minutes worth of choreographed handstands, flips, tumbles, and other aerial tricks, all set to music. Sometimes, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryi-6qgcqYw">they do it in eight-inch stilettos</a>. And just as gymnastics increases in difficulty over time, pole dancers get stronger, bendier, and more creative every year.</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why I wrote this</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">I auditioned for my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thepolerbears/?hl=en">university’s pole dancing team</a> my freshman year of college simply because I couldn’t believe it existed. I didn’t make the cut, but I tried pole dancing again while I was in grad school. It took me almost a year to build the strength I needed to flip upside down. But I stuck with it, training at my local pole studio nearly every day after lab, mopping its floors in exchange for a discounted membership. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, I’m a part-time pole instructor in the California Bay Area, and welcoming new people into the sport is one of my greatest joys. Pole dancing embodies endless contradictions — strength and grace, explosive power and sensual flow, technicality and vibes. For years, I’ve watched the pole community debate about how to honor its history, and I’ve seen my own studios evolve in their stance towards sex work over time. Here, I wanted to explore why it’s so hard for pole dancing to earn the IOC’s respect. (And selfishly, I want to watch more sports where people do flips and splits. People love flips and splits.)</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the <a href="https://bloggeronpole.com/2021/07/a-history-of-modern-pole-dance/">early 20th century</a>, burlesque and striptease performers began incorporating poles into their routines. This was less for artistic reasons than functional ones — bars had tiny stages or no stage at all, and dancers needed something to hold onto. When Mary’s Club opened in Portland in 1954, it became <a href="https://www.hausofpole.com/post/stripping-through-history-disrobing-the-origins-of-modern-day-pole-dancing">the first bar</a> to install brass poles onstage for strippers to incorporate into their performances. Strip clubs increasingly featured pole dancing, and dancers invented more tricks — climbing up the pole and performing splits on the ceiling, twerking upside-down, and plummeting back to the ground. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dancers generally practice and teach each other at the club, but in the early 2000s, the first pole studios opened in North America, Europe, and Australia, bringing the art of sensual movement on a vertical steel bar from strippers to hobbyists. Since then, pole dancing has seen a massive surge in popularity. Pole studios quickly spread across the world. Today, there are <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TlccFClJ-_DIvXnarwXGzBGh7SjU2O61tYRBmyJH_-U/edit?usp=sharing">over 600 studios</a> in the US alone, and thousands more across every continent excluding Antarctica. I, like many others, got swept into this world not through sex work, but Groupons advertising an intriguing alternative to pilates. I stuck with it long enough to become a professional pole instructor, and have taught microbiologists, sex workers, goth teens, and white-collar dads. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Clearly, pole dancing has widespread appeal. It’s also globally practiced, visually engaging, and physically impressive, meeting several of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/story/how-are-sports-chosen-for-the-olympics#:~:text=The%20Olympic%20Charter%20indicates%20that,countries%20and%20on%20three%20continents">criteria</a> for Olympic recognition. The <a href="http://www.polesports.org/">International Pole Sports Federation (IPSF)</a>, led by cofounder <a href="http://www.polesports.org/about-us/ipsf-committee/">Katie Coates</a>, has been advocating for pole as an Olympic sport for 15 years. It created a 126-page <a href="http://www.polesports.org/about-us/document-policies/">rulebook</a> from scratch and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2018/9/12/shattering-stereotypes-pole-dancing-wants-to-be-at-the-olympics">gathered 10,000 signatures</a> on a 2010 petition to make pole dancing an Olympic sport. It even earned <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2017/10/18/pole-dancing-in-the-olympics-international-sports-federation-recognition-helps-pave-the-way/">provisional recognition</a> by the now-defunct <a href="https://gaisf.org/about/observers/">Global Association of International Sports Federations</a> (GAISF) in 2017, once viewed as an auspicious step toward winning over the International Olympic Committee (IOC), whose formal recognition is a prerequisite to becoming an Olympic sport.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet even as Paris features new sports such as breaking, there’s no space for pole — not this year, nor any future games thus far. Even <a href="https://www.thebrisbaneolympics.com.au/sports/equestrian-vaulting-at-the-2032-brisbane-olympics/#:~:text=The%202032%20Brisbane%20Olympics%20will,athleticism%20and%20artistry%20of%20gymnastics.">equestrian vaulting</a> has locked in a 2032 comeback. What gives?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The fight for Olympic recognition</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, the boring answer: Gaining Olympic recognition involves a lot of hard, unpaid labor, and no one wants to do it. Athletes in movement practices like pole dancing already struggle to make a living doing their sport. (I lived off my pole instructor income alone for a couple months, and I don’t recommend it.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If you’re a high level athlete, you want to focus on your training,” said <a href="https://www.instagram.com/amysunshine007/?hl=en">Amy Bond</a>, founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.poleanddancestudios.com/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw8MG1BhCoARIsAHxSiQmNn6SAZw0wdGjIkz7hCiNY8zrKc_Aef0MAKbW2BztEXgesTYy2twwaApp6EALw_wcB">Pole + Dance Studios</a>, which operates several pole studios along the US west coast. (Disclosure: I teach at Pole + Dance Studios.) “You don’t want to focus your time on the administration and bureaucracy and red tape that goes into getting your sport into the Olympics.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pole’s Olympic push has largely been a one-woman operation, with Coates serving as an entrepreneur-diplomat-organizer-athlete at IPSF. “She’s one human trying to wear 15 hats,” Bond said. Even for a well-organized team of advocates, the work of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/story/how-are-sports-chosen-for-the-olympics">getting a sport to the Olympics</a> is Sisyphean at best. For example, the <a href="https://www.worlddancesport.org/">World DanceSport Federation</a>, which organizes international breaking competitions, was <a href="https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/everything-you-need-know-about-breakings-olympic-debut">first recognized by the IOC in 1997</a> — 27 years before its Olympic debut. Breaking won’t be included again in 2028. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pole got GAISF  “observer status” in 2017, giving the IPSF access to a network of international sports federations for support. This status theoretically brought it closer to being taken seriously by the IOC, but the GAISF <a href="https://www.playthegame.org/news/world-sports-federations-may-give-up-their-own-independent-platform/">dissolved in 2022</a>, bringing pole back to the drawing board. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We never really got anywhere and we never got any support. I think they were just trying to placate us and shut us up,” <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2024/07/olympics-2024-paris-summer-usa-skateboarding-pole-dance.html">Coates told Slate</a> last month. “It broke my soul because it felt like I’d reached the summit only to find another, much tougher mountain in front of me.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Looking at pole dancing next to other Olympic sports, the snub can feel ridiculous. Pole combines the jaw-dropping feats of gymnastics, the social media appeal of skateboarding, and the countercultural intrigue of breaking. Clara Pauchet, a French pole instructor, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sports/pole-dancers-eyeing-games-participation-soul-sport-risk-2024-04-04/">told Reuters</a>, “When I see what it requires of the body, I don’t see the difference between gymnastics with parallel bars and a vertical bar. I think it really has its place.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But pole also brings something that the IOC may not be ready to handle: sexuality, and a lot of cultural baggage.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The sportification of pole dancing</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Plenty of Olympic sports feature scantily-clad athletes. Female beach volleyball players <a href="https://wwd.com/pop-culture/celebrity-news/beach-volleyball-player-uniform-olympics-1236509653/">often wear bikinis</a> while competing, figure skaters perform in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbv1a5vYI24">form-fitting, sheer-accented leotards</a>, and French diver <a href="https://www.out.com/gay-athletes/jules-bouyer-hot-pictures-fan-reaction#rebelltitem15">Jules Bouyer</a> was wearing less than most pole dancers when his <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1405768/2024-olympics-anthony-ammirati-and-jules-bouyer-react-after-going-viral-for-nsfw-reasons">speedo bulge</a> went viral this year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But while revealing costumes are partially a vestige of pole’s roots, skin friction against metal is also what keeps athletes from sliding off the pole. Think of firefighters <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2i3gDgEt1Q">zooming down fire poles</a> — with clothes on, a stainless steel or chrome pole is slippery. Because the inner thighs, hip fold, armpits, and midriff are all crucial contact points for many tricks, they all need to be exposed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s what some pole athletes are afraid to admit: Pole outfits are frequently not only tiny, but <em>sexy</em>, and intentionally so. Many pole dancers, including online censorship researcher and <a href="https://bloggeronpole.com/about/">blogger</a> <a href="https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/our-staff/a/carolina-are/">Carolina Are</a>, don’t think that they should have to hide that to be respected as artists and athletes. Just because “something is sexual, doesn’t make it less beautiful, or less hard to do as an extreme sport,” she said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of the <a href="https://bloggeronpole.com/2021/07/a-history-of-modern-pole-dance/">first pole studio owners</a>, like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/officiallyfawnia/?hl=en">Fawnia Mondey</a> and <a href="https://www.polejunkies.com/index.php/about">Alena Downs</a>, were strippers first, bringing what they learned at clubs to women outside the industry. In 2005, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/worldpoledance/photos/a.1557690021176161/2693315304280288/?type=3">first World Pole Championship</a> primarily featured strippers as competitors. But, Are said, the more normie hobbyists entered the pole world, the more pole entrepreneurs distanced themselves from sex workers. The social media hashtag <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stripper/comments/vwo33k/notastripper/">#NotAStripper</a> was big in 2016, widely used by young, white women new to pole who were desperate to offload the cultural baggage of their new hobby.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In an attempt to earn respect and an aura of legitimacy in the international sports world, the IPSF and other pole federations rebranded “pole dancing” as “pole sport” or “pole fitness.” Rather than (accurately) trace pole’s origins to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJ_AIIFWd8">Hoochie Coochie</a> and burlesque dancers, a certain brand of athlete would rewrite history, attributing modern pole fitness to the ancient male-dominated sports of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M7Z5wYghpc">Mallakhamb</a> — performing yoga poses and wrestling grips on a wooden pole — and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJVO3UCN9FU">Chinese acrobatic pole</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bond understands why some pole athletes try to separate themselves from strippers, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qvxpdm/pole-dancing-sport-offensive-to-strippers">despite the harm it causes professional erotic dancers</a>. As a studio owner, she’s had ads rejected by social media platforms “if there’s any amount of butt shown, and sometimes even when there’s not.” Across the board, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14680777.2021.1928259">pole accounts are reportedly shadowbanned</a> on TikTok and Instagram, preventing dancers from marketing themselves and monetizing their work. “If these examples are a snapshot of our society,” Are said, “I doubt the Olympics would be any more progressive.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, pole incorporates many flavors of movement, from sensual body rolls to dynamic aerial tumbles. But what’s truly transformative about pole as a movement practice isn’t its athleticism — it’s “the pushing of boundaries of what constitutes strength and power,” and “the liberation from shame,” Are said. Establishing technical scores for something so subjective is tricky, and dancers disagree on whether it should be done at all. “Anytime you watch a movement practice that is embodying art,” Bond said, “it’s really hard to create standards.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many of the movements codified by IPSF require both extreme flexibility and strength. Pole athletes competing under its guidelines have to include a set number of tricks from a long list of “flexibility elements” and “strength elements,” with more points awarded to those performing longer continuous sequences of harder, more well-executed tricks. Like gymnastics, pole sport is largely judged based on execution (how flawlessly a trick was performed) and difficulty. But because pole is more “dance” than gymnastics, originality, charisma, and confidence also contribute to the final score. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While gymnasts usually begin training as children, when they’re more pliable and less afraid of hurting themselves, US pole dancers usually aren’t introduced to the sport until adulthood. Studios that do welcome kids <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX6Y0vQOyNs">face immediate backlash</a> from conservative media in the US, so many instructors avoid teaching children altogether. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But in Europe and Latin American countries, pole studios often cater to children, where it’s viewed no differently than youth gymnastics or martial arts. Russia has a well-established youth pole federation, creating a pipeline for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bdXkpgZ9dU">future Olympic hopefuls</a> to train and compete. Youth pole dancing competitions look a lot like competitions in rhythmic gymnastics or acrobatics — incredibly impressive, albeit standardized and sanitized.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But with standardization comes repetition. Just like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2IeEsPki0I">wolf turn</a> has become ubiquitous in gymnastics balance beam and floor routines because it’s a big point-earner, pole tricks like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7zAqujs5Im/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet">Russian splits</a> pop up over and over again in high-level routines.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some dancers worry that this could tarnish the essence of the movement, a concern <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/arts/dance/olympics-breaking-dance.html">shared by many B-boys and B-girls</a> leading up to breaking’s Olympic debut. A pole fitness event organized by a federation like IPSF, the current model for Olympic pole sport, involves watching a bunch of performances where people are pushing their bodies to the limit to maximize points. While it showcases athleticism in a way that the IOC may be able to stomach, Are said that “trying to clean up something that is naturally gloriously filthy, nuanced, and porous” strips dancers of their ability to experiment, tell stories, and own their sexuality.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bond is hopeful that even a sanitized version of pole will give artists the platform they need to introduce a large audience to the full spectrum of movement embodied at clubs and studios. Given society’s squeamishness around sensuality, “we have to play by those rules in order to move our industry of pole forward,” she said. “We only push these things forward by giving people a glimpse.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Others are less optimistic. If the IOC can embrace all of pole’s history, including its sexuality, and make space for sensual expression in its scoring system — which seems exceedingly unlikely — that would be great.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If not,” Are said, “bye.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was back in a very familiar building. Not only was he making his fourth address to a joint session of Congress — breaking Winston Churchill’s record for foreign leaders — he’s also been a presence in the building’s halls since serving as a diplomat in the early 1980s. Since he made his first speech to Congress in 1996, Netanyahu has been almost as much a fixture of politics in America as in Israel. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Things felt different today. It’s not just that Netanyahu is a controversial figure, one who drew <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/24/netanyahu-congress-protests-security">thousands of protesters</a> onto the streets of Washington. That’s not new; Netanyahu’s 2011 speech to Congress was <a href="https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/benjaminnetanyahujointsession2011.htm">interrupted by a pro-Palestinian protester</a> in the chamber. What is new is that he has become an increasingly marginalized one.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even a few weeks ago, when Netanyahu’s speech was announced, it had the makings of a marquee political event. Today, it was overshadowed by President Joe Biden’s highly anticipated Wednesday night speech to address his decision to drop out of the presidential election. Dozens of lawmakers — <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/24/half-house-senate-democrats-boycott-netanyahu">around half of Congress’s Democrats</a> — skipped Netanyahu’s speech altogether.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Soon-to-retire Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin’s presence behind Netanyahu on the rostrum attested to how much of a partisan figure Netanyahu has become. Vice President Kamala Harris, Senate President Pro Tempore Patty Murray, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, one of whom would normally have been in that seat, all <a href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-811586">declined the role</a>. Netanyahu, who has been Israel’s prime minister for 17 of the last 30 years, has done more than anyone to make support for the country an increasingly partisan issue in the United States, in part through actions like his<em> </em>speech to Congress in 2015. That time, he was invited by congressional Republicans to lobby against the Iran nuclear deal then being negotiated by the Obama administration in what was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/02/26/politics/democrats-missing-netanyahu-whip-list/index.html">considered a remarkably partisan speech</a> for a foreign leader.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In today’s address, by contrast, Netanyahu made little news. It was a speech that gave little indication of a plan to end the war in Gaza, and likely undermined diplomatic efforts underway to do so. It was a notably defensive speech for Netanyahu, devoted more to refuting criticism of Israel than to charting a way forward out of the morass it has found itself in. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi <a href="https://x.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/1816208313572364356">called</a> it “by far the worst presentation of any foreign dignitary invited and honored with the privilege of addressing the Congress of the United States.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Netanyahu said — and what he’s doing</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Netanyahu recounted the horrors of Hamas’s October 7 attacks and vowed to the families of hostages currently being held in Gaza that he “would not rest until all their loved ones are home.” Not all of those families may be inclined to take him at his word. <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/international/4786324-hamas-hostages-netanyahu-speech/">Many of them</a> are calling for the prime minister to accept a ceasefire deal to secure the hostages’ release, but today Netanyahu vowed that “Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas’s military capabilities and its rule in Gaza and bring all our hostages home,” adding, “That’s what total victory means and we will settle for nothing less.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Netanyahu also said, as he has in several previous remarks, that “[Israel] must retain overriding&nbsp;control [in Gaza] to ensure that Gaza never again poses a security threat to Israel” — a demand likely to be a nonstarter for any ceasefire deal.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite that, Netanyahu <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israels-netanyahu-says-deal-could-be-nearing-hostages-gaza-2024-07-23/">has said in recent days</a> that a ceasefire deal may be near, and the deal currently being negotiated is likely to be the focus of the prime minister’s meeting at the White House with Biden on Thursday. The Biden administration has tended not to respond directly to Netanyahu’s public statements on the deal, and this time was no exception. Asked if Netanyahu’s remarks made that deal less likely, a senior US administration official told reporters on Wednesday afternoon, “We were in the Situation Room doing some other stuff, so I have not seen the speech.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Netanyahu didn’t indicate any specific asks beyond continued US military support. “Give us the tools faster and we’ll finish the job faster,” he said, riffing on a famous Churchill line from World War II. As he has in all three of his previous addresses, going back to the mid-1990s, Netanyahu kept the focus on Iran, which he mentioned before Hamas. He made the case that Israel’s fight against Iran-backed groups like Hamas and Hezbollah serves to “keep American boots off the ground while protecting our shared interests in the Middle East.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He pushed back against criticism of Israel over civilian casualties and preventing food from entering Gaza. He ripped into anti-Israel protesters in the United States, accusing them of being “useful idiots” for Iran, criticized university presidents, and compared “gays for Gaza” to “chickens for KFC.” This was likely the first speech on Mideast policy that included a shout-out to the “<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/white-house-praises-unc-frat-bros-protected-american-flag-anti-israel-agitators-admirable">fraternity brothers of the University of North Carolina.</a>”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to lose friends and influence</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Netanyahu praised President Biden for his “half a century of friendship to Israel” and noted that the president describes himself as a “proud Zionist.” But that only served to highlight the shrinking number of Democratic politicians who would publicly describe themselves that way. Polls have consistently shown a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/472070/democrats-sympathies-middle-east-shift-palestinians.aspx">deep partisan divide</a> opening up over sympathy toward Israel.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He also thanked former president and current Republican nominee Donald Trump for actions in support of Israel during his presidency, including recognizing Israeli <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-recognizing-golan-heights-part-state-israel/">sovereignty over the Golan Heights</a> and moving the <a href="https://il.usembassy.gov/statement-by-president-trump-on-jerusalem/">US embassy to Jerusalem</a>. Netanyahu will be traveling to Florida to meet with Trump (<a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/netanyahu-requested-date-for-trump-meeting-falls-on-miami-based-son-yairs-birthday/">and possibly celebrate the birthday of his son</a>, who lives in Miami). Still, while Trump has not exactly turned on Israel, he has clearly soured somewhat on Netanyahu, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2021/12/10/trump-netanyahu-disloyalty-fuck-him">who he is still angry at</a> for congratulating Biden on his election victory in 2020. It doesn’t seem like a coincidence that Trump posted a <a href="https://x.com/BarakRavid/status/1815939398841847899">friendly letter</a> from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on the day he announced the Netanyahu meeting.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From a purely visual standpoint, Netanyahu may have gotten what he wanted today: rapturous standing ovations, even if mainly from Republicans. But more than <a href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-810113">70 percent of Israelis now say that Netanyahu</a> should resign. His own defense establishment is turning on his <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/israeli-defense-minister-publicly-criticizes-netanyahus-gaza-strategy#:~:text=Israel's%20defense%20minister%20accused%20Netanyahu%20of%20indecision%20and%20leading%20Israel,he's%20here%20with%20us%20now.">handling of the war</a> and he’s under fire over issues ranging from his long-running legal troubles to the controversial question of whether the ultra-Orthodox should serve in the country’s military.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the past, Washington has served as a sort of relief valve for Netanyahu, a place he could count on strong support, even when his political position looked rocky at home. In that first speech back in 1996, after receiving a five-minute standing ovation from Congress, he <a href="https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/benjaminnetanyahujointsession1996.htm">quipped</a>, “If I could only get the Knesset [Israel’s parliament] to vote like this.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, though, “the magic is gone,” Nimrod Novik, a former senior Israeli foreign policy official who is now an analyst at the Israel Policy Forum, told Vox. “The fellow that mastered verbal acrobatics to the point that different audiences could hear different messages in the same speech —&nbsp;that’s over. Those who were in awe of his verbal skills now take it with a grain of salt.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In more than 40 years of coming to Washington, Netanyahu has surely grown used to being a controversial figure. He may have to get used to being an irrelevant one.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Correction, 7 pm ET: </strong>An earlier version of this story referred to Netanyahu as a former ambassador to the US. He was a deputy chief of mission.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vice President Kamala Harris has 103 days to convince the American public to vote for her for president. It’s not a lot of time — especially considering former <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-launch-new-white-house-bid-while-his-party-licks-its-wounds-2022-11-15/">President Donald Trump launched his campaign in November 2022</a> — but it’s a timeline not too different from that of other countries, many of which have short campaign cycles.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US has the longest campaign cycle of any of its peer countries partly because we operate on a presidential system. We have fixed terms of leadership, and we know there will be elections every four years, so it’s easy to start early (especially given all <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/01/31/primary-elections-frontloading-voters-00138616">the procedural hurdles to running for president</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“That’s different from most other democracies, which are parliamentary systems and which have irregularly scheduled elections where you can have — as in Israel —  five elections in a very brief period of time,” <a href="https://truman.missouri.edu/people/squire">Peverill Squire</a>, professor of political science at the University of Missouri, told Vox. “Or you can call a snap election, as happened in France or the election <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/358985/uk-labour-keir-starmer-tories-migration-politics-elections-july-4-rishi-sunak-boris-johnson">in Great Britain</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So how do other countries with shorter campaign periods manage their leadership elections — and can that tell us anything about what the next three months could look like for Harris’s campaign?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The US system has unique factors that make comparison difficult</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Comparing US presidential campaigns to those in other countries — even our allies and peers — is kind of like comparing apples and oranges for many reasons. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A parliamentary system’s uneven cycles force campaign apparatuses — from how debates are run to deadlines for printing ballots — to be a lot more flexible than they are in the US. Plus, many of these systems are highly centralized, rather than federalized like in the US. In parliamentary systems, candidates run on relatively narrow party manifestos; there’s less individual variance between candidates of the same party. That means in a case like Harris’s, where one candidate is substituted for another late in the race, voters don’t really have to figure out how the new candidate differs from the old. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One major challenge Democrats may face is the role that money plays in the US election system. The 2010 Supreme Court decision in<em> </em><a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2008/08-205"><em>Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission</em></a><em> </em>essentially qualified political donations as free speech. It determined that corporations have the rights of individuals when it comes to campaign donations and <a href="https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/candidate-taking-receipts/contribution-limits/">can in some cases donate unlimited amounts</a>. That’s caused astronomical increases in campaign fundraising, which alters the course of American politics in critical ways that just don’t apply in European countries like France.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris has raised more than <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kamala-harris-fundraising-100-million-biden-drops-out/">$100 million since gaining President Joe Biden’s endorsement</a> on Sunday, but will need to keep the money flowing; Trump’s <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kamala-harris-fundraising-100-million-biden-drops-out/">second-quarter haul</a> was more than $60 million more than Biden’s. Campaigns run through money quickly as they fund ad buys and ground operations, and their outside partners do too. In an era of unlimited political spending, there’s a race to have the largest war chest — a competition that just isn’t an issue in European politics, <a href="https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/people/patrick-chamorel">Patrick Chamorel</a>, senior resident scholar at the Stanford Center in Washington, told Vox. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It&#8217;s parties that receive the money” in European elections, “and this money is public money.” Plus, Chamorel said, “in Europe, you have spending limits, which would in the US be considered an encroachment on freedom of expression.” There’s always a ceiling on how much the parties can spend in European elections — and there are very strict limits on corporate donations, which is meant to maintain the independence of the candidates and to ensure a pluralistic political system by keeping a relatively even playing field. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And in most European countries, “you don&#8217;t have money spent on advertisement in the media,” Chamorel said. Media organizations are required to give equal airtime to official candidates — “even the small candidates from the tiny parties, they have equal time.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s not the case in the US. And in the absence of spending caps or media rules, Democrats — who have emphasized getting the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/04/biden-dems-grassroots-donations-00109766">support of small donors in recent years</a> — will need to continue to find ways to keep Harris’s fundraising numbers high, particularly as they work to ward off the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361087/trump-silicon-valley-fundraising-musk-andreessen-horowitz">large individual donors</a> who have promised sizable donations to outside groups allied with Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One other key difference Democrats will have to contend with is the idea that voters need to be introduced to candidates. Harris, though vice president for the last four years, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/362619/kamala-harris-president-vision-political-ideology-2024-election">remains something of a blank slate</a>, leading to a lot of <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/362782/kamala-harris-gaza-israel-palestine-biden-netanyahu">speculation about what her policy positions are</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She has just over three months for voters to get to know her, but her European counterparts don’t face the same struggle in their short election cycles. Party leaders are usually a known quantity already, having worked their way up through leadership over many years after holding different positions in government. Plus Europeans tend to pay much more attention to politics than Americans, Chamorel said —&nbsp;so voters are likely to know candidates and what their parties actually stand for in a way American voters don’t.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>But there is a way that circumstances could play to Democrats’ advantage</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is one way Harris could really benefit from the European-style campaign cycle she faces.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Normally, America’s campaign cycles are so long that candidates run the risk of voters becoming disengaged by the time Election Day rolls around. That certainly appeared to be the case this cycle, with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/americans-dismayed-by-biden-trump-2024-rematch-reutersipsos-poll-finds-2024-01-25/">voters regularly telling pollsters</a> they wished they had <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/06/23/double-haters-biden-trump-deciders/">choices other than Trump and Biden</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“One of the problems of having candidates running for years in advance of an election is the public can become tired of them and their message,” Squire said. “[Harris will] reap the benefits of having an organization in place; she can just take over the Biden-Harris organization,” while still being relatively fresh to voters. “She can run as not really the incumbent, and as somebody who is known a little bit, but not that well by many Americans.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris may, to an extent, have the best of both worlds: She already has the benefit of being in national leadership positions. She has the Democratic machinery behind her, including Biden and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and she will have <a href="https://www.vox.com/joe-biden/361991/361991biden-campaign-funds-after-drops-out">access to Biden’s fundraising dollars</a>. But voters haven’t been seeing her campaigning everywhere for months now, which means she’ll <em>seem </em>new.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a two-party system in which the Democrats have a broad mix of ideologies — think of centrist Democrats like Biden versus more left-wing politicians like Sen. Bernie Sanders (who is an independent, but is broadly part of the Democratic coalition) — Harris will need to clarify and explain her positions. She’ll have to maintain a balance of staying close enough to Biden’s policies while offering the change that voters have expressed they want, which could prove to be a challenging needle to thread in a short period of time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, the shorter campaign cycle may mean less opportunity for errors like the debate performance that ultimately caused Biden to step down. And there will be less time for Trump and the Republican Party to create damaging narratives about Harris that overshadow her policy and performance — provided she creates a narrative about herself first.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris has clinched the support of all the major Democratic players — now she’ll have to concentrate on what’s most important, which is broadcasting her policy and building a coalition of voters who think she can be the next president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What might Harris look for? Based on that history, there are a few guesses: Her pick could be someone from a purple or red state, who offers geographic diversity given her roots in California. And — to assuage voters who still hold sexist or racist attitudes, as President Barack Obama did with Biden in 2008 — it might be a white man.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Below is a rundown of some of the possible candidates who might be considered — and what they’d bring to the ticket.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/gettyimages-2159037882_26f6dd.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Gov. Roy Cooper, in a navy suit, speaks from a podium to a large crowd holding Biden-Harris campaign signs." title="Gov.

Roy Cooper speaks before President Joe Biden at a post-debate campaign rally on June 28, in Raleigh, North Carolina. | Allison Joyce/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Allison Joyce/Getty Images" />
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Gov. Roy Cooper</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Cooper, 67, is the governor of North Carolina, a battleground state that Trump won narrowly in 2020 and 2016 that offers <a href="https://www.ncsbe.gov/about-elections/electoral-college">16 electoral votes</a> (of the 270 needed to win). He’s known for winning repeatedly statewide even as other Democratic candidates have struggled to do the same for roles like the Senate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As governor, he’s also vetoed Republican bills on abortion and guns, and has strong approval <a href="https://abc11.com/post/2024-elections-could-governor-roy-cooper-replace-president/15011995/">ratings overall</a>. Prior to becoming governor, he served as the state’s attorney general and in the state legislature.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Cooper could help improve Democrats’ chances in a battleground state, though it will still likely be an uphill battle given past contests in North Carolina. He’s also been pretty popular in his role, and has secured backing from some moderates and Republicans.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He previously collaborated with Harris while they each served as their states’ AG, meaning they have experience working alongside one another. And more recently, Harris and Cooper <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsVNTI1BqZo">have campaigned together</a> in the wake of <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357788/biden-trump-debate-winners-losers">Biden’s disastrous June debate</a>, during which the governor cautioned against the return of “Donald Trump’s America.”</p>

Josh Shapiro arrives to deliver remarks at a building trades union conference on April 24, in Washington, DC. | Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images" />
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Gov. Josh Shapiro</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Shapiro, 51, is the governor of Pennsylvania, another likely battleground state (with <a href="https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/allocation">19 Electoral College votes</a>), which Biden won in 2020 and which former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton lost in 2016.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He was elected in 2022, the same year that freshman Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) was elected to the Senate. Shapiro ran far ahead of Fetterman, <a href="https://www.politico.com/2022-election/results/pennsylvania/">winning 57 percent of the vote, to Fetterman’s 51 percent</a>. Shapiro has established himself as a moderate who helped negotiate bipartisan deals when he was in the state legislature, and is also known for his work as attorney general, when he secured settlements for victims of sexual abuse by the Catholic Diocese. He’s also been a vocal supporter of Israel amid the country’s devastating military offensive in Gaza, following Hamas’ brutal October 7 attack.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him?</strong> Like Cooper, he’s the popular Democratic governor of a swing state and could help the party improve their chances there. He’s also seen as more of a centrist who could appeal to moderate voters and independents, though his staunch backing of Israel could turn away progressive Democrats.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/gettyimages-2161807297_5538e2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Gov.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Gov. Andy Beshear</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Beshear, 46, is the governor of Kentucky and <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/11/7/23950792/election-day-2023-kentucky-governors-race-results-democrats-republicans">has won twice in a red state that previously overwhelmingly voted for Trump</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As governor, he’s been praised for his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic as well as multiple crises in the state, including <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/4/11/23679512/louisville-kentucky-shooting-workplace">a mass shooting at a bank</a> and severe flooding. Prior to this role, he also served as Kentucky’s attorney general.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Beshear is the rare Democrat who has been able to win multiple times in a red state and could offer additional appeal to some swing voters. In addition to the support he’s received for his leadership during various crises, he’s also touted infrastructure and private sector investment in the state during his tenure.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unlike other possibilities, though, he probably wouldn’t increase Harris’s chances of winning his home state, which is solidly GOP.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-2160763179.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Gov. J.B.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Gov. J.B. Pritzker</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he? </strong>J.B. Pritzker, 59, is the governor of Illinois, a Democratic state that Biden and Clinton both won in 2020 and 2016. Before becoming governor, he was a businessman and philanthropist, and is a scion of the family behind Hyatt hotels, who’ve also been consistent and influential Democratic donors.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As governor, Pritzker has established a modest national profile, including remarks he’s given attacking Trump and calls he’s made for more federal resources to address immigration in Illinois.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Pritzker has already built some name recognition as a fixture on cable news, and has proven to be a vocal Trump antagonist. Pritzker’s personal wealth could also potentially be a boon to the campaign, though his own state is not a battleground that would expand the Democratic map.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-2160744008_a0c39e.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Sen.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Sen. Mark Kelly</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Kelly is the junior senator of Arizona — a swing state with <a href="https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/allocation">11 Electoral College votes</a> — <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/11/5/21537670/senate-2020-results-arizona-mark-kelly-winner">who was elected in 2020</a> by framing himself as a candidate willing to work across the aisle. Previously, Biden won Arizona in 2020, while Clinton lost the state in 2016. Kelly is also known for his career as an astronaut alongside his twin brother Scott Kelly, and as the husband of gun control advocate and former US Rep. Gabby Giffords.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Kelly has a higher profile than some of the other names on this list, and is respected both for his scientific expertise and contributions as an astronaut in addition to his time in the Senate. He’s been a prominent gun control advocate alongside Giffords and made pushing these policies a priority.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given his efforts to appeal to both Republicans and independents in Arizona, he’d be another option who could help with trying to reach those voters. Arizona also continues to be an important battleground this time around, including in its <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings">Senate race</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-1394802139.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Pete Buttigieg, in a navy suit and white shirt, is shown from the side, while pinning an index card onto a wall full of similar cards with handwritten notes.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Secretary Pete Buttigieg</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he?</strong> Buttigieg, 42, is the secretary of transportation who rose to prominence as a former 2020 presidential candidate. He’s staked out more moderate positions and was previously mayor of South Bend, Indiana.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He’s become known for his media savvy and strong television appearances as an advocate for the Biden-Harris administration. He’s also had to respond to crises including the train accident and <a href="https://www.vox.com/science/2023/2/18/23603471/east-palestine-ohio-derailment-water-contamination-health">chemical spill in East Palestine</a>, Ohio, as well as the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024/1/8/24030677/boeing-alaska-airlines-plane-737-max-door-plug">Alaska Airlines mishap</a> when a door plug dropped out of a plane.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Buttigieg has been a strong spokesperson for the Biden-Harris White House and is well-established among the Democratic electorate. He’s among the youngest of possible choices, would contribute more representation from the Midwest,<strong> </strong>and could appeal to centrist voters. He’d also become the first openly LGBTQ person to be on a presidential ticket.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/gettyimages-2161013764_474f9c.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752616398754,100,78.494767202492" alt="Gov.

Gavin Newsom speaks during a press conference in Oakland, California, on July 11. | Stephen Lam/San Francisco Chronicle/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Stephen Lam/San Francisco Chronicle/Getty Images" />
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Gov. Gavin Newsom</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Newsom, 56, is the governor of California, and a longstanding political personality. He’s been a vocal advocate for more progressive policies, and for Democrats to more directly confront Republicans.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Prior to being governor, he was also lieutenant governor and mayor of San Francisco.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Newsom has already made clear that he wants to be a fighter for Democrats and has supporters who are interested in his approach. He’s also used opportunities like a debate against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to make some splashy points for the party and to get more attention, and could do the same for a possible campaign.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As governor of California, however, he wouldn’t bring additional geographic diversity to the ticket, and he also wouldn’t help with delivering a swing state, as his own is solidly Democratic. In addition, Newsom and Harris are both Californians, so they’d also likely have to contend with issues raised by the 12th Amendment of the Constitution, which prohibits two running mates from the same state.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Gov. Tim Walz</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he?</strong> Walz, 60, is in his second term as governor of Minnesota. A <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/national/2024/07/who-is-minnesota-governor-tim-walz-one-of-the-top-contenders-for-vice-president/#:~:text=Tim%20Walz%20was%20a%20high,one%20of%20the%20student's%20wallets.">former high school teacher</a>, he’s been in politics for decades, having started as a member of Congress in 2007. He received national attention for leading his party through a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/minnesota-taxes-abortion-health-racial-justice-transportation-marijuana-c3cc7db0cd92c022817ef3ae41097c73">2023 legislative session</a> that saw Democrats in the state achieve a litany of long-held ambitions, including on police reform, boosting education funding, marijuana legalization, abortion protections, child tax credits, and more.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him?</strong> Walz is the <a href="https://www.kaaltv.com/news/approval-rates-for-minnesota-leaders/#">well-liked leader</a> of a <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/presidential-race-ratings">purplish state</a> with a record of advancing Democratic priorities through his state legislature and with <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2023/12/15/public-sector-unions-spend-more-on-politics-in-minnesota-than-in-nearly-any-other-state/">strong ties to organized labor</a>. A Midwesterner, Walz could prove to be a useful surrogate for <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-campaign-midwest-after-clinching-democratic-nomination-2024-03-13/">shoring up support</a> in his own state, as well as ones like Michigan and Wisconsin. And like many of the other potential vice president picks on this list, he’s already proved to be a <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/twin-cities/2024/07/23/tim-walz-vice-president-kamala-harris-vet-minnesota">strong Harris surrogate</a> on television news.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Gov. Gretchen Whitmer</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is she? </strong>Whitmer, 52, is the governor of Michigan, a key swing state with <a href="https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/allocation">15 Electoral College votes</a> that Biden won in 2020 and that Clinton lost in 2016.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She’s been a popular leader in this role, and was initially known for how much she emphasized infrastructure and “fixing the damn roads.” Since then she’s been an outspoken advocate for abortion rights and for gender equity, speaking openly about how she was sexually assaulted in college. Prior to being governor, Whitmer was a member of the state legislature and the first woman to become the Democratic leader of the state Senate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What was the case for her? </strong>She’s among the members of the list who have strong and positive national recognition, and who could help raise Democrats’ chances in a pivotal swing state. Whitmer has also focused on issues including infrastructure and health care, which could broaden Democrats’ appeal to moderate voters. And if Harris and Whitmer were on the same ticket, they would form a groundbreaking all-woman ticket — something that neither major party has run before.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Why she won&#8217;t be the new VP:</strong> Less than 24 hours after Biden endorsed Harris, Whitmer emphatically told reporters that she has no desire to be vice president. “I’m not planning to go anywhere,” <a href="https://x.com/kenvogel/status/1815417822056755621">she said, adding</a>, “I am not leaving Michigan; I&#8217;m proud to be the governor of Michigan.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President Joe Biden’s unwavering support for Israel’s war in Gaza created a rift between moderates and progressives in his party. Now that he has stepped aside in the 2024 presidential race, the question is whether Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, would chart a different path forward as president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One early signal that she might: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scheduled to address Congress on Wednesday, and Harris will not preside in her role as vice president due to a previously scheduled event she is attending in Indianapolis. A slew of congressional Democrats (not just progressives) have decided not to attend in <a href="https://rollcall.com/2024/07/23/netanyahu-address-creates-a-dilemma-for-democrats/">protest of Netanyahu’s strategy in Gaza</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris will meet with Netanyahu one-on-one on Wednesday, and the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/harriss-support-for-gaza-cease-fire-hints-at-foreign-policy-shift-bbe8dc2a">Wall Street Journal reported</a> that she is expected to tell him “it is time for the war to end in a way where Israel is secure, all hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can enjoy their right to dignity, freedom, and self-determination.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Only days into her campaign, Harris has yet to articulate her Gaza policy, but the fact that she is not attending Netanyahu’s speech and privately communicating the urgency of a ceasefire signals that she might not follow Biden’s lead in giving the Israeli leader a “<a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/world/biden-netanyahu-bear-hug-disaster/">bear hug</a>.” Biden literally embraced Netanyahu on the tarmac when the president landed in Tel Aviv in November as a symbolic gesture of unequivocal support for Israel, and has since kept the prime minister close metaphorically, offering military and financial support.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Harris does change course, even slightly, that could alter the US-Israel relationship, but could also have important electoral consequences as well.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What does Kamala Harris think about Israel and the war in Gaza?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris has longstanding ties to the American Jewish community and Israeli interest groups.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, is Jewish and has been at the forefront of the Biden administration’s <a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2024/01/world-economic-forum-davos-antisemitism-herzog-greenblatt-emhoff-rosen/">initiative against antisemitism</a> since Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She has a good working relationship with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/kamala-harris-has-long-embraced-jewish-ties-but-critics-take-issue-with-gaza-stance/">shares a passion for climate issues</a>. She has also been on every one of the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/harriss-support-for-gaza-cease-fire-hints-at-foreign-policy-shift-bbe8dc2a">more than 20 phone calls</a> that Biden has had with Netanyahu throughout the war.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In her presidential bid, she has <a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2024/07/kamala-harris-jewish-democrats-vice-president-presidential-race/">won the backing</a> of major Jewish interest groups, including Democratic Majority for Israel, J Street, and the Jewish Democratic Council of America. She also has connections to the <a href="https://x.com/VP/status/1110301531306409986">American Israel Public Affairs Committee</a> (AIPAC) and gave a speech at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McK8bPR8pzU">organization’s annual conference in 2017</a> soon after she was elected to the US Senate, saying that one of her first acts in office was to introduce a resolution opposing a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israel. At the time, she said, “I believe the bonds between the United States and Israel are unbreakable.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Concerning the war in Gaza, Harris has repeatedly upheld Israel’s “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/03/03/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-commemorating-the-59th-anniversary-of-bloody-sunday-selma-al/">right to defend itself</a>” against Hamas and emphasized that the threat posed by Hamas to Israel must be “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/03/03/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-commemorating-the-59th-anniversary-of-bloody-sunday-selma-al/">eliminated</a>.” This suggests she’s largely in agreement with Biden’s posture. Harris has, however, taken a sharper tone than Biden concerning Israel’s treatment of civilians in Gaza.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a high-profile <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/03/03/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-commemorating-the-59th-anniversary-of-bloody-sunday-selma-al/">speech in March</a>, she became the first person in the Biden administration to call for an immediate ceasefire, albeit only a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/03/03/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-commemorating-the-59th-anniversary-of-bloody-sunday-selma-al/">temporary</a> one. She also said that the Israeli government must do more to increase the flow of aid to Gaza, “no excuses,” and called the situation in Gaza a “humanitarian catastrophe.” The version of the speech that was ultimately delivered had reportedly <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/kamala-harris-gaza-speech-watered-down-cease-fire-rcna141750">been softened</a> from its original draft, which more directly criticized Israel for its obstruction of aid trucks into Gaza.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She also has expressed empathy for <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024/4/24/24138333/columbia-student-protests-gaza-nyu-divest-faculty">student protesters on college campuses</a> who are horrified by the death and destruction in Gaza and have attempted to pressure their schools into cutting ties with Israel.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“They are showing exactly what the human emotion should be, as a response to Gaza,” Harris <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/kamala-harris-interview-profile-excerpt/">told the Nation</a>. “There are things some of the protesters are saying that I absolutely reject, so I don’t mean to wholesale endorse their points. But we have to navigate it. I understand the emotion behind it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If she becomes president, the Wall Street Journal reported that Harris is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/harriss-support-for-gaza-cease-fire-hints-at-foreign-policy-shift-bbe8dc2a">expected to replace</a> some of the chief architects of the Biden administration’s strategy in Gaza, including national security adviser Jake Sullivan, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. It’s to be expected that a new president would want their own team in place, but any changes would open up possibilities for taking a different tack.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris’s national security adviser, Philip Gordon, has emphasized diplomatic rather than military solutions in foreign policy and written extensively about the difficulties of regime change in the Middle East. That background may prove relevant as Israel seeks to root out Hamas and install a new government in Gaza.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of this suggests that Harris might be somewhat to Biden’s left on Gaza — but by how much is an open question and one that she will have to clarify.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“She does have an opportunity. She’s using the right language in some instances. But we need a clearer explanation from her on where she stands,” said Abed Ayoub, national legal and policy director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And — as with Joe Biden’s campaign promises to make Saudi Arabia a pariah state — there’s always a chance that what Harris does eventually say while campaigning may change once she’s in office.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Biden’s Gaza policy has been divisive&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Politically, Harris faces the quandary of determining if — and by how much — she should distance herself from Biden’s record on Gaza, which has fractured the Democratic base.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden at one point <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/05/08/congress/progressives-cheer-israel-weapon-pause-gop-fume-biden-00156857">paused shipments of large munitions</a> to Israel over concerns about how they would be potentially used against civilians in Gaza but has otherwise continued to offer material support for the war, even after Israeli operations in Gaza’s southernmost city of Rafah <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/07/middleeast/destruction-inside-rafa-gaza-israel-intl/index.html">wreaked widespread destruction</a>. Over <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/latest-israeli-strikes-southern-gaza-palestinian-death-toll-112159613">39,000 Palestinians</a> have already died in the course of the conflict, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In May, Biden called for a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/biden-middle-east-remarks/index.html">deal to end the war</a> and return the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza, while continuing to advocate for a two-state solution to the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But the Israeli parliament has since voted to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israels-knesset-votes-overwhelmingly-palestinian-statehood-netanyahu-p-rcna162466">reject a two-state solution</a> and ceasefire talks are still ongoing two months later.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Monday, Biden promised he would <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/22/biden-gaza-war-end-hostages-return-pledge">deliver a ceasefire</a> deal before he leaves office. He did not elaborate on how he plans to overcome the roadblocks that have stalled negotiations thus far.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Progressives have for months been calling on Biden to halt weapons shipments to Gaza and put more pressure on Israel to end the war. Over 650,000 Democrats <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/05/biden-uncommitted-primary-vote-00161700">voted “uncommitted”</a> in the primary to protest Biden’s policies, and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/opinion/100000009565908/biden-voters-dearborn-michigan.html">scale of the opposition to Biden in the Midwest</a> appeared as though it could have tipped the election in Trump’s favor in swing states including Michigan and Wisconsin. Depending on how Harris positions herself, she could win back some of those voters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think there is excitement that [Biden] is not at the top of the ticket,” said Layla Elabed, a Palestinian American organizer in Michigan who helped lead the uncommitted movement, and the sister of Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI). “But we are also right now watching and listening to what Harris is going to do next.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Overall, however, Democrats and Republicans <a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/most-americans-support-israel-over-hamas-poll/">remain largely supportive</a> of Israel’s campaign. Since Israel’s establishment in 1948, the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/11/politics/presidents-israel-cnn/index.html">US has maintained a special relationship with the country</a>. It has been the largest cumulative recipient of American foreign aid since its founding, <a href="https://www.cfr.org/article/us-aid-israel-four-charts">totaling about $310 billion</a> (adjusted for inflation) in total economic and military assistance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For these reasons, it’s unlikely that Harris will deviate substantially from Biden on Israel — and if there is any change in her policy, it would be only slight. The question will be whether any changes can win back voters that the president has alienated without losing the voters who embraced his stance.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This leaves Harris with a difficult political tightrope to walk. But unlike Biden, she isn’t weighed down with the direct responsibility for all that has happened so far.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The world is still dealing with the fallout from <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/361740/crowdstrike-outage-windows">the CrowdStrike screwup that took millions of computers offline last week</a>. Some IT workers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/21/24202960/crowdstrike-windows-outage-it-workers-photos-videos">have had to fix each computer manually</a>, walking from machine to machine <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/fix-the-crowdstrike-bug-with-usb-drive">with a USB stick</a>, and some remote workers <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1e8z91i/comment/leckaz9/">say</a> they’re locked out of their computers with no fix in sight. All because of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/crowdstrike-outage-update-windows/">a few lines of bad code</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It started in the early morning hours of Friday, July 19, when the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike pushed an update to its millions of customers. Unfortunately for all of them, there was a mistake in the code that caused Windows computers to crash repeatedly. This caused lots of problems for airlines, banks, hospitals, TV broadcasters, government agencies, and everyone who interacted with these organizations as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24201717/windows-bsod-crowdstrike-outage-issue">the dreaded “blue screen of death”</a> took over millions of computers. It took CrowdStrike <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/23/24204196/crowdstrike-windows-bsod-faulty-update-microsoft-responses">just 78 minutes</a> to identify the problem and issue a fix, but because many computers needed to be manually restarted, the problems persisted through the weekend and into this week. As of Wednesday morning, Delta Air Lines <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/travel/delta-air-lines-flight-cancellations-delays-wednesday-rcna163398">was still experiencing delays</a> due to the outage. The ongoing Delta flight cancellations <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2024/07/23/delta-flight-cancellations-unaccompanied-minors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">separated countless unaccompanied minors from their parents for days</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is all annoying and anxiety-inducing. But a massive outage like this — whether caused by a faulty update, as was the case with CrowdStrike, or by a cyberattack — could have been much worse. <em>Much</em> worse. Like, getting kicked back to the 19th century overnight worse, and it’s not clear what we can do to stop it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This was just an accident,” Mark Atwood, an open source policy wonk and former Amazon employee, told me. “This could have been something that … just turned everybody’s computers into bricks, possibly unrepairable.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The really scary thing is that there’s honestly not much you or I can do to prevent a catastrophe like that from happening in the future. If you work for CrowdStrike, sure, you could do your part, but for the most part, building a more resilient internet is a job for the federal government. As trite as it may sound, one thing you can do is call your representatives in Congress and demand action. Because even if there’s not much you can do on an individual level to prevent the next big internet outage or cyberattack, you will likely be affected.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One big problem — and a key reason why this outage was so huge — is that CrowdStrike controls so much market share, and its software is so deeply integrated into so many computers, that one bad update can bring them all down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Regulations require companies in critical industries, like <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html">health care</a> and <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/privacy-security/gramm-leach-bliley-act">banking</a>, to protect people from harm, which means they must follow cybersecurity guidelines and use endpoint security software, which protects internet-connected devices from cyberattacks. CrowdStrike <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/crowdstrike-outage-safety-update-rcna163127">tends to be the default option</a> to comply with these regulations, and in 2021, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) even picked CrowdStrike <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/press-releases/cisa-selects-crowdstrike-to-protect-the-nations-critical-endpoints-and-workloads/">to secure multiple government agencies</a>. CrowdStrike now controls nearly 25 percent of the market for endpoint security. So when CrowdStrike pushes out a bad update, a lot of people are affected. This particular incident affected 8.5 million Windows devices, <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/07/20/helping-our-customers-through-the-crowdstrike-outage/">according to Microsoft</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lawmakers and regulators can and should learn from this CrowdStrike fiasco. It could be an opportunity for the federal government to redouble its efforts at improving cybersecurity and for security companies to do better. We have to demand they build products that are truly secure, says Dan O’Dowd, CEO of Green Hills Software and founder of <a href="https://dawnproject.com/">the Dawn Project</a>, an organization dedicated to making computers safe for humans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We know how to do it. It’s been done for years and years in the military and in aviation,” O’Dowd told me. “But it does cost more, and people just have to accept that we’re going to have a somewhat higher cost, so that we don’t lose it all.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cybersecurity experts <a href="https://www.govtech.com/blogs/lohrmann-on-cybersecurity/cyber-attacks-is-the-big-one-coming-soon.html">talk about “the big one” a lot</a> these days, and that’s what O’Dowd is referring to when he says we could lose it all.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-2162028098.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="A monitor screen in a subway station reads “the global technical outage,” as people walk underneath it in the direction of signs pointing to the exits." title="A monitor screen in a subway station reads “the global technical outage,” as people walk underneath it in the direction of signs pointing to the exits." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="The global outage brought down information screens on the New York City subway on July 19. | Adam Gray/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Adam Gray/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The big one might involve hackers <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/17/biden-admin-ports-prep-for-cyberattacks-as-us-infrastructure-targeted.html">attacking physical infrastructure</a>, like the power grid, water treatment plants, or shipping ports. Bad actors <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-security-2024-threats-cybersecurity-russia-69b130e9896a8e8a229b7a668000183f">could target elections</a>, hack voting machines, and spread misinformation. These kinds of things are actually already happening, but so far, there has not been a truly catastrophic outage or an attack so successful that it’s brought down large swaths of modern society. Not yet, at least.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The CrowdStrike incident should be a wakeup call, a reminder that the big one is coming and that there’s more we could do to stop it. Republican lawmakers have called on CrowdStrike CEO George Shultz <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/22/house-committee-calls-crowdstrike-ceo-testify-global-outage/">to testify before the House Homeland Security Committee</a>&nbsp;to explain what happened to cause the outage and what the company was doing about it. CrowdStrike told me it was “actively in contact with relevant congressional committees,” and on Wednesday <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/falcon-content-update-remediation-and-guidance-hub/">published a preliminary incident report</a> detailing what went wrong and how it planned to prevent something like this from happening in the future.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Attention on Capitol Hill may also signal interest in legislation to create new regulations for the cybersecurity industry, although nothing has been announced.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, FTC Chair Lina Khan <a href="https://x.com/linakhanFTC/status/1814395610788929649">is drawing attention to</a> how the concentration of power can mean “a single glitch results in a system-wide outage, affecting industries from healthcare and airlines to banks and auto-dealers.” She seems to suggest that a better regulated cybersecurity industry could reduce that harm. Others, <a href="https://x.com/_Mark_Atwood/status/1814391019951272387">including Atwood</a>, have pointed out that, in some ways, the regulations are in place, but companies like CrowdStrike still aren’t following best practices.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Everyone believed there was no silver bullet, there was no cure for this other than try to think harder,” Atwood told me. “There are still bullets and best practices that, if you do them, the odds of making mistakes like this fall a lot.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Truth be told, there’s no easy way to make our networks and computers completely secure. But the federal government is continuing to try. It established CISA in 2018 to do everything from securing elections to protecting the power grid <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/programs/electromagnetic-pulse-and-geomagnetic-disturbance">from electromagnetic pulse, or EMP, attacks</a>. President Joe Biden also <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">issued an executive order in 2021</a> to improve the nation’s cybersecurity with 55 new requirements, <a href="https://fedscoop.com/cybersecurity-executive-order-requirements-gao-omb-cisa/">almost all of which have now been completed</a>. (That executive order is also what led CISA to pick CrowdStrike as the federal government’s endpoint security partner.) And this year, following <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-technology-colorado-donald-trump-voting-95b862c0cb66aac446a213aace504776">a series of breaches</a> during the 2020 midterm elections, CISA also launched a program to bolster election security, including protections for non-voting systems, like voter registration databases.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That just represents a handful of the federal government’s efforts to avoid a catastrophic cyberattack or outage. And the cybersecurity industry <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/tmo/cybersecurity/worldwide#revenue">is growing in lockstep</a> with increasing anxiety about such a disaster. Spending on cybersecurity rose about 70 percent from 2019 to 2023, <a href="https://www.moodys.com/web/en/us/about/insights/data-stories/2023-cyber-survey-highlights.html">according to Moody’s</a>, and the rise of generative AI <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-02-22-gartner-identifies-top-cybersecurity-trends-for-2024">will only complicate the picture</a> in the years to come. The 2024 election cycle <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-robocalls-artificial-intelligence-new-hampshire-texas-a8665277d43d05380d2c7594edf27617">has already seen AI-generated robocalls</a> that mimicked President Biden’s voice and told people not to vote, which does not sound as frightening as a cyberattack bringing down a power plant, but is an attack on democracy nevertheless.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The big one is still out there, lurking in some unknown future, waiting for the right string of events to occur and lead to catastrophe. Some of the worst nightmare scenarios have actually already happened, only not at a global scale. Ransomware attacks on hospitals and health care providers that threaten lives <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/change-healthcare-22-million-payment-ransomware-spike/">are a regular occurrence</a> in the US these days. After <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/03/inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid/">taking out a portion of Ukraine’s power grid</a> with a cyberattack in 2015 and 2016, Russia <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/russia-ukraine-frostygoop-malware-heating-utility/">used a novel cyberattack</a> to cut the heat to 600 buildings in the Ukrainian city of Lviv this past January. So far, and very luckily, we have not seen a cyberattack lead to a nuclear disaster, but <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/27/europe/chernobyl-cyber-attack/index.html">such a thing</a> is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/04/sellafield-nuclear-site-hacked-groups-russia-china">not out</a> of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-15/us-national-lab-nuclear-waste-site-hit-by-cyberattack?sref=qYiz2hd0">the realm of possibility</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“So I just rewatched <em>Chernobyl</em> last week,” Atwood said, referring to <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/6/4/18647339/chernobyl-finale-hbo-truth-how-accurate">the HBO series</a> about the 1986 nuclear disaster. “And that was one of the key lines: Why worry about something that hasn’t happened yet?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s how some cybersecurity executives think about the unimaginable, he told me, even when their own employees are warning against it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If we’ve learned anything from the past week — or even the past decade — it’s that the scale of outages and cyberattacks is getting larger as the world depends more on internet-connected devices to run itself. There’s no better time than now to reconsider whether we’re doing enough to stop the next one.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A little more than a year ago, in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/22-506_nmip.pdf"><em>Biden v. Nebraska</em></a> (2023), the Supreme Court struck down one of the Biden administration’s student loan forgiveness plans. The Court’s decision took <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/6/30/23779903/supreme-court-student-loan-biden-nebraska-john-roberts">extraordinary liberties with the law</a>, misreading a statute that clearly authorized the plan and relying on a doctrine known as “major questions.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The major questions doctrine, as I’ve <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/23791610/supreme-court-major-questions-doctrine-nebraska-biden-student-loans-gorsuch-barrett">previously explained at length</a>, has no basis in any federal statute or constitutional provision, and appears to be entirely made up by the Court’s right flank. Some defenders of the doctrine claim that it traces back to a <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/529/120/">2000 Supreme Court decision</a>, but the very strong version of the major questions doctrine that the Republican justices often invoke to block President Joe Biden’s policies <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/23791610/supreme-court-major-questions-doctrine-nebraska-biden-student-loans-gorsuch-barrett">did not emerge until he became president</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In applying the doctrine in <em>Nebraska</em>, however, the Court struck down just one of multiple programs the Biden administration created to reduce student loan burdens. Now, in a case known as <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A11/316401/20240705173618326_Alaska%20v%20Cardona%20Application%20to%20Vacate%20Stay%20final.pdf"><em>Alaska v. Cardona</em></a>, a trio of red-state attorneys general are asking the Supreme Court to neutralize much of a separate student loans plan which relies on an entirely different statute to justify its existence. (The “Cardona” in this case is Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The plan at issue in the <em>Alaska </em>case is known as the Saving on a Valuable Education or “SAVE” plan. <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A11/316401/20240705173618326_Alaska%20v%20Cardona%20Application%20to%20Vacate%20Stay%20final.pdf">Estimates of its costs vary</a>, and they range from $137.9 billion over the course of a decade to about three times that amount. Republicans <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/03/28/student-loan-lawsuit-save-repayment-plan/">object to the cost of the SAVE plan</a>. The plaintiffs challenging the plan rely heavily on <em>Nebraska</em>, and on the major questions doctrine at the heart of that case, in their <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A11/316401/20240705173618326_Alaska%20v%20Cardona%20Application%20to%20Vacate%20Stay%20final.pdf">brief to the justices</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <em>Alaska</em> case arises on the Court’s “<a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/8/11/21356913/supreme-court-shadow-docket-jail-asylum-covid-immigrants-sonia-sotomayor-barnes-ahlman">shadow docket</a>,” a mix of emergency motions and other matters which the Court can decide on an expedited basis. So a decision in the <em>Alaska</em> case will probably be handed down soon.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In its <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A11/318299/20240717143843099_24A11%20Alaska%20Opp%20FINAL.pdf">brief to the justices</a>, the Biden administration offers a few persuasive reasons why the Court should stay its hand. But, frankly, after <em>Nebraska</em>, it is difficult to determine whether legal arguments play any role in the student loans cases the Supreme Court takes. The decision in <em>Nebraska</em> was <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/23791610/supreme-court-major-questions-doctrine-nebraska-biden-student-loans-gorsuch-barrett">so egregious</a> — so <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/6/30/23779903/supreme-court-student-loan-biden-nebraska-john-roberts">lacking in respect for statutory text</a> — that it’s far from clear whether any student loans plan created by this Democratic administration can receive a fair hearing in this GOP-controlled Supreme Court.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s at stake in <em>Alaska?</em></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The immediate stakes in the <em>Alaska</em> case are somewhat smaller than those in <em>Nebraska</em>. The program at issue in the latter case would have outright <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/6/30/23779903/supreme-court-student-loan-biden-nebraska-john-roberts">canceled at least $10,000 in student loans</a> for student borrowers who earned less than $125,000 a year. The program at issue in <em>Alaska</em>, the SAVE plan, is more complicated. It has three parts, and only one of those parts is currently before the justices (although challenges to the other two parts are likely to make their way up to the Court eventually).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The SAVE plan <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A11/318299/20240717143843099_24A11%20Alaska%20Opp%20FINAL.pdf">makes three significant changes</a> to something known as “income contingent repayment plans.” Under these plans, a certain amount of every borrower’s income is protected from student loan repayments.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before the SAVE plan, a borrower earning up to 150 percent of the federal poverty rate (about $22,000 for a single person with no dependents) did not have to make student loan payments. And borrowers who earned more than this amount could subtract the amount from their income when determining how much they owed. The SAVE plan increases the amount of income protected from student loan repayments to 225 percent of the poverty rate (or just under $33,000 a year for a single-income earner with no dependents).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Additionally, before the SAVE plan, student loan repayments were capped at 10 percent of each borrower’s remaining income. The SAVE plan lowers that cap to 5 percent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, before the SAVE plan, borrowers could have their loans forgiven after making payments for 20 to 25 years. The SAVE plan accelerates this schedule, allowing some borrowers to have their loans forgiven after only 10 years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The specific issue before the Supreme Court right now is whether the second of these three changes — the decision to lower the cap from 10 percent to 5 percent — is authorized by federal law. The other two parts of the SAVE plan are likely to come before the justices eventually.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The biggest obstacle to the SAVE plan is the Court’s decision in <em>Nebraska</em></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To defend the provision of the SAVE plan at issue in <em>Alaska</em>, the Biden administration primarily points to a federal law that provides that income-contingent loans “shall require payments that <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1087e">vary in relation to the appropriate portion of the annual income of the borrower</a> (and the borrower’s spouse, if applicable) as determined by the Secretary.” That language provides strong support for the proposition that the secretary of Education, and not the Supreme Court, gets to determine what percentage of a borrower’s income must be repaid each year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In <em>Nebraska</em>, however, the six Republican justices in the majority seemed to divorce its analysis of student loan policy entirely from the text of federal law.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The student loan policy in <em>Nebraska</em> was authorized by a law known as the <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-117/pdf/STATUTE-117-Pg904.pdf#page=1">Heroes Act</a>, which gives the Education secretary broad authority to “waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision applicable to the student financial assistance programs &#8230; as the Secretary deems necessary in connection with a war or other military operation or national emergency.” The Biden administration pointed to the Covid pandemic as a “national emergency” that triggered the Heroes Act.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This one provision of the Heroes Act alone should have been enough to justify the student loan forgiveness program at issue in <em>Nebraska</em>, but that law also contained other provisions which <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/6/30/23779903/supreme-court-student-loan-biden-nebraska-john-roberts">should have removed any doubt</a> that the Education secretary had the power to create the loan forgiveness program that the Republican justices struck down.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Among other things, the Heroes Act waived a lengthy process known as “notice and comment” that federal agencies normally must undergo before changing federal policy. It provided that the secretary may dole out loan forgiveness <em>en masse</em> (“the Secretary is not required to exercise the waiver or modification authority under this section on a case-by-case basis”). And the Heroes Act also instructed courts not to interpret other federal statutes to limit the secretary’s loan forgiveness authority unless that statute was “enacted with specific reference to” the Heroes Act.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s hard to imagine a statute, in other words, which more clearly signaled that the secretary should be allowed to cancel student loans during a national emergency, regardless of whether the political party that controls the Supreme Court agreed with the secretary’s decision.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, <em>Nebraska</em> reached the implausible conclusion that the student loan forgiveness program at issue in that case was not authorized by the Heroes Act. It also claimed that the program violated the so-called “major questions” doctrine.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The major questions doctrine — which, again, <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/23791610/supreme-court-major-questions-doctrine-nebraska-biden-student-loans-gorsuch-barrett">appears in no law or constitutional provision</a> and was made up entirely by recent Supreme Court decisions — provides that Congress must “<a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/6/30/23779903/supreme-court-student-loan-biden-nebraska-john-roberts">speak clearly</a> if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast ‘economic and political significance.’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The student loan forgiveness program in <em>Nebraska</em> would have wiped out hundreds of billions of dollars in student loan debt, so it plausibly concerned a matter of great economic significance. But even if one concedes this point, it’s still hard to conceive of a statute that speaks more clearly than the Heroes Act.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Congress gave the secretary broad authority. It waived the normal procedural constraints on the secretary. It explicitly gave him or her the power to dole out relief to many borrowers at a time. And it forbade courts from reading any federal statute to limit the secretary’s authority unless that statute specifically mentioned the Heroes Act.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <em>Nebraska</em> decision, in other words, was so poorly reasoned that it raises serious questions about whether the Republican justices were interpreting the law in good faith. And that doesn’t bode well for the alternative student loans plan at issue in <em>Alaska</em>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are the best arguments for the plan at issue in <em>Alaska</em>?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Again, federal law provides that the Education secretary may determine the “appropriate portion of the annual income of the borrower” that should be repaid. That language provides very strong support for the student loan plan currently before the Court.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s also some doubt about whether the Court has jurisdiction over this case to begin with. No federal court may hear a lawsuit challenging a federal policy unless the plaintiff can show that they were injured in some way by that policy. The red-state plaintiffs essentially argue that they are injured because the SAVE plan will cause some borrowers who owe money to those states to pay back those loans more quickly, depriving the states of interest on the loans. (For complicated reasons, the states would be fully reimbursed, even if the borrower has a portion of their loans canceled.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it’s far from clear that a state is injured by having a loan repaid early — if the state wishes to earn interest income, it can always invest the repaid money in something else that pays interest. As the Biden administration says in its brief, “<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A11/318299/20240717143843099_24A11%20Alaska%20Opp%20FINAL.pdf">full repayment ‘would ordinarily be cause for celebration, not a lawsuit.’</a>”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, the Biden administration points to one significant difference between the SAVE plan and the plan at issue in <em>Nebraska</em>. In <em>Nebraska</em>, the Supreme Court faulted the Biden administration for creating what it claimed was a “<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/22-506_nmip.pdf">novel and fundamentally different loan forgiveness program</a>” than anything that had previously existed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The SAVE plan, by contrast, does not create a novel program. It takes an existing program that capped student loan payments and exempted a certain amount of income from loan repayments, and simply lowered the cap and increased the amount of the exemption.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Will these arguments be enough to rescue the SAVE plan? Maybe in a Court that is interested in following the law. After <em>Nebraska</em>, however, it is far from clear that this Court cares to do so.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you listen to venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz explain why they’re <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361087/trump-silicon-valley-fundraising-musk-andreessen-horowitz">supporting Donald Trump</a>, between the discussions of crypto and China and AI, you’ll detect a much more conventional reason for rich people to vote Republican: They’re <a href="https://youtu.be/n_sNclEgQZQ?si=77NENqin8HawDMEX&amp;t=3832">worried about Democrats raising their taxes</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Specifically, Andreessen and Horowitz railed against President Joe Biden’s proposed Billionaires Minimum Income Tax, which they claimed would destroy the startup ecosystem in Silicon Valley. They aren’t alone: <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/taxing-unrealized-gains-would-obliterate-us-economy">Finance</a> and <a href="https://x.com/mansourtarek_/status/1783936485936316778">tech</a> <a href="https://x.com/Austen/status/1783254353274638346">commentators</a> have been furious since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/28/biden-announces-billionaire-minimum-income-tax">Biden first unveiled the plan in 2022</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Billionaires oppose tax increase” has a certain “dog bites man” quality to it as a story. But this particular iteration viscerally annoys me. For one thing, Andreessen and Horowitz are complaining about a tax that not only is dead on arrival in Congress but one that the Supreme Court, just a couple weeks ago, <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/355969/supreme-court-moore-us-wealth-tax-billionaires">implied would be unconstitutional</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The plan is going nowhere. They’ve won. Stop gloating!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">My other beef is that I think the minimum tax was mostly a good idea. It represented the <a href="https://equitablegrowth.org/taxing-wealth-by-taxing-investment-income-an-introduction-to-mark-to-market-taxation/">culmination of decades of scholarship</a> from economists and tax law experts attempting to address a serious problem with the way the US currently taxes income from selling stocks, real estate, and other assets.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Luckily, I think there are other options to solve the problems that the proposal was meant to solve, options that might not face quite the same resistance and would pass constitutional muster.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The problem with normal capital gains taxes</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When you buy something for one price, and later sell it for a higher price, that’s called a “capital gain.” In tax lingo, you “realize” a capital gain when you ultimately sell the asset. If the asset gains in value without you selling it (e.g., a stock you own rises in price), those gains are “unrealized.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The capital gains tax in the US has a “realization requirement”: You have to actually sell the asset to be taxed. This creates an easy way for rich people to avoid taxes, by simply waiting to sell.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Imagine a 20-something who starts an internet company called FriendCo with his college roommates. Let’s call him Mark. (While I’m obviously basing Mark on somebody real, I’m going to simplify the real numbers a lot to make it easier to follow.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At FriendCo’s founding in 2004, Mark and his four roommates each took 10 percent of the company, with the other half to be sold to investors. At the start, their shares were worth $0. But their website took off fast and soon had 1 billion users. The company went public in 2012, at a market value of $100 billion. Mark and his roommates’ shares were worth $10 billion each.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At this point, the company stands still and remains worth $100 billion forevermore (I told you I was going to simplify).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Mark sells all his shares in 2012 after the company goes public, he’d pay taxes on the amount that the shares increased. They were worth $0 at first, and are now worth $10 billion. The top rate on capital gains in the US is 23.8 percent, so he’d pay $2.38 billion in taxes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Suppose, instead, Mark decides to keep all his shares until he retires 40 years later, in 2052. Assuming the tax code doesn’t change, he’d still pay $2.38 billion. That, right there, is the problem.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Being able to pay a tax bill decades in the future, instead of right now, is a <em>huge</em> benefit. If I told my landlord that I would prefer to pay my rent 40 years from now, she would not find that very amusing. At the very least she would demand that I pay a <em>lot</em> of interest for paying so late. Other big purchases, like houses and cars, usually <em>do</em> involve paying a ton of interest in exchange for later payments. Capital gains taxes don’t.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The “realization requirement” of the capital gains tax thus functions like a massive, zero-interest government loan to people who’ve gained money on their investments. They’re able to save huge sums in taxes merely by waiting to sell their assets, and not paying any interest while they wait.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is unfair; if you can afford to wait and not sell, you get a big tax break, but if you can’t afford that, you don’t. But the rule can also cause serious economic harm. By pushing people to hold onto investments longer than they normally would, it keeps them from moving their money to newer investments. That makes it harder for startups and other innovative firms to get the money they need to grow, leading to less innovation and slower economic growth.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The problem is compounded by other aspects of the US tax code. If Mark were to never sell his shares and instead pass them along to his children, they would not have to pay capital gains tax on the gain. In fact, if they were to later sell the shares, they would only pay tax on the difference between the value of the shares when they sell, and the value <em>when they inherited them</em>. (This is called “step-up in basis” or, more evocatively, the “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1987/06/25/the-angel-of-death-loophole/5a42296d-982b-4517-a13a-c89ba270f52d/">angel of death loophole</a>.”) So if the shares remain at $10 billion, the children can sell them and not pay a dime in capital gains tax. The rich are <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/more-than-half-of-americas-100-richest-people-exploit-special-trusts-to-avoid-estate-taxes">talented at evading the estate tax</a>, too, so it’s very possible that Mark’s fortune will be completely untaxed.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How the Biden minimum tax tries to fix the problem</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/131/General-Explanations-FY2023.pdf#page=40">Biden proposal</a> is meant to make the ultra-rich pay more. The strategy is simple: get rid of the realization rule.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For people with over $100 million in assets, the proposal would put in place a new tax regime. For easily sold assets with clear prices, like stocks and bonds and crypto, gains in value would be taxed during the year they happen, whether or not the assets are actually sold. Taxpayers would be able to get refunds if the assets later fell in value.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Andreessen, Horowitz, and other Silicon Valley types fret about what this would mean for startup founders whose companies haven’t gone public yet. These founders may be billionaires on paper but do not have any actual cash with which to pay taxes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If these VCs had read <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/131/General-Explanations-FY2023.pdf#page=40">the fine print of the plan</a>, they’d see that someone in this situation <em>would not have to pay taxes yet</em>. If more than 80 percent of a person’s net worth is in “illiquid assets” like private company shares, they would not have to pay annual tax on those assets. If they sold the assets, they’d pay the tax plus a “deferral charge,” a kind of interest for paying the tax years after they gained the money. Should the company go public or be acquired, the situation would change — but also the newly minted billionaire would suddenly have liquid assets with which to pay their tax bill.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is all somewhat academic, though, after the Supreme Court’s June 20 ruling in<em> </em><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-800_jg6o.pdf"><em>Moore v. United States</em></a>. While the decision itself concerned a minor provision in the Trump tax cuts, one justice, Amy Coney Barrett, wrote a concurring opinion arguing that realization is required for a capital gains tax to be constitutional. As my colleague <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/355969/supreme-court-moore-us-wealth-tax-billionaires">Ian Millhiser notes</a>, Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s majority opinion hinted pretty strongly that he’d side with Barrett on the matter, while deferring on a ruling for now.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the Barrett view has at least five supporters on the Supreme Court, then the Billionaire Minimum Income Tax is dead in the water.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A more modest approach</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, the minimum tax will likely never make it to the Supreme Court. Republicans control the House and aren’t voting to raise taxes on billionaires. The Biden administration failed to even get a much more modest capital tax hike passed in 2021–22, when they had a narrow Congressional majority. That plan would’ve <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-04/biden-tax-rule-would-rip-billions-from-biggest-fortunes-at-death?embedded-checkout=true">gotten rid of the angel of death loophole</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-seek-backup-plan-on-taxing-capital-gains-11631893650">internal Democratic opposition</a> in Congress killed the idea. I do not know of a single honest defense of the angel of death loophole, but unfortunately there are many deeply dishonest defenses. Former Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) spent much of 2021 claiming that <a href="https://doubledeathtax.org/heidi-heitkamp-launches-saving-americas-family-enterprises-safe/">realization at death would obliterate family farms in the Plains</a>, for which she offered literally zero evidence. Alas, the gambit worked.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In theory, though, a future Congress could still close the loophole. They could go further still and pass law professors Edward Fox and Zachary Liscow’s plan to <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4716197">tax the loans billionaires currently use</a> to generate tax-free cash. The most ambitious option would be to <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2979583">add deferral charges to the capital gains tax</a>, so the rich have to pay the government interest when they defer taxes by not selling their assets.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of which is to say: There are a lot of ways to raise revenue from America’s billionaire class. And none of them pose any of the risks to innovation or startups, whatever you hear about from the likes of Andreessen.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For more than two years, the US poultry industry has been battling a highly virulent strain of avian influenza, or bird flu. The virus has driven up egg and turkey prices and crossed over from infecting just birds to numerous mammalian species, including sea lions, mice, cats, dairy cows, and, increasingly, humans. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And it shows no signs of stopping — only reaching new milestones. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first milestone reached this month concerns the birds themselves. Last week, a Weld County, Colorado, farm that housed 1.3 million egg-laying hens detected bird flu and, per <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/depopulationpolicy.pdf">federal policy</a>, was forced to kill the whole flock in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. Those 1.3 million dead birds tipped the total number of chickens and turkeys killed during this outbreak to over 100 million — double the total from the <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/media/document/2086/file#:~:text=Approximately%207.4%20million%20turkeys%20and,as%20part%20of%20the%20response.">previous outbreak</a> in 2014 and 2015.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The second milestone concerns us humans. Earlier in July, bird flu was detected on an even bigger farm — housing 1.78 million hens — in the same Colorado county as the first farm. A crew of some <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/chicken-culling-disposal-raise-concern-bird-flu-spreads-2024-07-18/">150 workers</a> were deployed to kill the hens. They were given goggles and masks for protection, but the 104-degree heat combined with strong industrial fans in the barns made it <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/colorado-workers-with-bird-flu-toiled-high-heat-without-sufficient-protective-2024-07-16/">difficult</a> for the gear to work effectively.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2024/07/20/colorado-bird-flu-sixth-case/7391721505676/">Six</a> workers contracted the virus, which made it the single most infectious bird flu event for humans in US history, more than doubling the number of Americans who had contracted the virus since April 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/WAM22828.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.70228295175,100,78.5954340965" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Workers remove their biohazard suits after culling ducks at a farm in Ontario, Canada, in 2022. | Jo-Anne McArthur/We Animals Media" data-portal-copyright="Jo-Anne McArthur/We Animals Media" />
<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON512">Around half</a> of the nearly 900 people who’ve fallen ill to H5N1 globally since the early 2000s have died, though the variant circulating during this outbreak has proven quite mild in humans. Patients in Colorado and elsewhere have reported pink eye, fever, and coughing, and the Centers for Disease Control maintains that the risk to the American public <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/p-0715-confirm-h5.html">remains low</a>. I spoke with four bird flu experts who generally agree with that risk assessment, but with some important caveats, which brings us to the third milestone.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of those experts said that, based on <a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/avian-flu-infects-two-more-colorado-poultry-cullers-one-second-farm">genetic sequencing</a> from one of the sickened farmworkers, the strain of the virus that infected all those hens and workers is <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/07/22/bird-flu-infects-colorado-poultry-workers-related-to-h5n1-in-cows/">related</a> to a strain that’s been circulating in cows. That means the strain is more infectious for other mammals — like humans — than a normal poultry H5N1 virus.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I don&#8217;t think it is a coincidence that several people were infected with this version of the virus, which has adapted to cows,” said <a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/philip-s-meade">Philip Meade</a>, a microbiologist at Mount Sinai Health System.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This doesn’t mean a bird flu pandemic is on the horizon. For that to happen, the virus would have to evolve in such a way that it effectively transmits from human to human and causes more severe symptoms, which may never happen. But that’s the bedeviling nature of bird flu — it’s <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/09/bird-flu-upends-avian-influenza-dogma/">highly unpredictable</a>. Tom Peacock, a virologist fellow at the Pirbright Institute, which researches livestock diseases, said the risk level remains low “until it suddenly isn’t,” in the event that the virus adapts to transmit between people. That it’s circulating among cows increases the possibility that it could occur.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Is bird flu here to stay?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That the virus has been spreading in the US for over two years also raises the question as to whether it’s endemic, meaning it circulates year-round.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Experts told me it’s highly likely that it’s already endemic in wild birds, the original reservoir for the virus, who spread it to poultry farms in the spring and fall during migration. In <a href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/news/avian-flu-cases-decline-europe-surveillance-recommended-view-upcoming-season">Europe</a>, which has experienced a steep decline in bird flu outbreaks on poultry farms this year, wild birds seem to have gained some immunity from the virus, which could happen here too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the persistence of H5N1 in the US during the summer months suggests that a “decent proportion” of recent poultry outbreaks, according to Peacock, seem to be caused by the cattle strain, which he described as a major change.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The concern here is that the virus can maintain a transmission cycle involving cattle — which don&#8217;t usually die or sometimes even develop noticeable symptoms from bird flu — creating a reservoir from which the virus could mutate unfavorably or cause human outbreaks,” said <a href="https://andersen-lab.com/people/">Brady Page</a>, an infectious disease research fellow at the Scripps Research Institute.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In short, we could be entering some kind of bird flu doom loop, in which it has multiple reservoirs to infect farmed birds, and can more readily adapt to infect mammals.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That the threat level is on the rise is also a damning indictment of the US Department of Agriculture’s <a href="https://www.agriculture.com/usda-aims-to-isolate-exhaust-h5n1-virus-in-dairy-herds-8657880">sclerotic response</a> to the virus, which has drawn <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24140017/milk-bird-flu-safe-dairy-usda-fda">sharp criticism</a> from the infectious disease research community.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bird flu first began to infect dairy cows late last year, but it wasn’t detected until late March. The USDA then took several weeks to upload critical data about the virus. It also didn’t mandate routine testing of dairy cows, and farms with positive H5N1 tests weren’t required to report them — a move that hamstrung <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24140017/milk-bird-flu-safe-dairy-usda-fda">scientists’ efforts to track and prevent the spread</a>. It took a month for the agency to at least require testing before cows crossed state lines, and there’s no proactive effort to test large numbers of farm workers. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The response is in line with the USDA’s deferential relationship to industry and explains in part how we got here. The USDA has resisted calls to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24155545/bird-flu-vaccines-h5n1-avian-flu-cows">vaccinate poultry birds</a> because it would disrupt trade agreements, and thus the industry’s bottom line. The USDA also helped build the modern factory farming system, which provides the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/4/22/21228158/coronavirus-pandemic-risk-factory-farming-meat">perfect conditions</a> for viruses to spread: hundreds to thousands of weak, genetically identical animals packed together in unsanitary barns.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/WAM30758.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A young turkey on a farm in Israel is sprayed with firefighting foam to kill the flock during a 2016 bird flu outbreak in the country. | Roee Shpernik/Glass Walls/We Animals Media" data-portal-copyright="Roee Shpernik/Glass Walls/We Animals Media" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">“We should treat potential pandemic threats like this virus with the same seriousness that we apply to our national defense,” said Meade, the Mount Sinai researcher. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If we don’t, we’ll have a harder time breaking out of the bird flu doom loop. Without a vigorous response to contain the virus — and sober reflections on the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24128700/bird-fludairy-meat-industry-h5n1-cows-milk-eggs-safety">pandemic risk</a> posed by America’s meat industry — we’re likely to see more and more farmed birds <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23963820/bird-flu-surge-us-ventilation-shutdown-veterinarians">dying horrible deaths</a>, more sickened cows, higher food prices, and an increased threat that we spark the next pandemic.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Five years ago, standing in front of a crowd of some 20,000 people in Oakland, California, Kamala Harris announced that she was running for president. “My whole life, I’ve only had one client: the people,” she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now that President Biden has dropped out of the race and Harris has become the presumptive Democratic nominee, it’s fair to start asking what, exactly, she plans to do for her client if she wins in November. Despite Harris’s long career and remarkable rise in politics — she has served as the San Francisco district attorney, California’s attorney general, US senator, and, most recently, vice president — it’s still difficult to predict what her campaign, let alone presidency, will look like.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although Harris has been vice president for three years and ran a presidential campaign in the 2020 cycle, she’s managed to avoid being neatly pigeonholed into any ideological box. Unlike candidates Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, who are easily remembered for their Medicare-for-all or wealth-tax proposals, Harris’s 2020 campaign fizzled out with few, if any, policy ideas or slogans being closely associated with it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At any point in her two-decade political career, she could fit the description of a number of “types” of Democrat: centrist, moderate, progressive, liberal, establishment, or outsider. But besides her “<a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/kamala-harris-wrote-a-good-book-about">smart-on-crime</a>” identity, none of those labels has ever effectively captured her way of thinking or how she would govern as president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That might have been by design. “Policy has to be relevant,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/27/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020-election.html">Harris told the New York Times in 2019</a>. “That’s my guiding principle: Is it relevant? Not, ‘Is it a beautiful sonnet?’”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her allies and those who have worked with her in the past describe her as a pragmatist — a fact that makes it hard for the public and press to decipher her vision for the nation.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>President Joe Biden endorsed Kamala Harris for president. Here’s what to know about her.</strong></h2>

</ul>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This may be the best way to understand Harris: She doesn’t necessarily <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151127005330/https://modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/the-unstoppable-rise-of-kamala-harris">believe in a big ideological mission</a> to remake government or society, but instead considers government as a tool to concretely help improve the lives of as many people as possible, as quickly as possible, through practical means, like lowering the cost of medication, expanding access to broadband internet, and fixing roads and bridges. Aiming at smaller targets can effect change to bigger&nbsp;interconnected problems, like lowering inflation, expanding access to health care, and protecting reproductive rights.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“She thinks about policy and law not from a place of the words on a page, but the ways in which those words impact the lives of everyday people,” said Democratic California Sen. Laphonza Butler, a longtime adviser and friend to Harris. “She tends to see gaps and see around corners and make sure that the policy can work for everyone.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A 2015 profile of her in San Francisco Magazine underscored that incrementalist approach. “I don’t admire grand gestures,” Harris <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151127005330/https://modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/the-unstoppable-rise-of-kamala-harris">was quoted as saying</a>. “I admire goal achievement.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What those goals are, exactly, has remained unclear throughout her career. Even as recently as her last run for president, they weren’t entirely defined: As one person who sat in on a meeting with Harris about whether she should run later <a href="https://x.com/IsaacDovere/status/1815412205522719095/photo/1">put it</a>, “We launched into a void, without a worldview,” the journalist Edward-Isaac Dovere has reported.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Harris hits the campaign trail anew, many more voters will want to hear what her vision for the country is beyond defeating Donald Trump.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, what does Harris actually want to achieve if she makes it to the Oval Office?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Harris’s 2020 campaign gave voters an incomplete picture</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the last election cycle, Harris’s career as a prosecutor seemed to guide much of her campaign: Her <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/kamala-harris-prosecutor-for-the-people/">slogan</a> — “Kamala Harris, for the people”<em> </em>— was how <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/26/kamala-harris-2020-oakland-1128563">she introduced herself in court</a>; her ads focused on her <a href="https://x.com/KamalaHarris/status/1197243216132804608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1197243216132804608%7Ctwgr%5E341a78b4244eb8e416847db91740560bc1295366%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rollingstone.com%2Fpolitics%2Fpolitics-news%2Fkamala-harris-trump-attack-ad-viral-1235064809%2F">record prosecuting sexual predators</a>, banks, and big corporations; and her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/kamala-harris-prosecute-trump.html">promise to Democratic voters</a> was that she’d be the best candidate to “prosecute the case” against Donald Trump in 2020.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But as she campaigned, Harris’s messaging on policy was often muddied. She supported big ideas like Medicare-for-all, on the one hand, but emphasized that she’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/27/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020-election.html">“not trying to restructure society”</a> on the other.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of her policy positions were also never clear, in part because she flip-flopped on several occasions. There were multiple times, for example, when she seemed to support abolishing private health insurance while campaigning on Medicare-for-all, but she <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/kamala-harris-walks-back-her-hand-moment-health-insurance-democratic-n1024756">walked back on that position when pressed</a> on whether her plan would leave room for private insurers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In one high-profile moment during the campaign, she went after Biden’s record on desegregation during a debate, skewering him for opposing court-ordered school busing programs in the 1970s. But in the days after her attack on Biden, Harris gave <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/harriss-views-on-busing-come-under-question-after-her-debate-criticism-of-bidens-past-position/2019/07/04/b197c6cc-9e71-11e9-b27f-ed2942f73d70_story.html#">only vague answers</a> about whether she supported federally mandated busing, leaving many to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/us/politics/kamala-harris-biden-busing.html">wonder whether there was actually any daylight</a> between her position and Biden’s.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Aides who have worked with her in the past chalk some of this up to Harris’s “literalism” — what they say is a focus on the lived experience of the people who elected her and how policies and stances may need to change with the times or as reality sets in.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“She’s someone who thinks about the user experience of government, how it works, how it operates, how people are experiencing it, and she wants to make it better in literal ways, as opposed to theory,” said Daniel Suvor, who served as Harris’s chief of policy when she was California attorney general.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There was, however, at least one clear and consistent message throughout her 2020 campaign: that she was the best candidate to defeat Trump in that cycle. And while defeating Trump might not be a long-term agenda, it’s also not necessarily an insufficient reason to run for the presidency. After all, that’s what Biden repeatedly said <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-motivated-joe-biden-to-run-for-president">inspired him to run</a> in 2020 and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/biden-says-he-has-to-run-for-president-because-trump-is-running/">again in 2024</a>. And if Trump does indeed pose a long-term threat to democracy, then beating him at the ballot box can be a legacy-defining achievement in and of itself.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What does Harris’s vice presidency tell us about her priorities?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Harris struggled to define herself during the 2020 primaries, accepting the offer to serve as vice president only made that struggle <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/517325-kamala-harris-from-historic-to-invisible/">harder</a>. Early on, there were signs that Biden might want to empower his number two and make her a governing partner, as he said he would&nbsp;during the campaign. His pre-election talk about being a “bridge” to a new generation of leaders also cemented the idea that his vice president might be primed to be his successor.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it quickly looked like Harris would be sidelined — and that’s what the public and press eventually assumed occurred. Questions swirled around what her portfolio would include. Harris ended up doing a little bit of everything, contributing to the sense of ambiguity and that her <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/14/politics/kamala-harris-frustrating-start-vice-president/index.html">tenure suffered from a lack of focus</a>. She asked for one specific priority (voting rights) and received another more nebulous task (addressing <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361635/kamala-harris-border-czar-immigration-mexico-guatemala-rnc">root causes</a> of migration).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first priority was easy to define: securing the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/president-biden-taps-vice-president-harris-lead-efforts-pass-voting">passage</a> of the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. She <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/magazine/kamala-harris.html">reportedly</a> made the decision to focus on this task after spending time talking to other Black leaders in the Democratic Party, including those focused on ballot access and voting rights, such as Stacey Abrams.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s when she made a departure from the pragmatism that had previously defined her, despite the grim odds of the legislation passing in a tied Senate, let alone breaking a filibuster with 60 votes. She saw voter access as an issue that could unite various factions of the Democratic Party, and on which she could carry on the party’s legacy of fighting for civil rights — meaningful given her own historic place as the first Black woman vice president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She was warned about the low chances of this kind of legislation passing, but still, she <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/15/harris-voting-rights-push-527186">tried</a>, meeting with various activist groups and advocates to build popular support. Her work on Capitol Hill&nbsp;was more limited as the president himself tried to lobby senators. Despite an emotional <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/11/us/biden-harris-voting-rights">last-minute push</a>, the chance of abolishing the filibuster was essentially zero, killing the effort.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her second priority, pegged to immigration, came as an assignment she did not ask for: leading diplomatic efforts and engagement with the countries of Mexico and the Northern Triangle to address the root causes of migration. It was essentially the same assignment Biden had received from Barack Obama eight years before, but it quickly spun into a greater political mess,&nbsp;one that will continue to be a vulnerability for Harris in the general election.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The task was diplomatic, neither focused on border security nor the immediate response to the influx of migrants and people seeking asylum. But that <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361635/kamala-harris-border-czar-immigration-mexico-guatemala-rnc">distinction</a> was muddled by the press, Republicans and the right, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/4/1/22359917/biden-border-mixed-messaging-crisis">even</a> the White House.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Things changed for Harris when the <em>Dobbs </em>decision overturned <em>Roe v. Wade </em>and eliminated the constitutional right to abortion. The vice president&nbsp;quickly seized on the issue, talking naturally and practically about the decision’s real-world implications —&nbsp;in large part because it dealt with two constituencies she has always prioritized: mothers and children, a former Harris adviser said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She traveled to battleground and Republican-run states, explained the ties between abortion rights and other reproductive and individual rights, and became the administration’s point person on the issue. Harris’s thinking and strategizing on how to talk about reproductive rights in the aftermath of the <em>Dobbs</em> decision also fit the larger theme of how she thinks about policies and initiatives: considering who is affected, and how long it will take to achieve justice. And it will be a centerpiece of the campaign she runs now.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What would a Harris presidency look like?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What Harris’s career has made clear is that she’s more likely to pursue incremental progress than big, ambitious ideas. That’s why if elected, it’s likely that her administration would simply be an extension of the current one rather than a disruption.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the campaign trail this week, several priorities have come into focus, with the economy and affordability still at the top of the list. Harris continues to talk about prioritizing the middle class, just as Biden did: “Building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency,” Harris said at her first major campaign rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on Tuesday. “When our middle class is strong, America is strong.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To support that swath of Americans, improving the care economy — those services that focus on children and the elderly — could be one of the major policy areas she may come to prioritize.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She would zero in on a straightforward policy agenda, said Carmel Martin, who served as the vice president’s domestic policy adviser from 2022 to 2023:&nbsp;a focus on “economic progress while bringing down inflation, expanding access to services that people need — health care being at the front of the line — and protecting reproductive rights.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris has already shown signs of this focus, saying in a campaign address on Monday that she believes “in a future where no child has to grow up in poverty; where every person can buy a home, start a family, and build wealth; and where every person has access to paid family leave and affordable child care.” All of these stances are essentially what Biden has pitched before.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The fact that Harris has shown she’s not a hardened ideologue means that she can be swayed by political headwinds, giving social movements an opportunity to push various agendas.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of the country’s most transformational legislation, for example, didn’t come directly from presidents who were ideological hardliners, but rather from presidents who were willing to listen to social movements and public sentiment — as was the case during the Civil Rights Era.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Will Harris help or hurt the Democrats’ chances in November?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Usually, by the time a presidential candidate makes it to the general election after a grueling primary campaign, their policy priorities and ideology are relatively clear. Barack Obama, for example, offered a vision for a post-George W. Bush America —&nbsp;promising to end the US “forever” wars, address economic inequality, and unite the country around the common desire for hope and change. By contrast, Donald Trump offered a distinctly dark vision for the country, building a backlash coalition by injecting more racism and xenophobia into mainstream American politics.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2020, Biden was largely viewed as a centrist who campaigned on defending democracy and a return to normalcy after the rise of Trumpism and the devastating effects of a pandemic, specifically touting his vested interest in pursuing bipartisanship.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris, however, is starting a campaign essentially from scratch, without having gone through a primary process. As a result, voters haven’t been properly introduced to her as a candidate for the presidency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her lack of a clearly defined ideological position up to this point in her career might now prove an asset: She has a unique opportunity to reintroduce herself to the country and offer a new vision for the future.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What Harris does over the next few weeks will help to shape voters’ opinions of her. That doesn’t mean she can entirely evade her past — her <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/1/23/18184192/kamala-harris-president-campaign-criminal-justice-record">record as a prosecutor</a> will likely keep coming up — or that she won’t be haunted by past policy positions. For now, though, she’s likely to focus on Trump’s baggage and the danger he poses to democracy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The script writes itself: the prosecutor against the convicted felon,” California Sen. Alex Padilla said. “That&#8217;s what this race has become.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not as if no one was thinking about security issues when Paris was awarded this summer’s Olympics back in 2017. Just two years earlier, the French capital had been the scene of one of the worst terrorist attacks in European history, when Islamic State gunmen killed <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Paris-attacks-of-2015">more than 130 people</a>. That attack came only a few months after a massacre at the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo<em>. </em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then-French <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/17/world/europe/olympics-2024-paris.html">President François Hollande said</a> that when he was lobbying for the Olympics in 2016, he was asked by International Olympic Committee officials “whether Paris would be able to organize safe Games.” He made the case that not only would Paris be ready, but an Olympics in the City of Light would be the “most beautiful answer we could give to fundamentalism.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Seven years later, the Olympics are finally coming to Paris in a very different era with a very different landscape of security threats. While the attention of governments and the media has largely <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/352855/war-on-terror-biden-isis-al-qaeda">shifted away from terrorist groups like ISIS</a>, the group and its affiliates have demonstrated they can continue to carry out major attacks, including a <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2024/3/23/24109865/moscow-crocus-city-hall-theater-terrorist-attack-russia-isis-vladimir-putin-ukraine-war">horrific recent one in Moscow</a> with a death toll similar to what Paris suffered in 2015. The Olympics also take place against the backdrop of the October 7 attacks, Israel’s brutal war in Gaza, and a global surge in antisemitism, <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20240125-anti-semitic-acts-nearly-quadrupled-last-year-in-france-says-jewish-organisation">France very much included</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Olympics, which were originally <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22918000/beijing-olympics-world-peace-russia-ukraine-war">meant to mark a period of truce from war</a>, are also taking place in a Europe embroiled in the biggest armed conflict since WWII. The impact of the war in Ukraine will be visible during the competitions themselves: Russian and Belarusian athletes are barred from competing under their countries’ flags, though some will be present as “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/12/09/1218406353/russian-belarus-athletes-ioc-2024-olympic-games">individual neutral athletes</a>.” A recent string of mysterious events, including arson attacks, has also raised concerns that Russia could attempt to disrupt the games in retaliation for France and other Western countries’ support of Ukraine. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Olympics have been the target of political violence in the past – mostly famously the killing of 11 members of the Israeli team at the 1972 games in Munich by a Palestinian militant group and a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/04/13/eric.rudolph/">bombing by a right-wing anti-abortion extremist</a> at the 1996 games in Atlanta. Al-Qaeda was also known to have <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/al-qaeda-targeted-olympics-jews-court-20040520-gdiymj.html">planned to attack the 2000 Sydney Olympics</a> but ultimately didn’t follow through.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Large sporting events, with their massive crowds and built-in global media attention, will always present a tempting, if presumably well-defended target. Though it’s less remembered today than the slaughter at the Bataclan rock venue during the 2015 ISIS attacks in Paris, one terrorist attempted and failed to enter the Stade de France where 80,000 people including the French president were watching a France-Germany soccer match.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Not surprisingly, security levels at the Games are high with a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/paris-olympics-security-police-military-terrorism-34b168e7a511e22ce7119a91932d2759">heavy police and military presence </a>in Paris, as well as the controversial use of artificial intelligence technology for video surveillance. But notably, the opening ceremonies on Friday evening will be held for the <a href="https://olympics.com/en/news/paris-2024-olympic-games-opening-ceremony-all-you-need-to-know">first time outside a stadium</a>, with athletes parading in boats along the Seine. It promises to be a beautiful sight — but it will also be a security headache, set out across a sprawling metropolis rather than a closed and controlled location.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One US security official who spoke with Vox said that all Olympics pose their particular concerns, from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2012/07/26/sport/olympic-security-overview/index.html">terrorism in London in 2012</a> to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/weeks-from-olympic-games-rio-worries-about-rising-crime-police-cutbacks/2016/06/08/16343886-2c0b-11e6-b9d5-3c3063f8332c_story.html">crime during</a> Rio de Janeiro in 2016 to <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/10/05/national/2020-games-cyberattacks/">cyberattacks at the last summer games in Tokyo</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With Paris in 2024, the official said, “you have everything.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">ISIS: Down but not out</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In May, French police <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/french-officials-foil-olympics-terrorism-plot-/7638153.html">arrested an 18-year-old Chechen national</a> who was accused of plotting to attack a soccer game at the Paris Olympics, alleging that he “wanted to attack spectators, but also security forces and die as a martyr.” A month earlier, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sports/soccer/france-spain-tighten-security-champions-league-games-citing-islamic-state-2024-04-09/">security was tightened</a> at Champions League soccer games around the continent after ISIS threatened to launch drone attacks on the elite European club tournament.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s been no known comparable threat to the Olympics, but the attack on the Crocus Concert Hall near Moscow that killed <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2024/3/23/24109865/moscow-crocus-city-hall-theater-terrorist-attack-russia-isis-vladimir-putin-ukraine-war">more than 130 people in March</a> was a wake-up call to many officials: While greatly diminished, the threat from groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS has not disappeared. “If you can do Moscow, you can do Paris,” Gilles Kepel, a French expert on terrorism, <a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2024/04/29/beware-global-jihadists-are-back-on-the-march">told the Economist</a>.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Responsibility for the Moscow attack was claimed by Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K), the group’s Afghan affiliate in Afghanistan and Central Asia. (Khorasan is a historical name for a region that includes Afghanistan and parts of several neighboring countries.) In the years since the dismantling of ISIS’s territorial “caliphate” in parts of Syria and Iraq, ISIS-K has emerged as arguably the most dangerous and high-profile of the group’s global affiliates. It carried out a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-vows-revenge-after-biggest-attack-since-1979-revolution-2024-01-04/">bombing that killed more than 100 people</a> in Iran at the beginning of this year, as well as the attack in Kabul that killed 13 US troops and more than 100 Afghans during the chaotic evacuation of US personnel from Afghanistan. Authorities in Europe have broken up several alleged <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germany-charges-six-suspected-isis-k-members-over-attack-plots-2024-04-24/#:~:text=Germany%20charges%20seven%20suspected%20ISIS%2DK%20members%20over%20attack%20plots,-By%20Reuters&amp;text=BERLIN%2C%20April%2024%20(Reuters),prosecutor's%20office%20said%20on%20Wednesday.">ISIS-K plots</a> in recent months. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Experts say the ISIS of today operates differently than it did in its heyday. Many of the attackers involved in the 2015 massacre had traveled to Syria for on-the-ground training. That’s no longer feasible. “All these things used to be done from ISIS hubs, but ISIS doesn’t have territory anymore. It’s totally dematerialized,” Wassim Nasr, a Paris-based terrorism analyst with the France 24 television network, told Vox. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But ISIS operatives in Europe aren’t quite the proverbial “lone wolves” either. They interact online with what Nasr called “cyber-coaches” abroad who advise them on planning and logistics.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The result, Nasr says, is that ISIS operatives in Europe are likely less trained and less able to carry out attacks than their predecessors. “That’s the difference from 10 years ago,” he says. “The European recruits who could have done this [carried out a successful attack on a high-security event like the Olympics] are now either dead or in jail.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A US security official told Vox that while authorities aren’t taking ISIS’s decline for granted, particularly in light of the Moscow attack, they see no sign of an active threat. “You have a lot of aspirational chatter online,” the official said. “What we’re not seeing is those aspirational views turned into anything concrete.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">October 7 and the war in Gaza have, of course, raised the level of tension as well. Israel’s presence at the games may drive some protests, as it did at the recent <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/sweden-gears-up-eurovision-final-amid-israel-protests-dutch-controversy-2024-05-11/#:~:text=There%20was%20also%20booing%20when,slogan%20%22United%20by%20music%22.">Eurovision Song Contest in Sweden</a>. French authorities <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/france-give-24-hour-protection-israeli-olympics-team-amid-gaza-tensions-2024-07-22/">announced this week</a> that the Israeli Olympic team would be given 24-hour protection after a left-wing lawmaker said the team was not welcome and should be protested.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US official said street protests, whether about Gaza or anything else, were not a major security concern and that French authorities were well-equipped to handle them: “It’s the national pastime here. It’s what the French do.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A greater concern is that the events in the Middle East could inspire violent one-off attacks by individuals. Europol recorded over a <a href="https://www.icct.nl/publication/terrorism-threat-2024-paris-olympics-learning-past-understand-present">dozen jihadist terror plots in Europe</a> in the nine months following October 7 compared to just six in all of 2022. These include the ISIS sympathizer who <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/france/20231017-killer-of-french-school-teacher-claims-attack-for-islamic-state-group">stabbed a schoolteacher to death</a> in Northern France in October, and the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67604591">killing of a German tourist</a> in a hammer and knife attack near the Eiffel Tower in December.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Moscow rules</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the first time in years, European security officials may be worried less about non-state groups like ISIS than about a hostile government. The continent has been on increasingly high alert for acts of sabotage <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/30/europe-on-high-alert-after-suspected-moscow-linked-arson-and-sabotage">orchestrated by the Russian government</a>, linked to the war in Ukraine. Russian agents have been <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68843541">accused of plotting sabotage attacks</a> against military targets in Germany, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f8207823-f5e1-4caf-934d-67c648f807bf">interfering with railways in the Czech Republic</a>, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/suspects-alleged-russia-linked-uk-arson-attack-face-trial-next-year-2024-05-10/#:~:text=United%20Kingdom-,Suspects%20in%20alleged%20Russia%2Dlinked%20UK%20arson,to%20face%20trial%20next%20year&amp;text=LONDON%2C%20May%2010%20(Reuters),British%20court%20heard%20on%20Friday.">arson attacks in the UK</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/30/europe-on-high-alert-after-suspected-moscow-linked-arson-and-sabotage">Lithuania</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Earlier this month, it was reported that US and German authorities had foiled a Russian plot to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/us-germany-foiled-russian-assassination-plot/index.html">assassinate the CEO of Rheinmetall</a>, Germany’s largest defense contractor and a significant contributor of ammunition to the Ukrainian war effort. US military bases across Europe were recently placed on high alert because of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/09/politics/intelligence-russian-sabotage-threat-us-bases-europe/index.html">intelligence about potential Russian sabotage attacks</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last month, a Russian-Ukrainian man <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2024/06/27/man-arrested-with-explosives-near-paris-airport-was-part-of-vast-russian-sabotage-campaign_6675959_7.html#:~:text=The%2026%2Dyear%2Dold%20Russian,sabotage%20campaign%20orchestrated%20by%20Moscow.">was injured while making explosives</a> near Paris’s Charles De Gaulle airport. French authorities say he had been planning to attack a hardware store in Paris as part of a Moscow-orchestrated sabotage campaign. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the recent NATO summit in Washington, Gabrielius Landsbergis, foreign minister of Lithuania, referred to these events saying, “I’m not sure it can be called “hybrid events” or “gray zone events any longer. It’s quite clear that [these are] terrorist attacks by a hostile neighboring country against NATO countries.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Petter Nesser, an expert on terrorism in Europe with the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment, told Vox that while it can be very difficult to attribute some of these events to Russia directly, it is clear that “Russia wants to sow discord and weaken cooperation among European states to help them have their way in Ukraine. They have shown in the past they can use their spy networks and proxies to sow discord.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The exclusion of Russia and Belarus — at least officially — from the Games may make them an even more tempting target for sabotage. This need not take place in physical space. The Olympics are always the target of cyberattacks, and British authorities have alleged that Russia <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/19/russia-planned-cyber-attack-on-tokyo-olympics-says-uk">plotted large-scale cyberattacks</a> against the Tokyo Olympics in 2020 before they were postponed due to the coronavirus. French organizers say these Games are facing an “unprecedented level of threat” online, and not just from the Kremlin. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The AI eye in the sky</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite the numerous threats, Olympic organizers have promised to turn the French capital into the “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/olympics-paris-corruption-terrorism-crime-2c64905237dbd8fb6ed2aa6dde92a08a">safest place in the world</a>” during the games, an effort that involved the deployment of some <a href="https://apnews.com/article/france-paris-olympics-olympic-games-security-e8f9b8812dc06dae22ffdfad9d15858e">30,000 police per day</a> — and up to 45,000 during the Opening Ceremony — including reinforcements from around 40 countries. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Authorities are also using a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sports/olympics-how-france-plans-use-ai-keep-paris-2024-safe-2024-03-08/">controversial artificial intelligence system to</a> analyze images captured by surveillance cameras around the city in real-time to identify potential threats such as unusual behavior, abandoned objects, or weapons. French legislators had to <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/tech-24/20230324-france-passes-controversial-ai-surveillance-bill-ahead-of-2024-olympics">amend the country’s laws</a> last year to allow for deployment of the new technology. The system was successfully tested at a Depeche Mode concert in Paris in March. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Privacy advocates worry that the use of the system opens up the floodgates to future use of AI technology to undermine privacy and criminalize what authorities deem to be aberrant or unusual behavior in crowds.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“When the next event comes up in another country, they will, of course, look at France and whether or not there was a political reaction,” Patrick Breyer, a German minister of the European Parliament who organized an open letter protesting the use of the system, told Vox. “There’s a risk this will become standard procedure in connection with large events.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before every Olympics, there is a tendency in media coverage to <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2021/07/pre-olympics-bummers.html">accentuate the negative</a>: terrorist risk, political controversy, shoddy facilities, crime, environmental damage. Once the Games start and the athletes are on the court or off the blocks, these issues tend to be brushed aside, for better or worse.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All indications so far are that the Paris Olympics will be a safe and successful Games. US security officials who spoke with Vox emphasized that for all the threats, they have no concerns about the French authorities’ ability to handle them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since 1993, before every Olympics the UN General Assembly has voted to urge member-states to observe the <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/olympic-truce">Olympic Truce</a>, which calls for a cessation of hostilities during the course of the Games. This Olympics was no different, with the vote passing in November.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Olympic Truce has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/what-is-the-olympic-truce-5ea915f2f856d2b1c5edba2e9fc23cbe">always been more aspiration than reality</a>, and between the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, not to mention countless other conflicts around the globe, we can be sure that war won’t come to a pause during the two weeks of the Paris Games.

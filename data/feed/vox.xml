<p class="has-text-align-none">Some people collect coins or stamps. For a time, I collected debit cards. Not stolen ones! Each one of them had my name on them, right below the logo of the latest banking app I’d decided to try out: Venmo, Cash App, Chime, Varo, Current, Acorns.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the better part of a decade, I did all my banking through these apps, enjoying their slick user experience and lack of fees. The problem with every one of them, however, is that they’re not chartered banks. If the company behind the app went bankrupt, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) would not necessarily come to my rescue.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This disaster scenario was a hypothetical worry when I eventually settled for Chase and its FDIC insurance. For millions of others, it became a reality earlier this year when a company called Synapse <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-synapse-bankruptcy-has-the-fintech-world-on-edge-f83cbe6d">collapsed and froze them out of their accounts</a>. Users of Yotta, a popular savings app with a built-in lottery, and other apps that relied on Synapse to help manage their accounts couldn’t access their money for months. Now, as hundreds of thousands of Synapse customers’ dollars <a href="https://fintechbusinessweekly.substack.com/p/sen-elizabeth-warren-calls-for-regulators">remain in limbo</a>, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/warren_van_hollen_letter_to_prudential_regulators_on_baas_oversight_91124.pdf">are calling for banking reforms</a>, and the FDIC is <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2024/fdic-proposes-deposit-insurance-recordkeeping-rule-banks-third-party">proposing changes</a> to its rules.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/fintechs-a-new-paradigm-of-growth">a growing number of people</a> are embracing these financial technology, or fintech, services. More than <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronshevlin/2023/07/05/the-checking-account-war-is-over-and-the-fintechs-have-won/">a third of Gen Z and millennials</a> used a fintech app or a digital bank as their primary checking account, according to a 2023 Cornerstone Advisors study.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So some questions are worth asking: Is it a bad idea to use an app like Venmo as your main bank? Are digital banks like Chime trustworthy enough?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The answer to both questions is yes. Venmo is not a bank, and using it as your primary checking account comes with some risks. Some fintech companies, like Chime, are just as big as traditional banks and offer some nice perks. Again, because they’re nontraditional, there are risks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“You&#8217;re not going to go back to a world where everybody works with a small bank and walks into a branch,” Shamir Karkal, co-founder of Simple, one of the first digital banks. “The future is just going to be more fintech, and I think we all just need to get better at it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To get better at all of this, it helps to know what’s going on behind the scenes.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Neobanks and money transmitters, briefly explained</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The term fintech can refer to a lot of things, but when you’re talking about everyday services for everyday people, it typically refers to either neobanks or money transmitters. Chime is a neobank. Venmo is a money transmitter. They’re regulated in different ways, but because most of these companies issue debit cards, many people treat them like checking accounts. Fintech apps are not the same thing as FDIC-insured banks.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Neobanks are fintech companies that offer services like checking accounts in partnership with chartered banks, which are FDIC-insured. Neobanks sometimes enlist intermediaries known as banking-as-a-service, or BaaS, companies, which are not FDIC-insured. Still, you will often see the FDIC logo on neobank websites, just like you see it stuck to the glass doors of many brick-and-mortar banks. That logo instills trust, and thanks to their partnerships, neobanks can claim some FDIC protections. But because they do not have bank charters, these neobanks and BaaS companies are not directly FDIC-insured. Instead, neobank customers can be eligible for something called <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/financial-institution-employees-guide-deposit-insurance/pass-through-deposit-insurance-coverage">pass-through deposit insurance coverage</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Three things to know</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Listen to Vox’s Adam Clark Estes break down the potential pitfalls of keeping your money in a fintech app, like Venmo or Chime.</p>

</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pass-through insurance is a simple concept <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/issue-spotlight-analysis-of-deposit-insurance-coverage-on-funds-stored-through-payment-apps/full-report/">that’s deceivingly complex in practice</a>. Essentially, if you deposit money into an account with a neobank, like Chime, the funds get routed to a chartered bank, sometimes through one of those BaaS intermediaries. If the chartered bank fails, no problem: FDIC insurance kicks in, and you can recoup up to $250,000 of your deposits. If the intermediary fails or the neobank itself fails, you might be eligible for pass-through insurance — but you might not. In its explainer about when or if you’ll get your money back in these kinds of situations, the FDIC literally says, “<a href="https://www.fdic.gov/consumer-resource-center/2024-06/banking-third-party-apps">It depends</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“American consumers see the FDIC logo, and they interpret that as meaning: My money is safe and I will get it back,” said Jason Mikula, who runs the popular <a href="https://fintechbusinessweekly.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=substack_profile">Fintech Business Weekly newsletter</a>. “That&#8217;s just not what FDIC does exactly.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Money transmitters, also known as money services businesses, are even further removed from the perceived safety of the FDIC. Put bluntly, if you’re keeping all your money in a Venmo or Cash App account, you don’t qualify for FDIC insurance. Money transmitters are not neobanks or banks at all but rather completely <a href="https://stripe.com/resources/more/what-is-a-money-transmitter#introduction">different legal entities</a> that are regulated by individual states as well as the Department of the Treasury. There are certain protections provided by these agencies, but FDIC insurance is not one of them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So when an app like <a href="https://www.withyotta.com/security">Yotta</a> or <a href="https://www.chime.com/">Chime</a> says on its website that it’s FDIC insured, it’s not a lie, but it’s not necessarily true either.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Venmo, to its credit, admits in the fine print of its homepage that its parent company PayPal “is not a bank” and “is not FDIC insured.” To confuse you even more, however, certain PayPal services that enlist a chartered bank partner, like a PayPal Mastercard or savings account, <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/program-banks-tnc">might qualify for FDIC insurance</a>. Again, it depends.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The perils and perks of banking with an app</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fintech companies take careful steps to make banking with them feel safe. They include the FDIC logo on the website to provide customers with some peace of mind, even though the fine print on those protections is more complicated. They issue debit cards with the Visa or Mastercard logo to suggest that these cards play by the same rules as any big bank’s debit card. These logos can act as a stamp of approval, an assurance that your money is in good hands.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is actually the heart of the problem, as far as Sen. Elizabeth Warren is concerned. This month, she and Sen. Van Hollen <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/warren_van_hollen_letter_to_prudential_regulators_on_baas_oversight_91124.pdf">asked regulators</a> to ban neobanks and fintech companies from using the FDIC name and logo if they were only offering pass-through insurance. They also called for greater supervision of these companies under the Bank Service Company Act.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The average consumer shouldn’t be expected to understand the intricacies of FDIC insurance in order to comfortably and safely save or invest their money,” Warren’s letter says. “Consumers must feel confident that they are dealing with a regulated and insured entity when they see the FDIC logo.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That doesn’t necessarily mean that all neobanks and fintech companies are untrustworthy. In some cases, the sheer size and track record of fintech companies can instill quite a bit of trust. Chime, the largest digital bank <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronshevlin/2024/03/24/is-chime-ready-for-an-ipo-it-has-more-primary-customers-than-chase/">with roughly 22 million customers</a>, scored a $25 billion valuation in its latest round of funding and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-22/chime-financial-is-said-to-target-public-listing-in-us-in-2025?sref=qYiz2hd0">is planning to go public next year</a>. Venmo’s parent company, PayPal, is widely <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/digital-payments/2023/60percent-of-consumers-trust-paypal-over-their-bank-with-stored-payment-credentials/">considered safe and trustworthy</a>. And don’t expect Block, the $42 billion company that owns Cash App <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-financial-services-begins-banking-operations">as well as its own chartered bank</a>, to fail any time soon.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The truth is, even if there is some false sense of security, fintech apps offer certain customers features that big banks can’t or won’t. One thing that’s made Chime and many other neobanks so popular, for instance, is that they don’t charge so many fees. That’s a huge boon to young people <a href="https://www.vox.com/22367985/paypal-venmo-financial-inequality-unbanked-underbanked">as well as people without bank accounts</a>. If a fintech app is your only option, then you might not care so much about FDIC insurance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If you&#8217;re poor in America and you&#8217;re banking at Chase or Wells Fargo, you&#8217;re going to get overdraft fees, minimum balance fees,” Mikula explained. “So there is a real need that [fintech] companies fulfill as a result of your establishment banks essentially not wanting to bank poor people because it&#8217;s difficult to do profitably.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As many as 6 percent of Americans <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/02/23percent-of-low-income-americans-are-living-without-a-bank-account.html">were living without a bank account</a> in 2023, according to Federal Reserve data. That share grows to 23 percent for those making less than $23,000 a year. The unbanked population, which disproportionately comprises Black, Hispanic, and undocumented people, is at a greater risk of falling victim to predatory lending practices, including payday loans. Some fintech companies also offer short-term loans, though they’ve been criticized <a href="https://apnews.com/article/earned-wage-access-costs-payday-loans-9679d1bd09546d12074e0f27e23f0632">for being predatory as well</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fraud alert</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Payment apps like Venmo are popular with scammers. Using a Venmo-branded debit card <a href="https://venmo.com/purchaseprotection/">comes with some purchase protection</a>. If you happen to fall for a scam, however, there’s a good chance the app will not pay you back.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://help.venmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/209681208-I-accidentally-paid-a-stranger-on-Venmo">Venmo</a>, <a href="https://cash.app/help/6544-avoiding-common-scams-with-cash-app">Cash App</a>, and <a href="https://www.zellepay.com/safety-education/fraud-scams-overview">Zelle</a> are all clear about issuing refunds for payments to other individuals: They don’t do it. Or at least they can’t guarantee it. You should treat these peer-to-peer payments like cash.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Here are some tips for spotting and avoiding scams on <a href="https://help.venmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048404533-Common-Scams-on-Venmo">Venmo</a>, <a href="https://cash.app/help/6544-avoiding-common-scams-with-cash-app#">Cash App</a>, and <a href="https://www.zellepay.com/safety-education/fraud-scams-overview">Zelle</a>. But if you’re more of a motivated-by-fear person, read <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/zelle-fraud-scam-swimming-pool-online-payment-apps-mobile-banking-2023-10">this story</a> about a guy who wanted a deal on a swimming pool and got “a $31,000 lesson in the downside of payment apps” instead.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, fintech companies offer the unbanked <a href="https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/12/17/three-barriers-unbanked-citizens-face-and-how-fintech-overcomes-them/">the ability to save money and build credit</a>. For someone who can’t open a traditional bank account, Venmo can be a lifeline, since they can add funds to their Venmo balance and then pay bills using their Venmo debit card without needing a traditional checking account. If they have access to a smartphone, getting basic banking services is simple these days.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As I learned firsthand when testing out many of these services over the years, it’s very easy to sign up for and easy to deposit money into a fintech app. If you have a problem, however, help can be hard to find. Many fintech companies and neobanks, including Chime, lack brick-and-mortar locations, which means you can’t walk into a branch to get an issue resolved. In fact, poor customer service <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/neobanks-customer-service-growing-client-base">is a common complaint</a> for these companies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That means you should always research a company before giving money to it. Read the reviews and study the fine print. Obvious red flags include hidden fee structures and reports of customers not being able to withdraw their money. You should also consider trying services out with small sums rather than your life savings. And, as always, <a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/mobile-payment-apps-how-avoid-scam-when-you-use-one">watch out for scams and frauds</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What is true in the real world is even more true in the app world: Beware of deals that look too good to be true. Only gamble with what you’d be willing to lose.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to launch a <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies">mass deportation program</a> starting on day one of his second term. That could have devastating consequences for the millions of people residing in “mixed status” households: those in which both undocumented immigrants and people with permanent legal status reside.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has said that he would rely on an <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies">18th-century law</a> to carry out mass deportations and that he intends to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/03/trump-mass-deportations-detention-camps-military-migrants">first target</a> “known or suspected gang members, drug dealers, or cartel members.” Vice President-elect JD Vance has <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jd-vance-mass-deportations-start-1-million-defends/story?id=112739447">set an initial goal of 1 million deportations</a>. A representative for the Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment about whether any exceptions would be made for undocumented immigrants who have lived in the US for a long time or who have immediate family here, including US-citizen spouses and children. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are many such people: The US has an estimated <a href="https://cmsny.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CMS-REPORT-Proposed-2024-Mass-Deportation-Program-Would-Socially-and-Economically-Devastate-American-Families.pdf">4.7 million mixed-status households</a>, according to a 2024 Center for Migration Studies report. Roughly 500,000 people in those households may have hoped for new protections against deportation through a <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/355662/biden-path-citizenship-spouses-children-undocumented-legalization-green-card">Biden administration program</a> that would have cleared the way for undocumented spouses and stepchildren of US citizens to apply for legal status. That program was <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/judge-declares-biden-immigration-program-for-spouses-of-u-s-citizens-illegal/">struck down</a> in federal court on Thursday.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Trump gets his way, his deportation program threatens to rip families apart in what could be a new iteration of his <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/10/7/21506059/trump-family-separations-sessions-rosenstein">first administration’s policy of separating immigrant families</a>. However, Tom Homan, Trump’s former director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and current immigration adviser, has also proposed that <a href="https://x.com/60Minutes/status/1850689458590384212">families could be deported together</a>, apparently including US citizens. It is not clear whether he was suggesting that they would go voluntarily together.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies">clear practical challenges</a> associated with implementing a mass deportation program on the scale Trump is promising. But if he manages to overcome those hurdles, such a program could wreak lasting psychological damage on <a href="https://cmsny.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CMS-REPORT-Proposed-2024-Mass-Deportation-Program-Would-Socially-and-Economically-Devastate-American-Families.pdf">millions of American-born children</a> in mixed-status families, place economic strain on their communities, and even weaken the US economy. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">The familiar damage of family separation</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Research on the effects of Trump’s previous policy of separating immigrant families sheds light on the potential fallout from breaking up mixed-status families through mass deportations.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In his first term, Trump adopted what was called the “zero tolerance policy” for undocumented immigrants arriving at the southern border. Parents were sent to immigration detention to await deportation proceedings. Their children, meanwhile, were sent to separate facilities operated by the Department of Health and Human Services and, in some cases, released to other family members in the US or to foster homes. (<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/immigration-border-crisis/fact-check-did-obama-administration-separate-families-n884856">Previous administrations</a>, in most cases, would not have detained the parents or children, releasing them together into the US.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At least 5,000 families were separated before a California federal court ordered the federal government in June 2018 to reunify the families affected and end the policy. As of May 2024, some <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/07/immigration-family-separation/">1,400 still had not been reunited</a>, despite an ongoing Biden administration effort to do so.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The harm the policy would inflict was well-known to Trump officials at the outset. Commander Jonathan White, who previously oversaw the government’s program providing care to unaccompanied immigrant children during the first Trump administration, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-administration-was-warned-of-traumatic-psychological-injury-from-family-separations-official-says">told Congress</a> that he had repeatedly warned the officials who concocted the policy that it would likely cause “significant potential for traumatic psychological injury to the child.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A <a href="https://perma.cc/2RPJ-WM5H">September 2019 government report</a> confirmed those effects, finding that immigrant children who entered government custody in 2018 frequently experienced “intense trauma,” and those who were “unexpectedly separated from a parent” even more so. In 2021, a group of pediatricians <a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/147/1/e2020012930/33464/Treatment-of-Migrant-Children-on-the-US-Southern?autologincheck=redirected">concluded</a> in a study that separating families “constitutes cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment that rises to the level of torture.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Vox <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/10/21/21526566/trump-family-separations-immigrant-children">previously reported</a>, psychologists have seen that childhood trauma manifested in three main ways: disruptions to social attachments, increases in emotional vulnerability, and, in some cases, post-traumatic stress disorder. Those symptoms could be short-lived or they could persist; they could also not even manifest until a child enters their teen years or adulthood. Any of them could significantly hinder a child’s later success in academics and in the workplace.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The family separation caused by mass deportations would look different from family separation at the border, and whether the psychological effects on separated children are more or less extreme will depend on their circumstances. What is clear, however, is that mass deportation would cause family separation at a scale far larger than anything Trump tried in his first term in office.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This is orders of magnitude higher as far as families that are going to be split apart, and the kind of life-altering consequences of that will be visited upon 5.5 million US-born children,” said Matthew Lisiecki, a senior research and policy analyst at the Center for Migration Studies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He and his co-researcher Gerard Apruzzese conservatively <a href="https://cmsny.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CMS-REPORT-Proposed-2024-Mass-Deportation-Program-Would-Socially-and-Economically-Devastate-American-Families.pdf">estimate</a> that a third of American-born children in mixed-status families, including 1.8 million who live in households with two undocumented parents, would remain in the US even if their household members were deported.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That would inflict not just psychological suffering, but also a hefty financial cost: Children who remain in the US would see their median household income drop by nearly half, from $75,500 to $39,000, if their undocumented household members were deported, Lisiecki and Apruzzese found. Other family members or public social services would have to pick up the cost of raising them, which the researchers estimate at $116.5 billion. The loss of their parents’ productivity — and the $96.7 billion they contribute annually in taxes — could also hurt the US economy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The kind of trauma experienced as part of that is something that these Americans will be living with every day of their life from here on out,” Lisiecki said. “I don&#8217;t think we have the experience at that scale to say what that means for the lives of those kids as they grow up and move forward.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether Trump can actually deliver on his promises of mass deportations is a big question mark. He has said that the program would have “<a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/07/congress/trump-immigration-mass-deportations-00188339">no price tag,</a>” suggesting that the budget is unlimited, but he would need the support of Congress to make that happen. It’s not yet clear that he’ll have the numbers to increase the immigration enforcement budget, especially given that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/g-s1-33301/2024-house-seats-undecided-control">control of the House is still undecided</a>. But even if implemented on a small scale, the consequences for affected mixed-status families would be dire. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Germany appears headed toward an unexpected election — and complete political upheaval — after its deeply unpopular ruling coalition collapsed this week.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Until Wednesday, Germany, which operates under a parliamentary system in which multiple parties compete for power, was governed by a fragile coalition of three parties with very different aims. That arrangement changed after <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/12/8/22810520/germany-government-olaf-scholz-chancellor-greens-fdp">Chancellor Olaf Scholz</a> (who belongs to the party that led the coalition, the center-left Social Democratic Party) fired his finance minister, who belongs to the fiscally conservative Free Democratic Party, over a budget dispute.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In response, the Free Democratic Party pulled out of the coalition, leaving the Social Democratic Party and its other coalition partner, the climate change-focused Green Party, without a majority in the Bundestag, Germany’s parliament. For the time being, the two parties will still govern the country, but it will be difficult to pass legislation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a result, Germany faces political gridlock. Scholz has said he will call a vote of confidence in his government <a href="https://apnews.com/article/germany-scholz-government-struggling-economy-coalition-lindner-1cae2cd0266453103fc89800e47e7ce7">in January</a>. He and the Greens are expected to lose, which would trigger an early election and likely <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/political-wrangling-starts-after-german-coalition-collapse/a-70725678">elevate different parties and politicians</a> to leadership positions, significantly shifting the course of German politics.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How did things get so chaotic in Germany?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The three-party coalition was troubled nearly from the beginning.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Scholz has never been particularly popular, and his party has been steadily losing ground to the right-wing <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2024/3/12/24080074/germany-afd-far-right">Alternative for Germany (AfD)</a>, as well as to other minority parties in both <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/354601/european-parliament-elections-macron-afd-national-rally-far-right-fidesz-france">European Parliament</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germanys-far-right-afd-track-another-state-election-win-2024-09-22/">state elections</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The other issue the coalition faced was that German economic growth has been slow for years, struggling to rebound from the Covid-19 pandemic. That’s primarily because the German auto industry is threatened by<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/18/vw-bmw-mbg-germanys-top-car-brands-are-struggling-in-the-ev-era.html#:~:text=The%20headwinds%2C%20while%20not%20unique,member%20states%20from%20voting%20in"> Chinese electric imports and decreased demand</a>. German energy costs have skyrocketed following <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/8/28/23325958/sanctions-impacting-russias-economy-putin">sanctions on the cheap Russian fuel</a> the country relied on prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After no party won a majority back in 2021, the coalition members — each with a very different approach to spending — agreed to work together “based on the assumption that they had a pretty generous budget from <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-top-court-annuls-move-to-repurpose-covid-funding/a-67403848">leftover coronavirus funds</a>,” credit secured to finance the country’s pandemic response, <a href="https://www.cfr.org/expert/liana-fix">Liana Fix</a>, a fellow for Europe at the Council on Foreign Relations, told Vox.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The plan was for “Social Democrats to give social welfare to their constituencies, for the Liberals to reduce taxes for business owners, and for the Greens to do climate projects,” in line with their parties’ priorities, said Fix.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the German constitutional court ruled earlier this year that the emergency Covid-19 funds couldn’t be used for other priorities, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/23/germany-slides-deeper-into-budget-crisis-heres-what-you-need-to-know.html">leaving a multibillion-euro hole in Germany’s budget</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Adding to this problem is that Germany has a constitutionally set level of debt it isn’t supposed to exceed. Scholz wanted to raise that debt level, in part, to <a href="https://www.vox.com/22960493/germany-chancellor-reversal-defense-war-russia-ukraine">surge aid to Ukraine during its war with Russia</a>. Christian Lindner, the fired finance minister, said that to do so would be tantamount to “<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c04f5dc1-e971-4421-9993-ac11c6231dd5">violating my oath of office</a>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Opposition parties have called for rapid action to form a new government, particularly given that US President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. He has <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/374102/trump-harris-tariffs-congress">threatened tariffs</a> that could further damage Germany’s economy. Scholz’s proposed timetable for elections wouldn’t allow a new government to be formed before June. Once it is formed, he and the Social Democratic Party will likely find themselves voted out of power.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As leaders scramble to assign blame for <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy">Donald Trump&#8217;s decisive win</a> on Tuesday, this round of post-election finger-pointing differs markedly from recent cycles. Unlike past elections with narrow margins, Trump&#8217;s likely popular vote victory and his uniform swing across states and counties defy simple explanations like a racist electorate or discontent over Biden&#8217;s foreign policy. Even chalking the election entirely up to inflation seems rather convenient and incomplete.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sen. Bernie Sanders, who earned about 6,000 fewer votes in his reelection bid than Kamala Harris did in Vermont, came out on Wednesday <a href="https://x.com/BernieSanders/status/1854271157135941698">with a statement</a> blasting the Democratic Party for abandoning working-class people, who appeared to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2024/exit-polls-2024-election/">break overwhelmingly</a> for Trump. This critique quickly gained traction, with commentators arguing that Harris and the Democrats had lost touch with working people&#8217;s needs, prioritizing issues like&nbsp;democracy and abortion rights too much. “If voters did not believe that Harris had a real plan to make their lives better, materially, it is hard to fault them,” <a href="https://jacobin.com/2024/11/its-happening-again-trump-election-win">wrote Matt Karp in Jacobin</a> on Wednesday. “I wish we had enacted the housing, care, and child tax credit elements in Build Back Better so we would have had concrete cost-of-living benefits to run on,” <a href="https://x.com/BharatRamamurti/status/1854556125523329511">lamented</a> former Biden administration official Bharat Ramamurti on Thursday.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’m not here to prescribe what politicians should or should not run on next time around, and I do desperately hope that elected officials use their time in office to pass good, well-designed legislation that improves people’s lives. But it seems like the discourse is barreling toward a well-trodden yet dubious place.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The (appealing) contention is that Democrats could have turned their electoral fortunes around if they had passed the right policies and then campaigned more effectively on those programs. In recent years this philosophy has been dubbed “<a href="https://x.com/matthewstoller/status/1447356638768373761">deliverism</a>” — coined to suggest that voters will elect politicians who deliver on their promises to solve problems. “Deliverism means governing well and establishing a record that the electorate needed to win actually feels,” <a href="https://prospect.org/politics/case-for-deliverism/">wrote</a> American Prospect editor David Dayen in 2021.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After the 2022 midterms, Sen. Elizabeth Warren <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/12/opinion/elizabeth-warren-democrat-senate-midterm.html">argued in the New York Times</a> that voters had rewarded Democrats specifically for programs like pandemic relief and infrastructure modernization. Other policies, like allowing Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices and capping insulin costs for older Americans, Warren argued, were what motivated voters to cast their ballots for Democrats. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Party leaders particularly favor a more sophisticated version of this theory: that policies will create “positive feedback loops,” building loyal constituencies who enable further policy victories through their continued electoral support. It’s no secret, for example, that Democrats believe making it easier for workers to join unions will not only improve their standard of living but improve Democrats’ electoral position by increasing the number of union members in the US.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Deliverism&#8217;s appeal lies in its intuitive logic, especially for college-educated rationalists drawn to clear cause-and-effect relationships: Good policies will lead to subsequent electoral victories. But there’s not a lot of evidence that policymaking actually works like this.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Decades of scholarship have shown that most people don’t understand how policies work, what policy benefits they’re getting, and which party is responsible for enacting specific policies. And even when a politician designs a program so that it’s easier for them to take credit, that still doesn’t always work out to their benefit. Those who received health insurance through Obamacare Medicaid expansion, for example, <a href="https://www.russellsage.org/publications/stable-condition">showed very little change</a> in voter turnout or party loyalty.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Northwestern political scientists Daniel Galvin and Chloe Thurston outline <a href="https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/documents/working-papers/2018/wp-18-16.pdf">in their essential research</a> on these questions, history should fundamentally challenge the premise that good policy success will most likely lead to political rewards for the party that passes it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Upon inspection, the intellectual basis for thinking that policies are good vehicles for building electoral majorities — or good substitutes for the more tedious work of organizational party-building — is quite thin,” they write.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This isn’t to say that Democrats shouldn’t try to pass good policy. The expanded child tax credit during the pandemic was <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/8/30/23317834/child-tax-credit-ctc-ira">demonstrably good policy</a>, even if most voters showed only <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NPR_Marist-Poll_USA-NOS-and-Tables_202112070936.pdf">muted enthusiasm for it</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And it’s of course not the case that politicians are never rewarded for good policy. Many voters even now still credit Trump <a href="https://prospect.org/politics/2024-10-31-philadelphia-kamala-vs-the-couch/">for the stimulus checks</a> they received in the mail during the pandemic, checks that prominently featured the president’s name. Doing good things and taking credit for those things can be helpful sometimes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But as Democratic leaders move to refocus on working-class priorities, they face two sobering realities: <a href="https://democracyjournal.org/arguments/the-death-of-deliverism/">Policies alone rarely drive electoral outcomes</a>, and an increasingly stark divide separates non-college voters from the college-educated liberals and socialists who lead the party and its allied progressive groups. Navigating these tensions will be necessary for charting future strategy, and the research suggests that Harris’s loss this week could not have been avoided if she had just emphasized Biden administration accomplishments more clearly. Such thinking oversimplifies a much more complex political reality.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>This story was originally published by&nbsp;<a href="https://grist.org/politics/washington-climate-law-repeal-failed-cap-and-trade/">Grist</a>&nbsp;and is republished here as part of the&nbsp;<a href="http://climatedesk.org/">Climate Desk</a>&nbsp;collaboration.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The people of Washington state elected to save the most ambitious price on carbon in the country. A large majority of voters,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/washington-state-general-election-results-2024/?300_tab=5&amp;300_filter=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">62 percent</a>, rejected a ballot initiative to repeal the state’s Climate Commitment Act, the cap-and-trade law that has already raised more than $2 billion for cleaning up transportation, shifting to clean energy, and helping people adapt to the effects of a changing climate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On an otherwise depressing election night for voters who consider climate change a top concern, there was an air of victory at the Seattle Convention Center on Tuesday evening, where Gov. Jay Inslee and a couple hundred organizers with the campaign opposing the repeal gathered for a watch party. As news rolled in that former President Donald Trump was the favorite to win the presidential election, many in the crowd did their best to focus on their success in rescuing the state’s landmark carbon-cutting law. Inslee, the outgoing Democratic governor whose signature climate legislation was at risk, said that the results should embolden states to take action on climate change.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I really feel it was important from a national perspective, because every state legislator can now look to Washington and say, ‘This is a winning issue,’” Inslee said in an interview with Grist. “This is something you can defend and win big on. And we won big.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Inslee said that the effort to defeat the initiative had emphasized the concrete, local benefits of the program to voters, rather than getting into the weeds about how cap and trade works. “We focused on the easiest thing for people to wrap their minds and hearts around,” Inslee said, pointing to the tangible economic benefits that the repeal would take away: the funding for transportation, schools, and fighting fires.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Putting any kind of price on carbon has long been seen as <a href="https://grist.org/politics/who-killed-the-carbon-tax-republicans-or-democrats/">politically risky</a>. Opponents of Washington’s Climate Commitment Act, including Brian Heywood, the hedge fund manager driving the repeal effort, blamed it for raising gas prices. The ballot measure would have not only struck down the state’s price on pollution — it would have also prevented the state from ever enacting a similar policy in the future.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The resounding public support for Washington’s cap-and-trade program “is going to echo coast to coast,” said Democratic state Rep. Joe Fitzgibbon, who helped pass the legislation in 2021, during a speech at the convention center. Officials in states including <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/carbon/washington-state-vote-harbinger-wider-carbon-markets-2024-11-01/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New Jersey, Maryland, and New York</a> have been eyeing similar policies, and they’ve been watching the results in Washington to see how voters responded. “I know that there are states that are thinking, ‘What can we do?’” Fitzgibbon told Grist. “And especially when there’s a vacuum at the federal level, that’s when I think you see the most motivation in state capitols to move.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cap and trade already exists in California, and in a more limited form among <a href="https://www.rggi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a network of states in the East</a>, but <a href="https://grist.org/economics/washington-state-cap-and-invest-california-lessonsit-works/">Washington’s law is more ambitious</a>, aiming to slash emissions nearly in half by 2030, using 1990 levels as a baseline, and by 95 percent by 2050.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Washington state is the gold standard for how we tackle climate change in a way that’s inclusive, in a way that’s politically popular, in a way that actually will decarbonize,” said state Sen. Joe Nguyễn, a Democrat who chairs the state’s Environment, Energy, and Technology Committee. A review of existing climate policies in 41 countries in August found that <a href="https://grist.org/economics/climate-policy-emissions-study/">carbon pricing programs were the most likely of any policy to lead to large emissions cuts</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Climate Commitment Act’s passage in 2021 followed&nbsp;<a href="https://grist.org/economics/after-a-decade-of-failures-washington-state-passes-a-cap-on-carbon-emissions/">more than a decade of failed attempts to put a price on pollution</a>&nbsp;in Washington state. It requires companies to buy pollution permits at quarterly auctions, a way to generate money for climate solutions and at the same time incentivize businesses to reduce their emissions. The number of permits available decreases over time. The program has so far raised billions to make public transit free for youth, install energy-efficient heat pumps in homes, and reduce local air pollution, among other measures.<a href="https://grist.org/politics/environment-conservation-climate-resilience-ballot-initaitives-election/"></a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Across the state, almost 600 organizations joined the “No on 2117” coalition to defend the law in 2024, ultimately raising <a href="https://www.pdc.wa.gov/political-disclosure-reporting-data/browse-search-data/committees/co-2024-35713" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$16 million</a>. Many businesses, religious organizations, health advocates, and agricultural organizations were on board. At the event Tuesday, there were security guards representing unionized labor, the chair of the Suquamish Tribe, and a public policy manager from the tech giant Amazon. “We put together, all of us, the most extraordinary coalition in the history of this state, on any issue, ever,” said Gregg Small, executive director of the group Climate Solutions, in a speech at the convention center.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The initiative faced other headwinds. Ballots explicitly alerted voters to the fiscal costs of the repeal, despite <a href="https://www.nwprogressive.org/weblog/2024/08/washington-state-supreme-court-quashes-jim-walshs-lawsuit-to-hide-the-costs-of-his-destructive-initiatives-from-voters.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appeals to the state Supreme Court</a> by the Washington State Republican Party to get that language removed. And Washington’s gas prices — which soared to <a href="https://www.cascadepbs.org/environment/2023/07/why-washington-gas-prices-are-nations-highest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$5, the highest in the country</a>, in 2023 — have now come down to around <a href="https://gasprices.aaa.com/?state=WA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$4 a gallon</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/washington-state-general-election-results-2024/?300_tab=5&amp;300_filter=0">Another ballot initiative</a>, which would complicate the state’s plans to get off natural gas, was still too close to call on Friday. With ballots still left to count, 51 percent of voters approved of the measure, which targets new building codes that make installing natural gas more difficult and <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/climate-lab/states-new-law-involving-pse-aspires-to-set-a-course-for-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">legislation to help the state’s largest utility accelerate its use of clean energy</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now that Washington’s cap-and-trade program survived the repeal, the state can move forward with plans to <a href="https://ecology.wa.gov/air-climate/climate-commitment-act/cap-and-invest/linkage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">link its carbon market up with California and Quebec’s</a>. The state can also begin the years-long process of implementing the Climate Commitment Act’s program to regulate air quality. This summer, the state began <a href="https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2024/08/27/new-wa-program-aims-to-curb-air-pollution-in-parts-of-state-most-affected-by-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">releasing grants to help reduce air pollution in “overburdened” communities</a>, but much of the work had been on hold as the state waited to see if voters would keep the law, according to David Mendoza, the director of public advocacy and engagement at the Nature Conservancy in Washington state.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The whole repeal initiative might have been a blessing in disguise, Nguyễn said. It gave people a chance to pay attention to all the work the state had done on climate change that might otherwise have been ignored. “I actually want to thank Brian Heywood and his cronies for putting this on the ballot, and just reaffirming to everybody that we care about climate change in Washington state.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Donald Trump is once again the president-elect of the United States, a development that promises to profoundly affect the world order.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During his first term in office, from 2017 to 2021, Trump’s foreign policy was protectionist and transactional; he cast doubt on the <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2018/5/8/17328520/iran-nuclear-deal-trump-withdraw">utility of alliances</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/6/28/17513972/trump-nato-russia-putin-nafta">alienated partners</a>, and attempted <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2019/2/26/18239694/trump-north-korea-kim-jong-un-vietnam-summit">complex diplomacy on his own</a>. At times, Trump’s methods <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/6/28/17513972/trump-nato-russia-putin-nafta">strained US relationships</a> and made the US the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/25/17900980/un-trump-laughed-at">target of ridicule</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He was clear throughout his campaign that a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382679/trump-foreign-policy-america-first-tariffs-nato-alliance">second term would feature the same approach</a>, threatening to impose sweeping <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/trumps-new-tariff-proposal-could-cost-americans-78-bln-annual-spending-nrf-study-2024-11-04/">new tariffs</a> (even on allies), suggesting changes to how the US works with NATO, and promising a <a href="https://www.kyivpost.com/post/41800">rapid end to the war in Ukraine</a>. Ahead of his election, reports suggested <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3gr90jnxjvo">some US allies were worried</a> about a Trump win. Now that he is headed back to the White House, world leaders from across the political spectrum have had a range of reactions from firm enthusiasm, to muted optimism, to silence. Here’s what they’ve had to say.</p>

<iframe frameborder="0" height="200" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP3671778017" width="100%"></iframe>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A range of responses in conflict zones</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was one of the first world leaders to offer Trump hearty congratulations for his “historic” return to the presidency. Trump’s win “offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America,” <a href="https://twitter.com/netanyahu/status/1854070348926328965">Netanyahu wrote on the social media site X</a>. “This is a huge victory!”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Netanyahu and Trump enjoyed a close relationship during Trump’s first term, and they have much in common; they are both nationalists, and have both faced significant legal obstacles to their leadership. <a href="https://www.vox.com/donald-trump/383152/donald-trump-criminal-indictments-supreme-court-reelected">Trump is a convicted felon</a>, and Netanyahu has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/04/world/netanyahu-corruption-trial-resumes/index.html">thus far successfully avoided conviction on corruption charges</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As president, Trump moved the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a symbolic move that tacitly affirmed the contested city as Israel’s, and pushed Arab countries to normalize ties with Israel through the Abraham Accords. Under a second Trump administration, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/israels-rightist-government-celebrates-trump-claims-victory-2024-11-06/">support for Israel and Netanyahu is likely to increase</a>; though he has called for a conclusion to the war in Gaza (which the Biden administration has financially and diplomatically supported) he has also given Netanyahu a green light to “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/25/trump-netanyahu-support-gaza-lebanon/">do what you have to do</a>” in Gaza and implied <a href="https://time.com/6972021/donald-trump-2024-election-interview/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiossneakpeek&amp;stream=top">he no longer believes in a two-state solution</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump does not have the same warm relationship with Palestinian leaders, who were more measured in their statements. Palestinian Authority head Mahmoud Abbas <a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/live-blog/live-blog-update/president-abbas-congratulates-president-trump-winning-us-presidential?fid=537046&amp;nid=405861&amp;topic=Israel%2527s%2520war%2520on%2520Gaza">congratulated Trump in a statement</a>, saying, “we are confident that the United States will support, under your leadership, the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people.” Hamas leaders were much more circumspect, saying, “Our position on the new US administration depends on its positions and practical behavior towards our Palestinian people, their legitimate rights and their just cause.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ukraine also has deep military ties to the US at the moment; the US has been Ukraine’s largest security backer by far as the country continues its nearly three-year-long fight against Russia’s full-scale invasion. Ukrainian President <a href="https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1854073411904938032">Volodymyr Zelenskyy</a> offered his congratulations and made clear his hopes for the second Trump term.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I appreciate President Trump’s commitment to the ‘peace through strength’ approach in global affairs,” Zelenskyy wrote on X. “This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer. I am hopeful that we will put it into action together.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Measured but optimistic responses from allies</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other allies, particularly in Europe, offered a range of cautiously optimistic responses.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4976102-nato-mark-rutte-donald-trump-2024-election-win/">NATO’s new chief Mark Rutte</a> said he would work alongside Trump to “advance peace through strength through NATO.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s attitude toward the alliance —&nbsp;as with international affairs more broadly —&nbsp;is highly transactional. In his first term, he regularly disparaged the security alliance, complained that European nations were not contributing enough financially, and pulled nearly a third of US troops out of Germany at the end of his presidency.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Trump&#8217;s criticism all along has been that America&#8217;s friends, partners, and allies free ride on its security guarantee and steal jobs from the United States,” <a href="https://www.cfr.org/expert/james-m-lindsay">James M. Lindsay</a>, a senior fellow in US foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, told Vox.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">European leaders like centrist French President Emmanuel Macron, center-left British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and right-wing Italian President Giorgia Meloni all congratulated Trump and expressed their desire to enhance the trans-Atlantic partnership under a second term, as did European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, those desires may be tested by a tariff plan Trump has floated. He’s expressed a willingness to enact tariffs of as much as 20 percent from most trading partners, including friendly nations. Anticipating a Trump victory, European Union leaders have tried to <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-trade-war-donald-trump-elections-triumphs-board-tariffs-transatlantic-relations/">prepare by proposing retaliatory tariffs on US imports</a>. The <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/worlds-largest-trade-and-investment-relationship-hangs-balance">US is the EU’s largest trading partner</a>, and the bloc’s economy took a hit when Trump imposed tariffs on European steel and aluminum during his first term.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mixed responses from <strong>US adversaries</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">US adversaries have had mixed responses.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Russian President Vladimir Putin, who Trump has praised in the past, did not publicly congratulate Trump until Friday, and <a href="https://fortune.com/asia/2024/11/06/china-says-it-hopes-for-peaceful-coexistence-with-u-s-as-trump-clinches-win/">Chinese President Xi Jinping</a> has not yet done so.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Putin offered his congratulations during a conference in Sochi, Russia, calling Trump a “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/putin-trump-russia-us-election-6f388707c132bdf6554ee4e615f894ad" data-type="link" data-id="https://apnews.com/article/putin-trump-russia-us-election-6f388707c132bdf6554ee4e615f894ad">brave man” for surviving a shooting during a July campaign appearance</a>. <strong>  </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov had <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/russias-medvedev-says-trump-presidency-would-be-blow-ukraine-2024-11-06/">suggested on Wednesday that</a> official congratulations weren’t likely to be forthcoming, saying, “we are talking about an unfriendly country, which is both directly and indirectly involved in a war against our state,” referring to US support for Ukraine. Trump has said that he would bring a stop to Russia’s war in Ukraine within a 24-hour period, without discussing how that would be possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though there are some indications that Russia and Ukraine might come to the negotiating table, Peskov was circumspect about the US’s role in making that happen.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We have repeatedly said that the US is able to contribute to the end of this conflict,” he said.&nbsp;“Will this happen, and if so, how &#8230; we will see after January,” when Trump takes office.&nbsp;Putin didn’t offer much more, though he said Trump’s “desire to restore relations with Russia, to help end the Ukrainian crisis, in my opinion, deserves attention at least.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Xi has not publicly congratulated Trump. Trump <a href="https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2018/september/ustr-finalizes-tariffs-200">slapped China with massive tariffs in 2018</a>, and threatened 60 percent tariffs on Chinese imports during a second term.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We will continue to approach and handle China-US relations based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/china-says-hopes-for-peaceful-coexistence-with-us-as-trump-on-brink-of-victory-673c3d3f">Mao Ning said during a Wednesday press conference</a>. When asked if Xi would call Trump to congratulate him on the win, she said the ministry would “handle related matters in accordance with usual practice” following the official announcement of election results.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Update, November 8, 12:30 pm ET:</strong> This story has been updated to reflect the response of Russian President Vladimir Putin to Trump’s win. </em></p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2020, when Joe Biden won the White House, generative AI still looked like a pointless toy, not a world-changing new technology. The first major AI image generator, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/05/1015754/avocado-armchair-future-ai-openai-deep-learning-nlp-gpt3-computer-vision-common-sense/">DALL-E, wouldn’t be released</a> until January 2021 — and it certainly wouldn’t be putting any artists out of business, as it still had trouble <a href="https://community.openai.com/t/dall-e-is-illiterate-with-the-text-it-adds-in-images/570654">generating basic images</a>. The <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2022/12/7/23498694/ai-artificial-intelligence-chat-gpt-openai">release of ChatGPT,</a> which took AI mainstream overnight, was still more than two years away. The <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/351189/google-ai-overview-section-230">AI-based Google search results</a> that are — like it or not —&nbsp;now unavoidable, would have seemed unimaginable.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the world of AI, four years is a lifetime. That’s one of the things that makes AI policy and regulation so difficult. The gears of policy tend to grind slowly. And every four to eight years, they grind in reverse, when a new administration comes to power with different priorities.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That works tolerably for, say, our food and drug regulation, or other areas where change is slow and bipartisan consensus on policy more or less exists. But when regulating a technology that is basically too young to go to kindergarten, policymakers face a tough challenge. And that’s all the more case when we experience a sharp change in who those policymakers are, as the US will after Donald Trump’s victory in Tuesday’s presidential election.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This week, I reached out to people to ask: What will AI policy look like under a Trump administration? Their guesses were all over the place, but the overall picture is this: Unlike on so many other issues, Washington has not yet fully polarized on the question of AI.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s supporters include members of the accelerationist tech right, led by the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who are fiercely opposed to regulation of an exciting new industry.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But right by Trump’s side is Elon Musk, who <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/26/elon-musk-supports-california-ai-bill-00176388">supported California’s SB 1047</a> to regulate AI, and has been <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/10/30/elon-musk-ai-could-go-bad-existential-threat-xai-fundraising/">worried</a> for a long time that AI will bring about the end of the human race (a position that is easy to dismiss as classic Musk zaniness, but is <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/1/10/24032987/ai-impacts-survey-artificial-intelligence-chatgpt-openai-existential-risk-superintelligence">actually quite mainstream</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s first administration was chaotic and featured the rise and fall of various chiefs of staff and top advisers. Very few of the people who were close to him at the start of his time in office were still there at the bitter end. Where AI policy goes in his second term may depend on who has his ear at crucial moments.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Where the new administration stands on AI</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2023, the Biden administration issued an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">executive order on AI</a>, which, while generally modest, did mark an early government effort to take AI risk seriously. The Trump campaign platform says the <a href="https://rncplatform.donaldjtrump.com/?_ga=2.255281992.1180040526.1729587267-1531562902.1729587267">executive order</a> “hinders AI innovation and imposes radical left-wing ideas on the development of this technology,” and has promised to repeal it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There will likely be a day one repeal of the Biden executive order on AI,”&nbsp;Samuel Hammond, a senior economist at the Foundation for American Innovation, told me, though he added, “what replaces it is uncertain.”&nbsp;The <a href="https://www.nist.gov/aisi">AI Safety Institute</a> created under Biden, Hammond pointed out, has “broad, bipartisan support” — though it will be <a href="https://punchbowl.news/article/tech/big-tech-urges-congress-to-formalize-ai-safety-institute/">Congress’s responsibility to properly authorize and fund it</a>, something they can and should do this winter.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are reportedly drafts in Trump’s orbit of a proposed replacement executive order that will <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/16/trump-ai-executive-order-regulations-military/?wpisrc=nl_technology202">create a “Manhattan Project” for military AI</a> and build industry-led agencies for model evaluation and security.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Past that, though, it’s challenging to guess what will happen because the coalition that swept Trump into office is, in fact, sharply divided on AI.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“How Trump approaches AI policy will offer a window into the tensions on the right,” Hammond said. “You have folks like Marc Andreessen who want to slam down the gas pedal, and folks like Tucker Carlson who worry technology is already moving too fast. JD Vance is a pragmatist on these issues, seeing AI and crypto as an opportunity to break Big Tech&#8217;s monopoly. Elon Musk wants to accelerate technology in general while taking the existential risks from AI seriously. They are all united against ‘woke’ AI, but their positive agenda on how to handle AI&#8217;s real-world risks is less clear.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.transformernews.ai/p/what-trump-means-for-ai-safety">Trump himself</a> hasn’t commented much on AI, but when he has — as he did in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrFdHO7FH8w">Logan Paul interview earlier this year</a> — he seemed familiar with both the “accelerate for defense against China” perspective and with expert fears of doom. “We have to be at the forefront,” he said. “It&#8217;s going to happen. And if it&#8217;s going to happen, we have to take the lead over China.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As for whether AI will be developed that acts independently and seizes control, he said, “You know, there are those people that say it takes over the human race. It&#8217;s really powerful stuff, AI. So let&#8217;s see how it all works out.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a sense that is an incredibly absurd attitude to have about the literal possibility of the end of the human race — you don’t get to see how an existential threat “works out” — but in another sense, Trump is actually taking a fairly mainstream view here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many AI experts think that the possibility of AI taking over the human race <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/21/18126576/ai-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-safety-alignment">is a realistic one</a> and that it could happen in the next few decades, and also think that we don’t know enough yet about the nature of that risk to make effective policy around it. So implicitly, a lot of people do have the policy “it might kill us all, who knows? I guess we’ll see what happens,” and Trump, as he so often proves to be, is unusual mostly for just coming out and saying it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">We can’t afford polarization. Can we avoid it?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s been a lot of back and forth over AI, with Republicans <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/donald-trump-ai-safety-regulation/">calling equity and bias concerns “woke” nonsense</a>, but as Hammond observed, there is also a fair bit of bipartisan consensus. No one in Congress wants to see the US fall behind militarily, or to strangle a promising new technology in its cradle. And no one wants extremely dangerous weapons developed with no oversight by random tech companies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meta’s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, who is an <a href="https://x.com/ylecun/status/1852563383318462784">outspoken Trump critic</a>, is also an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/12/metas-yann-lecun-says-worries-about-a-i-s-existential-threat-are-complete-b-s/#:~:text=Dietsch%20%2F%20Getty%20Images-,Meta's%20Yann%20LeCun%20says%20worries%20about%20AI's%20existential%20threat%20are,winner%20of%20the%20prestigious%20A.M.">outspoken critic of AI safety worries</a>. Musk supported California’s AI regulation bill — <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/369628/ai-safety-bill-sb-1047-gavin-newsom-california">which was bipartisan, and vetoed by a Democratic governor</a> — and of course Musk also <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/383336/trump-election-elon-musk-misinformation">enthusiastically backed</a> Trump for the presidency. Right now, it’s hard to put concerns about extremely powerful AI on the political spectrum.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But that is actually a good thing, and it would be catastrophic if that changes. With a fast-developing technology, Congress needs to be able to make policy flexibly and empower an agency to carry it out. Partisanship makes that next to impossible.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More than any specific item on the agenda, the best sign about a Trump administration’s AI policy will be if it continues to be bipartisan and focused on the things that all Americans, Democratic or Republican, agree on, like that we don’t want to all die at the hands of superintelligent AI. And the worst sign would be if the complex policy questions that AI poses got rounded off to a general “regulation is bad” or “the military is good” view, which misses the specifics.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hammond, for his part, was optimistic that the administration is taking AI appropriately seriously. “They&#8217;re thinking about the right object-level issues, such as the national security implications of AGI being a few years away,” he said. Whether that will get them to the right policies remains to be seen — but it would have been highly uncertain in a Harris administration, too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>A Vox reader writes: “Trump can&#8217;t run for a third term, right? (Yes, we know what the Constitution says &#8230; but he really, truly can&#8217;t run for a third term, right??)”</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy">President-elect Donald Trump</a> has won his second — and final — term in office. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/18/trump-at-nra-convention-floats-a-three-term-presidency-00158786">Trump has joked about pursuing a third term</a> and has a penchant for promoting authoritarian ideas, <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/07/can-donald-trump-run-2028-presidential-election/76094187007/">he’s barred from running again</a> by the 22nd Amendment of the US Constitution. To run for a third term, he’d have to repeal that amendment, and that would be difficult. Undoing a constitutional amendment requires an overwhelming level of support from Congress and state legislatures, support he would be unable to obtain.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When asked if there were legal loopholes or other ways for a president to get around the 22nd Amendment, Stanford University Law Professor Michael McConnell, a specialist in constitutional law, had a definitive answer.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“No. There are none. This will be his last run for president,” McConnell told Vox.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What the 22nd Amendment says</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The 22nd Amendment firmly limits <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/how-we-wound-up-with-the-constitutions-only-term-limits-amendment">presidents to two</a> successful runs and applies equally to those elected to consecutive terms and those, like Trump, who are elected to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-trump-run-again-2028/">nonconsecutive terms</a>. It states the following:&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">&#8220;No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The amendment <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/how-the-22nd-amendment-came-into-existence">was ratified in 1951</a> and came after years of both parties calling for term limits for the presidency.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While President George Washington set a precedent for only holding two terms in office, President Franklin D. Roosevelt later <a href="https://www.history.com/news/fdr-four-term-president-22-amendment">became the first and only commander-in-chief</a> to serve additional terms. Roosevelt was ultimately elected to four terms in office, though he passed away during his last term in 1945.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Following Roosevelt’s tenure, there were growing calls to establish term limits for future presidents, leading to Congress’s approval of the 22nd Amendment and states’ subsequent ratification.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why it’s so hard to roll back the 22nd Amendment</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The thresholds for approving a constitutional amendment and for repealing it are exceedingly high.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are two ways to go about rolling back an amendment. The first would require two-thirds of both the House — 290 members — and the Senate — 67 members — to agree to do so. Once they did so, three-fourths of all states — 38 — would then also have to agree.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These thresholds would be impossible for Trump to meet given Democratic opposition, and there would likely be some Republican outcry as well. While <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382868/republican-senate-majority-ohio-west-virginia-trump">Republicans are poised to retake Senate control</a>, they’ll fall far short of the two-thirds majority required for such a vote. If the GOP attains control of the House, they’d similarly fall far short of the two-thirds majority needed there. Additionally, at least 17 states have voted for Vice President Kamala Harris, signaling that they’d be unlikely to support any such amendment. That’s more than the one-fourth of states Trump could afford to lose should he somehow succeed in getting the amendment overturned by Congress.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A second means of repealing an Amendment would require holding a Constitutional Convention, which two-thirds of states — 34 — would have to support. Any amendments proposed at such a Convention would still need ratification from three-fourths of states — 38.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This option would face the same opposition from Democrat-leaning states as the first one.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the amendment was first approved, there have been numerous proposals in <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/term-limits/">Congress raised to repeal it</a>, though they have all languished due to lack of support.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The amendment is crystal clear</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Experts say there aren’t really any realistic options for Trump to try to bypass the 22nd Amendment.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Theoretically, <a href="https://cornerstonelaw.us/22nd-amendment-doesnt-say-think-says/">the 22nd Amendment doesn’t prevent a former president</a> who has already served two terms from becoming vice president in a subsequent term. As vice president, that person could then potentially ascend to the presidency if the president on the ticket stepped down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It could theoretically happen, but it isn&#8217;t going to happen,” says McConnell, who added that it’s a “silly thing to worry about.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Efforts to challenge the amendment in court are also moot.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Supreme Court does not have the basis to overturn the 22nd Amendment, according to legal experts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Per UCLA law professor Adam Winkler, any challenge to a constitutional amendment would likely rest on arguments that the procedure used to approve the amendment was faulty in some way.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s “impossible” in this case, says Winkler, given how this amendment has been settled for more than seven decades.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Winkler notes the Supreme Court could try to interpret the 22nd Amendment to say that it only applies to presidents who have served consecutive terms, but even that would be a stretch based on its text. Any effort to declare the amendment unconstitutional by the Court would run into the problem of the amendment being part of the Constitution, notes McConnell. “By definition, the Constitution cannot be unconstitutional,” he says.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Overall, as Georgetown law professor Abbe Smith explained when asked if Trump could vie for a third term, it’s pretty simple: “Short answer: There is no way.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As such, Trump’s recent run is set to be his final one.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382945/kamala-harris-lost-donald-trump-why">Election night 2024</a> felt like the sequel to Election 2016: Many of the beats were the same, but the particulars were different. The early returns were ominous, and prospects did not improve from there. I was not as surprised, and yet it affected me as deeply if not more so.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you are anything like me, you have been trying to hold many different ideas in your head at once these past few days —&nbsp;and you still have a lot of questions. I won’t pretend to have all the answers, because nobody does. But we have collected your questions from the Vox Instagram page, our Explain It to Me inbox, and the Explain It to Me podcast phone line.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here are four common queries from Vox’s readers and listeners, with my best read on them (with an assist from one of Vox’s most astute young political minds) as we sift through the fog of Election Week.</p>

<iframe frameborder="0" height="200" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP9146325452" width="100%"></iframe>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Did Trump overperform or did Harris underperform?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We all want to apportion blame or credit. Was Kamala Harris doomed by the political environment? Or did her campaign make missteps? Both can be true. Which one determined the outcome more?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The truth is, it’s hard to say what was determinative. Nate Silver can run 80,000 simulations of the election, but the rest of us only get to live through one reality. We can’t know the counterfactual and it will take time for <a href="https://catalist.us/wh-national/">the data that tells the story of this election</a> to come into focus.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With that caveat out of the way, I am skeptical that Harris ever had a chance — and I’m more inclined to pin her loss on the conditions under which she was running, rather than the choices she made as she ran.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Something stuck out to me throughout election night: Whenever MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki would pull up some bellwether county in a swing state, he would compare the 2024 margins to 2020 and 2016. He would often point out Donald Trump was returning to his 2016 levels, while Harris trailed President Joe Biden’s 2020 performance, closer to (and yet usually above) Clinton in 2016.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2024/11/05/compare-2020-2024-presidential-results/">Look at this map from the Washington Post</a> that charts the shift from 2020 to 2024 in the presidential race by county. It’s red arrows all over. You should read exit polls with caution, but it would <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-harris-trump-women-latinos-black-voters-0f3fbda3362f3dcfe41aa6b858f22d12">appear</a> Trump made gains with voters across the board. That suggests to me there was a structural problem, as much as any strategic one, for Harris.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Luckily, we don’t have to look far for structural explanations. Vox’s Zack Beauchamp <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383208/donald-trump-victory-kamala-harris-global-trend-incumbents">wrote on the wave of anti-incumbency worldwide</a> that seems to have carried Trump and sunk Harris. It’s damaged conservatives (in <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/358985/uk-labour-keir-starmer-tories-migration-politics-elections-july-4-rishi-sunak-boris-johnson">the UK</a>) and liberals (in <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/south-koreas-2024-general-election-results-and-implications">South Korea</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The constant is people being fed up with those in power after Covid-19 and the global inflation that followed. The aggregated economic indicators might still be solid, but wage growth has only <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383397/economy-inflation-2024-election-democrats-trump">narrowly outpaced</a> inflation. Consumers aren’t feeling flush with cash and slowing inflation does not mean <em>no</em> inflation. Interest rates have also stayed high, adding to the sense that things are expensive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">America might also be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/09/americans-conservative-obama-trump-joe-biden">a little more conservative</a> than Democrats thought, which is why Trump sought to portray Harris as an out-of-touch liberal. Maybe the Biden-Harris administration could have handled inflation better. But it’s vexed governments everywhere.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More than anything, people were simply frustrated: <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1669/general-mood-country.aspx">In an October Gallup poll</a>, 72 percent of US adults said they were dissatisfied with how things were going in the country. It’s going to be hard for any incumbent national leader to win in that environment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Let’s remember the state of the 2024 campaign <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/03/us/politics/poll-debate-biden-trump.html">after the Biden-Trump debate</a> and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/08/14/harris-energizes-democrats-in-transformed-presidential-race/">the clear evidence</a> of improvement in Democrats’ chances after Harris took over. She attempted to circumvent Americans’ anger with the status quo by running as the challenger even while she was the sitting vice president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it didn’t work, and maybe it never could. People were sick of the Biden-Harris administration. They wanted a change. That’s what Trump was selling.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What is Trump going to do?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s the big takeaway, beyond any specifics that could be subject to change: Trump is <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24159069/trump-guardrails-authoritarian-democracy-second-term">less likely to be constrained</a> by other Republicans, by advisers who are more loyal to the office than him personally, and by democratic norms than he was during his first term.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now for the specifics. The day after his victory, Trump’s campaign <a href="https://x.com/axios/status/1854167037586595937?s=46&amp;t=LVLwPwruc4koXd6hdIOe8Q">pledged</a> to start “the largest mass deportation operation” in US history on his first day back in office, a signal that he may be even more aggressive on his signature issue. He could enact those tariffs as he pleases <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/374102/trump-harris-tariffs-congress">unless Congress stops him in the next two months</a>. His team has <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-day-one-election-victory-karoline-leavitt-1981319">telegraphed</a> an immediate expansion of oil and gas exploration. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has <a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1852812012478398923">brashly said</a> that the Trump administration would advise the removal of fluoride from American water supplies on day one, a preview of the public health agenda likely to follow. We can also expect some kind of <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/donald-trump-election-federal-agencies">shake-up within the federal bureaucracy</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is worth sounding a note of caution, however. Trump signed the so-called “Muslim ban” on January 27, 2017, but <a href="https://www.aclu-wa.org/pages/timeline-muslim-ban">it was blocked by the courts</a>, including the Supreme Court. It took him a year and a half to get an altered version okayed by the judiciary. Likewise, Trump’s attempt to approve <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/13/18263675/medicaid-work-requirements-lawsuit-donald-trump">Medicaid work requirements</a> was later stopped by a federal judge. One of the biggest questions of a second Trump term is: How much will the judiciary restrain him, if his own people won’t?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Congress, Trump and Republicans are already hankering to cut more taxes and slash the social safety net. But actually passing those plans is still going to be hard. Control of the House is still undecided and even if the GOP wins it, their margin will be extremely thin. <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/31/16055960/why-obamacare-repeal-failed">The failure to repeal Obamacare in 2017</a> is a very recent example of a newly minted Republican majority’s top priority failing because of public backlash.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What does Trump&#8217;s election mean for the world?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before the election even occurred, one Vox reader asked us: Why do US elections matter so much for the rest of the world?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US has <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/ranked-us-military-officially-most-powerful-2024-208664">the most powerful military in the world</a>, it is one of the two most important diplomatic players in global affairs (<a href="https://www.lowyinstitute.org/china-beats-united-states-top-2024-global-diplomacy-index">though China has caught up</a>), and its foreign aid programs are <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-policy-101-the-u-s-government-and-global-health/">a vital lifeline for humanitarian efforts</a> around the world. On foreign policy in particular, Trump has plenty of discretion to do as he pleases without much or any input from Congress.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We know the consequences of this enormous power’s misuse. The US military has obviously been used for <a href="https://www.cfr.org/timeline/iraq-war">terrible ends</a>, US diplomacy can be <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2024/us-sanction-countries-work/">ineffectual</a>, and US-funded humanitarianism has a mixed track record.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That is why the fate of not only 330 million Americans but many millions more around the world was altered by Trump’s election.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/353037/trump-gaza-israel-protests-biden-election-2024">Israel’s war in Gaza</a>, the effort to contain <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/366903/mpox-monkeypox-africa-continental-emergency-drc-who-clade">mpox in Africa,</a> the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/354112/sudan-darfur-el-fasher-genocide-humanitarian-aid-neglect">famine in Sudan</a>, the war in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7vuV-cyHA">Ukraine</a>, Taiwan’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24047940/china-us-war-taiwan-japan-key-role-explained">future as an independent nation</a> — these are some of the high-profile issues over which Donald Trump, rather than Joe Biden or Kamala Harris, will have significant leverage and influence. PEPFAR, the AIDS relief program that became the signature success of the bipartisan global health consensus that took shape under George W. Bush, <a href="https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-u-s-presidents-emergency-plan-for-aids-relief-pepfar/">will need to be reauthorized next year</a>, and there are signs of Republican support <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24036223/pepfar-aids-hiv-africa-global-health-george-w-bush-republicans-congress">wavering</a>. Trump will hold the veto pen during that congressional debate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What will actually happen? I don’t know. But I know Trump’s election has defined what will be possible.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What do Democrats do now?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I want to briefly hand the newsletter over to Vox senior political reporter Christian Paz, who sat down with Explain It To Me podcast host Jonquilyn Hill to analyze this year’s election and has as good of a read on the state of the Democratic Party as anyone:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">There&#8217;s still this assumption that a diversifying America would inevitably lead to progressive or liberal or Democratic dominance, regardless of other factors, which once again, keeps being proven wrong and wrong.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">In fact, this election will be one where racial polarization decreases, especially among Latino voters. They voted similarly or in the similar direction or similar swing as white voters. The Democrats got the turnout they wanted, but it turns out that the voters that were turning out just didn&#8217;t want to vote for a Democrat.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">The Democrats bet a lot on educated and suburban voters, while expecting to maintain their previous margins with working-class voters of color and snagging enough white working-class voters to push them over the top. That bet didn’t pay off.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It will take months for Democrats to figure out how to recalibrate going forward, in the 2026 midterms and beyond. Looking at the 2024 fallout so far, Christian said, “There&#8217;s a mixed bag [in terms] of just what it is that the electorate wants.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Democrats struggle to come to terms with the results of this week’s election, some young women are looking abroad for inspiration. Women across social media have been exploring an idea called 4B, a protest movement in South Korea that calls for women to boycott men. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Now I am, how you say this, a ho, but I really want to get behind this 4B movement,” <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jhordanthemodel/video/7434529048241458462">begins one TikToker</a>, who goes on to say she approves of women withholding sex from men. “After this election — where women were pretty much told to their faces that no one gives a shit about them — don’t forget, ladies, we do have power. And you know the kind of power I’m talking about. Giving up our bodies to men is a choice. We don’t have to do this.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The TikTok tag <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/search/video?q=4bmovement&amp;t=1731019154913">#4bmovement currently has thousands of posts</a> with millions of views, and Google search interest in the term <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=now%207-d&amp;geo=US&amp;q=4b&amp;hl=en">spiked after the election</a>. Some of the social media posters are clearly joking out of a combination of rage, stress, and sadness — but others are more serious. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Once you can get out of your mind that you will not be missing out by engaging in this behavior, you will be better off,” <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@professionalsassatron/video/7434571070348332330">one earnest TikToker says</a>. “I encourage you to reclaim your power and have really honest conversations with yourself about whether being in a romantic relationship with men at this point in time is worth it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For a certain cohort of young American women, Donald Trump’s decisive victory appears to represent a breaking point. After the overturning of <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, the reelection of the man who destroyed it, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/us/trump-voters-reactions.html">the virulent glee of a number of his male supporters at both</a>, some are toying with the idea of opting out of dealing with men altogether. Trump was elected in part by a generation of <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/383364/gen-z-podcasts-trump-win-joe-rogan-bros">men steeped in hyper-macho rhetoric</a> about putting women in their place from figures like Andrew Tate. To the women distressed with the ascendance of these toxic bros, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysistrata">Lysistrata</a> solution seems not only justified but also potentially effective.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The birth of 4B</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The 4B campaign developed primarily among feminist Korean Twitter users in 2017 and 2018 in conjunction with South Korea’s Me Too movement. It stems in part from the earlier and more popular tal-corset or Escape the Corset movement, which called for participants to cut their hair short or shave their heads, give up makeup, and abandon overtly feminine clothes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Named after the Korean prefix bi, or no, adherents are asked to follow four prohibitions: No heterosexual marriage, no heterosexual dating, no heterosexual sex, and no childbearing under any circumstances. While it’s hard to know how many South Korean women participate in 4B, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191207051222/https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east-asia/article/3041058/why-south-korean-women-are-turning-their-backs-sex-marriage-and">the group self-reports a membership of 4,000 followers</a>. It’s niche, but it’s made itself heard in Korea and around the world. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Both 4B and Escape the Corset are born of a society with strict gender norms and stringent beauty standards, and developed as a response to what participants see as the dehumanization of women in their culture.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One inflection point came in 2015, the year of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/6/5/8735037/what-is-mers-virus">MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus) epidemic</a>, when a misogynistic smear campaign accused two Korean women of visiting MERS-plagued Hong Kong and refusing to test themselves before returning home. The whole MERS epidemic, the theory went, was the fault of two thoughtless, selfish, and flighty women. The internet lit up with violently sexist hate speech —&nbsp;but the story was untrue.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Groups of women, outraged by the misogyny, started gathering on a MERS forum to talk about how they were done with men. In time, those online communities began to spill out into dedicated feminist websites, real-world rallies, and, eventually, the Escape the Corset movement.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1177477181">The beauty expectations of South Korea are famously strict</a>;&nbsp;the country is home to the most plastic surgeons per capita of any other country in the world by far. As women joining the Escape the Corset movement began opting out of the beauty industry, they had a measurable effect on South Korea’s economy, with women in their 20s buying significantly <a href="https://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1206&amp;context=dignity">fewer cosmetics, hair products, and other beauty products</a> in 2018 than they did in 2016, and plastic surgery expenditures going down by $58.3 billion in the same time period.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">New fronts kept opening up in Korea’s gender wars over the next several years. In 2016, a 34-year-old man <a href="https://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/744756.html">stabbed to death a random woman</a> in her 20s in Seoul’s busy Gangnam neighborhood, saying, “I did it because women have always ignored me.”</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>If women’s sole social value was to be breeding animals and sexual objects, declared practitioners of 4B, then they would simply decline either to breed or to self-objectify.</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The same year, the South Korean government unveiled a new initiative targeted at improving the country’s birth rate with a “birth map,” rendered in shades of pink to rank towns and cities by the number of women of childbearing age. “They counted fertile women like they counted the number of livestock,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/30/world/asia/south-korea-fertility-birth-map.html">one feminist blogger wrote at the time</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/asia-pacific/south-korean-woman-jailed-over-nude-photo-of-male-model-1.3594777">More protests erupted in 2018</a> after a woman was imprisoned when she photographed a nude male model in her art class after he declined to cover his genitals during a class break, sharing the pictures on the internet to shame him. In South Korea, molka, or digital sex crimes involving nonconsensual images of women, <a href="https://www.codastory.com/authoritarian-tech/molka-digital-sex-crimes-south-korea/">had become a flourishing industry</a>, supplied by men armed with pinhole cameras waiting to videotape unsuspecting women in bathrooms, subway stations, or motel rooms. Despite a vocal protest movement pushing for stricter laws, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/asia-pacific/south-korean-woman-jailed-over-nude-photo-of-male-model-1.3594777">only 9 percent of molka perpetrators</a>, mostly men, receive jail time. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2018, however, the woman in the art class was arrested, tried, and sentenced to 10 months in prison.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For feminist activists, the incident epitomized the double standards under which South Korean law enforcement operated. Men who committed crimes against women were ignored or given a slap on the wrist, while women who committed those same crimes against men got the book thrown at them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For all of these problems —&nbsp;the sex crimes committed with impunity, the dehumanizing government initiatives, the law enforcement that only punished women — a solution became, eventually, 4B.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If women’s sole social value was to be breeding animals and sexual objects, declared practitioners of 4B, then they would simply decline either to breed or to self-objectify. They would opt out. They wouldn’t just forswear makeup. They would forswear marriage and sex and children. They would devote their lives to building their autonomy.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4B in the US?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The tenets of 4B are extremely different from the kinds of feminism that tend to flourish in the US, where popular culture places a premium on choice and empowerment. Mainstream feminist campaigns here usually celebrate women’s ability to make their own decisions and do whatever makes them feel best as individuals.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The point of 4B and Escape the Corset, however, is not to make women feel more fulfilled or more at home in their bodies. It is also not to put pressure on men as individuals to reform their ways. The point of 4B is to send a message about the structure of society — to say it’s not acceptable that you are valued only for your fertility and sexual appeal — and to ensure your independence. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In <a href="https://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1206&amp;context=dignity">an academic paper</a> about the movement, author Hyejung Park translates a 2019 video from the South Korean activist group SOLOdarity: “It is true that <em>tal-corset</em> [Escape the Corset] comes with some inconveniences,” the activists allow. “When your hair is short, you might have to get a haircut more frequently, and you might need to buy a whole new wardrobe for <em>tal-corset.</em> Nevertheless, we practice <em>tal-corset</em> because it is not about being more comfortable. It is about not being a doll, a second-class citizen.”</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>It supposes a world that so emphatically decenters men and their desires for women that men themselves disappear from a woman’s life. </p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The idea of refusing to wear skirts for the sake of your politics, even if you like them, is an attitude that has been out of favor in American feminism since <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/3/20/16955588/feminism-waves-explained-first-second-third-fourth">the end of the second wave</a> in the 1970s. Still, there is a discipline and a radicalism to this form of activism that you can easily understand feeling attractive for America’s angry young women in this moment. It supposes a world that so emphatically decenters men and their desires for women that men themselves disappear from a woman’s life. After the US elected <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/381187/trump-access-hollywood-video-gen-z-tiktok">a symbol of masculine aggression and violence</a> to our highest office for the second time, a person can see the appeal.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The idea of such severe and uncompromising protest also makes sense considering the reams of smirking rape jokes that the mere discussion of 4B online has provoked. Many American 4B TikToks have comments from men under them crowing, “Your body, my choice,” a refrain that young fans of far-right influencer <a href="https://x.com/ItsSamG/status/1854198526126805320">Nick Fuentes</a> have reportedly <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/helenofcoy.bsky.social/post/3laen4pavhu2p">taken to parroting in schools</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“[W]omen threatening sex strikes like LMAO as if you have a say,” <a href="https://x.com/millerstream/status/1854247807735214298?s=46&amp;t=QLlX84ipkW3wjTELsZO2AQ">a post from one X account</a> with 122,000 followers went. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s worth remembering, though, that the divide between left and right in this country does not neatly map across gender divides. While we won’t know until later how the numbers break down, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2024/exit-polls-2024-election/">early exit polls say</a> 45 percent of all women and 53 percent of white women voted for Trump. Trump surrounds himself with enabling women, and the likes of Marjorie Tyler Greene <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/marjorie-taylor-greene-aoc-gender-politics/2021/05/14/c4c8d032-b405-11eb-a980-a60af976ed44_story.html">gleefully shriek misogyny</a> across the floors of Congress. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A possible lesson of the Women’s March era — that feminist reaction to the first Trump term — is this: Uniting in a large group as a pure expression of rage is not always sustainable. The Women’s March collapsed because of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/the-womens-march-in-year-3-can-the-movement-overcome-a-year-of-controversy-and-division/2019/01/17/0eb23740-18c9-11e9-8813-cb9dec761e73_story.html">vicious infighting</a>, which is traditionally <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23528531">what happens to large leftist groups in the US</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps it’s time for American feminism to get specific and disciplined about its action points. 4B is specific and it is disciplined, which is part of what makes it difficult to translate out of its cultural context and into America. It is clear on its goals, which are to take personal autonomy through the force of one’s own denial, rather than to ask for it at the polls or in interpersonal relationships.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A line of inquiry American feminists might take from 4B is this: What are you going to work toward? And what are you going to do to get there?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The president of the United States proved himself capable of speaking in complete sentences during a press conference Thursday night.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This was notable because, before the presser, President Joe Biden’s competence at the most rudimentary aspects of public speaking had come into doubt. At both the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357788/biden-trump-debate-winners-losers">first presidential debate</a> in late June and his interview <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/359160/biden-abc-news-interview-drop-out">with ABC News</a> last week, Biden repeatedly failed to produce coherent English on command.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a perfectly rational world, the abysmal quality of Biden’s previous public performances should have <em>raised</em> the bar for him at Thursday’s press conference: If you just demonstrated that you’re a dreadful candidate at your worst, then winning your party’s confidence should require showing that you are an absolutely <em>brilliant</em> one at your best. Otherwise, why should your co-partisans tolerate your manifest unreliability?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But this is not how all Democrats see things.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many in the party are reluctant to publicly defy their president, who has made his desire to stay in the 2024 race clear. And they also have <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/02/16/senior-democrats-joe-biden-old-00083129">little faith in Vice President Kamala Harris</a>, who is by far the most likely Democrat to replace Biden at the top of the ticket. For these reasons, some Democratic lawmakers would like to believe that the case for Biden to step aside isn’t crystal clear. But the president’s disastrous debate performance forced such Democrats to entertain the idea that Biden was an anchor around their party’s neck. As the press revealed that Biden had been <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/joe-biden-age-public-election-campaign-343a47bf">suffering such mental lapses</a> with increasing frequency — and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/03/us/politics/poll-debate-biden-trump.html">polls</a> showed the president and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/12/us/politics/democrats-biden-battleground-states.html">his party</a> slipping — the ranks of the rebellion-curious swelled. Before Thursday’s press conference, CBS News <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/potentially-dozens-of-democrats-expected-to-call-on-biden-to-step-aside-after-nato-conference/">reported</a> that “dozens” of congressional Democrats were considering calling for Biden’s exit after the event.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet some of these reluctant rebels evidently found cause for wavering in Biden’s news conference.<strong> </strong>Between the end of that presser and midday Friday, only a handful of Democratic lawmakers called on him to step aside. Others, meanwhile, declared themselves reassured. “I think he convinced a lot of people he should stay in the race,” Rep. Steve Cohen (R-TN) <a href="https://x.com/AC360/status/1811569212558606408">told CNN</a>. Chris Coons, a Democratic senator from Biden’s home state of Delaware, <a href="https://x.com/ChrisCoonsforDE/status/1811559710945874239#">declared</a>, “Tonight President Biden was knowledgeable, engaging, and capable.”<br></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democrats skeptic of Biden’s candidacy suggested that his performance had set back their cause. In New York Times reporter Annie Karni’s <a href="https://x.com/anniekarni/status/1811564428258607505">summary</a> of their thinking, “This may make an already very slow decision process even slower.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Democrats must not succumb to the gross irresponsibility of low expectations. Nothing Biden did Thursday evening indicated that sticking with him is the Democratic Party’s best bet. And Democrats have a civic duty to put forward the strongest possible candidate, given that their defeat would bring an insurrectionist back to power.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To give Biden his due, his performance Thursday night did suggest that he remains competent to perform his office’s basic functions — certainly, <em>more</em> competent to do so than his Republican challenger. The president demonstrated fluency in foreign affairs and an ability to intelligibly convey his thoughts, at least much of the time. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This said, the rigor and cogency of his remarks on geopolitics have been <a href="https://x.com/AndrewJBates46/status/1811553625572790488">grossly exaggerated</a>. To take just one example: At the NATO summit, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pressed the United States to give his country greater latitude for using American weapons offensively. Zelenskyy argued that Ukraine could not win the war without greater freedom to strike military targets within Russia. A reporter asked Biden whether he found this argument persuasive. Here was <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/07/11/remarks-by-president-biden-in-press-conference-9/">Biden’s reply</a>, according to the White House transcript:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>We have allowed Zelenskyy to use American weapons in the near term, in the near-abroad into Russia.  Whether or not he has — we should be — he should be attacked — for example, should Zelenskyy — he’s not, but if he had the capacity to strike Moscow, strike the Kremlin, would that make sense? It wouldn’t.</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>The question is: What’s the best use of the weaponry he has and the weaponry we’re getting to him? I’ve gotten him more HIMAR— I got him more long-range capacity as well as defensive capacity. </em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>And so, our military is worki— I’m following the advice of my commander-in-chief — my — my — of the — the chief of staff of the military as well as the secretary of Defense and our intelligence people.  </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the start of this answer, Biden struggles to articulate a coherent thought. By the end, he’s said enough to convey the broad outlines of his position to the already well-informed: He is worried about getting into a direct conflict with a nuclear superpower, so he doesn’t want Ukraine to be able to fire American weapons at major Russian cities. He thinks that he has provided Ukraine with all necessary weaponry, but he is prepared to make adjustments, should his military advisors instruct him to do so.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, he did not articulate these ideas in a manner that would render them comprehensible to the typical voter. And even a more pristinely worded version of his answer would still be light on substance; Biden did not acknowledge that Ukraine has been losing ground for a long time now, nor did he explain how this trajectory could be reversed in the absence of a shift in US policy. In other words, he did not really engage with the argument he intended to rebut. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the substance of Biden’s remarks was mediocre, the presentation was something much worse. The president sounded frail and coughed frequently. He failed to read his opening address off the teleprompter without stumbling over his words repeatedly. He referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as “Vice President Trump.” A <a href="https://x.com/PeterHamby/status/1811604490962804877">clip</a> of the latter gaffe rapidly amassed more than 8 million views on TikTok.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This performance did not amount to a convincing case that Democrats can best prevent Donald Trump’s election with Biden as their leader. Yet on Thursday, the president suggested that he should not <em>need</em> to make such a case. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Asked whether he would step down if his team presented him with polling showing that Harris would fare better against Trump, Biden replied, “No, unless they came back and said, ‘There’s no way you can win.’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The president’s poll numbers <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/">have fallen</a> since the debate (before which he was already on track to lose, according to the polls). But it would be an overstatement to say that he cannot possibly win. Polarization has put a hard floor under Biden’s support. If he sweeps Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, he will likely win reelection. He is more than <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/pennsylvania/trump-vs-biden">5 points behind Trump</a> in Pennsylvania, according to RealClearPolitics’s polling average, but trailing Trump by <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/michigan/trump-vs-biden">smaller</a> <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/wisconsin/trump-vs-biden">margins</a> in the other two. It would not take an extraordinarily large polling error — or a historically unprecedented shift in political winds — for Biden to prevail. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet if Biden believes what he says about Donald Trump, then he should not find the fact that his odds of victory aren’t 0 percent especially reassuring.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The president is historically unpopular, and has been so for the majority of his term. His <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/">approval rating</a> sits near 37 percent. Many voters blame him for inflation, and (<a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/24137666/trump-agenda-inflation-prices-dollar-devaluation-tariffs">mistakenly</a>) <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/trump-trusted-biden-inflation-top-issue-voters-poll/story?id=110343680">have more faith</a> in Trump’s ability to bring prices down. And <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/03/us/politics/poll-debate-biden-trump.html">more than 70 percent</a> consider Biden too old to serve another term. He failed to catch up with Trump in swing states before the debate, even when the media’s attention was focused on the Republican’s felony convictions and the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/355756/joe-biden-campaign-ad-trump-convicted-criminal">GOP had yet to begin seriously advertising against him</a>. It is highly unlikely that Biden will have an easier time gaining ground, now that 1) he has repeatedly validated the electorate’s concerns about his cognitive decline, 2) the press has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/joe-biden-age-public-election-campaign-343a47bf">revealed that his team</a> has been willfully misleading the public about his condition, and 3) his every misstatement from here until Election Day is certain to attract outsize media scrutiny. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is possible the polls are wrong. But in both 2016 and 2020, they <em>overestimated</em> Democrats’ support. It is not prudent to assume that a hypothetical polling error is concealing Biden’s strength rather than overstating it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kamala Harris is not an ideal candidate. And she would very likely be Biden’s replacement. But she does have <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/">a lower disapproval</a> rating than the president, and performs <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/09/biden-clinton-harris-democrat-poll-00166937">better</a> than him <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oLv3PqktVHZ1bKWZJzGct7ADi9qTqJZWpNALJsD_ZiA/edit?gid=1892265243#gid=1892265243">against Trump</a> in several recent polls. Above all, she is a competent, coherent public speaker who comes across as neither ancient nor deeply weird, a quality that favorably distinguishes her from the major parties’ current standard-bearers. I think some Democrats have forgotten what a normal presidential candidate sounds like. I’d encourage those impressed with Biden’s performance Thursday night to view it — side by side — with Harris’s remarks in North Carolina that same day:</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our Vice President Harris gave a fantastic speech in North Carolina today about what Joe Biden has accomplished, and what Donald Trump wants to do. <a href="https://t.co/FT9Tjxz3Ya">pic.twitter.com/FT9Tjxz3Ya</a></p>&mdash; Leia🌻 (@TheSWPrincess) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSWPrincess/status/1811570795505758434?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 12, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Common sense suggests that a political party will not maximize its odds of victory by nominating a profoundly <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/">unpopular</a> 81-year old who is trailing badly in the polls, unable to reliably speak coherently, and believed to be unfit to serve another term by the vast majority of voters. And a dispassionate read of the available data says the same. Democrats should not be satisfied with a standard-bearer who can sometimes convey the impression of bare competence when speaking publicly. And Biden should not be satisfied with retaining <em>an outside chance</em> of beating Trump. The Democratic Party must field the strongest possible candidate this November, so as to minimize the odds of an authoritarian insurrectionist taking power. Biden’s performance Thursday night confirmed that he is no longer that candidate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After Hurricane Beryl made landfall in southeast Texas at <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-beryl-texas-7dfd5353671ee30d0c6d11518ea5a370">Category 1 strength earlier this week</a>, it left <a href="https://www.click2houston.com/sports/2024/07/11/am-i-officially-a-houstonian-now-texans-lineman-tytus-howard-documents-flooding-aftermath-of-hurricane-beryl/">extensive flooding</a> and power outages for <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-beryl-texas-7dfd5353671ee30d0c6d11518ea5a370">nearly 3 million homes and businesses</a> in its wake. As of Friday morning, more than <a href="https://poweroutage.us/area/state/texas">a million electricity customers in Texas are still in the dark</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/358323/hurricane-beryl-rapid-intesification-caribbean-climate">Hurricane Beryl</a> was unprecedented in many ways — it marked the earliest time in the hurricane season that <a href="https://www.starnewsonline.com/story/news/local/2024/07/11/what-hurricane-beryl-the-earliest-category-5-storm-could-mean-for-nc/74288495007/">a tropical storm grew to Category 5 strength</a> when it reached that level on <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/category-5-hurricane-beryl-makes-explosive-start-2024-atlantic-season">July 2</a> — yet it was also predictable. So were its consequences. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Extraordinarily <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/2024/2/28/24085691/atlantic-ocean-warming-climate-change-hurricanes-coral-reefs-bleaching">warm waters in the Atlantic Ocean</a> served as fuel for the storm while a rising La Niña in the <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24145756/la-nina-2024-el-nino-heat-hurricane-record-temperature-pacific">Pacific Ocean</a> created a fertile atmosphere for hurricane formation, allowing Beryl’s winds to whip up to <a href="https://www.providencejournal.com/story/weather/2024/07/01/hurricane-berly-category-4-tracker-maps-spaghetti-model/74266076007/">170 miles per hour</a>. Scientists tracking these trends have been warning of an “<a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-predicts-above-normal-2024-atlantic-hurricane-season">above-normal</a>” hurricane season for months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the storm’s impacts on vulnerable infrastructure and its convergence with severe temperatures were just as foreseeable.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beryl is the latest example of a <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/352234/how-one-weather-extreme-can-make-the-next-one-even-more-dangerous">compound disaster</a>, where multiple extreme weather events intersect at the same time, or where the fallout from one exacerbates the damages from another.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">It’s just one thing after another</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beryl struck a region that’s still recovering from destruction caused by wind and water this year. The Houston area experienced severe flooding at the beginning of May after a torrential downpour drenched the area in upward of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/houston-texas-flooding-severe-weather-117b0f63c9bd53be31ee34e11547da21">23 inches of rain</a>. A band of intense thunderstorms known as a <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/152843/derecho-darkens-houston">derecho then galloped across Texas</a> on May 16 and charged into Houston, tearing off roofs, shattering windows, and knocking down power lines. Another burst of thunderstorms and tornadoes erupted over Memorial Day weekend, lashing Houston with winds up to <a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/05/at-least-23-killed-in-long-weekend-swarm-of-severe-weather/">88 miles per hour</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These back-to-back storms <a href="https://houstonlanding.org/houstonians-left-in-the-dark-by-centerpoint-turn-to-social-media-to-tackle-power-outages/">stressed infrastructure and depleted emergency resources</a>. They also left little time to rebuild, let alone harden streets, power lines, and sewer systems against future disasters.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then Beryl brought its own suite of destruction. It pushed a life-threatening storm surge onto the coast, dumped <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/07/08/hurricane-beryl-texas-damage-updates-rain/">up to 15 inches of rain</a>, and even <a href="https://www.foxweather.com/weather-news/beryl-landfall-texas-hurricane">spawned tornadoes</a> that pushed trees over into homes and utility poles. Power companies are warning residents to stay at least <a href="https://houstonlanding.org/these-houston-areas-received-the-strongest-wind-gusts-during-hurricane-beryl/">35 feet away from downed power lines</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">CenterPoint did apply for a <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/doe-rejected-houston-grid-improvement-a-year-before-beryl-blackout-2/">$100 million grant</a> last year from the US Department of Energy to bolster its wires and poles to withstand severe weather, but the agency denied the proposal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Houston Mayor John Whitmire laid some of the blame for the slow recovery on a lack of preparation on the part of the city before he took office. “Yes, I’m angry at the level of neglect at this stage,” he <a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/city-of-houston/2024/07/11/493278/houston-mayor-whitmire-says-beryl-exposed-gaps-in-citys-storm-preparedness/">told the city council</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The city is no stranger to severe weather, and its flat, paved, low-lying terrain has long made it <a href="https://www.click2houston.com/sports/2024/07/11/am-i-officially-a-houstonian-now-texans-lineman-tytus-howard-documents-flooding-aftermath-of-hurricane-beryl/">notorious for flooding</a>. The most vivid example was <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/8/24/16198030/hurricane-harvey-2017-texas-gulf-corpus-christi-galveston-houston">Hurricane Harvey</a> seven years ago, which doused Houston with an <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/8/28/16217626/harvey-houston-flood-water-visualized">extraordinary 27 trillion gallons of water</a>, the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/08/hurricane-harvey-is-the-rainiest-atlantic-hurricane-ever-measured/538407/">rainiest hurricane ever measured in the Atlantic</a>. It racked up <a href="https://tdem.texas.gov/disasters/hurricane-harvey">$125 billion in damages</a>, making it the second most costly hurricane to make landfall in the continental US after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And the state of Texas has become infamous for the <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/23144696/texas-grid-energy-market-blackouts-heatwave-winter-storm">weaknesses in its energy infrastructure</a>. The Texas power grid is largely isolated from its neighbors so it can’t easily draw power from other states when its supply is disrupted. Its freewheeling state energy market prioritizes abundant cheap electricity over maintaining backup power reserves and investments to protect against severe weather.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These factors combined to cause widespread blackouts across the state after <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/2/16/22284140/texas-blackout-outage-winter-storm-uri-ercot-power-grid-cold-snow-austin-houston-dallas">Winter Storm Uri</a> in 2021 froze natural gas pipelines, coal piles, wind turbines, and solar panels just as chilly Texans cranked up the heat. The state is also struggling to keep up with <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/23893057/power-electricity-grid-heat-wave-record-blackout-outage-climate">summertime energy demand</a> as average temperatures rise and cooling needs grow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The future is likely to pose even greater challenges. Texas’s <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/12/19/texas-2023-population-growth-census/">population is growing</a>, so there will be more people who will need more energy. And climate change is worsening the effects of many of these disasters, raising average temperatures and water levels. That means more Texans are likely to end up in harm’s way when a disaster strikes. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This pattern is repeating across many parts of the world. Much of humanity will remain haunted by past disasters as the specters of more catastrophes lurk over the horizon. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mitigating these risks thus requires thinking beyond hurricanes as stand-alone events, and instead as phenomena built on the wreckage of past storms whose shock waves will reverberate for years to come. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Six years ago, the Trump administration’s “<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/5/8/17327512/sessions-illegal-immigration-border-asylum-families">zero tolerance</a>” policy at the southern border went into effect. Thousands of immigrant families <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/us/politics/family-separation-border-immigration-jeff-sessions-rod-rosenstein.html#click=https://t.co/6MuLwtCuru">were split up</a>; migrant children were taken and kept <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/5/8/17327512/sessions-illegal-immigration-border-asylum-families">separately</a> while their parents awaited prosecution. The images and sounds of caged children stunned the nation, and the outcry was swift: Democrats rallied against then-President Donald Trump, protests swept the country, and public opinion was <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/6/18/17475740/family-separation-poll-polling-border-trump-children-immigrant-families-parents">sharply against Trump</a>’s policy. Immigration soared to become a top concern <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/261500/mentions-immigration-top-problem-surpass-record-high.aspx">again</a>, and the share of Americans saying immigration was a good thing for the country jumped. That sentiment <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1660/immigration.aspx">continued to grow</a> during the rest of Trump’s presidency.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, things look much different. Americans <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/611135/immigration-surges-top-important-problem-list.aspx">once again</a> view immigration as the country’s <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx">single most important problem</a>, but public sentiment appears to have taken a sharp<strong> </strong>turn to the negative. Polling this spring and summer seems to suggest that a significant share of American voters — not just Republicans — are warming up to the idea of tough-on-immigration policy proposals and rhetoric.</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Inside this story</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Numerous polls suggest the American public is souring on immigration,&nbsp;with even Democratic voters showing more interest in Donald Trump’s policy proposals for mass deportations. It’s a reversal of the public’s several-decades-long trend of increasing sympathy and appreciation for immigrants. This piece lays out three reasons for this surprising trend in public opinion.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/647123/sharply-americans-curb-immigration.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_campaign=syndication" data-type="link" data-id="https://news.gallup.com/poll/647123/sharply-americans-curb-immigration.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_campaign=syndication">According to Gallup</a>, 2024 is the first time since 2005 that most of the public have wanted less immigration, and this year marks the largest share of Americans feeling resistant to immigration since 58 percent said so in 2001.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And those shifts are happening across party lines: Gallup notes in its most recent public opinion report that the desire to decrease immigration has jumped 15 percentage points among Republicans, 11 points among independents, and 10 points among Democrats — the group most supportive of immigration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">An Axios poll from April suggested <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/04/25/trump-biden-americans-illegal-immigration-poll">42 percent of Democrats</a> would support mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. Other polls have also found an anti-immigrant shift in the public’s mood. Gallup’s <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1660/immigration.aspx">long-term tracking poll</a>, which has been running since the 1960s, shows a more general decline in the share of Americans who want to increase rates of immigration or keep them the same.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Conversely, the portion of Americans who want to decrease immigration has spiked: <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/647123/sharply-americans-curb-immigration.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_campaign=syndication" data-type="link" data-id="https://news.gallup.com/poll/647123/sharply-americans-curb-immigration.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_campaign=syndication">55 percent </a>of Americans feel this way, up from a low point of 28 percent in 2020.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This shift against immigration is happening even as the general American consensus has been moving in favor of immigrants over the last few decades. In 1994, for example, 63 percent of Americans believed that immigrants were a “burden” to the country; only 31 percent said immigrants strengthen the country, according to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/01/31/majority-of-americans-continue-to-say-immigrants-strengthen-the-u-s/">Pew Research Center</a> data. By 2019, those dynamics had flipped: 62 percent of Americans believed immigrants were an asset to the nation; only 28 percent thought they were a burden.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, with the public seemingly <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24153132/us-border-crisis-mexico-migrant-immigration-asylum">lurching</a> to the right on immigration, politicians are moving accordingly. There’s been a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-immigration-asylum-border-congress-7507034034ba49a8f170777600cad46e">rightward</a> pivot by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/immigration-biden-trump-election-3e27793981ecda46d1b87d996f04dce0">Biden</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/democrats-border-security-task-force-seeks-redefine-party-immigration-rcna143039">congressional Democrats</a>, and Trump —&nbsp;who built his first campaign on demonizing immigrants (and particularly immigrants of color) —&nbsp;has stepped up his constant attacks on the Biden administration’s immigration policy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So what explains the American public’s souring mood on immigrants and immigration?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though there are no simple answers, pollsters and immigration researchers offer a few explanations that can be roughly sorted into three theories.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first theory centers the role of elected officials — specifically Republicans, and more specifically Trump. As Republicans left power and shifted into opposition mode, they’ve refocused attention on immigration as a threat to American identity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other experts argue the economy — particularly inflation&nbsp;and the public’s “scarcity mindset” —&nbsp;has made more Americans critical of immigration. When the public feels as though the economy is booming and there&#8217;s plenty to go around, they feel more open to sharing that wealth. But when people perceive the economy to be tenuous, like after the pandemic when inflation took off, Americans feel more hesitant to share with outsiders.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A third group argues that the anti-immigrant turn is being driven by concerns about the rule of law and social disorder. This theory posits that the post-pandemic surge in crime, combined with heightened media coverage of disorder in public, prompted greater concerns from Americans about security and quality of life —&nbsp;concerns that were then also applied to the border and people trying to cross it without documentation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Theory 1: It’s the politicians&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s first presidential campaign — starting <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/06/16/theyre-rapists-presidents-trump-campaign-launch-speech-two-years-later-annotated/">quite literally</a> with his announcement speech —&nbsp;was built on demonizing immigrants and claiming that open borders were destroying America. But that created a rhetorical tension once he took office, as he had to claim that the problem was rapidly improving thanks to his new anti-immigration measures.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since Joe Biden took office, he has <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/01/20/joe-biden-trump-immigration/">pledged</a> a more open, humanitarian approach to immigration and border politics. He paused construction on a border wall; he issued new protections for DACA recipients, and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/20/fact-sheet-president-biden-sends-immigration-bill-to-congress-as-part-of-his-commitment-to-modernize-our-immigration-system/">sent</a> a new immigration bill to Congress. He essentially sought to create the <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/news/first-100-days-office-biden-executive-actions">sharpest contrast</a> possible with Donald Trump’s legacy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That shift, however, created the perfect opportunity for Republicans, led by Trump, to once again cast immigration and immigrants as a threat to American identity. The surge in illegal border crossings and legal asylum seekers that followed the pandemic —&nbsp;as well as this liberalizing of migration policy —&nbsp;were fodder for the fear-mongering and exploitation of racial and social fears. And right-wing politicians and commentators have routinely played up this threat, unifying immigrant-skeptical Americans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The lead-up to the 2022 midterms and the 2024 campaign so far provide evidence of this shift. While the 2020 campaign centered on the pandemic and the economy, once Biden took over, Republican candidates across the country shifted into talk about “open borders.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For example, the pro-immigration groups America’s Voice and Immigration Hub <a href="https://theimmigrationhub.org/new-report-gop-revs-up-anti-immigrant-ads-and-misinformation">in 2021 tracked an increase</a> in mentions of the terms “Biden-Harris border crisis” and “mass amnesty” in paid advertising, as well as increased anti-immigrant discourse online. Once the midterm season picked up, more Republican campaign ads began to mention immigration negatively — <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/gop-campaign-ads-put-focus-immigration-inflation-n1294130">about one in five ads in March 2022</a>, for example. And in 2024, Republican candidates (most visibly Donald Trump) have also <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b60b2381aef1dbe876cd08f/t/663928fa7427034ec69088f8/1715022075139/Immigration+Hub+Memo_+Q1+AdImpact+Spending+Data.pdf">stepped up</a> talk of immigrant “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/26/us/politics/republicans-immigration-ads-election.html#:~:text=A%20campaign%20ad%20from%20a,a%20Senate%20seat%20in%20Michigan.">invasions</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s more recent framing of illegal immigration as “poisoning the blood of our country” is a key example of this more vitriolic talk of immigrants. And it fits into a longstanding history of American xenophobia; immigration scholars consider this kind of discourse a direct appeal to “in-groups”: existing communities that define themselves against “out-groups” like immigrants, and exploit suspicion and bigotry.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, this theory can’t fully explain the shift in negative sentiment since the pandemic. Republican politicians (including, famously, Trump) and right-wing media have previously led other cycles of outrage and panic over migration, “<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/1/18041710/migrant-caravan-america-trump-epistemic-crisis-democracy">caravans</a>,” and the southern border. Immigration was a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/11/7/18071658/fox-news-caravan-midterm-elections">key campaign point</a> for Republicans during the 2018 midterms, but support for immigration <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/508520/americans-value-immigration-concerns.aspx">continued to rise</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Theory 2: It’s the economy</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Americans feel good about their financial security and the health of the national economy, they also feel good about immigrants and immigration. That’s the lesson from the last few decades of Gallup polling, according to Jeff Jones, one of Gallup’s data and public opinion experts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We saw some declines around the Great Recession — favorable percentages were in the 50s — and then in 2018 and 2019, opinions were quite positive,” Jones told me. In fact, both Republicans and Democrats were more positive about immigration during that time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But after the pandemic and its ensuing inflation and interest rate hikes, economic sentiment took a nosedive, and anti-immigrant sentiment began to pick up as well.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These more recent swings also show up in a few of Gallup’s other tracking polls. When asked whether immigrants have a positive or negative effect on job opportunities, taxes, or the economy in general, negative sentiment <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1660/immigration.aspx">tended to increase</a> in the lead-up to the Great Recession but recovered after. A similar dynamic emerged before and after the pandemic: 43 percent of respondents said immigrants had a positive effect on the economy, while 31 percent said it had a negative effect. By 2023, respondents were nearly evenly divided: 39 percent to 38 percent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But economics alone don’t explain recent twists. Both economic conditions and sentiment about the economy have been improving more markedly over the last year, but the public’s anti-immigrant shift has <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/611135/immigration-surges-top-important-problem-list.aspx">been accelerating</a>. Clearly, something else is happening here.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Theory 3: It’s the “law-and-order” mindset</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Matthew Wright, a University of British Columbia political scientist who studies immigration, suggests a third complementary explanation: a renewed public desire for “law-and-order” policies prompted by the pandemic-era rise in crime and the Biden-era increase in border-crossing attempts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Compared to the lull in rates of immigration during the pandemic, the surge in border crossings <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24153132/us-border-crisis-mexico-migrant-immigration-asylum">in the last three years</a> was unprecedented, overwhelming what federal and local officials have been able to manage. That volume has resulted in dramatic scenes at the border, in border communities, and in big cities, where many asylum seekers have been moved.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wright suggests that a good chunk of Americans feel conflicting emotions that conflate illegal immigration, asylum seekers, and immigration in general with a sense of public disorder. They are torn between having sympathy for immigrants in general and feeling worried about public safety, order, and the rule of law. And they combine their feelings about the border with their attitudes about crime and governance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“In terms of what people are concerned about, the way I read these figures and these trends is that they&#8217;re mainly concerned about illegal immigration, and they&#8217;re mainly concerned about the border,” Wright said. “There&#8217;s something to be said for people being seriously uncomfortable with the idea that their country doesn&#8217;t have a border, that the border is not something we can enforce.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gallup polling also provides some clues of shifting sentiment here: In 2023, 47 percent of Americans said they believed immigrants had a worsening effect on crime in the US, up from 42 percent in 2019. And the share of Americans who say they personally worry a “great deal” specifically about <em>illegal</em> immigration has steadily increased since 2020 — from 32 percent in March 2020 to 48 percent in March of this year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To Wright, these findings complement other polling that shows a confounding mix of opinions on immigration. A not insignificant number of voters hold both these more critical views of immigration as well as generally open views: positive toward refugees, favoring reform of legal migration, and supporting pathways to citizenship for those already here.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This law-and-order theory suggests that these voters can hold competing ideas in their minds: not opposing migration, but wanting it done in an orderly manner. This theory also explains why Trump and Republicans may have a unique opening this year — to activate both nativist and bigoted attitudes in some voters, as well as to exploit fear of “chaos” and bad management.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“They can use a very simple message to capture different kinds of people: They can capture both the prejudicially motivated person and the pure law-and-order guy — that person is not expressly racist, necessarily, but values order in society,” Wright said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Update, July 12, 10:40 am ET:</strong> <em>This story, published May 24, has been updated to include new Gallup polling on the American public’s sentiments toward immigration.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The steamy and stifling Washington humidity poaching European diplomats through their business suits wasn’t the only cloud hanging over this week’s NATO summit. It had already been clear for weeks that the gathering, held in DC to commemorate the alliance’s founding here 75 years ago, would be shadowed by questions about the upcoming US presidential election. And that was before President Joe Biden’s disastrous June 27 debate, which made it increasingly likely that NATO leaders would soon be dealing with Donald Trump, not Biden, in the White House.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The debate between Biden and Trump is sort of an elephant in the room,” Rachel Rizzo, a senior fellow and expert on NATO at the Atlantic Council, told Vox. “And I think if you are a European ally, and you watched that debate, you’re probably concerned about Biden’s ability to win the election.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Speaking with reporters on Thursday, national security adviser Jake Sullivan denied that any allies had expressed concerns about Biden’s performance in office. On the contrary, he said, he had heard “a drumbeat of praise for the United States, but also for President Biden, personally, for what he’s done to strengthen NATO.” <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/11/nato-allies-weakened-biden-trump-return-00167424">Reporting from</a> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-05/biden-s-allies-abroad-think-it-s-untenable-for-him-to-stay-on">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/biden-age-concerns-world-leaders-democrats-6d753921">news outlets</a> suggests otherwise, but whatever misgiving these allies might have, they have little incentive to bring them up in public.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“No European leader is going to come out and disparage the US president,” Rizzo noted. “It doesn’t help to come to Washington and tell everyone you’re freaking out about this.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Any hopes Biden would be able to use the summit to reassure his critics about his fitness for the campaign were dashed on Thursday afternoon when he accidentally introduced President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine as “President Putin” — the man currently trying to kill Zelenskyy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether he stays on the ticket or not, it’s looking increasingly likely that Biden, a longtime fixture of the US foreign policy establishment and a longtime supporter of the transatlantic alliance, may only have a few months left in office.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Zelenskyy <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/razom-z-amerikoyu-svit-zdaten-robiti-pravilni-rechi-vistup-v-92045">put it somewhat obliquely in a speech</a> in Washington on Tuesday, “Let’s be candid and frank. Now everyone is waiting for November.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Waiting on Trump</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s skepticism about the value of long-term alliances, which he largely sees as opportunities for countries to free-ride on American security guarantees and defense spending, was arguably the most consistent through line of his foreign policy as president. The prospect of his return has stoked fear about the future of those alliances. The Japanese press has even coined a word for this anxiety: “<a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/03/21/japan/politics/donald-trump-moshitora-japan/">moshitora</a>,” or “what if Trump?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There has long been a special place <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/closer-trumps-years-criticizing-nato-defense-spending/story?id=107201586">in Trump’s ire for</a> NATO, which he has called “obsolete” and “<a href="https://www.axios.com/2018/06/28/donald-trump-foreign-policy-europe-nato-allies-worried">as bad as NAFTA</a>.” (NAFTA, in Trump’s protectionist view, was <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/nafta-under-trump-the-myths-and-the-possibilities/">about as bad as international deals get</a>.) Trump <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/natosource/trump-confirms-he-threatened-to-withdraw-from-nato/">threatened</a> on several occasions as president to pull out of the alliance, and advisers say he<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/04/bolton-says-trump-might-have-pulled-us-out-nato-if-he-had-been-reelected/"> likely would have</a> if he had been reelected in 2020. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s main complaint was that a significant number of NATO members had long failed to meet the alliance’s target of spending 2 percent of their GDP on defense. That complaint wasn’t a new one — former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush voiced <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/11/obama-and-bush-also-pressed-nato-allies-to-spend-more-on-defense.html">the same</a> complaint — though Trump’s comments suggested misleadingly that these countries owed money to<em> </em>NATO, or even to the US. (They didn’t and don’t — the target, which is nonbinding, refers to countries’ spending on their <em>own </em>defense.) </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More recently, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-trump-nato-277d1b30ba6fd0ee37ca626c59ab05ed">Trump boasted</a> that he would let Russia “do whatever the hell they want” to countries that “didn’t pay.” This week, Trump underlined NATO leaders’ anxieties by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/11/trump-orban-meeting-florida-nato-00167547">meeting with Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán</a>, the alliance’s principal gadfly and Putin defender. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The “moshitora”<em> </em>in Washington this week has created insecurity for an alliance that would otherwise have some reason for swagger on its 75th birthday, though for a very unfortunate reason. Throughout the war on terror, NATO struggled to define its post-Cold War mission amid long-term, long-range deployments, such as Afghanistan, for which it often felt ill-suited. Just five years ago, French President Emmanuel Macron, hardly a Trumpian isolationist, described the alliance as “<a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/11/07/emmanuel-macron-warns-europe-nato-is-becoming-brain-dead">brain-dead</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All that changed with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which brought the alliance back to its original core mission: protecting Europe from Russia. As Sen. James Risch (R-ID), ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, put it on Wednesday, before 2022, “​​NATO had become stodgy. We’d forgotten what it was formed for. NATO was formed for the exact circumstance we find ourselves in today.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The most obvious post-war change for the alliance is the addition of two new flags outside its headquarters in Brussels: Sweden and Finland, who joined in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine after decades of neutrality. The allies have also gone a long way toward addressing Trump’s principal complaint. In 2024, 23 of the 32 members are <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_67655.htm">expected to spend</a> more than 2 percent of their GDP on defense, up from just three in 2014. Trump’s <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/closer-trumps-years-criticizing-nato-defense-spending/story?id=107201586">allies have taken some credit for this</a>, as have Biden administration officials. But in truth, most of the credit probably belongs to Vladimir Putin for reminding NATO’s member-states why it exists. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The bargaining stage</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent months, Trump has somewhat softened his rhetoric on NATO, saying he would “<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-says-he-wont-quit-nato-if-europe-pays-its-way/">100 percent</a>” stay in the alliance, as long as European countries “play fair.” But he still seems poised to undermine what has become NATO’s overriding priority: aiding Ukraine in its war with Russia. Trump reportedly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-reviews-plan-halt-us-military-aid-ukraine-unless-it-negotiates-peace-with-2024-06-25/">plans to pressure Ukraine</a> into negotiations with Russia by threatening to withhold US military aid. Without it, the war wouldn’t end, but Ukraine’s defenses <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24002840/ukraine-russia-war-united-states-aid-volodymyr-zelensky-vladimir-putin-europe-congress-border">may not be able to hold out</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the summit in Washington this week, which took place in the wake of a devastating <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainian-air-defence-engaged-repelling-russian-missile-attack-kyiv-officials-2024-07-08/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">missile attack</a> on a children’s hospital in Kyiv, Ukraine <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/07/11/situation-report-nato-washington-summit-ukraine/?tpcc=recirc_latest062921#:~:text=40.,according%20to%20the%20summit%20communique.">got some major new aid pledges</a>, including dozens of new air defense batteries and the long-awaited announcement that US-made F-16 fighter jets <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/10/nato-allies-begin-transfer-of-f-16s-to-ukraine-blinken-says">would be on their way to the country</a> from Denmark and the Netherlands. Ukraine was not offered full NATO membership but the summit communique <a href="https://nato.cmail20.com/t/r-e-tdjtjydd-nzutlhlju-r/">did affirm </a>its “irreversible path” to membership, which is stronger language than has been used before. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">NATO policymakers have been working to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/07/10/trump-proof-nato-summit/">“Trump-proof”</a> some aspects of aid to Ukraine, such as setting up a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/nato-to-establish-new-kyiv-post-for-ukraine-81b4205c">new command center in Germany</a> to coordinate military aid and the training of Ukrainian troops. But the strains on Ukraine’s defenses caused by Congress’s monthslong delay in authorizing new aid this year made it clear how much <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024/4/24/24138541/ukraine-russia-us-aid-congress">the international assistance effort</a> still relies on US support. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As I reported around the summit this week, it became clear that the talk was less about “Trump-proofing” — likely impossible — than about making a pitch for the alliance and its mission in terms that can be seen as MAGA-friendly. If not quite acceptance, it seemed officials had at least reached the bargaining stage when it came to a Trump return. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At a reception hosted by the European Union on Tuesday night, Oleksandr Kamyshin, Ukraine’s minister of strategic industries, suggested that what’s good for Ukraine is also good for American business, whoever is occupying the White House. “I’ve heard that Republicans stand for the defense industry. We’re bringing value to the defense industry of the US,” he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same event, Laurynas Kasčiūnas, Lithuania’s defense minister, said, “There are many directions where we can work with a future possible Trump administration if it happens.” A worse strategy, he suggested, would be “if we try to build in Europe a moral wall against Trump. We need to be calm and find ways to communicate with him.” He also noted that Trump’s hostility to the Euro-Atlantic mission was often more talk than practice. It was under Trump, after all, that US troops were <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20191021-us-moves-troops-tanks-into-lithuania-in-message-to-russia">first deployed to Lithuania</a>, on Russia’s border. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One senior NATO official, speaking on background in Washington this week, suggested that the recent boost in defense spending by NATO countries might defuse some of the tension. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Calling out European allies and Canada to spend more on defense was warranted,” the official said. “Raising the issue of defense spending was not exclusive to the Trump administration. [Now] we are in a different place. We have turned a corner and I think we have several examples to show that.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Zelenskyy notably spoke at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and was introduced by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, though this felt like an appeal to an internationalist Republican party that no longer exists.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whatever your views on the former president, it’s hard to fault European leaders for their Trump-friendly appeals this week. There’s little other option.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen put it on a panel at NATO’s public forum on Wednesday, referring to the US complaints about European reliance on American military power: “We have to admit, from a European perspective, that we were depending on you. We still depend on you. Never leave us.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the unlikely event you haven’t heard, President Biden <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/359160/biden-abc-news-interview-drop-out">had a pretty rough time</a> in the first presidential debate on June 27. Is there a way to measure <em>how </em>rough of a time?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kind of: betting markets on who will win the election. On June 27 at 8:40 pm (shortly before the debate started) <a href="https://electionbettingodds.com/">one aggregator of the markets</a> gave Biden a 36 percent chance. By 11 pm? Down to 24 percent.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That was approximately the same reaction I encountered on social media (“wow, Biden looks bad and can’t win”), but presented with the concreteness and addictiveness of the swingy New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/forecast-president.html">election-day needle</a>. You could even see Biden’s numbers recover — slightly — during his 45-minute press conference yesterday evening, rising from around 10 percent to 13 percent. The markets were vibes translated into concrete numbers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But are the concrete numbers correct? And is there a way to relate to them helpfully?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Markets are perhaps the best way humans have ever devised to integrate new information and quickly arrive at new pictures of important questions. When a company releases a bad earnings report, for example, the value of its stock tumbles almost immediately, as experts on the question of how much that stock will be worth in the future adjust their bets from that earnings report. People (and, increasingly, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/03/01/ai-in-financial-services-transforming-stock-trading/#:~:text=AI%20trading%20programs%20make%20lightning,otherwise%20be%20unable%20to%20detect.">AI algorithms</a>) who are good at their jobs make money, while the ones who are bad at their jobs lose money. In between, the entire world benefits from fast, accurate pricing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/351473/people-bet-on-sports-why-not-on-anything-else">dream of election prediction markets</a> is that we could build something similar for political questions. Over the last two weeks, as the election betting markets have swung wildly in response to every change in the news around Biden, the promise of that dream — and its acute current limitations — have been on full display.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The promise of prediction markets</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">An open secret about all election models, <a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/nate-silver-2024-president-election-polls-model">from Nate Silver’s</a> to that of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/upshot/introducing-2024-poll-tracker.html">the New York Times</a>, is that they involve a hefty sprinkling of expert judgment. Yes, they make a lot of use of polling, but how to weight each poll, how much movement to build in, and how to weight the polls against economic fundamentals are all judgmental calls. I disagree with people who call election prediction <a href="https://eu.dispatch.com/story/opinion/cartoons/2012/09/26/polling-is-more-art-than/23987272007/">more of an art than a science</a>, but only because I think they’re mistaken about how many judgment calls go into science.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most of these election models work by running countless computer simulations under various assumptions and publishing the results. A prediction market<em>, </em>by contrast, has a much simpler setup.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can buy “Biden,” which pays you $1 if Biden wins the election, or “Trump,” which pays you $1 if Trump wins the election, or some other name, which pays out if that person wins the election. How much are people willing to pay for “You get $1 if Biden wins the election”? That’s how the market judges Biden’s odds of winning.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Right now, people are only willing to pay about 12 cents for the right to collect $1 if Biden wins the election; if you think they’re underrating him, you can buy all these contracts from them and get very rich if Biden wins.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">(In compliance with Vox’s ethics policies, I do not bet money on areas I cover, so I don’t participate in election betting markets. Still, I try to publicly register what I would buy when I disagree with them; for example, at the start of 2020, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/1/13/21055740/trump-reelection-biden-nomination-brexit-2020-predictions">I said I thought</a> there was a 60 percent chance Biden would be the Democratic nominee when prediction markets <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/elections/betting_odds/democratic_2020_nomination/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/elections/betting_odds/democratic_2020_nomination/">had him at 33 percent</a>.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are many reasons to believe that markets could be very good at predicting elections — in principle, at least. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27762382/">Published research has found</a> that prediction-market-like projects have worked in many past contexts, with aggregators like SciCast and now Metaculus showing startlingly good track records on policy questions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And the track record of betting markets on the morning of election day is <a href="https://electionbettingodds.com/TrackRecord.html">very good</a>: If the market says someone has a 20 percent chance of winning, they generally win about 20 percent of the time.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another argument is that markets are strong for precisely this sort of problem — one where a lot of smart people are thinking about it and there is a lot of available data, but many challenging judgment calls go into integrating that information and acting on it, and where we know there will ultimately be one correct answer.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">People are better at making predictions if they have to put some money where their mouth is, and the <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/12/the-right-way-to-use-the-wisdom-of-crowds">wisdom of crowds</a> is a real thing. So is the tendency in markets for people who are bad at predictions to lose their money to people who are good at it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the simplest argument is that if Nate Silver is consistently better than the markets, people will trade on his predictions until the markets simply reflect what Nate Silver thinks. A high-volume, highly liquid market at the very least shouldn’t predictably underperform any other sources, since any underperformance is an opportunity to make money.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But while prediction markets could be a highly effective and reliable way of predicting elections, they also have some serious flaws — flaws which have very much been on display over the last two weeks.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What goes wrong with betting on elections?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This whole newsletter has been ignoring one fairly important point: Prediction markets for elections are not, strictly speaking, generally legal in the United States. <a href="https://www.predictit.org/">PredictIt</a> has an exemption for research reasons that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement092223">constantly threatening to shut down</a>. The other major markets I’ve been referencing throughout this piece, Betfair and Polymarket, generally don’t allow Americans to participate. (Betfair makes exceptions for Americans in a few states.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These restrictions have two major downsides. One is that the people who know the most about the elections — like journalists or political staffers — are generally restricted from betting on it, which means that the markets are much less useful as information aggregators. (A futures market around, say, soybeans would be much less accurate if companies that know soybeans couldn’t participate in it.) Without the savviest people allowed to take part, the crowd is inherently less wise.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Possibly more importantly, these restrictions mean that the markets have limited liquidity in general. (Liquidity refers to how much money is changing hands on the market.) For big questions, like “Biden vs. Trump,” the liquidity is okay — <a href="https://polymarket.com/event/presidential-election-winner-2024?tid=1720730061283">hundreds of millions of dollars exchanging hands.</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But for smaller markets, it’s a <a href="https://asteriskmag.com/issues/05/prediction-markets-have-an-elections-problem-jeremiah-johnson">huge problem</a>. One manifestation: The markets have a <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/2/14/21137882/prediction-markets-bloomberg-sanders-president">persistent tendency to overrate hugely long-shot candidates</a> like Michelle Obama, and in the immediate aftermath of the debate, California Gov. Gavin Newsom emerged as by far the likeliest replacement for Biden as opposed to Vice President Kamala Harris, which seems highly unlikely.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These conditions all mean there aren’t enough trades happening to correct such errors. The low liquidity also means that markets are relatively easy to manipulate, which has happened <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2012/10/23/how-to-manipulate-prediction-markets-and-boost-mitt-romneys-fortunes/">at least once.</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ironically, the possibility of election manipulation is the main reason why the CFTC wants to ban prediction markets, which some elected officials have decried as <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9108f393-6a45-41a3-bd76-20581b19288e">“a clear threat to our democracy,”</a> but the fact that they’re effectively banned makes them much easier to manipulate. It would take hundreds or thousands of times more money to manipulate commodity prices than to manipulate election betting odds, precisely because trading commodities is legal.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These disadvantages make prediction markets a double-edged sword. On the one hand, they’re powerful aggregators of public opinion, with a built-in accountability mechanism and a good track record for those questions where there’s a lot of trading. On the other hand, they’re too easy to manipulate, especially for smaller markets, handle unlikely candidates badly, <a href="https://asteriskmag.com/issues/05/prediction-markets-have-an-elections-problem-jeremiah-johnson">don’t outperform professional forecasters</a>, and as a result, can sometimes feel more like a distraction than a source of truth.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Toward a better election market</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the last two weeks I’ve been observing another dynamic, and while I’m not sure whether to call it an upside or a downside, it does feel to me like a way that prediction markets are falling short of their potential.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The markets were quick to say that Biden had a bad debate, and their odds that the Democrats would pick another nominee briefly spiked. The odds that Biden would resign peaked at a 35 percent chance on July 4. But after Biden doubled down, the markets reverted to saying he’d likely be the nominee — jumping back up to an 83 percent chance he’d stay as of July 9.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then George Clooney and some elected Democrats <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/10/opinion/joe-biden-democratic-nominee.html">criticized</a> him, and his odds of staying in office slid precipitously again. And then, Thursday evening’s press conference took place, and Biden did well enough to <a href="https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/7057/Who-will-win-the-2024-Democratic-presidential-nomination" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/7057/Who-will-win-the-2024-Democratic-presidential-nomination">bring his odds back up</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Is this a rational response to new information? Is it a wild, vibes-driven pendulum? Are the markets seeking truth or are they, as Andrew Gelman once <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2022/11/16/how-good-are-election-prediction-markets/">articulated the worry,</a> “just a kind of noisy news aggregator”? For an unprecedented question like whether there will be sufficient public pressure to get Biden to drop out, is there an important difference between a rational aggregation and a vibes-driven stampede?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Where it seems like prediction markets could be most valuable is in the conditional markets: “If this person is the Democratic nominee, would they defeat Trump?” That, after all, is the question most Democrats care about the most. These markets do suggest <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/prediction-markets-suggest-replacing">Biden should be replaced.</a> But such markets are much smaller and much less liquid, and as a result, it’s not clear to me they’re adding much clarity to our public discourse.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I don’t think prediction markets are a bad thing if they’re just an expression of general sentiment about whether Biden will resign. But the thing that I dream of is a world where markets offer reliable and accurate answers to the question, “Which Democrat is the most electable this November?” This could usefully direct the public conversation about Biden stepping down. Even better would be a world in which the markets identified Biden’s cognitive decline and related electoral weakness <em>early, </em>instead of at the exact same moment as everyone else.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s what it would look like for markets to be a major strength for policy decision-making. We’re not there yet.</p>

Here, we answer two questions asked by Vox readers, which have been edited and condensed.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I immigrated to the United States just two years ago. I have retired in my original country and have a pension and some savings, but I feel that this money is not enough to support our future retirement life in the United States. What should I do?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dear Retiree,</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I am enough of a personal finance expert to know that if you do not have enough money to support your future life, you’re going to need to figure out how to earn more money.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unfortunately, I am not enough of an immigration expert to advise you on the different ways in which you might be able to earn more money — so I reached out to Ellen Sullivan, owner and attorney at <a href="https://cambridgeimmigrationlaw.com/">Cambridge Immigration Law</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The first thing you need to understand is whether you have the legal right to work in the United States,” Sullivan told me. “Then you need to look at whether your work permit comes with any restrictions.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sullivan, who has been practicing US immigration law for 19 years, explained that many lawful permanent residents have unrestricted work permits that allow them to work anywhere. “Some people have work visas that tie them to a particular employer, but many people have the ability to work wherever they choose, or wherever they can find a job. You could work in an office or you could work at Walmart.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You may also want to consider other ways of generating income, <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/2023/8/10/23824235/how-to-invest-money-stock-market-investing-retirement-advice">such as investments</a>. “People can invest in the United States regardless of their immigration status,” says Sullivan. “This includes investments in property and real estate.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you have the ability to invest in real estate — which may or may not be an option for you at the moment — you might be able to earn additional income by renting out your property. “Becoming a landlord is considered an investment and not a job,” Sullivan explains. “This means that you can be a landlord without a work permit.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Regardless of how you choose to earn income, you’ll want to ensure that you follow any applicable tax laws, both in the US and in your original country. “Any income you earn in the United States can be taxed,” says Sullivan, “and you may also be subject to tax requirements in your home country.” It could be worth talking to a tax professional about your potential tax obligations, especially if you are unclear about what you might owe.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I also asked Sullivan what an immigrant might want to know if they were thinking about working under the table. She explained that there were two separate issues in play here — the first being the work itself, and the second being the taxes you may be required to pay on your earnings. “If you choose to work without permission or if you choose to ignore your tax obligations, these are civil and criminal violations,” she said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many people earn money through informal, quasi-legal jobs — the nanny or tutor who is paid in cash, for example — and many people assume that this kind of work does not need to be reported to the IRS. This is an incorrect assumption, and it could hurt you in the long run. You need to file tax returns with the IRS every year, even if you are an <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/4/17/15290950/undocumented-immigrants-file-tax-returns">undocumented immigrant working an informal job</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s one more factor to consider as you plan the next phase of your life in the United States, and that’s whether you need to move to a lower cost-of-living area. I don’t know where you are living, or whether you want to stay where you are to be close to family or community, but <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/3/26/18255131/moving-midwest-cedar-rapids">relocating to a less expensive part of the country</a> could allow you to live on your pension and savings without having to get another job. That said, many US adults continue working, in some capacity, even after they retire — so your situation is neither unusual nor atypical. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In other words, welcome to America.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I’m 65 this year. I want to know if I will be penalized if I invest in stocks, bonds, or any other kind of investment while on Social Security Disability?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dear 65,</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As far as I understand, you probably won’t be penalized if you invest while on Social Security Disability — but once again, this is a question to which I need to appeal to the specialists.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“You can definitely invest while on Social Security Disability (SSD),” says Andrew Latham, a certified financial planner who shares financial insights at <a href="http://supermoney.com">SuperMoney.com</a>. Latham explained that investment income is generally not considered “earned income,” which means it won&#8217;t affect your SSD benefits. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, you may still need to keep track of your total assets. “If you’re also on Supplemental Security Income (SSI), be aware of strict asset limits: $2,000 for individuals and $3,000 for couples,” Latham told me. “You can still invest, but if you do well and earn more than the asset limits, it will probably <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-resources-ussi.htm#:~:text=If%20the%20value%20of%20your,you%20sell%20the%20excess%20resources">reduce or disqualify you from your SSI benefits</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I asked Latham if putting money into investments would remove it from your total asset pool. If you were an individual with $3,000 in assets, for example, could you invest $1,000 and retain your SSI benefits? Latham said no. “Investing excess assets will typically not help with SSI, since the principal amount of investments, including stocks, mutual funds, savings bonds and so on, do count as assets.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I also had a conversation with Jim Wang, owner of <a href="https://wallethacks.com/">WalletHacks</a>, who I consider a go-to resource for these kinds of questions. “I did research into this topic when I was helping my parents as they started collecting Social Security benefits,” Wang explained. “The Social Security Administration, <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/whileworking.html">on their website</a>, states that they only include wages from your job, net profit from self-employment, bonuses, commissions, and vacation pay. They don’t count pensions, annuities, investment income, interest, veterans benefits, or other government or military retirement benefits.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So far, it’s looking like you should be able to invest while on Social Security Disability without running into any penalties — but there’s one more detail you may need to be aware of.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“In order to put money into an IRA or Roth IRA, you must have earned income,” says Marc Barnes, an enrolled agent and family office director at <a href="https://coppercanyontax.com/">Copper Canyon Tax and Accounting Services</a>. If you don’t have earned income — and many people on Social Security Disability do not — you can still invest in a brokerage account. However, you may need to prepare for the tax implications.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There is no tax deduction on a brokerage account, and the earnings, interest, and dividends that are produced will hit your tax return and could result in an increase in taxable income,” Barnes explains. “Brokerage accounts aren’t bad, but too many advisors are using a cookie-cutter approach to investing and the client ends up with too much taxable activity hitting their tax return and that is totally unnecessary.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bet you’re wishing I’d stopped my advice column a few paragraphs ago, right? Unfortunately, it gets even more complicated.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If disability is your only income, then a few dollars of interest or dividends isn’t really going to affect you. It would most likely be taxed at 0 percent and wouldn’t be enough to make your disability or Social Security taxable,” Barnes told me. “If you are married and your spouse has income, then you are probably already paying tax on disability or Social Security income and more consideration should be given to the investments.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There you have it, 65. Yes, you can invest; no, you probably won’t be penalized; and yes, you should be sure to consider the potential tax implications before making any investments.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And, as I always remind people — <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/353811/on-the-money-june-beginner-investing-risk-business-mentors">don’t invest any money you can’t afford to lose</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As <a href="https://www.vox.com/science/24141780/summer-hot-national-weather-service">this summer</a> has already made clear, <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/23800261/tips-extreme-heat-heatwave">extreme heat</a> is here, and it’s poised to get worse in the coming years. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Due to soaring temperatures, more and more people are also at risk for severe health concerns that come with them, including heat stroke, cardiovascular problems, and respiratory issues.<strong> </strong>That’s particularly <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/351471/heat-waves-increase-the-number-of-risky-premature-births">true for already-vulnerable groups</a> including elderly people, those who are pregnant, and those with preexisting conditions like heart disease or diabetes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Texas — a state that often sees some of the hottest temperatures in the country — extreme heat killed <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/01/12/texas-heat-deaths-2023-record-climate-change/#:~:text=Green%20was%20among%20the%20334,which%20are%20not%20yet%20final.">more than 330 people in 2023</a>, setting a new record. More recently, millions of people in cities like <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/heat-wave-hits-texas-amid-power-outages-from-beryl/">Houston have had to deal with a massive heat wave</a> while navigating power outages caused <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/11/weather/texas-heat-beryl-power-outage-thursday/index.html">by Hurricane Beryl.</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite the growing toll, there’s shockingly little regulation around protecting people from the effects of heat. It’s a stark contrast to how policies tend to treat the extreme cold. And while extreme cold continues to be <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/Which-Kills-More-People-Extreme-Heat-or-Extreme-Cold">deadlier than extreme heat</a>, as heat waves become more dangerous, the gap between the two is likely to shrink.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For example, very few states have laws that require landlords to provide air conditioning for their renters. Conversely, <a href="https://www.zumper.com/blog/is-it-illegal-for-a-landlord-to-not-provide-heat/">most states</a> have policies that mandate the provision of heat in the winter. But even navigating what is and isn’t required around extreme heat is difficult. A comprehensive state-by-state cooling policy resource doesn’t yet exist, which speaks to the sparse landscape of regulations considering heat exposure.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s largely due to policymakers lagging behind climate change, the opposition from <a href="https://laist.com/brief/news/housing-homelessness/los-angeles-cooling-air-conditioning-extreme-heat-renter-landlord-tenant-requirement-climate-change-housing">landlord groups</a> to such requirements, and the hefty cost of both energy bills and equipment that would actually address the problem. There are questions, too, over who would bear those costs, including concerns that mandates for air conditioning would simply fall on tenants in the form of higher rents.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The need for adequate cooling will only become more pressing, though. And the growing prevalence of heat waves — <a href="https://www.vox.com/22538401/texas-heat-wave-weather-definition-record-temperature-climate-change">which are getting stronger, longer, and more frequent</a> — underscores the fact that air conditioning is no longer a luxury but a necessity and that the lack of it in people’s homes could prove fatal.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>There are big gaps in cooling policies</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cooling policies for rental properties vary state by state, often city by city. There’s no federal law or regulation governing them, and many states don’t have them either. Although some cities like <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2016/09/28/dallas-makes-rules-tougher-on-landlords-with-new-housing-standards/">Dallas</a> have approved ordinances mandating that landlords provide air conditioning, for instance, Texas doesn’t <a href="https://www.sll.texas.gov/faqs/tenants-rights-ac-heating/">offer the same protections</a> statewide. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There’s no baseline right to air conditioning or anything like that at the federal level,” David Konisky, Indiana University’s co-director of the Energy Justice Lab, told Vox.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a result, such measures — known as habitability laws— are highly dependent on where people live. These laws, which determine what requirements a landlord must meet for the housing they provide, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/home/2024/07/10/do-landlords-have-to-provide-ac/">rarely include cooling</a>. For heat, meanwhile, these policies tend to say that rental properties need to include a heating unit that keeps them above a certain temperature. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Unlike heat, cooling is really not incorporated into habitability standards or enforced in increasingly hot summers,” says Ruthy Gourevitch, a housing policy manager at the Climate and Community Project. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some state policies, like those in <a href="https://www.kahnair.com/rules-regarding-air-conditioning-in-rental-units/">California</a> and <a href="https://wyrk.com/landlord-air-conditioning-nys/">New York</a>, require landlords to maintain air conditioning that’s already in a unit, but they don’t mandate that they provide AC in the first place. Most states have experienced scorching heat waves in recent years yet many still have no state law on the books to require cooling systems.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A similar dynamic is evident when it comes to federal energy assistance programs, which often dedicate most of their funds to assisting tenants in the winter to cover heating costs. About 80 percent of the funds allocated to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) are doled out in the winter, while far less is distributed in the summer, says Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. That’s largely a byproduct of the underfunding of the program, with much of the money running out after it’s been used in the winter, Wolfe says. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This breakdown can leave tenants in need of such aid struggling to cover costs in the summer even if they have access to air conditioning.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/23274788/heat-wave-ac-energy-bill-utilities">Rebecca Leber previously reported for Vox</a>, this same trend holds true when utility companies shut off power, something they do when a customer misses their payments.<strong> </strong>Many states will offer protections to customers in these situations during the cold months of winter. Not so with the increasingly fierce, hot months of summer. According to Vox’s previous <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/23274788/heat-wave-ac-energy-bill-utilities">reporting</a>, 41 states offer customer protections from utility shut-offs during the extreme cold if they fail to pay a bill, while just 18 states offer the same for extreme heat. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Preventing such shut-offs is one key way to ensure that people have air conditioning access during dire spikes in temperature, Leber writes. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There are lots of areas of policy where we have this distinction historically, between cold and heat,” says Konisky. “[We’ve thought that] trying to protect people from extreme cold temperatures has been more important.” But, now, “heat is just as deadly, just as big of a concern.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>These omissions could have severe consequences</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As extreme heat becomes more common and more hazardous to people’s health as a result, the impact of these gaps will become increasingly apparent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Low-income tenants, in particular, are disproportionately affected by such omissions, experts say, because they’re less likely to be able to afford their own cooling systems. Black Americans are also more likely to live in places where they are exposed to extreme heat, <a href="https://info.primarycare.hms.harvard.edu/perspectives/articles/african-americans-extreme-heat">a 2020 study found</a>. According to research by climate and health scientists Adrienne Hollis and Kristy Dahl, “counties with large African American populations are exposed to extreme temperatures two to three more days per year than those counties with smaller African American populations.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The risks of being indoors without air conditioning or other cooling options during these heat waves are high especially for older people, infants, pregnant people, and those with serious health conditions like heart disease and high blood pressure. Severe complications that could result include blood clots, kidney impairment, and asthma. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“With access to cooling, unfortunately, it’s heading that direction of being another one that shows the economic divide in the country and also the globe,” says Wolfe. <a href="https://www.acdirect.com/blog/many-us-households-dont-air-conditioning/">Roughly 13 percent</a> of US households lack air conditioning, with renters more likely to go without than homeowners. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The consequences of that lack have been increasingly evident in recent years, with multiple cities like Phoenix <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/06/phoenix-arizona-extreme-heat-deaths#:~:text=Last%20year%2C%20Phoenix%20suffered%20a,rise%20over%20the%20past%20decade.">recording record-high deaths from heat</a>. In 2023, Phoenix experienced 30 consecutive days of heat over 110 degrees Fahrenheit and saw 645 deaths, almost double the number from the year before. A large proportion of these deaths included people who were low-income or unhoused, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7227d0nl20o#:~:text=Last%20year%2C%20645%20people%20died,county%20has%20risen%20each%20year.">according to Phoenix officials</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Being inside during such heat waves, without air conditioning, is particularly hazardous.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It can actually get hotter indoors than outside, and this is a really important environmental justice issue,” Leah Schinasi, an assistant professor of environmental and occupational health at Drexel University,<a href="https://www.cell.com/heliyon/fulltext/S2405-8440(24)01832-2?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2405844024018322%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"> concluded in a 2024 <em>Heliyon</em> study</a>.  </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The policies that could change</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition to regulations that treat cooling systems like a necessity, experts say there needs to be more funding to cover the costs associated with them. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some cities, where temperatures have been consistently high and climbing, like Dallas, have approved ordinances in recent years to mandate that landlords provide air conditioning that keeps units under a specific temperature. <a href="https://ktla.com/news/local-news/l-a-county-weighs-air-conditioning-mandate/">Other cities, like Los Angeles</a>, are considering similar proposals.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such policies add to a handful of laws at the state level.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Seth Gertz-Billingsley, a Harvard law student who has studied heat protection policies across different states, <a href="https://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/news-and-ideas/in-a-warming-world-is-air-conditioning-a-right">notes that the Oregon law</a> is one of the most expansive. That law — <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2022/07/new-oregon-law-established-renters-right-to-ac-but-some-landlords-still-threaten-fines.html">which passed in 2022</a> — allows renters to install air conditioning, and also sets up an emergency fund to help low-income tenants afford AC. It doesn’t, however, mandate that all landlords offer air conditioning.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition to strengthening requirements for air conditioning and other cooling systems, advocates say it’s important that such policies account for the costs that would accompany these changes, so they aren’t simply passed on to tenants.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Federal and state governments could offer subsidies to landlords, for instance, says Wolfe. And more funding is needed for energy assistance programs directly focused on tenants.<strong> </strong>Wolfe estimates that LIHEAP could use an additional $3 billion annually to cover the costs people face in summer.<strong> </strong>Tenant protection from rent increases and potential evictions needs to be baked into such proposals, too, says Gourevitch. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another key consideration is the need to install cooling options, like heat pumps, that won’t also contribute to the climate crisis. <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/23067049/heat-wave-air-conditioning-cooling-india-climate-change">The paradox of air conditioning</a> has long been that it’s crucial to help preserve people’s health during heat waves but that it simultaneously spews a sizable amount of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. Devices like heat pumps, which move air from indoors to outdoors and vice versa, are a more efficient alternative because they <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/heat-pump-systems#:~:text=During%20the%20heating%20season%2C%20heat,comfortable%20temperatures%20for%20your%20home.">“transfer heat rather than use energy to generate heat.”</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To change such policies, however, lawmakers need to catch up with how quickly climate change is taking place and affecting people’s lives. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/25/weather/us-summer-heat-forecast-climate/index.html">Forecasts for this summer</a> and beyond show that the world is poised to get hotter. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Many of our habitability laws and enforcement policies are many decades old, and need to be updated to confront the new reality that we live in,” says Gourevitch.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you weren’t astutely aware already: Kids live in the same tech-dominated, phone-addled world that the rest of us do. Babies as young as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10122061/">6 months old spend over an hour a day in front of screens</a>. The average tween <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2022/11/children-mobile-phone-age.html">gets their first phone before they turn 12</a>. Recently, the US Surgeon General went so far as to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/health/surgeon-general-social-media-warning-label.html">call for warning labels on social media platforms</a> to inform parents about the apps’ mental health impacts on young people. Deciding how to introduce children to tech and the kinds of boundaries to draw around their use is no longer a matter of if but when.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The available research on smartphones’ effects on children is somewhat mixed, which can make it confusing for parents trying to make decisions when it comes to their kids’ tech exposure. Studies show when 1-year-olds spend more than four hours a day looking at screens, they have <a href="https://healthmatters.nyp.org/what-does-too-much-screen-time-do-to-childrens-brains/">developmental delays and issues with communication, fine motor skills, and problem-solving</a> at ages 2 and 4 (although only <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2808593">4 percent of the study’s participants</a> were exposed to more than four hours of screen time a day). As little as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6059409/">one hour on mobile devices has been linked to behavioral issues</a> and inability to pay attention, according to a study among Japanese first graders. Constant use of devices <a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news-events/publications-archive/brain/screen-time-brain">prevents children from getting bored and letting their young minds wander</a>. Frequent internet use can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9273128/">impede a child’s ability to create interpersonal relationships</a>. In his new book <em>The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness,</em> social psychologist <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area/353979/this-is-your-kid-on-smartphones">Jonathan Haidt argues</a> that a “phone-based childhood” is to blame for negative mental health outcomes in kids. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These findings about negative impacts may be alarming, but they don’t present the entire picture. A May 2023 advisory from the American Psychological Association, reviewing the available evidence to date, found that “<a href="https://www.apa.org/topics/social-media-internet/health-advisory-adolescent-social-media-use">using social media</a> is not inherently beneficial or harmful to young people.” In fact, there may be a silver lining: Rather than completely sequester and alienate young users, technology use can actually <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9658971/">help adolescents form social connections and explore their identities</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, experts say children should have limits and rules when it comes to their tech use. There are no clear, one-size-fits-all answers about when kids should be given their first phones or the amount of monitoring they need as they grow older. Parents will need to make decisions based on their values, judgment, and priorities. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ask yourself — and your kids — why they need a phone</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When it comes time to decide whether to give your child their own phone, it’s important to interrogate the reason why. If that reason is to assuage your own anxiety, it’s worth reconsidering, says Emily Cherkin, founder of the Screentime Consultant and author of <a href="https://thescreentimeconsultant.com/book"><em>The Screentime Solution: A Judgment-Free Guide to Becoming a Tech-Intentional Family</em></a>. Many parents mean well; they want to know where their children are or be able to get in touch in case of an emergency. But they are far more likely to encounter other dangers on smartphones. “The work that parents have to do is to dial down our anxiety about what I call the scary, but not the dangerous,” Cherkin says. “What’s scary is kidnapping, but it’s not dangerous. It’s so, so, so unlikely. Dangerous is youth mental health and bullying.” If your “why” is truly communication-related, Cherkin suggests giving your kid a flip phone.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When kids are old enough to start clamoring for their own device, it’s worth hearing them out, says <a href="https://www.wcwonline.org/Active-Researchers/linda-charmaraman-phd">Linda Charmaraman</a>, a senior research scientist and founder and director of the Youth, Media, and Wellbeing Research Lab at Wellesley Centers for Women at Wellesley College. They could have any range of answers that touch on peer pressure, a desire to connect with friends, or an interest in learning more about their interests.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But you also have to weigh those considerations against how tech fits in with your family’s values, Cherkin says. Pick two or three of your most important values — respectfulness, responsibility, or honesty, for example — and create a screen time boundary that corresponds. “If you value togetherness and communication, and everyone has a phone in their hand at the dinner table, that’s not in alignment with your value,” Cherkin says. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“I would say as young as 4, you could talk about the trickiness of tech”</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cherkin has found families who have strong communication, trust, and familial relationships are more likely to find a screen time balance that works for them, rather than those who impose hard and fast time limits. At the same time, it’s reasonable to set rules based on values, such as no phones at dinner time (so everyone can catch up) and at bedtime (because you want your kids to get a good night’s sleep). </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Crucially, parents must also follow these rules, too. “Children hate hypocrisy,” Cherkin says. “They can smell that out. Then it’s a lot harder to get their buy-in because it’s like, ‘Well, you’ve told me not to do this.’” If you can’t commit to completely separating from your phone at night, for instance, make sure to put it on a table on the other side of the room or just outside your bedroom door. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Make a smartphone contract</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While some parenting movements — like <a href="https://www.waituntil8th.org/">Wait Until 8th</a> — suggest waiting until the end of eighth grade to give a child a smartphone, experts suggest using your best judgment based on your child’s personality and those aforementioned family values. Experts say that children under 13 should not have access to social media. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563221003769">In a study of youth social media use</a>, Charmaraman found teens aged 13 and up were more responsible, less secretive, and engaged in less cyberbullying than users under 10 years old.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://drsherylziegler.com/">Sheryl Ziegler</a>, a licensed clinical child psychologist, also suggests adjusting any privacy or security settings before you hand over a smartphone. Go to the parental controls setting on the device (Apple has <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/105121">many built-in features on its products</a>) and any apps. (For example, <a href="https://parents.snapchat.com/parental-controls">Snapchat’s Family Center</a> allows parents to see who their kids are chatting with.) Turn off all notifications to avoid distraction during homework or a movie. Download only the apps you permit them to use. If they want to download any additional apps, they need to ask permission first, Ziegler says. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also essential to establish clear-cut rules before your child gets their own device. Ziegler suggests modifying the template created by <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/common_sense_family_media_agreement.pdf">Common Sense Media </a>— a nonprofit focused on media and technology safety for children — to your family’s needs. You and your child should be in agreement on privacy and safety, the amount of time they’re allowed to spend on the device (including during the summer), and pledge to consistently communicate about what they’re doing on the device. These rules can be applied even when kids start using family devices, Ziegler says. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is no hard and fast rule for how much time kids should spend on their devices. If they have school-issued laptops and they prefer to study on their iPads, that means they spend most of their waking hours looking at a screen. Take stock of how long kids are spending in front of a device versus other activities, like hanging out with friends, homework, or extracurriculars. “The younger the child,” Cherkin says, “the lower we want that number” on screens.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends <a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/138/5/e20162591/60503/Media-and-Young-Minds?autologincheck=redirected">children under 2 years old have no screen time</a> (other than video chatting with a relative) and children between the ages of 2 and 5 be limited to one hour of quality children’s programming. Ziegler recommends children ages 6 to 12 get no more than two hours a day of screen time. Parents will need to monitor the quality of that time, too: Watching a movie with the family is different from scrolling TikTok for two hours straight. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Keep certain rooms and times of day phone-free. Experts agree children should not have phones in their bedrooms overnight. <a href="https://devorahheitner.com/">Devorah Heitner</a>, author of <a href="https://devorahheitner.com/growing-up-in-public/"><em>Growing Up in Public: Coming of Age in the Digital World</em></a>, suggests keeping phones away before they go to school and during homework time, too. You might also suggest they go phone-free while hanging out with friends and family. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Be transparent with your kids about why you’re making the contract, Ziegler says. “I like to tell kids the reason why I’m going to be doing that is it’s going to be really hard for you to [turn the device off] because it’s so fun and these things were created to keep you on here as long as possible,” she says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There should be an understanding that you don’t expect your kids to be perfect and that they will mess up. Remind them that you don’t want to bust them for doing something wrong, but you’ll be there to help them navigate sticky situations. This way they’ll feel comfortable coming to you if they said something rude in a text that got back to another student, for instance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When they inevitably sneak out of their room in the middle of the night and grab their phone, don’t let anger take over. Ziegler suggests saying, “I get it, you really wanted to get back on the group chat. This is a sign to me, and to you, that we need to take a break. We’re going to give it a rest all day tomorrow.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Keep having conversations about safety, privacy, and online behavior </h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether or not your child has their own phone, it’s important to get deeply familiar with how they’re browsing the internet and engaging with social media, Heitner says. Ask your kids what games and programs they use at school and on shared devices at home. This can range from Roblox to Google Docs. Take time to watch videos from your child’s favorite influencer, Heitner suggests, to determine whether their content is trustworthy and appropriate. Ask your child to explain how, say, Discord works or to show you a funny video on TikTok so you can see how your kids are spending their time on various platforms. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“These are ways into having conversations with kids about what they’re seeing,” Heitner says. You might observe how negative the comments section is on a particular YouTube video. You could ask your kid, “How does it make you feel to see that? What would you do if somebody made a comment like that to you?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another way to have conversations around the dangers of certain apps includes reading the terms and conditions, Cherkin says. As tedious as it may seem, reading through them with your kids can illustrate how the platform handles their data. You could say, “It says here in the Snapchat agreement that they actually don’t guarantee that your snap is deleted if you say you’ve deleted it. They’re essentially tricking you.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I would say as young as 4, you could talk about the trickiness of tech,” Cherkin says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Discussions around online privacy and safety should be ongoing. You can start at the most straightforward tips — don’t share passwords or personal information online, for example — and progress to more difficult topics. Ask your children how they communicate with friends online. “If I call [someone] a loser with 60 exclamation points [online], I just called my friend a loser with 60 exclamation points,” Heitner says. “That&#8217;s going to have an impact on our relationship even though they’re not in the room with me &#8230; It&#8217;s really important to lean into teaching kids that we&#8217;re all human beings behind these screens, and we want to act like nice people, and if someone isn&#8217;t being nice, we have the freedom to leave and to not pursue further interactions.”</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>If you’re checking emails at dinner, your kids will learn that phone use is acceptable anywhere — and that it’s a salve for boredom</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If your adolescents are going to be on apps like Instagram and TikTok, make sure they know not to post images of other people without their consent, Charmaraman says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Teach your kids strategies if they start to feel distress online. Can they change the subject in the group chat if things get really negative? If things get too upsetting, could they leave it entirely? Encourage your kids to reach out to you if any of their peers or people they chat with online mention bullying or self-harm, Heitner says.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Help them anticipate inevitable feelings of exclusion or social comparison, Heitner continues. Explain that they will see friends hanging out without them and what they can do to feel better: Get off their phone, watch Netflix, walk the dog, ask their neighbor to hang out.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.885819/full">Research shows</a> the closer a parent is with their child, the less likely they’ll have problematic internet use. Rather than interrogating kids about what they’re doing on their phones, you might ask, “Is there anything interesting or surprising that’s come up on your phone lately?” or “I heard from so-and-so’s parents about this wild video going around. What’s your take on that?” </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to think about parental monitoring apps</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Experts are split over whether to use parental monitoring apps, like Bark, which send parents notifications if their children’s texts, emails, or apps showcase sexual content or signs of bullying, violence, or suicidal ideation. Ziegler personally uses Bark with her teens — and the filter is, in her experience, quite comprehensive. For instance, she once received a notification that her son was looking at drug-related content on his phone only because she sent him a text reminding him to take his medication.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given the breadth of sexual, violent, or addictive content available online, Ziegler likes how Bark offers notifications in real time that she can choose to open or ignore. “The chances of you being like, ‘Every Friday night I’m gonna go check my kid’s phone’ is probably pretty small,” she says. “Physically taking their phone to look at, it feels very invasive to them.” Always be honest with your child about the level to which their activity will be monitored.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cherkin believes that engaging in absolutism or fear-based parenting will only drive kids to seek that same content behind your back. Similarly, Charmaraman suggests parents speak to their children about their phone use directly rather than monitor their activity. Adolescents will inherently find themselves in awkward positions online, Charmaraman says, because that’s the nature of adolescence. “People are just trying to figure out who they are and sometimes they say or do socially awkward things,” she says, “That’s really what you’re going to be seeing when you’re monitoring.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Know when smartphone use is becoming too much</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Notice how your child reacts when they’ve reached their screen time max for the day. Do they beg you for more time? Are they irritable? Are they unsure of what to do next? These are all signs they’re probably spending too much time on their phones, Ziegler says.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Taking the phone away outright may not be the best course of action; your child might be afraid to open up to you because they’re scared they’ll get their phone taken away, Charmaraman says. Help them realize the root of their problems may be related to their phone or social media use. Try saying “I noticed you’re really stressed out and annoyed. I’m making a connection that it might be related to the phone, but I want to hear what your explanation for it is. Is there something else going on?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You might suggest your kid delete an overused app or block a classmate on social media. “Rather than taking away the phone completely,” Charmaraman says, “you can just say, ‘Maybe we can take a break on this one app.’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Maybe your child stays up all night watching YouTube videos on their phone. Instead of removing it from their room the next day, ease them into the transition, Charmaraman suggests: The phone stays on a nightstand one night, then the next night it’s across the room, until finally they feel comfortable with it charging overnight in another room.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Model healthy phone boundaries for your kids</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you want your children to live balanced lives online and off, you need to set a good example. If you’re checking emails at dinner or scrolling Instagram while waiting in line at the grocery store, they’ll learn that phone use is acceptable anywhere — and that it’s a salve for boredom. Limit your own screen use as much as possible. Should you need to take a work call during screen-free time, explain to your family that you don’t want to be distracted while hanging out with them, but you need to make one quick call and then they have your undivided attention, Cherkin says.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Be open with your feelings around phone use, too. Maybe you feel dread about the upcoming election after scrolling on X. Or you find it hard to pull yourself out of a TikTok binge. Call out any unpleasant feelings “so that when our kids have struggles, we can say, ‘That persuasive design is getting you, too. It’s hard for me as a parent to put this down. I can understand why this is so frustrating,’” Cherkin says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, parents don’t need to go into panic mode the moment their child picks up a device. So long as you set up a system of transparency and communication, kids will know to turn to you if they’re having any problems online.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With the future of his reelection campaign in doubt, President Joe Biden made a move on Thursday that was very unusual for him: He answered a lot of questions from reporters in a press conference. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The press conference, at the close of this week’s NATO summit in Washington, went fine for Biden. He took questions for about an hour, speaking about several foreign policy, economic, and political issues. Some of his foreign policy responses in particular were praised as detailed and substantive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, he did at one point mention “Vice President Trump” when he meant to say “Vice President Harris.&#8221; And at an earlier event he accidentally introduced Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky as “President Putin.” But they were simple slips of the tongue and not borne of substantive confusion — Biden spoke extensively on the Ukraine/Russia war and about Harris’s qualifications. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden’s performance was not exactly commanding, but he didn’t ever seem lost or fully out of it as he did at points in the debate. He did just fine.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The question is whether “just fine” is good enough to stem what’s becoming a tide of Democratic calls for him to step aside.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Biden’s okay press conference came after two very bad days for him — and more bad days may be coming</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Just a few days earlier, it seemed Biden had managed to ride out the storm over his bad debate performance. But a slew of bad news Wednesday and prior to the press conference Thursday ensued.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">His fundraising <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/10/dems-fear-biden-fundraising-cratering-00167496">is plummeting</a>. His own campaign aides are telling reporters <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/biden-reelection-insiders-no-path-debate-rcna161296">he should quit</a>. More Democrats <a href="https://x.com/haleytalbotcnn/status/1811517306276888924">have come out</a> publicly against him staying in the race, with one going so far <a href="https://www.kgw.com/article/news/politics/national-politics/marie-gluesenkamp-perez-statement-biden/283-c293250b-ed80-4360-bce5-532931e8700a">as to say</a> he should resign the presidency. Reports circulated that top party figures — <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2024/07/11/what-obama-and-pelosi-are-doing-about-biden-00167520">Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi</a>, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/10/schumer-biden-dump-donors-2024-election">Chuck Schumer</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/uaws-fain-tells-board-hes-worried-trump-could-beat-biden-sources-say-2024-07-11/">United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain</a> — have in private been less than fully supportive of Biden.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden’s team <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-debate-doggett-election-2024-pelosi-970ac9eca4cf397faea9306a0e4e7442">had announced</a> plans for the presser last week, as part of a strategy for the president to prove his fitness by doing more unscripted public events. In addition to his <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/abc-news-anchor-george-stephanopoulos-exclusive-interview-biden/story?id=111695695">interview with ABC News</a> last week and a call-in chat with <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/08/joe-biden-morning-joe-interview-2024-00166784">MSNBC’s <em>Morning Joe</em> program</a>, the president called into two local radio stations last week. But the radio interviews became problematic when it <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/06/biden-interview-draft-questions-wurd">was reported</a> that the Biden campaign had drafted the questions the hosts would ask and that the <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/11/milwaukee-radio-station-says-it-agreed-to-edit-interview-with-biden/74369012007/">campaign had requested</a> that two comments Biden made be edited out.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then, by the time the NATO press conference drew near, leaks suggested that, even if it went well, it might not help him much. <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/11/biden-house-democrats-call-drop-out">Axios’s Andrew Solender reported</a> that House Democrats were poised to issue “a flood of new statements urging Joe Biden to exit the 2024 race” no matter how the presser went. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Margaret Brennan of CBS News <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/potentially-dozens-of-democrats-expected-to-call-on-biden-to-step-aside-after-nato-conference/">said</a> that “dozens” of such statements from lawmakers were expected in a pre-planned coordinated effort and that a source predicted that, by next week, Biden would find it untenable to stay on the ticket.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So far, Biden remains unmoved</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the press conference, Biden professed utter confidence that everything would be fine for his campaign.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Asked if he’d free Democratic convention delegates pledged to him to back someone else, Biden said such delegates were “free to do whatever they want.” If delegates decided at the convention to back someone else, that would be democracy in action, he said, but “that’s not gonna happen.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Asked what would spur him to end his campaign, he said he’d only do so if his advisers told him “there’s no way you can win.” But, he added, “No one’s saying that.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other presidents, he asserted, had been trailing at this point by more than he is now. He would campaign hard and turn things around.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We’re just gonna keep moving,” he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Shortly after the press conference ended, <a href="https://x.com/natalieandrews/status/1811558570745376903">Rep. Jim Himes</a> (D-CT) released a statement calling President Biden “a remarkable leader.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I hope,” Rep. Himes added, that he “will step away from the presidential campaign.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Which means that, despite the presser, Thursday ended close to where it began: with Democrats at an impasse between a party skeptical of its nominee and a nominee resolute about staying in the race.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last year, the National Pork Board, a pork marketing group sponsored by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), funded a nearly $8.5 million program in partnership with researchers from Iowa State University, the University of Georgia, the University of Minnesota, North Carolina State University, and North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University to research popular perceptions of the pork industry and improve its reputation, according to federal <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f13ca3e0d7b7a5d4bf7abc8/t/65da7fa3688e982d508a23a1/1708818344236/Real+Pork+Consortium+Proposal.pdf">records</a> obtained by <a href="https://www.vox.com/23906572/crystal-heath-veterinarian-medicine-factory-farming-ventilation-shutdown-future-perfect-50-2023">Crystal Heath</a>, a veterinarian and founder of animal advocacy nonprofit Our Honor. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The project, called the Real Pork Trust Consortium, aims to counter “consumer misperceptions of pork production practices,” including about its impacts on animals and the environment, a grant proposal obtained by Heath states. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The grant proposal, reproduced below, notes that some consumers, like those in coastal states, hold more negative views of the pork industry and that “by analyzing the traits and tendencies of these specific groups, we can create targeted communication strategies which influence consumers’ knowledge and understanding of pork production methods, inform decision-making related to political activity, and encourage pork consumption across diverse consumer groups.” Researchers will create communications to share with consumers, with the aim of improving trust in the industry and “ensuring its social license to operate.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Heath questions why it should be the job of university researchers to protect the reputation of pork producers. The industry has “enlisted university faculty to serve in its public relations apparatus,” hoping to use researchers’ credibility to prop up an industry that has been implicated in animal cruelty, zoonotic disease risk, and environmental harms, she told Vox in an email. “It’s sort of like increasing public trust in coal mining-based energy production, lead-based paint manufacturing, leaded fuel-dependent transportation, asbestos-dependent construction methods, or DDT-based pest control.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The National Pork Board (NPB) did not initially respond to requests for comment. After publication, Iowa pork producer and president of NPB’s board of directors Al Wulfekuhle told Vox in a statement that “land-grant colleges and universities are an important source of scientific expertise and hands-on experience when it comes to advancing animal agriculture. &#8230;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>So that we can continue to produce affordable, nutritious protein&nbsp;<a href="https://www.porkcares.org/proof/decades-of-improvement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more efficiently and sustainably,</a>&nbsp;the Pork Board intentionally partners with organizations, academic institutions and researchers who are committed to following objective research practices and guidelines.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lead researcher Nicholas Gabler, a professor in Iowa State University’s animal science department, did not respond to Vox’s request for comment but <a href="https://www.feedstuffs.com/agribusiness-news/real-pork-trust-consortium-works-to-resolve-gaps-in-understanding-of-pork">stated</a> in a recent interview with the animal agriculture trade publication Feedstuffs that the consortium is “not a marketing program. It is a science-driven program for understanding how we can communicate better” to improve trust between pork producers and consumers.&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Real Pork Trust Consortium is far from the only partnership between meat producers and universities. Close collaboration between the meat industry and academic scientists stretches back to the early days of land-grant universities in the US, when researchers were enlisted to boost the productivity of agriculture in the rapidly growing nation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, some of these partnerships have shifted to focus on contemporary challenges like addressing animal agriculture’s outsize contribution to climate change. But land-grant universities’ original mandate to serve the interests of the agriculture industry<strong> </strong>is colliding with <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/3/20/24105735/peak-meat-livestock-emissions-plant-based-climate-deadline">clear calls from climate scientists about the need to scale down</a> the livestock industry to meet climate targets and minimize risks to public health and animal welfare.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To mitigate their emissions, meat and dairy companies are pinning their hopes on a suite of technological solutions including adding <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/14062022/cow-seaweed-methane/">seaweed to cattle feed</a> or <a href="https://grist.org/agriculture/biogas-boom-ira-incentives/">implementing manure digesters</a>: massive pools meant to capture methane from livestock poop, for use as a fuel source. These practices do shave off emissions, but in many cases they’re difficult to scale, and their potential to mitigate the carbon footprint of highly emitting industries like beef and dairy is overstated. Climate scientists <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02409-7#:~:text=By%202050%2C%20dietary%20changes%20could,people%20ate%20less%20meat%3F')">agree</a> that they have to be accompanied by reductions in livestock production and shifting diets to eat less meat and dairy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the livestock industry has its own scientists, in some cases, emissions-reduction research is carried out by public, land-grant universities, like the University of California Davis, University of Nebraska, Colorado State University, Texas A&amp;M, and others. As with the Real Pork Trust Consortium, animal science programs at these institutions are sometimes funded with millions of dollars in donations from meat and dairy corporations and trade groups and conducted by researchers with ties to industry.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These partnerships largely prioritize animal agriculture’s continued profitability and can serve to sow doubt about livestock’s role in the climate crisis. Critics say they amount to greenwashing. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The animal agriculture industry is now involved in multiple multimillion-dollar efforts with universities to obstruct unfavorable policies as well as influence climate change policy and discourse,” wrote <a href="https://law.yale.edu/viveca-morris">Viveca Morris</a>, an environmental lawyer at Yale Law, and <a href="https://jenniferjacquet.com/">Jennifer Jacquet</a>, an expert on corporate influence at the University of Miami, in a sprawling <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-024-03690-w">2024 paper</a> analyzing university-industry partnerships in the livestock sector. “These efforts have downplayed the livestock sector’s contributions to the climate crisis, minimized the need for emission regulations and other policies aimed at internalizing the costs of the industry’s emissions, and promoted industry-led climate ‘solutions’ that maintain production.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The university mission,” they warned, “is at risk when universities allow industries to shape research and fund communications with the appearance of academic independence.” </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Land-grant universities were set up to boost ag productivity</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The close partnership between farmers and America’s public universities dates back to 1862, when the federal <a href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/morrill-act">Morrill Act</a> allowed states to establish public universities funded by the sale of federal land (much of which had been <a href="https://www.landgrabu.org/">stolen from Native American tribes</a>). That’s why these universities are called “land-grant” institutions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The goal was to provide education in fields that would help Americans build a successful country, including engineering, military science, and agriculture, said <a href="https://www.aplu.org/about-us/who-we-are/staff/steele/">Doug Steele</a>, the vice president of food, agriculture, and natural resources at the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU). </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Public universities’ relationship with farmers was further formalized in 1914 with the creation of the USDA’s <a href="https://www.nifa.usda.gov/about-nifa/how-we-work/extension/cooperative-extension-history#:~:text=The%20Smith%20Lever%20Act%20formalized,address%20exclusively%20rural%2C%20agricultural%20issues.">Cooperative Extension System</a>, which established university-government partnerships with the goal of increasing farm productivity and profitability and addressing the research needs of rural, farming communities. These programs offered free educational resources to the public and produced research in direct response to questions from farmers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Extension services aimed to help rural people (particularly white landowners) survive the modern world, especially as an economic gap widened between rural and urban communities, said <a href="https://history.missouri.edu/people/deutsch">Chris<strong> </strong>Deutsch</a>, a historian of the meat industry at the University of Missouri. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the 1920s and ’30s, when crop failures began to prevent American farmers from producing cotton and fruit such as peaches (significant cash crops at the time), extension services stepped in to give farmers another way to make money, said <a href="http://www.rogerhorowitz.com/about-roger.html">Roger Horowitz</a>, a historian of the US food system at the Hagley Museum.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Extension agents became more connected to the meatpacking industry and more interested in encouraging commercial livestock production as an alternative,” Horowitz said. Since livestock was (and still is) mostly fed grass, hay, and grains, which weren’t as hard hit by crop failures, the sector was seen as a viable alternative.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After World War II, agriculture and land ownership increasingly consolidated, and the nature of land-grant universities’ relationship with agriculture began to shift away from a focus on individual farmers’ needs toward more industrial and commercial interests.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thus began a close partnership between public universities and livestock producers that would eventually lead to the factory farms that exist today: animal production and slaughter operations run in large industrial facilities that resemble factories more than traditional farms and raise far more animals, far more quickly, than any previous agricultural system.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Public universities, and especially extension services, “were a key part in the creation of the intensive agricultural system that we have, and particularly the animal side &#8230; because of all the myriad problems that emerge from trying to concentrate animals in a singular point,” said Deutsch.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jacquet put it even more bluntly: “You don&#8217;t get the industry that we have now without the land-grant institutions.”</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>“The university mission is at risk when universities allow industries to shape research and fund communications with the appearance of academic independence</em>”</p><cite>VIVECA MORRIS AND JENNIFER JACQUET</cite></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The livestock sector began to thrive via all kinds of advancements in farming methods made possible by the work of university scientists. Dubbed the “<a href="https://www.asas.org/docs/default-source/midwest/mw2020/publications/footehist.pdf?sfvrsn=59da6c07_0">first great biotechnology</a>” by one researcher, modern <a href="https://extension.umn.edu/dairy-milking-cows/artificial-insemination-cattle">artificial insemination</a> — the process of collecting sperm from a male animal and depositing it in the reproductive organs of a female — arose after work from extension program researchers at Cornell University (one of seven private land-grant universities in the US) and public university faculty at the University of Minnesota, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and others. Today, the technology is ubiquitous across the meat and dairy industries, giving farmers an unprecedented level of control over the reproductive lives of animals and allowing for rapid production speeds.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Feed additives developed by public universities supercharged animals’ ability to metabolize food and convert it into body mass, said Deutsch. In the 1950s, for example, Iowa State University researcher <a href="https://isubios.pubpub.org/pub/ljwww8lm/release/1">Wise Burroughs</a> helped develop and patented a feed additive called diethylstilbestrol, a synthetic form of estrogen that led cows to gain weight 12 percent faster while eating 8-10 percent less feed. Iowa State later partnered with feed and pharma giant Eli Lilly to produce the hormone (Eli Lilly has since split from animal-health subsidiary Elanco and now focuses on human health). By the 1970s, it was banned in the US, in part due to its link to cancer in humans. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Also in the 1950s, extension programs began to push farmers to use more antibiotics, since they made animals grow faster while requiring less feed, said Horowitz.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Publicly supported scientists affiliated with land-grant universities also contributed much of the early research into poultry genetics, nutrition, and health, propelling the US chicken industry into the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/2/10/23589333/cecile-steele-chicken-meat-poultry-eggs-delaware">behemoth</a> that it is today. The use of medicated feed and new research into poultry diseases created a booming chicken industry that helped increase American chicken production almost 30-fold in the last century.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Genetics research transformed the chicken from a “backyard scratch, hunt, and peck animal into, essentially, a technology,” said <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Chicken.html?id=iwh3yAEACAAJ">Paul Josephson</a>, an environmental historian at Colby College who has written a book about the history of chickens. High-profile <a href="https://livestock.extension.wisc.edu/articles/the-chicken-of-tomorrow/">contests</a> in the 1940s, resulting from partnerships between the poultry industry and extension programs including at the University of Delaware and the University of Arkansas, sought the “Chicken of Tomorrow,” a breed that would have a larger percentage of breast, leg, and thigh meat.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, Americans eat more than 9 billion broiler chickens every year — animals that are <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119385505">more than four times</a> as massive as a chicken of the 1950s, a transformation that has come at a high cost to animal welfare. Modern chickens <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/aug/17/from-farm-to-factory-the-unstoppable-rise-of-american-chicken">grow so big and so fast</a> that their legs often can’t support the immense weight of their bodies. Research out of public universities made this transformation possible through developments in feed, antibiotics, and genetics. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today’s public universities continue to develop methods that push animals to their biological limits to allow the US to produce ever more animals at higher speed and lower cost. A 2015 New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/20/dining/animal-welfare-at-risk-in-experiments-for-meat-industry.html">investigation</a>, for example, found that the US Meat Animal Research Center, a cooperative program between the USDA and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, was breeding female pigs and cows to give birth to ever more offspring, leading to mass mortality and severe animal welfare problems. The USDA told the Times that the center follows federal animal welfare rules.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2016, public records <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/04/14/killing-chickens-bird-flu-vsd/">obtained</a> by animal welfare group Animal Outlook revealed that research at North Carolina State University funded by the US Poultry and Egg Association, an industry trade group, played a major role in developing ventilation shutdown: a method used to mass kill chickens and turkeys by trapping them inside barns and pumping in extreme heat. The method kills the animals by heatstroke and is now being used to cull tens of millions of poultry birds to stop the spread of bird flu; it’s been <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23963820/bird-flu-surge-us-ventilation-shutdown-veterinarians">criticized</a> as the cruelest culling option.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This type of research is “unethical, particularly &#8230; when the very things you’re doing to increase production are causing harm to animals,” said <a href="https://www.vermontlaw.edu/directory/person/winders-delcianna">Delcianna Winders</a>, an associate professor of animal law at Vermont Law and Graduate School.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Ag industry-aligned researchers want to develop climate solutions without sacrificing growth</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The supercharged growth of the livestock industry has brought huge consequences for the environment, for the public, and for the animals themselves. “It’s ecologically illogical,” said Deutsch. “It shouldn’t be possible to gather a million [animals] into one small contained room and have that be sustainable.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, Deutsch said, the livestock industry still depends on university research to maintain conditions where <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23963820/bird-flu-surge-us-ventilation-shutdown-veterinarians">disease thrives</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/31/23852325/farming-myths-agricultural-exceptionalism-pollution-labor-animal-welfare-laws">ecological issues</a> are rampant, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/3/9/22967328/animal-cruelty-laws-state-federal-exemptions-pennsylvania-martin-farms-dairy-calves-dehorning">animal welfare violations persist</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meat and dairy production account for <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/novel-meat-and-dairy-alternatives-could-help-curb-climate-harming#:~:text=The%20animal%20agriculture%20industry%20is,cent%20of%20global%20GHG%20emissions.">14-20 percent</a> of global greenhouse gas emissions, while fertilizer and manure runoff from concentrated animal farms has created widespread water quality issues in the US Midwest, <a href="https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/2021/06/midwest-farm-states-nitrate-pollution-tap-water-more-likely-lower-income">particularly</a> for disadvantaged communities. Forcing animals into crowded spaces also heightens the risk of <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/4/22/21228158/coronavirus-pandemic-risk-factory-farming-meat">zoonotic disease spillover</a> — as we’re seeing now with <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24128700/bird-fludairy-meat-industry-h5n1-cows-milk-eggs-safety">bird flu infections</a> among US dairy herds and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/s0522-human-case-h5.html">dairy workers</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, public universities are hard at work assisting the industry in finding sustainability solutions that don’t sacrifice growth. Much of that work surrounds efforts to reduce <a href="https://www.epa.gov/gmi/importance-methane#:~:text=Methane%20is%20the%20second%20most,trapping%20heat%20in%20the%20atmosphere.">methane</a> — a greenhouse gas nearly 30 times <a href="https://www.epa.gov/gmi/importance-methane">more potent</a> than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere&nbsp;<strong> </strong>— released by beef and dairy cattle.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Researchers at universities across the country, including Colorado State University, the University of California Davis, the University of Nebraska, and others, are working to research various feed additives that promise to reduce cows’ methane emissions, as well as breeding cattle to select for low-methane traits. While that’s framed as a sustainability strategy, it comes with an added benefit for the industry’s bottom line: When cows emit less methane, they likely also convert their feed into meat more efficiently and may require less food, according to <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fanim.2021.641590/full">some</a> <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1828051X.2017.1404945">studies</a>. In this way, creating combinations of cattle breeds and feed additives that reduce methane may also create more profit for producers and allow for growth in the sector.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Environmental advocates have <a href="https://modernfarmer.com/2024/04/biogas-mega-dairies-problem/">raised concerns</a> that methane-reduction strategies such as feed additives and manure digesters may ultimately end up creating more, not less, pollution, since they offer farmers additional income streams and promote growth of the industry. In <a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/low-carbon-fuel-standard">California</a>, for example, dairy producers can receive <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/28122023/milking-it-battle-underway-california-dairy-biogas-market/">lucrative financial credits</a> for producing biogas by capturing methane from manure. Public university research and extension programs have<strong> </strong>advanced the <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=106096">increasing popularity</a> of manure digesters by <a href="https://extension.psu.edu/agricultural-anaerobic-digesters-design-and-operation#:~:text=Earlier%20anaerobic%20digesters%20for%20biogas%20production&amp;text=Laboratory%20experiments%20to%20produce%20methane,treat%20settled%20waste%2Dwater%20solids.">testing prototypes</a> in their own research facilities and creating <a href="https://learningstore.extension.wisc.edu/products/anaerobic-digestion-from-animal-manure">educational resources</a> for farmers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One <a href="https://foe.org/resources/biogas-or-bull/#:~:text=Herd%20sizes%20at%20facilities%20with,nearly%2085%2C000%20dairy%20cows%20total.">study</a> by the environmental nonprofit Friends of the Earth found that herd sizes at livestock facilities with manure digesters grew 3.7 percent, on average, each year — 24 times the growth rate of overall dairy herd sizes.<strong> </strong>“We are not saying that this is like a primary driver of [dairy industry] consolidation, more that it is a factor that can exacerbate an existing trend toward consolidation,” said <a href="https://foe.org/team-members/chloe-waterman/">Chloë Waterman</a>, senior program manager for FOE’s Climate-Friendly Food Program. Consolidating livestock can lead to worsening pollution and increased animal welfare harms.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These methane-reduction strategies can shave off emissions, but only at the margins. Without pairing those technologies with a plan to reduce meat and dairy production, we stand <a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/without-changing-diets-agriculture-alone-could-produce-enough-emissions-surpass-15degc">little chance</a> of limiting global warming below targets set by global climate experts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That reality is hard to square with land-grant researchers’ role in the livestock industry. As they provide the basic research that advances temporary solutions such as feed additives and manure digesters, public university researchers simultaneously lend a patina of scientific expertise to industry-backed claims that the animal agriculture industry shouldn’t be blamed for climate change and does not need to scale down. The <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f13ca3e0d7b7a5d4bf7abc8/t/65da7fa3688e982d508a23a1/1708818344236/Real+Pork+Consortium+Proposal.pdf">Real Pork Trust Consortium</a> offers a particularly extreme example, with its goal to “enhance pork’s image among global consumers and societies.” But it’s hardly alone.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The rise of “climate-smart” meat and dairy</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2022, records gathered by <a href="https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2022/10/31/frank-mitloehner-uc-davis-climate-funding/">Unearthed,</a> an investigative journalism project funded by Greenpeace, and also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/31/climate/frank-mitloehner-uc-davis.html">covered</a> in the New York Times, found that the Clear Center, a research institute at UC Davis run by prominent animal industry scientist Frank Mitloehner, had <a href="https://www.desmog.com/2022/11/03/animal-agriculture-industry-commits-millions-to-prominent-university-animal-science-research-center-documents-show/">received millions of dollars</a> in gifts from the animal feed and livestock industry, particularly Ifeeder, a nonprofit founded by an industry association whose members include meat giants Cargill, Tyson Foods, and a subsidiary of JBS, the world’s largest meat company.<strong> </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The research funded by Ifeeder was, in part, meant to investigate the role of feed additives in reducing enteric methane emissions. Industry funding is common in academic research and isn’t, on its own, necessarily compromising. But Mitloehner is also an outspoken <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGG-A80Tl5g">defender</a> of livestock farming and downplays animal agriculture’s role in the climate crisis, acting as a climate expert for the industry’s needs via written articles, media interviews, and presentations.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In one <a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/23259351-clear-center-about">document</a> explaining the Clear Center’s purpose, Ifeeder wrote that “Mitloehner provides a neutral, credible, third-party voice” and that data produced by the Clear Center will “show consumers that they can feel good about the choice they are making to include protein in their families’ diets.” Mitloehner told Unearthed that “the Clear Center works with the livestock sector to make it better for the environment. To suggest we’re doing anything other than that is a gross mischaracterization of what we do,” and that “the Clear Center and myself are not concerned with the financial interests of stakeholders or others in the livestock industry.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A similar story emerged at Colorado State University in 2020, when a partnership between the university and various beef industry groups formed AgNext, a program dedicated to research that advances sustainability in the livestock sectors, according to its <a href="https://agnext.colostate.edu/about/">website</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">AgNext’s first director, Kimberly Stackhouse-Lawson, who used to work as the chief sustainability officer for JBS USA, has received at least $574,467 from the cattle, pork, dairy, feed, and pharmaceutical industries (including NCBA and JBS) to, in part, research livestock sustainability, according to records obtained by <a href="https://aria.info/about-us/">ARIA</a>, a research organization focused on climate. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Both Stackhouse-Lawson and AgNext researcher Sara Place, who worked previously for animal pharmaceutical company Elanco and was senior director of sustainable beef production research at the National Cattlemen&#8217;s Beef Association, completed their PhDs under Mitloehner’s supervision. Place’s doctoral work evaluated the impact of an Elanco feed additive on methane emissions in dairy cattle. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Like Mitloehner, Stackhouse-Lawson has <a href="https://agriculture.house.gov/uploadedfiles/stackhouse-lawson_testimony_package.pdf">spoken</a> about her belief that regulations of greenhouse gas emissions should not burden producers financially and that sustainability goals should not hinder “value chain profitability.” Like the Clear Center, AgNext has emphasized communicating to the public that animal protein is an <a href="https://perma.cc/82H7-KRMP">essential part of a healthy diet</a> and not the climate culprit that other scientists make it out to be. Mitloehner and Stackhouse-Lawson have both been involved in advancing policies aligned with the livestock industry’s interests and have given congressional testimony regarding climate change and animal agriculture.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“To the extent Mitloehner and Stackhouse-Lawson publish peer-reviewed research related to climate change, their work focuses primarily on the use of feed additives or other technological and industry-led solutions, or promoting greenhouse gas accounting metrics that are favorable to the US meat and dairy industries,” write Jacquet and Morris in their <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-024-03690-w">paper</a> about the Clear Center and AgNext.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“In recognition of the impact of agriculture on climate change, AgNext researchers work with members of the entire livestock value chain to understand current practices and systems and identify viable and scalable options that can move the industry toward a sustainable future,” Place said in an email. “While it is common for industry and government to fund programs, equipment and even research, university research is independent and objective — funding sources have no influence on AgNext research outcomes. To be clear, it is not true that AgNext promotes ‘greenhouse gas accounting metrics that are favorable to the US meat and dairy industries.’” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At Pennsylvania State University, meanwhile, researchers were <a href="https://www.psu.edu/news/agricultural-sciences/story/penn-state-awarded-grant-help-dairy-farmers-develop-climate-smart/">granted up to $25 million</a> from the USDA to work with the Center for Dairy Excellence, a consortium of Pennsylvania dairy trade groups, and ag tech company Proagrica to develop “climate-smart” dairy farming practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Penn State program ultimately aims to assess the climate impacts of methods Pennsylvania dairy farmers are already using.&nbsp;With a better idea of the emissions reductions of certain farming practices, dairy farmers could participate in a voluntary climate market, where the greenhouse gas reductions of their practices are sold as carbon offsets for which farmers receive a payment, according to Caroline Novak of the Professional Dairy Managers of Pennsylvania, a trade group that has partnered with Penn State for the project. “Implementing and maintaining climate smart practices costs farmers money. They have to find a way for the practices to pay for themselves. If they are forced to do it without financial sustainability,&nbsp;there will be no farms left to feed people,” Novak said in an email. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s reminiscent of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/8/23863100/tyson-climate-friendly-beef-burger-usda">“climate-smart” label piloted by Tyson</a> last year for beef that the company claimed emitted 10 percent less than its overall beef herd. The actual emissions reductions of the program are unclear, and even with a 10 percent emissions reduction, beef is far from climate-smart: It’s by far the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food">worst food</a> for the climate, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/dining/climate-change-food-eating-habits.html">dairy</a> is not far behind.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/Untitled.png.webp?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=6.6270833333333,0,86.745833333333,100" alt="Aerial view of hundreds of cows concentrated in a feedlot." title="Aerial view of hundreds of cows concentrated in a feedlot." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="An aerial shot of Nebraska-based Adams Land &amp; Cattle Co., Tyson’s sole supplier of its Brazen Beef line. | Google Maps/Environmental Working Group" data-portal-copyright="Google Maps/Environmental Working Group" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">As is the case with feed additives, manure digesters, and the Tyson program, farmers may be earning more without having to change much about the way their farms operate.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">“<strong>Science depends on the questions we ask</strong>”</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">University research, Jacquet and Morris argue, offers legitimacy that corporations themselves cannot achieve.<strong> </strong>As universities partner to advance the livestock sector via projects like the Clear Center, AgNext, and the Real Pork Trust Consortium, they miss opportunities to use their resources to advance sustainability solutions that decenter productivity and profitability and prioritize the public interest, including environmental health, public health, and animal welfare.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>Research shows that industry funding can influence the types of questions asked, and studies that are unlikely to find information useful to industry are less likely to get funding</em></p></blockquote></figure>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none"></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Asking who this serves is really important,” Jacquet said. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Research aimed at increasing profit is “yet another form of subsidy to the industry,” Winders said. “That&#8217;s not a public service. It&#8217;s not like those profits are going to be spread across society. Those profits are going to the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census">highly, highly concentrated</a> industry. And so it&#8217;s helping these already extremely profitable multinational corporations make even more money.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Research shows that industry funding can influence the types of questions asked, and studies that are unlikely to find information useful to industry are less likely to get funding. One <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6187765/">2018 study</a> of research across multiple STEM fields found that corporate sponsorship of research “can drive research agendas away from questions that are the most relevant for public health.” At the moment, much of the public research into animal farming is following this path by pushing advancements only into climate solutions that allow for industry growth while employing public university researchers to spread the message to consumers that industrial animal farming isn’t as harmful as they might think.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, research into alternatives to the livestock sector, such as cell-cultivated meat and plant-based alternatives, receives comparatively little public funding, <a href="https://www.cell.com/one-earth/pdf/S2590-3322(23)00347-0.pdf">as shown by recent research</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Projects more relevant to environmental concerns and public health could include studies that advance production of plant-based proteins, Winders said, or initiatives that educate farmers on organic farming methods, said Horowitz. Such initiatives could also help farmers unhappy with exploitative contracts with meatpacking companies to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22609382/plant-based-meatless-future-transition-farmers-meatpacking-workers">escape the industry</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Right now, land-grant researchers have strong incentives to prioritize the interests of powerful, highly polluting incumbent industries. But there are infinitely many paths that university research could take.“Science depends on the questions we ask,” Heath said. </p>

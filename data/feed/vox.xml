<p class="has-text-align-none">President Joe Biden pardoned his son Hunter Biden on Sunday, just weeks before he leaves the White House and despite <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/389206/hunter-biden-pardon-joe-biden-democrats-response">previously promising not to do so</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden said in a statement announcing the pardon that his son had been “selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted” and that his political opponents had undertaken an “effort to break Hunter,” suggesting that the Justice Department under a second Trump administration would continue to go after him. Hunter Biden was convicted in two separate federal cases involving handgun and tax-related charges and was awaiting sentencing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/12/01/statement-from-president-joe-biden-11/">full and unconditional pardon</a>” covers an 11-year period ending on December 1 and is “not limited to all offenses charged or prosecuted.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice,” Biden said in the statement.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Republicans, unsurprisingly, have criticized the decision, but so, too, have some of Biden’s fellow Democrats. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) <a href="https://x.com/SenatorBennet/status/1863623197788160041">called</a> the pardon a decision to “<a href="https://x.com/SenatorBennet/status/1863623197788160041">put personal interest ahead of duty</a>” that “further erodes Americans’ faith that the justice system is fair and equal for all,” and Rep. Greg Landsman (D-Ohio) said <a href="https://x.com/RepGregLandsman/status/1863591569363804388">it was “a setback”</a> for those who want to “believe in public service again.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s what you need to know about Hunter Biden, the president’s pardon powers, and what this precedent could mean for Donald Trump.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is Hunter Biden, and what did he do?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hunter Biden, 54, is the president’s only living son and the only family member of a sitting president to be convicted of federal crimes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In June, a Delaware jury <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/354731/hunter-biden-guilty-gun-charges">convicted him</a> on three charges related to misrepresenting his illegal drug use on a form he submitted while purchasing a handgun in 2018, when he was addicted to drugs. He had initially struck a plea deal with prosecutors that later fell apart, and instead, they brought the gun charges to trial — a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/15/us/politics/hunter-biden-gun-charges.html">rare occurrence</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In September, Biden also pled guilty to nine charges related to underpaying taxes between 2016 and 2019, including filing a false tax return and tax evasion.&nbsp;He would have faced up to 25 years in prison for the gun conviction and 17 years for the tax conviction, though likely would have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/us/politics/hunter-biden-crimes.html">only been sentenced for a fraction of that time</a>, totaling under five years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Neither case involved longstanding probes into Biden’s business dealings, which Republicans have attempted to link to his father. But it’s possible further charges could have been brought against him had he not been pardoned.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What is a presidential pardon?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Under the Constitution, the president has the power to “grant Reprieves and Pardons.” A full pardon reverses a past criminal conviction (or, in Hunter Biden’s case, all of them within a certain span of time, as well as the possibility of facing legal jeopardy for as-of-yet-unprosecuted crimes) and its consequences, including restoring the right to vote, hold office, and sit on a jury, if lost as a consequence of the conviction. Presidents can also grant clemency to those convicted of federal crimes, reducing their sentences while leaving convictions in place. This authority, however, is not limitless.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though the president can grant an unlimited number of pardons, they can only do so for federal criminal offenses, not state crimes or civil liability. There are also <a href="https://protectdemocracy.org/work/the-presidential-pardon-power-explained/">other restrictions</a> on the president’s pardon powers: Federal courts have found that pardons must advance “public welfare”; they cannot be used to infringe on constitutional rights, to obstruct justice, or as bribes; and they must not interfere with the president’s duty to “<a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S3-3-1/ALDE_00001160/">take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed</a>” by encouraging future lawbreaking.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Have presidents pardoned their family before?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Presidents have pardoned members of their family before, though it’s relatively uncommon. Bill Clinton pardoned his half-brother, who <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/02/nx-s1-5213251/hunter-biden-presidential-pardon-explained">pleaded guilty</a> to drug charges in 1985. Trump pardoned his son-in-law Jared Kushner’s father, Charles Kushner, who he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/30/politics/charles-kushner-france-ambassador-trump/index.html">recently appointed as the US ambassador to France</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump also pardoned <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2023/trump-pardon-power-2024-benefit/?itid=hp-top-table-main_p001_f001">dozens of people</a> shortly before leaving office in his first term who later went on to endorse him or financially support his 2024 campaign, including his former White House chief strategist Steven Bannon, former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, his former campaign chair Paul Manafort, and his former political consultant Roger Stone.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 1974, Gerald Ford notably pardoned his predecessor, Richard Nixon, after the Watergate scandal, a decision he attributed to the need to allow the country to move past the scandal.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Biden’s controversial decision to pardon his son may pave the way for future presidents — Trump included — to abuse their pardon powers. Biden’s pardon is incredibly broad, covering over a decade in which his son could have potentially committed crimes that have not even been charged yet, and in that sense, is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/12/02/hunter-biden-presidential-pardon-comparisons/">unprecedented</a>. Typically, presidents pardon specific crimes or any crimes related to a particular event. This one amounts to blanket amnesty.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Will Trump pardon anyone when he takes office?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has previously claimed he has an “<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/hunter-biden-donald-trump-pardon-2028-1994233">absolute right</a>” to pardon himself, a statement that has <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/hunter-biden-donald-trump-pardon-2028-1994233">divided legal scholars</a>. It’s unclear if he will test that theory, however; while he has <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/11/donald-trump-legal-cases-charges/675531/">34 felony convictions</a> to his name for falsifying business records, those lie outside his pardon power in New York state court. He also faces multiple federal criminal investigations, but following Trump’s reelection, Special Counsel Jack Smith and the Justice Department said they would drop cases against him for trying to overturn the 2020 election and mishandling classified documents at Mar-a-Lago.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The conservative majority on the Supreme Court has suggested it might side with Trump if he pardons himself. In a ruling earlier this year, it found that presidents have immunity from prosecution for official acts under their &#8220;exclusive sphere of constitutional authority.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has also suggested he would pardon those behind the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol. More than <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/prosecution-jan-6-capitol-riot-60-minutes/">1,000 people</a> have been convicted for their involvement, including on charges of seditious conspiracy and assaulting law enforcement officers, and hundreds of cases are still pending. Trump has previously, baselessly, called them “hostages” and said he would be &#8220;<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-january-6-defendants-first-acts-reelected/">inclined to pardon many of them</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Past presidents have pardoned insurrectionists before, but not recently. Previous cases include during the 1794 Whiskey Rebellion and the Philippine-American War at the turn of the 20th century, but in those cases, the pardons were seen as an opportunity to quell further unrest. Potential Trump pardons for January 6 insurrectionists could have the opposite effect; by allowing his supporters to escape consequences for committing politically motivated violence, it could encourage further such violence on his behalf.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Could the pardon power be reformed?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some Democrats have raised the possibility of putting guardrails on the president’s pardon power to prevent future abuses in the wake of Biden’s decision. Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5017923-gerry-connolly-hunter-biden-pardon/">indicated</a> Monday that he would support reforms: “At the very least, we’ve got to circumscribe it so that you don’t get to pardon relatives, even if you believe passionately that they’re innocent or their cause is just,” he said on CNN.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other Democrats have <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/4913189-trump-pardon-power-reform/">previously suggested</a> that not only a president’s family members, but members of their administrations or campaign staff and anyone who commits a crime to further the president’s personal interests should not be eligible for a pardon. Though that might already be beyond the scope of the president’s pardon powers, making that prohibition explicit would help prevent abuse, especially since courts may be reluctant to intervene.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, such reforms would require a constitutional amendment. Two-thirds of both chambers of Congress would have to approve it, which seems unlikely at such a moment of political polarization.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>How could Biden still use his pardon powers?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With under two months left in office, Biden may still issue further pardons. It’s traditional for presidents to issue grants of executive clemency before leaving office, and advocates have urged Biden to do so in a number of cases. Perhaps most prominently, Biden still has time to grant clemency to the<a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/biden-contemplates-federal-commutation-requests"> 40 men currently on federal death row</a>, who otherwise would face the <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-trump-and-barrs-last-minute-killing-spree">possibility of execution</a> under a second Trump administration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He could also use the power to alleviate the harms of mass incarceration, as <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25354946-2024-11-20-letter-to-president-biden-on-clemency?responsive=1&amp;title=1">dozens of lawmakers</a> have recently urged him. Specifically, they asked Biden to help “elderly and chronically ill,” “people with unjustified sentencing disparities,” and “women who were punished for defending themselves against their abusers” who are currently in prison, including many who do not pose a public safety threat and who have been separated from their families.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.justice.gov/pardon/clemency-statistics">Biden has granted 25 pardons and 132 commutations</a> of sentences during his time in office, according to Department of Justice data. That puts him behind other recent Democratic presidents, including Barack Obama, who issued 212 pardons and 1,715 commutations during two terms. However, Obama issued hundreds of clemency actions on his <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/23/13731448/obama-pardon-clemency-commutation">last day in office</a>, and Biden could do the same — on Monday, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre <a href="https://x.com/ToluseO/status/1863619155427017125">told reporters</a> that more pardons will be forthcoming.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President Joe Biden has pardoned Hunter Biden for all crimes — known and unknown — that his son committed over the past 11 years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is not a great look for a man who’s decried President-elect Donald Trump’s attacks on impartial law enforcement, declared that “<a href="https://x.com/JoeBiden/status/1796665674535711051">No one is above the law</a>,” and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/06/politics/biden-will-not-pardon-hunter-biden/index.html">repeatedly</a> vowed he <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/13/president-says-he-wont-pardon-hunter-biden-00163281">would not</a> pardon his son.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The president <a href="https://x.com/samstein/status/1863380360635015505/photo/1">justified</a> immunizing Hunter from criminal accountability by arguing that his son&nbsp;had been “selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted.” Hunter Biden was convicted of lying on a federal gun application and failing to pay his taxes, offenses that virtually never inspire felony charges, in the president’s telling. That he was not only prosecuted for such indiscretions — but charged so aggressively he was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/us/politics/hunter-biden-crimes.html">likely to face three years in prison</a> — reflected a politically biased process, Biden argues: Were he not the child of the GOP’s top political adversary, Hunter would never have faced hard time for such minor crimes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is a plausible argument. But then, one can just as reasonably argue that New York would never <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/353111/trump-trial-verdict-criticisms-wrongly-convicted">have investigated anyone but Trump</a> for falsifying business records to conceal a hush money payment to a porn actor paramour. And in that case, Biden was emphatic that the <a href="https://x.com/JoeBiden/status/1796665674535711051">law was the law</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All this said, it is not hard to understand Biden’s hypocrisy. His sole surviving son was staring down years in prison, plausibly because of Biden’s own decision to seek the presidency (thereby throwing a spotlight on his son with a history of drug addiction). The incoming president, meanwhile, has vowed to investigate the Biden family for further crimes. Joe Biden had the power to protect his child from imprisonment and further selective prosecutions. I suspect most fathers in his shoes would do as he has done.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Biden is not just a father. He is, for a few more weeks anyway, the de facto leader of the Democratic Party. And this pardon does his co-partisans no favors.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To the contrary, it reinforces the narrative that Democrats’ ostensible horror at Trump’s <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/04/corruption-is-trumps-greatest-political-liability.html">use of public power for private benefit</a> is sanctimonious posturing. If all sides are corrupt, why not back the unabashed crook who promises to ruthlessly put America first? These sorts of (deluded) sentiments have badly undermined Democrats in recent years. And the pardoning of Hunter Biden lends credence to such reasoning.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More concretely, Biden has made it more difficult for Democrats to claim the moral high ground in impending fights over Trump’s abuses of the pardon power. Already, the president-elect <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/01/us-news/donald-trump-vows-to-overhaul-democrat-controlled-doj-after-biden-pardons-son-hunter/">has hinted</a> that he intends to pardon the January 6 rioters en masse, an act that could embolden other MAGA die-hards eager to commit lawless acts in service of their leader.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fortunately, Democrats now have the opportunity to demonstrate the sincerity of their ideals, while also mitigating one of their party’s greatest political liabilities — all by simply loudly and uniformly condemning Biden’s pardon as an abuse of power.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, from a certain angle, Biden may have just done his party a favor. The president’s extraordinary unpopularity has weighed on Democrats for years now. During the 2024 campaign, the party had limited capacity to distance themselves from the Biden administration, since their standard-bearer was its second-most prominent member.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But now that Harris 2024 is no more, Democrats face little imperative to protect Biden’s brand. And the impetus to get out from under his shadow has only grown since Election Day. According to both <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/653786/postelection-economic-confidence-biden-ratings-down.aspx">Gallup</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/">538’s polling</a>, Biden’s approval rating has fallen since the election, with Americans now disapproving of him by a 19-point margin in the latter’s assessment. Exit polls, meanwhile, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/2024-exit-polls-fears-american-democracy-economic-discontent/story?id=115529546">showed a record-high 45 percent</a> of voters saying that they have grown worse off under the existing administration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thus, even before Hunter’s pardon, it was in the interests of Democrats to loudly break with their president. Now, the party has a means of doing so without implicating anyone else in their firmament. Denouncing Biden over inflation would involve disparaging every Democratic member of Congress who voted for the president’s fiscal policies (which also still have <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7240265e-0157-428b-9c47-fb07c360dfc2">much to recommend them on the merits</a>). Decrying the president for pardoning his son, by contrast, damages no one but the president, whose career in Democratic politics is over.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To be sure, many voters are not going to notice Democrats’ disavowing Biden en masse, while others will see it as a cynical ploy. Taking Biden to task for pardoning his son is not going to solve all of the party’s problems. And this whole episode will have fallen far out of the public’s consciousness by the 2026 midterms, let alone the 2028 presidential election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the project of extricating the Democratic brand from a presidency that voters disdain — however misguidedly — must start somewhere. In pardoning Hunter, Biden has given both his son and his party a chance for a new beginning. Democrats should seize it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Monday, the Supreme Court held an ostentatiously normal oral argument in a <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/387520/supreme-court-white-lion-andy-oldham-vaping">high-stakes case about vaping</a>. The bottom line is that the justices appear likely to reject an attempt to undermine the Food and Drug Administration’s authority over nicotine vapes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The case is significant not because of what it means for the relationship between the FDA and tobacco companies, but what it portends about the future of American law. The question the Court considered on Monday has come before various lower court judges many times. And each time, the lower courts ruled in favor of the FDA — except once. That one outlier decision was authored by Judge Andy Oldham, a Trump appointee who is widely considered a strong candidate for the Supreme Court in the incoming administration, should an opening arise.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, while the current panel of justices appears likely to follow existing law and back the FDA, that Monday’s case exists at all suggests the Court could grow more friendly to attempts to sabotage agencies like the FDA if President-elect Donald Trump gets to fill more seats on the high Court.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The case, known as <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/food-and-drug-administration-v-wages-and-white-lion-investments-llc/"><em>FDA v. Wages and White Lion Investments</em></a>, arises out of a 2009 law giving the FDA authority to regulate tobacco and other nicotine products. Because it took a long time for the FDA to start enforcing this law against vapes, many flavored vaping products are now widely available, but FDA has now begun the process of <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/387520/supreme-court-white-lion-andy-oldham-vaping">pulling those products from the market</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Under the 2009 law, the FDA is supposed to <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/387j">ban all vaping products</a> unless they are “appropriate for the protection of the public health.” Specifically, the FDA must weigh whether a particular vaping product is likely to cause more existing cigarette smokers to “stop using such products,” than it would cause new vapers to take up the habit and become addicted to nicotine.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Armed with this statutory mandate, the FDA has approved some tobacco- and menthol-flavored vaping products, while rejecting products that are fruit, candy, or dessert-flavored. The idea is that vapes that taste similar to cigarettes are likely to appeal to adult smokers, while vapes that taste like cherries or cinnamon candy are more likely to appeal to teenagers who aren’t yet addicted to nicotine.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>White Lion</em> involves two vaping companies that make products with flavors like <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/387520/supreme-court-white-lion-andy-oldham-vaping">“Chewy Clouds Sour Grape,” “Killer Kustard,” and “Suicide Bunny Mother’s Milk and Cookies.”</a> The FDA rejected these companies’ request to approve these teen-friendly products.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Oldham and the tobacco companies behind the case both argued that the FDA engaged in “regulatory switcheroos” when it allegedly told vaping companies to submit one kind of evidence in their applications seeking approval of flavored vapes then rejected those applications for failing to provide a different kind of evidence. But only Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito appeared open to this argument.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is a minor side issue in the case that could give some of the justices a reason to rule against the FDA on very narrow grounds. But, for the most part, <em>White Lion</em> appears likely to end in a perfectly normal decision holding that the FDA, and not the courts (including judges like Oldham), gets to decide which vaping products are legal under the 2009 law.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><em>FDA v. Wages and White Lion Investments</em> is not a hard case</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The FDA took a long time to roll out its regulations of flavored vapes. The law permitting it to regulate tobacco products at all is only 15 years old, and the FDA did not actually finalize its regulations governing vapes until 2016. Vaping companies were required to seek FDA approval of their products by September 9, 2020, or else those products would be immediately removed from the market. Companies that met the deadline received an additional grace period allowing them to sell their vapes while the FDA considered their application.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The result was that, by the time FDA actually got around to denying many of those applications (and the FDA says it has denied applications to sell over 1 million different vaping products), there were plenty of companies already selling flavored vapes in the United States. Those companies filed a flurry of lawsuits once the FDA denied their applications.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But, with one exception, every court to consider those lawsuits rejected them. Eight federal appeals courts heard these vaping cases, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/387520/supreme-court-white-lion-andy-oldham-vaping">seven of them rejected them in unanimous opinions</a>. Only the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/12/27/23496264/supreme-court-fifth-circuit-trump-court-immigration-housing-sexual-harrassment"> most right-wing of the federal circuits</a>, bought the vaping companies’ arguments. This is part of a pattern in the Fifth Circuit. The court’s judges — Oldham in particular — have consistently handed down decisions undermining federal agencies’ ability to function, often relying on arguments that have no support in actual law.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It was pretty clear during Monday’s <em>White Lion</em> oral argument that the arguments against FDA are weak and imprecise. Oldham’s primary argument against the FDA was that the agency changed its requirements for product approval. Oldham claims the agency first told vaping companies they are not required to conduct two specific kinds of experiments — “randomized controlled trials and longitudinal cohort studies” — and then rejected applications to sell certain vapes because they did not include these kinds of studies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/387520/supreme-court-white-lion-andy-oldham-vaping">that’s not what happened</a>. What the FDA actually said was that the companies “could have” submitted these kinds of studies, but it would also “consider other evidence” suggesting that a particular vaping product was likely to benefit the public health.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, many of the justices appeared baffled by the suggestion that FDA changed its position during the long approval process. “I’m not really seeing what the surprise is here, or what the change is here,” Justice Elena Kagan told Eric Heyer, the lawyer for the vaping companies. Justice Sonia Sotomayor said she’s “at a loss” trying to understand how the FDA switched its position.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, several of the Court’s Republicans also seemed skeptical of Oldham and the vaping companies’ arguments. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, for example, expressed confusion about why the case is in federal court in the first place. As he pointed out, the vaping companies seek a court order requiring the FDA to reconsider their applications. But, as Kavanaugh noted, the companies are already allowed to reapply for approval in the event of a rejection. So what, exactly, he asked, is the legal issue the courts need to decide?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similarly, Justice Amy Coney Barrett criticized Oldham’s conclusion that ambiguous statements by the FDA must be construed against the agency, at one point asking Heyer how that rule could possibly work if applied broadly.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is one side issue in the case that could cause a headache for the FDA. In their applications, the vaping companies were supposed to lay out what safeguards they had in place — such as requiring retail sellers of vapes to check IDs — to prevent young people from buying nicotine products. The FDA admits it did not even bother to evaluate these sections of many vaping companies’ applications, and the government doesn’t really defend its non-action on these sections of the applications.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead, the government claims its error was harmless, because the applications would have been denied anyway because the FDA had already denied other applications proposing similar safeguards against youth vaping.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A few justices suggested that maybe the case should be sent back to the FDA to give them an opportunity to evaluate these applications in full. But that suggestion seemed to lose steam as the argument proceeded. Even Justice Neil Gorsuch, who often votes with the Court’s rightmost flank, at one point seemed to agree with the government that it is “obvious” the FDA will just deny the applications again if the case is sent back to them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, if any part of this case is sent back to the FDA, the agency will take up the question of flavored vapes under a new Trump administration — and Heyer was quite honest about the fact that his clients are hoping they would get a new result from a Republican-run FDA.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But, as Kavanaugh pointed out, nothing prevents the vaping companies from reapplying for approval under the Trump administration anyway. So, if Trump and his subordinates are determined to legalize flavored vapes, they will potentially have an opportunity to do so no matter what the Court does in <em>White Lion</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In any event, it seems very unlikely that the Court will sign onto Oldham’s approach, or hand down a broad decision disabling the FDA. For now, at least, there appears to be some daylight between the median justice on the Supreme Court, and the most extreme elements within the judiciary.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s a code of conduct for the multiplex experience, deliberately broadcast right before a movie: When the lights start to dim, we turn off our phones and end any side discussions. However, if dispatches of <em>Wicked</em> screenings around the country are any indication, this code isn’t being followed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the few days since the highly anticipated musical movie <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/386247/wicked-2024-movie-novel-ending-explained-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo"><em>Wicked</em></a> arrived in theaters, it’s been difficult to scroll through social media without seeing photos — if not entire scenes —&nbsp;of the film taken from patrons’ phones. In-theater recordings of <em>Wicked</em>’s signature number “Defying Gravity” are all over TikTok. <a href="https://x.com/nat_dwbua_/status/1860541618060943677">One X<em> </em>user</a> went viral for asking fans to post photos they had snapped during the movie. This immediately ignited a conversation among film critics and cinephiles about a lack of theater etiquette in the general public. But is it totally their fault?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s safe to say that the film marketing tactics of the past few years have taught people how to show up to movies — ready to whip out their phones. That’s not to mention the advent of streaming, plus the years spent mostly inside during the pandemic, that have certainly played a role in a lack of movie-going etiquette.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the wake of <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23789864/barbenheimer-barbieheimer-barbie-oppenheimer-release-memes-double-feature">Barbenheimer</a>, movies aren’t just meant to be shared with a room full of people but with others on social media. The endless merch and product tie-ins that come with IP films, as well as more organic efforts to dress up for screenings, have made the extremely mundane experience of sitting in a dark room for a couple of hours &#8220;content.&#8221; But what happens to moviegoing when it becomes all about sharing?&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Moviegoing for the ’gram</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In an effort to recoup losses from the pandemic, there have been more and more incentives for people to get off their couches and back into movie theaters. These innovations certainly enhanced the moviegoing experience beyond snacking on popcorn, ultimately making it a lot more shareable and post-worthy online. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since 2019, when AMC offered <a href="https://www.marketingbrew.com/stories/2024/11/22/how-the-specialty-popcorn-bucket-is-helping-build-out-the-theater-experience">specially designed R2-D2 popcorn buckets</a> to coincide with the release of <em>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</em>, novelty items have made a huge comeback. Now, they’re an expected bonus when buying tickets for the year’s biggest releases. Over the past few years, AMC has sold uniquely designed buckets and cups for buzzy movies like <em>The Mario Bros. Movie</em>, <em>Renaissance: A Film By Beyoncé</em>, and <em>Dune: Part Two</em>. The last film’s elaborately designed bucket — with an opening resembling the mouth of a sandworm — was so attention-grabbing that it got its own parody song on an episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rl_Xhvgkxrk"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/362928/how-to-see-twisters-4dx-perfect-way-imax-rpx-explained">4Dx experience</a> is another in-theater development that patrons can’t stop posting about. The immersive format, involving motion seats and practical effects, gained a lot of word-of-mouth popularity this year for movies like <em>Madame Web</em>, <em>Twisters</em>, and <em>Deadpool and Wolverine. </em>Much of this word-of-mouth, though, has occurred online, particularly on TikTok where <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sharmedlife/video/7393729832238042398?q=4dx%20&amp;t=1732734281770">influencers</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@allyb1226/video/7400158266266815774?q=4dx%20&amp;t=1732734281770">regular</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@yourboymoyo/video/7238331364293102874?q=4dx%20&amp;t=1732734281770">customers</a> film themselves being thrust around and sprayed with water while the movie’s playing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Outside of theaters, studios are <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/movie-marketing-spends-summer-films-1235142253/">investing more and more money</a> into elaborate marketing campaigns for their buzziest movies, the most notable cases being the 2023 hit <em>Barbie</em> and this year’s <em>Wicked.</em> This advertising has largely manifested in endless brand collaborations, from <a href="https://pressroom.lexus.com/drive-the-magic-lexus-unveils-a-wicked-pair-of-rides/">luxury cars</a> to <a href="https://www.crocs.com/c/cast-of-characters/wicked?gclid=Cj0KCQiAgJa6BhCOARIsAMiL7V9r16y4M6AfvJSTaWB0mYsiMwfQ2-GipciKFAxbgly9P16pZr-9VrQaAoE-EALw_wcB&amp;adid=ppc_google_us_brand_wicked_searchgooglebrandcollections_x_x_x&amp;ef_id=Cj0KCQiAgJa6BhCOARIsAMiL7V9r16y4M6AfvJSTaWB0mYsiMwfQ2-GipciKFAxbgly9P16pZr-9VrQaAoE-EALw_wcB:G:s&amp;s_kwcid=AL!4035!3!717308216836!e!!g!!wicked%20crocs&amp;gad_source=1">Crocs</a>, all designed to&nbsp;be collected and shared on social media with the movie’s hashtag. The ubiquity of the marketing suggests that if you aren’t seeing these movies in theaters, you’re missing out on a huge monocultural moment.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Studios have also turned to influencers to provide <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/film-critics-social-media-influencers-screenings-publicity/">early reactions to movies</a>. Sometimes, these popular X and TikTok users are invited to advance screenings alongside journalists. In more and more cases —&nbsp;like with <em>Gladiator II</em> and <em>Wicked — </em>they’re given earlier access to these movies than some critics.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Amid all of these orchestrated marketing movies, it seems as though customers are finding unique ways to enhance the moviegoing experience for themselves. For example, the trend of “themed dressing” feels like an earnest expression of movie fan culture with organic roots. In the past, this trend has been reserved for movies associated with “nerd culture,&#8221; like <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Harry Potter</em>. But <a href="https://www.gq.com/gallery/barbie-oppenheimer-street-style-photos">“Barbenheimer”</a><em> </em>made this activity more of an instinctual habit for the average moviegoer. Without the instruction of a studio, everyone got the memo to wear pink to their screenings of <em>Barbie</em> and, on a lesser scale, black to see <em>Oppenheimer</em>. Since then, marketers have clearly taken notice. This seemed evident in a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/itendswithusmovie/reel/C-dIFmsPeWH/?hl=en">promotional video</a> Blake Lively filmed earlier this year for the domestic abuse movie <em><a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/366523/blake-lively-drama-justin-baldoni-it-ends-with-us-hoover-movie-feud">It Ends With Us</a></em>, where she urged ticket-buyers to “wear their florals” in theme with the movie’s florist protagonist. The same phenomenon is occurring at <em>Wicked</em> showings, where fans are arriving in pink or green clothes, and even full-on green face paint to imitate the main character Elphaba.&nbsp;If fans weren’t planning on dressing up themselves, the pink-and-green marketing certainly implied that it was a crucial part of the theater experience.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What happens to a communal space when it’s all about content?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since <em>Wicked</em>’s premiere, moviegoers have been posting their reactions to the film — along with their themed outfits —  on TikTok and X, often directly from the theater. One <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@fredasquith/video/7440889417750809888?q=me%20before%20wicked&amp;t=1732646647387">trend</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@bacobell_/video/7440845864546929951?q=me%20before%20wicked&amp;t=1732646647387">that’s</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@yourstrulybusie/video/7440330399710072094?q=me%20before%20wicked&amp;t=1732646647387">proved</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@gia.mariano/video/7440953771108076846?q=me%20before%20wicked&amp;t=1732646647387">popular</a> is a format where a user posts themselves before the movie starts with a hard cut to their emotional reaction during the credits or outside of the theater. In other cases, people have <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@imogenhorton/video/7441177027815738656?q=reactions%20during%20wicked&amp;t=1732730139853">filmed themselves</a> or the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@songsbyralph/video/7441433639751077175?q=reactions%20to%20wicked&amp;t=1732730084783">person next to them</a> reacting to the movie while they’re watching it. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many of these emotional responses are genuine. But the urge to self-broadcast in the middle of a film speaks to a misunderstanding or, in some cases,&nbsp;complete disregard for the sanctity of movie theaters. In its worst interpretation, it shows a lack of respect for other people’s in-theater experiences.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This phenomenon has become a problem outside of the theater, too. In the case of <em>Wicked</em>, many users have posted photos of the film, including spoilers or pivotal scenes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Undoubtedly, studios’ recent embrace of <a href="https://www.screendaily.com/features/how-social-media-influencers-are-transforming-film-marketing/5187462.article">influencers as marketers</a> has something to do with this. In an article for <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/movie-marketing-spends-summer-films-1235142253/">the Hollywood Reporter</a>, writer Pamela McClintock said that, as “advertising on TV is more complicated and expensive,” studios have had to explore different promotional routes including “TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, YouTube and other platforms.” Likewise, influencers are now&nbsp;appearing at press junkets, activations, and other events, implying that moviegoing is also about engagement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Entertainment reporter Raven Brunner says that screenings have contributed to the movie-posting problem, given that influencers and even critics are encouraged to take photos and post them. “When you go to an early screening, they have that customized banner before the movie starts that you&#8217;re supposed to take photos of,” she says.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s hard not to draw a line from the posts that circulate after an advanced screening — whether it’s from a film account or a <a href="https://people.com/ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo-transform-kim-kardashian-home-wicked-magical-screening-party-8732640">celebrity</a> — to the average moviegoer snapping photos during <em>Wicked</em>. Comedian and writer Josh Gondelman thinks this problem exposes a tendency for moviegoers to view themselves as “creators” first. As a result, they end up prioritizing what they share with others over their own personal consumption.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There are so many ways to be like, ‘hey, check me out. I&#8217;m a person in the world engaging with culture,’ which I think is pleasant,” he says. “But you can do it without making everyone else&#8217;s experience in the theater secondary to your followers&#8217; later.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, he doesn’t think all movie-posting comes from a shallow, attention-seeking place.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I always try to be understanding and appreciative of people who want to do, like, a long vlog response to something and just want to share their thoughts on art,” he says.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, there are basic rules of behaving in public that people, particularly in a younger, more online generation, are <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23835782/concert-attack-cardi-b-pink-ashes-movie-theater">struggling with</a>. The past few years since the pandemic spent largely inside watching movies on streamers presumably haven’t helped.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At a bare minimum, these inescapable spoilers and leaked scenes show an enthusiasm around movies (or at least certain titles). Maybe there’s hope that, in a world where young people have been influenced to see movies again, they can also be influenced into turning off their phones.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thanks to a new Netflix docuseries from true crime mainstay <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/2/5/18210945/ted-bundy-extremely-wicked-shockingly-evil-vile-review-netflix">Joe Berlinger</a>, audiences across the nation are asking a question true crime fans never really let go of.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The new series, <em>Cold Case: Who Killed JonBenét Ramsey</em>, doesn’t actually spend all that many of its three hour-long episodes speculating about its title question. Instead, it spends most of them arguing a hot take that’s less hot than you might think — that JonBenét’s own parents didn’t do it. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&nbsp;Following JonBenét’s violent death — which occurred sometime during the early morning hours of December 25 and 26, 1996, in her family’s massive home in Boulder, Colorado — that was a very popular theory. During the ensuing media frenzy, many members of the public looked at John Ramsey and his wife Patsy (who died in 2006) and assumed the case was open and shut.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The victim was an <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/184273-how-the-jonbenet-ramsey-case-affected-me-as-a-kid">eerily</a> <a href="https://www.academia.edu/6086362/_Necrophilia_Pedophilia_or_Both_The_Sexualized_Rhetoric_of_the_JonBenet_Ramsey_Murder_Case_">sexualized</a> 6-year-old pageant queen; her face graced the tabloid magazine covers at every checkout line in America. In 1997, no single news story was bigger than this one; by 1998, the Los Angeles Times labeled her “<a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-sep-28-ca-27182-story.html">the nation’s most famous murdered child since the Lindbergh baby</a>.” And although a <a href="https://realnewjournalism.com/2016/09/17/jonbenet-ramsey-a-judicial-analysis/">2003 federal ruling</a> supported the Ramseys’ innocence, and they were formally <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna25608543">exonerated in 2008</a>, many people remain convinced that one or both of JonBenét’s parents were the culprits and suggest they did it to cover up a horrible accident committed by their 9-year-old son. A hugely influential <a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/burke-ramsey-now-rcna181229">2016 CBS series</a> about the case confidently made that argument.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet in recent years, many experts, including several featured in Berlinger’s documentary, have argued that an intruder committed the crime — a theory that the original police investigation never really seemed to take seriously, and which led to deep divisions among Boulder police, the district attorney, and the FBI.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Much of the confusion stems from the problem that the original investigation was botched from the beginning, with police allowing the crime scene to be completely contaminated, evidence to be moved around and tampered with, rooms to be cleaned, and a string of visitors to traipse throughout the house for hours after the Ramseys called 911. This negligence torpedoed the integrity and reliability of nearly every piece of evidence in the case. As a result,&nbsp;even decades later, every detail remains up for debate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As for a list of potential suspects, while there are several primary contenders, including the Ramseys, it’s often difficult to have an even-handed discussion about them. That’s likely all because of a single piece of evidence, one of the most infamous in true crime history: the ransom note.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For most people who look into the JonBenét case, how they view the ransom note determines how they view the rest of the case, including who did it. That’s because the ransom note itself is so inexplicable that it immediately, and perhaps permanently, biased and derailed the entire investigation.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The strangest ransom note ever</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first weird thing about the ransom note is where Patsy claims to have found it — lying unobtrusively on the floor of a back spiral stairwell in the early-morning hours of December 26. She gave conflicting stories about the sequence of events: In one version, she checked JonBenét’s room first and noticed she was missing, and then found the ransom note; in the more frequently repeated version, she found the note first, then ran upstairs to check on JonBenét, only to discover her missing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The next weird thing about the ransom note is &#8230; well &#8230; everything about it. Here is the text in full:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">Mr. Ramsey,</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Listen carefully! We are a group of individuals that represent a small foreign faction. We [the word “do” has been scribbled out] respect your bussiness [sic] but not the country that it serves. At this time we have your daughter in our posession [sic]. She is safe and unharmed and if you want her to see 1997, you must follow our instructions to the letter.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">You will withdraw $118,000.00 from your account. $100,000 will be in $100 bills and the remaining $18,000 in $20 bills. Make sure that you bring an adequate size attache [sic] to the bank. When you get home you will put the money in a brown paper bag. I will call you between 8 and 10 am tomorrow to instruct you on delivery. The delivery will be exhausting so I advise you to be rested. If we monitor you getting the money early, we might call you early to arrange an earlier delivery of the money and hence a [sic] earlier [“delivery” is scribbled out] pick-up of your daughter.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Any deviation of my instructions will result in the immediate execution of your daughter. You will also be denied her remains for proper burial. The two gentlemen watching over your daughter do not [“not” has been inserted between words] particularly like you so I advise you not to provoke them. Speaking to anyone about your situation, such as Police, F.B.I., etc., will result in your daughter being beheaded. If we catch you talking to a stray dog, she dies. If you alert bank authorities, she dies. If the money is in any way marked or tampered with, she dies. You will be scanned for electronic devices and if any are found, she dies. You can try to deceive us but be warned that we are familiar with Law enforcement countermeasures and tactics. You stand a 99% chance of killing your daughter if you try to out smart [sic] us. Follow our instructions and you stand a 100% chance of getting her back.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">You and your family are under constant scrutiny as well as the authorities. Don&#8217;t try to grow a brain John. You are not the only fat cat around so don&#8217;t think that killing will be difficult. Don&#8217;t underestimate us John. Use that good southern common sense of yours. It is up to you now John!</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Victory!</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">S.B.T.C</p>
</blockquote>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s a lot to unpack here: The strange ransom amount — $118,000 — corresponded to John’s year-end bonus that year from the lucrative tech company he ran. The note’s over-the-top language seems to be referencing well-known quotes from movies that feature abductions and ransoms, including <em>Dirty Harry</em>, <em>Ransom</em>, <em>Ruthless People</em>, and <em>Speed</em>. The “foreign faction” is very obviously not real, and “S.B.T.C.” has never been linked to any existing group.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The final oddity about the note is where it came from — a notepad belonging to Patsy. The note’s author not only used the notepad, they wrote a draft version of the note originally addressed to “Mr. &amp; Mrs.” before directing the note just to John. They even used a Sharpie from the house that they then helpfully returned to the correct pen holder.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Patsy participated in a string of handwriting analysis sessions for investigators. One of them testified for the prosecution at the grand jury, <a href="https://extras.denverpost.com/news/jon101799.htm">reportedly concluding</a> that the “handwriting showed indications that the writer was Patsy Ramsey” but that it was impossible to be certain. However, the modern understanding of handwriting analysis generally holds that it’s a shaky forensic arena prone to <a href="https://www.criminallegalnews.org/news/2023/jan/15/debunking-forensic-science-decade-increased-scrutiny-reveals-forensic-processes-prone-bias-and-error/">significant cognitive bias</a>, and that less experienced analysts are <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2119944119">more likely</a> not only to be wrong, but to be more confidently wrong than their peers. Other handwriting analysts have since <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/9797920/jonbenet-ramsey-update-ransom-note-handwriting-gary-oliva/">offered</a> totally different opinions about who wrote it. Behavioral analysts, too, tried to analyze the note with dubious results. To give you an idea of the kind of hysteria that surrounded this case, one official psychological profile <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990224122955/http://www.seraph.net/jonbenet.html">claimed</a> that “SBTC” could have meant “Saved by the cross,” and argued that Patsy was a “delusional sociopath” who committed the murder as part of an arcane religious ritual.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The ransom note is so strange that for many people it’s impossible to get around the sheer improbability of anyone writing it at all. After all, what purpose could it serve an intruder to linger in the house after the crime, taking their time to write multiple drafts of a note, for a kidnapping that had not taken place?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One argument against this is that the intruder could have written the note before the crime. The Ramseys were away for hours at a Christmas party that evening, which gave a potential predator hours to enter the house, familiarize themselves with the home’s layout, and play around with creative writing exercises while waiting for the family to return and settle in for the night. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the question of motive — why? — seems to lead, for most people, away from an intruder and straight back to a Ramsey: The note is so fantastical that the most glaringly obvious conclusion is that it was written by someone who was desperate to divert attention away from the home and away from the family. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For a while, if that was the motivation, it worked: Boulder police assembled at the house but then left without securing it as a crime scene, leaving only one officer there throughout the day until JonBenét’s body was ultimately found by her father in the basement.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet if this was really a cover-up by the family, the question of motive still remains: Why would the family leave (or place) JonBenét’s body in the basement if they wanted the police to think she’d been abducted? Why write such an elaborate ransom note or ask for such a specifically incriminating amount? Either way you look at it, the ransom note just doesn’t make sense.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For most people, there’s only one way to read the ransom note: Patsy wrote it. What else could it be?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One alternate way for us to think about this ransom note comes to us via <a href="https://www.truecrimeconsult.com/"><em>The Consult</em></a>, a recent podcast hosted by former members of the FBI’s Behavioral Analysis Unit, of <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/14/16474370/mindhunter-review-netflix-fincher"><em>Mindhunter</em></a> fame. We know <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/11/12/18044688/criminal-profilers-mindhunter-hannibal-criminal-minds">criminal profiling is as pseudoscientific</a> as every other cool-but-actually-junk forensic tool, so we have to take this analysis with many grains of salt. But in their <a href="https://www.truecrimeconsult.com/jonbenet-ramsey-the-ransom-note-part-1/">two-part</a> <a href="https://www.truecrimeconsult.com/jonbenet-ramsey-the-ransom-note-part-2/">series</a> studying the ransom note earlier this year, host Julia Cowley and her guest Robert Drew made interesting observations about the mindset of the letter writer — by honing in on the fact that they were really into movies about abduction.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That sounds like an obvious point, but the profilers used it to make a salient point about the kind of person who could commit this crime. Every film referenced in the note involves a villain who, at the moment he’s making ransom demands, fully has the upper hand over the hero. He’s not only calling the shots, but doing so gleefully and maliciously, exactly as the letter writer may be attempting to do with John. The former FBI profilers argue that the letter is a fantasy of having control over someone rich and powerful — that it’s not an anomaly, but rather an extension of a crime scene created by a sadistic child abuser.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This isn’t the only way to read the note, of course, but it’s a reasonable way to think about how the note fits into an intruder scenario. And given the resurgence of interest in the case, maybe this truly bizarre piece of evidence will finally start making some sense.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A year after graduating from college, Chi was adrift.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She’d gone from a life of structure to one without guardrails and her mental health was declining. As a result, she distanced herself from friends and family. She left her job as a peer facilitator at a support group for people with depression and bipolar disorder and lived in an apartment and neighborhood with people she didn’t know.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I was very, very lonely,” says Chi, whose last name is being withheld so she could speak freely about her mental health. “[I] was trying to figure out how would I structure my days. Where could I be? Who could I talk to?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the past, a friend had suggested <a href="https://www.fountainhouse.org/">Fountain House</a>, a national mental health nonprofit that offers clinical support, housing resources, care management, and work programs for people experiencing serious mental illness, based in a physical location known as a clubhouse.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Not only could Chi get help finding work or housing, but she’d also volunteer alongside other Fountain House members to keep the place running — a cornerstone of the clubhouse model, which Fountain House <a href="https://fountainhouse.org/about/clubhouse-model">originated in the 1940s</a>. (Membership is free and work is performed on a volunteer basis without pay.) She’d have a community — and some structure — once again.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In her 13 years as a Fountain House member, Chi has been a tutor, organized cultural heritage days, and led racial equity, diversity, and gender initiatives. “I feel like I&#8217;m a person of integrity and a person of importance at Fountain House,” Chi says. “At the time when I was coming into Fountain House and really struggling with loneliness … and just feeling really lost, Fountain House has been a place where I have felt found.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While Fountain House’s model is geared toward the needs of those with mental illness, its methods for curbing loneliness are far more widely applicable in the midst of <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/366620/loneliness-epidemic-coping-demographics-america-social-connection-mental-health">an ongoing loneliness epidemic</a> that touches old and young, people of all genders, the married and unpartnered. It goes to show that while simply being around people is great, being in a community you’ve willingly opted into, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-024-00720-3">where you matter to others</a>, and where you find a sense of purpose — regardless of mental health — is even better. And it’s an ingredient that’s often conspicuously missing in discussing solutions to the burgeoning crisis.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A nostalgic slate of solutions&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In his <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf">2023 advisory on loneliness and isolation</a>, US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy suggests increased access to volunteer groups and religious organizations. The political scientist and author of <em>Bowling Alone</em> Robert Putnam <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/jul/23/join-or-die-documentary-review">says to join a club</a>. The Institute for Family Studies sings the <a href="https://ifstudies.org/blog/why-are-we-ignoring-family-as-a-solution-to-loneliness">praises of marriage and family</a>. <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/loneliness-and-social-isolation/loneliness-and-social-isolation-tips-staying-connected">Introduce yourself to your neighbors</a>, advises the National Institute on Aging. In other words, many of our leading authorities on loneliness suggest a nostalgic slate of solutions that hark back to a time when neighbors freely mingled and religious institutions provided a social and moral compass.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This perspective, of course, flattens history, and fails to account for the ways that racism, segregation, homophobia, and other acceptable forms of exclusion often kept marginalized people deeply isolated (in even more acute ways than it does today). </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It&#8217;s a distorted view of the past,” says <a href="https://www.gse.harvard.edu/directory/faculty/richard-weissbourd">Richard Weissbourd</a>, a senior lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and director of the <a href="https://mcc.gse.harvard.edu/">Making Caring Common Project</a>, an organization that provides research-backed resources for moral and emotional health. “Some of those forms of closeness were not, in fact, as simple and nourishing as people imagine them to be.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nostalgia-focused guidance also fails to account for modern ways of living. While <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/07/theres-no-place-like-home.html">many people still live near their hometowns</a>, others leave for college and work, and are separated from their family support networks — if they’re emotionally<a href="https://today.yougov.com/society/articles/44817-poll-family-ties-proximity-and-estrangement"> close to their family at all</a>. Smartphones, social media, endless forms of entertainment, and self-care are <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/350424/self-care-isolation-loneliness-epidemic">designed to keep us engaged and isolated</a>. The <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/23769973/limits-therapy-speak-narcissist-gaslighting-trauma-toxic">rise of therapy-speak</a> has helped create a social ecosystem in which people are <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23940673/balance-responsiveness-relationships-friends-family-support-mental-health">focused on their own comfort over the well-being of others</a>. Chance encounters with strangers are less likely given the ascent of self-checkout and remote work.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>To move through the world in a way that fosters connection is a choice.</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Americans also spend less time engaged in social activities and leisure. The 2023 American Time Use Survey from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics found that Americans spent <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.t11b.htm">less than five hours a day</a> on activities like watching TV, reading, and relaxing, and even less time — fewer than 30 minutes — each day socializing. While Americans spend about <a href="https://www.bls.gov/charts/american-time-use/emp-by-ftpt-job-edu-h.htm">eight hours a day at work</a>, most are not devoting their free time to <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/americans-paid-time-off-work-burnout-rcna128645">pursuits that would imbue meaning and belonging</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those who feel alienated can’t be forced to join a club or ditch their phones or ascribe to a religious identity in order to help them feel more connected. Some may have a desire to be socially engaged, but don’t have access to places like Fountain House or other affirming clubs in their communities. But there are ways to find meaningful connection even in a modern, digitally connected world. Despite its seemingly classic approach to connection, Fountain House has zeroed in on something crucial — people don’t just need social connections; they need meaningful ones, too.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What prevents connection?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The issue in our modern loneliness conundrum isn’t with the number of relationships people have, but their quality. A recent study found that 75 percent of respondents were <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305834">satisfied with the number of friends they had</a>, but 40 percent wanted to be closer to them. Over a third of Weissbourd’s participants in a 2020 survey on loneliness said they felt lonely because <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b7c56e255b02c683659fe43/t/6021776bdd04957c4557c212/1612805995893/Loneliness+in+America+2021_02_08_FINAL.pdf">no one took the time to meaningfully ask them how they were</a>; 42 percent said they wished they had more people who cared about them outside of family.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Americans recognize they desire more quality connections, what holds people back from seeking them out? In a word, Weissbourd says, individualism.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the 1950s, American society was <a href="https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/2018-07/92003.pdf">composed of social conformists</a> — people who wanted to fit in publicly, but in private, desired personal freedom to live, worship, and speak as they choose. By the ensuing decades, individualism morphed from these personal freedoms into placing a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797613479387">premium on one’s uniqueness and personal choice</a>. An increased interest in personal success, safety, and physical and mental well-being, in turn, breeds an internally focused culture. If you’re spending so much time trying to further your own pursuits, or thinking about yourself, you might fail to see the value in activities that require another person: <a href="https://www.vox.com/friendship">friendship</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/368201/volunteer-charity-donations-systemic-change-activism-nonprofits-loneliness-philanthropy">service</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/23837430/how-to-make-friends-start-a-club">club membership</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0005796711002464">self-absorption can lead to anxiety</a>, research suggests, which prevents people from reaching out in the first place <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-59532-3">out of a fear of rejection</a>. The possibility of discomfort is par for the course when interacting with others, says <a href="https://seswps.umkc.edu/profiles/daniel-maitland.html#">Daniel Maitland</a>, an associate professor of clinical psychology at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. But being too in your head because you don’t want to offend — or be offended, hurt, or rejected — prevents people from being vulnerable. “Getting out of our comfort zone is essential to forming connection,” he says.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For many, the costs of social interaction start to outweigh the benefits. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“People underestimate, potentially, how much value [social] groups might have for them,” says <a href="https://www.norc.org/about/experts/louise-hawkley.html">Louise Hawkley</a>, a principal research scientist at NORC, a nonpartisan research organization at the University of Chicago. Helping your sister with child care, attending a block party, or catching up with a friend could carry too high a likelihood of social exhaustion, awkwardness, and conflict.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To move through the world in a way that fosters connection is a choice, says <a href="https://www.nicholasepley.com/">Nicholas Epley</a>, a professor of behavioral science at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business — a choice you can make every day, even if you don’t belong to a church or book club. People inherently understand the value of sociality, he says, but some fail to make the decision to chat with people in their orbit. It’s easy to look at your phone while in the elevator — it’s a little harder to take a leap and introduce yourself to a new neighbor or colleague.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These seemingly inconsequential encounters have value. <a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2021/09/deep-conversations-strangers">Meaningful conversations can come from everyday interactions</a> and maintaining relationships with <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/23744304/how-much-social-interaction-do-you-need-loneliness-burnout">people of varying levels of closeness</a>, from stranger to closest confidante, known as “relational diversity” improves well-being.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Taking advantage of ordinary moments of connection may help promote more social engagement, Epley says. Start to notice where you could engage with others — at the grocery store, for instance — and the barriers holding you back — your phone. Small choices can have a big impact. “I, for instance, don&#8217;t keep my phone in my pocket ever unless I&#8217;m supposed to talk to somebody,”&nbsp; he says. “I have it in my backpack. That just makes it easier for me to engage with other people when they&#8217;re around.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding a way back to each other</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The struggle for meaningful relationships stems from a general sense of purposelessness, feelings of helplessness and hopelessness, of fear. “When you feel that way,” Weissbourd says, “you have greater needs from your connection.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Family, career, and faith (as well as money) still remain <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2018/11/20/where-americans-find-meaning-in-life/">common drivers of meaning</a>, but some measures suggest these tent poles of connection are diminishing in significance. Americans are <a href="https://www.bgsu.edu/ncfmr/resources/data/family-profiles/julian-median-age-first-marriage-2021-fp-22-15.html">delaying marriage</a> and <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/04/fertility-rates-declined-for-younger-women-increased-for-older-women.html?utm_campaign=20220406msacos1ccstors&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery">child-rearing</a> — if <a href="https://ifstudies.org/ifs-admin/resources/final2-ifs-single-americansbrief2020.pdf">they decide</a> to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2024/07/25/the-experiences-of-u-s-adults-who-dont-have-children/#:~:text=Secondary%20data%20methodology-,57%25%20of%20adults%20under%2050%20who%20say%20they're%20unlikely,reason%20they%20never%20had%20them">do so at all</a>. The <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/01/why-parents-and-kids-get-estranged/617612/">rise of parental estrangement</a> signals historically traditional familial roles no longer serve adult children. Gen Z and millennials increasingly <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/talent/recruiting-gen-z-and-millennials.html">disentangle their identities</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20220613-gen-z-the-workers-who-want-it-all">from their work</a>. Most Americans agree <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2024/03/15/8-in-10-americans-say-religion-is-losing-influence-in-public-life/">religion has less of an influence</a> on their lives — and they aren’t happy about it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The key to why these traditional forms of connection, like bowling leagues and religious institutions, were so effective at abating loneliness isn’t because they simply brought people together, but that participants derived meaning from them. Without it, they’re not likely to stay engaged and keep coming back.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the goal shouldn’t be to compel people to take part in these traditions; it’s for those who are adrift to find something that fills the void, that imbues meaning.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Volunteerism <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/368201/volunteer-charity-donations-systemic-change-activism-nonprofits-loneliness-philanthropy">serves such a purpose for many people</a>, Weissbourd says. Having a clear role and a shared goal is what Fountain House members say helps them stay connected and mentally well.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If personal motivations aren’t enough to spur lonely people into action, perhaps they’re more likely to engage under doctor’s orders. One promising solution that doesn’t just tell people to go back to the imagined past is a burgeoning <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/personalisedcare/social-prescribing/">social prescription</a> movement, which aims to connect patients with community volunteering, art, and movement groups. In the UK, <a href="https://socialprescribingacademy.org.uk/resources/the-future-of-social-prescribing-in-england/">where social prescribing is integrated into the national health care system</a>, more than 2.5 million people have been referred by health professionals to a “<a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/personalisedcare/workforce-and-training/social-prescribing-link-workers/">social prescribing link worker</a>” who connects those who are lonely, as well as those with chronic or mental health conditions, to social groups.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The goal, says <a href="https://www.hotzthoughts.com/">Julia Hotz,</a> author of <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Connection-Cure/Julia-Hotz/9781668030332"><em>The Connection Cure: The Prescriptive Power of Movement, Nature, Art, Service, and Belonging</em></a><em>,</em> is to find an activity that patients actually want to do. “Instead of focusing on just what&#8217;s the matter with you,” she says, “it asks what matters to you.” Because if a physician socially prescribes an art class to someone who really wants to ride a bike, “I’m probably going to choose staying home scrolling my feed,” Hotz says.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“Instead of focusing on just what’s the matter with you, social prescribing asks what matters to you.”</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Taking part in a meaningful activity with other people is usually compelling enough for participants to keep their phones out of sight, Hotz says. The mutual buy-in from fellow foragers or crocheters creates a system of support: If you miss a session, group members will notice your absence. Over time, you start to suspect that not only does the work you’re doing matter, but you matter, too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US medical system is slowly integrating social prescribing programs. In Massachusetts, <a href="https://www.wcvb.com/article/massachusetts-social-prescribing-mass-general-brigham/61572620">doctors at Mass General Brigham can prescribe</a> arts and culture events to patients. The Cleveland Clinic launched a <a href="https://consultqd.clevelandclinic.org/unconventional-approach-to-geriatric-complaints-appears-to-decrease-emergency-visits-and-symptoms">social prescribing model for geriatric patients</a>. Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey members and Rutgers University Newark students can get <a href="https://www.njpac.org/arts-well-being/">six months of free art prescriptions</a>, the first insurer-involved social prescribing program in the country.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But lack of access shouldn’t prevent people from socially prescribing for themselves, Hotz says. She suggests thinking back on activities, perhaps during childhood, that brought you joy or flow or something you have a deep interest in. Are there any local organizations or events dedicated to that practice?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hotz acknowledges that some communities will have more to offer than others, but she typically relies on Google, library and park websites, and word of mouth to find social clubs. The process of finding a group you enjoy and connect with is time intensive. And given the plethora of demands in this modern world — work at all hours, intensive parenting, other forms of caregiving — it can be a challenge to even find a second to mine your desires in the first place.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Virtual groups can also be sources of meaning. During the pandemic, Fountain House members performed their work assignments exclusively online. Even now, Chi says she begins her day at Fountain House over Zoom before heading into the clubhouse. Online communities have been essential for <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34706814/">young LGBTQ people</a> and <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2010-23600-008">those with physical disabilities</a> to find affirming support.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Central to these caring, meaningful communities is a sense of belonging — that members are <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9955914/">seen as essential</a> to the group’s functioning. Vulnerability is the vehicle, according to Maitland, the psychology professor, to open up to others, even if it’s potentially uncomfortable.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Quality relationships can blossom because of, and in spite of, this digitally-connected world. It’s a comfort then that despite all the forces shaping collective values and priorities, having a purpose and being seen for who you are is what fosters community. Maybe the impulse isn’t toward nostalgic forms of connection, but for timeless ways of relating.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President-elect Donald Trump has long sought to end deportation protections for immigrants with Temporary Protected Status (TPS), a program that has significantly expanded under the Biden administration to cover over 860,000 people. He has shown no sign of relenting in a second term — and may try to either revoke those protections or let them expire soon after being sworn in.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">TPS allows people to temporarily live and work in the US and is currently granted to citizens of at least 16 countries suffering from natural disasters, armed conflict, or other extraordinary circumstances. The secretary of homeland security can grant TPS to each country for a renewable period of up to 18 months. Some countries’ TPS status is set to expire soon, including El Salvador’s, which expires <a href="https://immigrationforum.org/article/fact-sheet-temporary-protected-status/">in March</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Directing his homeland security secretary not to renew TPS for these countries could allow Trump to start reducing the population of TPS holders. Ending TPS, which has provided a lifeline for hundreds of thousands of immigrants for decades, would reshape families and communities across the US. It would also harm local economies and industries that rely on TPS recipients’ labor.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In an <a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-springfield-haitian-migrants-removed/">interview with News Nation</a> in October, Trump said he would end TPS protections for Haitians after <a href="https://www.vox.com/podcasts/372206/springfield-ohio-pets-haitian-immigrants-conspiracy">lying about immigrants eating pets</a> in Springfield, Ohio: “Absolutely I’d revoke it,” he said, adding that he would send them back to their home country, despite its <a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2024/country-chapters/haiti">deepening political and humanitarian crises</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tom Homan, who Trump tapped as his “border czar,” was also an editor of <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce">Project 2025</a>, a <a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf" rel="nofollow">900-page opus</a> of conservative policy recommendations published by the Heritage Foundation, a right-wing think tank. The document explicitly calls on Congress to repeal TPS and other temporary status programs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump previously sought to end TPS during his first term. The lawsuits that delayed his plans have yet to be fully resolved. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden has more than doubled the number of immigrants covered by TPS. Immigrant advocates are hoping that Biden will use his final months in office to extend those TPS protections that will soon expire. But if Trump tries to end TPS, advocates are gearing up for what could be another legal fight, perhaps more difficult than the last.</p>

<iframe frameborder="0" height="200" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP8713373625" width="100%"></iframe>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The potential impact of ending TPS</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The current population of TPS holders is diverse — it includes people from Venezuela, Honduras, El Salvador, Ukraine, and more. Some TPS holders have been living in the US for decades, meaning that forcing them to return home would likely result in family separations and impact the communities where they have laid roots, as well as the US industries that employ them. Despite the length of time many TPS recipients have been in the US, they have no means to convert their legal status to a green card.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Many of us have been here for decades in the United States. We have built a family, many of us with kids born in the United States,” said José Palma, a TPS holder from El Salvador and coordinator at the National TPS Alliance, an advocacy group for TPS holders. “This is their country.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Haitians were first granted TPS after a devastating 2010 earthquake from which the country never recovered, setting off a cascade of events that culminated in the collapse of its government. For Hondurans, the grant came in 1999 after Hurricane Mitch wreaked widespread destruction. For Salvadorans, it was granted in 1990 amid a civil war in their home country that lasted 12 years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cecilia Menjívar, a sociology professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, has studied these populations of Honduran and Salvadoran TPS holders. In a <a href="https://latino.ucla.edu/research/temporary-protected-status/">2020 report</a>, she found that they were deeply integrated in their communities and employed at high rates.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of the more than 2,000 people she surveyed, she found that all had lived in the US for at least 20 years, about two-thirds had a US-born child, 88 percent of them were in the labor force, and about one-third owned their homes. They had a large presence in hospitality, construction, personal services, and transportation. In addition, she said they are “very civically active,” participating in church groups, neighborhood initiatives, school organizations, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This is not a population that can be uprooted so easily,” Menjívar said. “It will be quite impactful for the rest of the community to pluck them up and send them home.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other TPS holders, however, have arrived more recently. Lebanese were only granted TPS in October amid the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. The biggest population of recent arrivals are Venezuelans fleeing the Maduro regime, numbering <a href="https://immigrationforum.org/article/fact-sheet-temporary-protected-status/">more than 340,000 since they were granted TPS in 2021.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Menjívar said she expected them to have similarly high levels of labor force participation. They have not had as much time to put down roots here, but that doesn’t mean it will necessarily be easier to return them to their home countries. Venezuela, for instance, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/11/12/trump-mass-deportation-venezuela-nicolas-maduro">does not currently accept deportees from the US</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What is true for most TPS holders is that ending protections wouldn’t just affect them. It would also affect their communities and even their family members who never left their home countries and rely on their remittances.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The majority of recipients send money to our countries to support our families,” Palma said.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Can Trump’s plans to end TPS be stopped?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has the power to end TPS protections, but it would be unusual to do so well before they are set to expire.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The way that TPS decisions typically work and the way that the statute is designed is that new decisions with regard to TPS are supposed to be made in the period immediately before the end of the period of designation for TPS holders,” said Emi MacLean, senior staff attorney at the ACLU of Northern California.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That means that Palma and other immigrant advocates may be able to buy some time for TPS recipients whose status is set to expire soon if they can convince the Biden administration to renew their status for another 18 months. But even if they are successful, Trump may still try to revoke their protections prematurely.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I can&#8217;t say definitively that [the Trump administration is] not going to try to do something that is atypical,” MacLean said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The clearest path (and the one Trump followed in his first term) is to just not renew TPS protections when they expire. However, if Trump does decide to end TPS protections early, his decision will likely face legal challenges.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During Trump’s first term, he tried to terminate TPS protections for about 400,000 citizens of El Salvador, Honduras, and Haiti, among nationals of other countries. He argued that conditions in those countries had improved enough that their citizens could safely return. <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/11/7/20950689/trump-tps-temporary-protected-status-el-salvador-haiti-honduras-state-department-report-senate">Senior State Department officials disagreed</a>, arguing that ending TPS would destabilize the three countries and that any wind-down period should span several years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2018, immigrant advocates sued the Trump administration, alleging that the president’s decision to end TPS was motivated by racism and that it unlawfully forced the US-citizen children of TPS holders to either separate from their families or live in a foreign country. They also asserted that Trump didn’t follow the correct agency procedures in his efforts to end the benefit, which involve evaluating the current conditions in the countries covered by TPS.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A federal court temporarily blocked Trump from following through while legal battles played out, and cases continued well after Biden took office. In June 2023, Biden finally rescinded Trump’s terminations of TPS and extended it for the affected countries. The lawsuits were dismissed as a result, but immigrant advocates are preparing to go back to court if Trump tries to end TPS again.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">MacLean suggested that some of the same legal arguments may apply this time around. She pointed to Trump’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/371855/trump-vance-springfield-ohio-racist-conspiracy-theories-haitian-immigrants">racist comments about Haitians</a> on the campaign trail as evidence that any termination of their TPS status may be similarly racially motivated.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the exact contours of their legal arguments may depend on what happens in the coming months and who is affected, MacLean said it is clear that “any sort of broad-based effort to terminate TPS would almost certainly face really serious legal hurdles.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The one other way Trump could try to end TPS would be to request congressional help: Congress could also repeal TPS entirely, as Project 2025 proposes. Given congressional gridlock on the issue of immigration and the narrow Republican margin in the House and Senate, however, that path seems unlikely.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What ails the Democratic Party? Since Kamala Harris’s defeat, several Democrats and center-left commentators have pointed the finger at one culprit: “the groups.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Specifically, they claim, progressive interest and activist groups have both moved too far left and grown far too influential in the Democratic coalition, pushing the party to adopt stances out of step with the median voter on a range of different issues. This, they say, has backfired electorally and will ultimately hurt the people the groups claim to want to help.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Many of today’s lawmakers and leaders have come up at a time when alienating the groups is seen as anathema, but they should start seeing it as both right and necessary,” former Democratic staffer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/16/opinion/democrats-interest-groups-majority.html">Adam Jentleson wrote</a> in the New York Times in November.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other commentators — <a href="https://x.com/jonfavs/status/1860500811328917624">Jon Favreau</a>, <a href="https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/1860703589125034333">Matthew Yglesias</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/opinion/obama-ezra-klein-podcast-michael-lind.html">Ezra Klein</a>, and <a href="https://www.liberalpatriot.com/p/the-democrats-progressive-organization">Ruy Teixeira</a> — have made similar points. Some, like <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/how-we-got-here-ce8">Yglesias</a> and <a href="https://www.liberalpatriot.com/p/the-democrats-progressive-organization">Teixeira</a>, have been criticizing the influence of such groups for years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet this critique has been met with an impassioned backlash from progressives and leftists. Some, like <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/corporate-democrats-not-woke-activists-doomed-kamala-harris/">Waleed Shahid</a>, argue the blame is misplaced and the supposed power of these progressive groups has been exaggerated. “The Democratic Party has long been shaped by far more powerful forces — corporate interests, lobbyists, and consultants — whose influence has neglected the real crises facing everyday Americans,” Shahid wrote for The Nation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Others argue that inflation — a global phenomenon — was the main reason for Harris&#8217;s defeat, so a groups-focused diagnosis misses the point. And yet others argue that progressive groups represent morally righteous causes that Democrats should not abandon — for instance, that moderation <a href="https://x.com/adamjohnsonCHI/status/1854873773167513714">would</a> <a href="https://x.com/treeaston/status/1858527304017760711">amount</a> to throwing marginalized groups “under the bus.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This debate is now in full swing. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I’m quite comfortable — morally and politically — with the position that Dem presidential candidates shouldn’t let voters believe they want to defund the police, abolish ICE, decriminalize border crossings, or provide transition surgeries for undocumented immigrants in prison,” Favreau <a href="https://x.com/jonfavs/status/1860500811328917624">recently posted on X</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In some ways, it’s a continuation of the debate over social justice politics and “<a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/3/22/18259865/great-awokening-white-liberals-race-polling-trump-2020">wokeness</a>” that has been raging for years. But it extends well beyond that — on <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/climate-is-the-problem">climate change</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/377170/kamala-harris-economic-policy-new-progressive-economics">economic policy</a>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/06/the-orthodoxy-that-doomed-democrats-border-policies/678644/">immigration</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/22876643/democrats-voting-rights-senate-filibuster-manchin">voting reforms</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/abortion/386228/abortion-ivf-roe-republicans-congress-bipartisan-ban-birth-control">reproductive rights</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/375488/child-care-paid-leave-build-back-better-harris-ctc-preschool-biden-families">child care</a>, and many others, the influence of such nonprofit groups on Democrats’ strategic decisionmaking has been immense in recent years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet there’s more to the story than just the groups. The bigger picture is that Democrats are reckoning with the apparent <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/378644/progressives-left-backlash-retreat-kamala-harris-pivot-center">end of a years-long trend</a> in which liberal college graduates’ opinions kept moving further left, a trend that influenced all actors in the party.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The debate now is over whether and how Democrats should respond to electoral defeat — by moving to the center and trying to moderate their positions, sticking to their guns, or moving even further left.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But what happened, exactly, and how? And what are the implications for Democrats, as they search for a path back to electoral victory?</p>

<iframe frameborder="0" height="200" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP5907029487" width="100%"></iframe>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are “the groups”?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When critics talk about “the groups,” they’re talking about a vast and complex tapestry of progressive nonprofit organizations focusing on a variety of issues. Some, like the <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/9/10/20847401/sunrise-movement-climate-change-activist-millennials-global-warming">Sunrise Movement</a>, are relatively young. But others — the ACLU, Planned Parenthood, the Human Rights Campaign — have been around for decades.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Critiques of “the groups” are typically about progressive groups specifically, even though there have long been centrist and non-ideological interest groups that also influence the Democratic Party. Because, the critics assert, it’s the progressive groups that grew far <em>more</em> influential within the Democratic Party in recent years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Back at the start of Barack Obama’s presidency, for instance, Democrats in both the White House and Congress had a sometimes-testy relationship with the activists his press secretary Robert Gibbs disparaged as being part of the “<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/168588-white-house-unloads-anger-over-criticism-from-professional-left/">professional left</a>.” On policy and political matters, Democrats took into account progressive groups’ demands, but they were typically guided by caution about what might be “too far” for the public to accept or what might alienate powerful business interests. (The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/16/obama-health-plan-ama-support">Affordable</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna31485134">Care Act</a> and Democrats’ <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/10/11/as-the-world-burns">failed cap-and-trade bill</a> were both crafted in <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/biden-pass-climate-legislation-1140934/">close consultation with business interests</a>.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But with the rise of new protest movements and social media, and with establishment Democrats’ approach seemingly being discredited by Donald Trump’s 2016 win, progressive groups got more emboldened. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2016/11/30/its-unprecedented-in-our-history-after-trumps-election-millions-of-dollars-poured-into-nonprofits/">New money</a> from megadonors and flush foundations, as well as viral small donors, flowed into existing groups’ coffers and funded new ones. A new generation of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/06/us/aclu-free-speech.html">activist staffers</a> <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/06/13/progressive-organizing-infighting-callout-culture/">demanded bold action</a>. The lines between groups focused on different causes started to blur as a practice of allyship emerged, particularly on <a href="https://prochoicewashington.org/2020/06/25/in-solidarity-with-black-lives-defund-the-police/">social justice issues</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democratic politicians responded in part by moving left. This was most on display in the 2020 presidential primary, when leading contenders — <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/harris-defends-shifting-positions-on-fracking-and-decriminalizing-illegal-border-crossings">including Harris</a> — endorsed positions that would have seemed unthinkably radical to Democrats just a few years earlier, like banning fracking and decriminalizing unauthorized border crossing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One example that’s become emblematic of this trend is an <a href="https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2024/08/Harris-ACLU-Candidate-Questionnaire.pdf">ACLU questionnaire</a> to which Harris responded that she’d support “gender transition care” for federal inmates and immigration detainees, a position Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/us/politics/presidential-campaign-transgender-rights.html">blasted in attack ads</a> this year. (When Elizabeth Warren first ran for office in 2012 and was asked about this, she <a href="https://www.washingtonblade.com/2019/01/09/warrens-newfound-support-for-surgery-for-trans-inmates-could-impact-2020-race/">quipped</a> that she didn’t think it would be a good use of taxpayer money — but by 2019, she announced her full-throated support of such surgeries, in what advocates interpreted as an attempt to <a href="https://www.washingtonblade.com/2019/01/09/warrens-newfound-support-for-surgery-for-trans-inmates-could-impact-2020-race/">box in Harris</a>.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyond the 2020 primary, there was a broader trend of Democrats starting to view progressive advocacy groups as central to the party’s policymaking and strategic calculations. By the 2020s, Klein <a href="https://t.co/B3aK0DqRDp">observed</a>, a “culture of how you make policy” and “who you listen to had emerged” inside the Democratic Party. On one issue he covered, permitting reform for clean energy projects, Hill staffers “would explain to me that if you couldn’t get” environmental justice groups on board, “they couldn’t move forward with this at all.” Klein continued:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">And I would say, “Well, what is the power of these groups — like, what is their leverage on you?” And there was never an answer. It was just a coalitional decision that had been made in the culture of the way the Democratic Party now made policy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In my own reporting — on issues like <a href="https://www.vox.com/22876643/democrats-voting-rights-senate-filibuster-manchin">voting rights</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/377170/kamala-harris-economic-policy-new-progressive-economics">economic policy</a> — I have noticed a similar shift in how Democratic staffers now talk about “the groups” (a term such staffers <a href="https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/1860703589125034333">often use</a> in such vague fashion). On many issues, these nonprofits became arguably the key constituency the Democratic Party was focused on pleasing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition to inflation, polls showed that voters were particularly unhappy with the Biden administration’s record on unauthorized immigration — an issue where Democrats had moved significantly to the left in recent years after pressure from activists and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/the-disillusionment-of-a-young-biden-official">their own staffers</a>. Faced with public discontent amid surging border crossing numbers, Biden eventually advanced sharply <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/353835/asylum-border-biden-policy-trump-shutdown">restrictionist policies</a> through executive action — but not until 2024, when it was too late to <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_061224/">change voter perceptions</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, viewed from the perspective of progressive activists, this is nonsense: They think Democrats tell them no all the time. On certain issues — most notably the Biden administration’s support for Israel’s war in Gaza — they’re correct. Most Democrats never went so far as to back “defunding the police.” And the further left the group, the less likely it is that Democrats fully embraced their agenda.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet relative to the early Obama era baseline, the party has indeed <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/378644/progressives-left-backlash-retreat-kamala-harris-pivot-center">shifted left</a> on a whole range of economic and cultural issues. This was indeed partly due to the hard work and tireless advocacy of the groups — but not entirely.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Democratic Party’s transformation wasn’t just about the groups</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The broader reason why Democrats’ leftward shift happened remains somewhat mysterious.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yglesias <a href="https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/1855044436004143113">has argued</a> that the rise of the groups is mostly a story of “astroturf” — that big donors and foundations funded phony “grassroots” movement organizations that convinced both Democratic politicians and the media to take them seriously, even though they spoke for no one but their donors. But that doesn’t explain the leftward shift in long-established groups <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/06/us/aclu-free-speech.html">like the ACLU</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Klein discussed several possibilities for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/opinion/obama-ezra-klein-podcast-michael-lind.html">why Democrats adopted a culture</a> of deference to the groups, including a mistaken belief that those groups could deliver them votes (for instance, the argument that Latino voters generally wanted the lenient policies toward unauthorized immigrants demanded by advocacy groups), a revolving door between progressive nonprofits and Democratic staff jobs, and the rise of social media (which made the perceived backlash when politicians defied the groups more intense).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of these may be part of the story, but I do think there’s a risk of overstating the groups’ actual power and centrality to events.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Benjy Sarlin <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/11/15/2024/the-groups-are-too-easy-a-scapegoat-for-democrats">wrote at Semafor,</a> in Democrats’ 2020 primary, it was often specific candidates who chose to box out their opponents by running to the left, and they were doing so because they believed it would be politically beneficial to them. Sarlin also reminds us that “Abolish ICE” briefly caught on not because of any “group” — the slogan was coined by an up-and-coming Democratic consultant who was chasing influence and social media clout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the election, Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA) and commentator <a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1859775933575520741?s=46">Aaron Rupar</a> have both opined that Democrats had gotten on the wrong side of public opinion on the issues of trans athletes or bathrooms. Both have gotten impassioned pushback; a top aide to Moulton <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4981767-moulton-aide-resigns-transgender-athletes/amp/">resigned</a>, Rupar faced social media criticism and <a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1859775933575520741?s=46">apologized</a>. But this pushback wasn’t because of the groups. It was because of genuinely held beliefs in progressive circles that trans women are women, that that’s an issue of fundamental rights, and that any concession to public opinion on this matter is poor allyship and throwing a marginalized group under the bus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The groups themselves were also responsive to social media pressure. One low-stakes but illustrative example: In 2017, the ACLU tweeted a picture of a (white) toddler with an American flag, captioned, “This is the future that ACLU members want.” Outraged respondents from progressive Twitter <a href="https://time.com/4915799/aclu-baby-viral-meme/">deemed that</a> a white supremacist image. The ACLU then praised the critics for reminding them “that white supremacy is everywhere.” Such incidents were quite common at that time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The larger dynamic is: In the second Obama term and the first Trump term, the groups moved left, but they were responding to donors who had <a href="https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2020-10-7-the-uneasy-alliance-between-progressives-and-billionaire-donors">shifted left</a>. Those donors were trying to channel the energy and passion of activists who had shifted left. Those activists got favorable coverage from media outlets that had shifted left. Those media outlets were chasing traffic and ratings from an audience that seemed to have shifted left (while being sensitive to social media criticism from that audience). And Democratic politicians were gauging all this and shifting left.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So in my view, the best overarching explanation is simply that opinion among liberal college grads (who overwhelmingly populate the institutions listed above) shifted left in the 2010s. Every actor was chasing incentives that resulted from this leftward shift, whether it be money, clicks, or social approval. The groups are merely a part of this larger story — they may have helped exacerbate the leftward shift, but they also reflected it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, that poses the larger question of why that leftward shift happened. There are various potential causes, including post-Great Recession disappointment, disillusionment with the Democratic establishment reflected in Bernie Sanders’s rise and deepening after Trump’s victory, social media exposing liberals to new ideas like the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/3/22/18259865/great-awokening-white-liberals-race-polling-trump-2020">Great Awokening</a> and making activists more influential, and the rise of “movement”-style thinking. There was a widespread belief that the old consensus had failed and bold new progressive ideas were necessary. And, while Trump was in power, there seemed to be no negative consequences to moving left — internal Democratic tensions and misgivings were subordinated to the task of stopping Trump.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What comes next?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What does seem clear is that, for the time being at least, the leftward shift <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/378644/progressives-left-backlash-retreat-kamala-harris-pivot-center">has stopped</a> since Biden took office. A backlash to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/upshot/democrats-trump-working-class.html">progressive activists’ preferred policies</a> on several issues, including <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/383079/california-prop-36-tough-on-crime-colorado-prop-128">criminal justice</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/351535/3-theories-for-americas-anti-immigrant-shift">immigration</a>, is in full swing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And, of course, Harris lost. How much blame, if any, “the groups” should get for that has become a matter of intense debate. Progressive group defenders point out that Harris tried to pivot to the center and that the Biden administration’s record on inflation and immigration were her two biggest vulnerabilities. The groups’ critics say Harris’s group-influenced positions from the 2020 primary weighed her down, and Democrats ran into political trouble on inflation and immigration in part because of the groups’ bad advice.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How the Democratic world — its groups, donors, activists, media outlets, staffers, and politicians — responds to all this is yet to be seen.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are past models. In the 1980s, after the landslide defeats of three successive Democratic presidential nominees, various reform factions <a href="https://www.progressivepolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Politics_of_Evasion.pdf">tried to moderate</a> the party, arguing that they’d gotten out of touch with the median voter and were too beholden to “special interests.” Some called for moderation on cultural issues, others for new pro-growth and pro-business policies. Bill Clinton became affiliated with these reformers, and won the presidency in 1992.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In contrast, the model of Democrats between 2004 (when John Kerry lost) to 2008 (when Obama won big) may suggest a sweeping overhaul of the party’s positions isn’t necessary. After all, Harris came pretty close to winning. Perhaps Trump will govern poorly and Democrats will return to power having changed little, avoiding a wrenching internal coalitional conflict. And perhaps the apparent end of the leftward opinion shift among liberal college graduates will be enough to effectively weaken the power of the groups.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another model, oddly enough, is Trump. Before his rise, the Republican Party was tethered to an unpopular “free market” economic agenda involving Medicare cuts and free trade pushed by donor-financed advocacy groups. In 2016, Trump distanced himself from that agenda, and in doing so revealed those groups had little actual power. However, Trump also hugged other groups in the GOP coalition even tighter — promising, for instance, to pick his Supreme Court appointees from a Federalist Society list. Then, in 2024, it was the anti-abortion groups that looked to be a political millstone for Trump — so he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/01/politics/trump-federal-abortion-ban/index.html">distanced himself</a> from them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Democrats now, there are some nascent attempts to challenge the group-dominated status quo. Yglesias recently pitched a new agenda for “<a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/a-common-sense-democrat-manifesto">Common Sense Democrats</a>” that involves moderating on several issues. Klein has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-jennifer-pahlka-steven-teles.html">more focused</a> on how to make Democratic governance work better, and <a href="https://x.com/ezraklein/status/1860401118871711990">says his critique</a> is more about the party’s “broader culture of coalitional cowardice” rather than “an anti-left-wing view.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet others are skeptical of how much Democrats will — and should – change. “Democrats declaring independence from liberal and progressive interest groups can’t and likely won’t happen,” the commentator Michael A. Cohen (not Trump’s former lawyer) <a href="https://truthandcons.substack.com/p/looking-for-loss-in-all-the-wrong">wrote on Substack</a>. “For better or worse, these groups <em>are</em> the modern Democratic Party. If Democrats hope to retake political power in Washington, they must ensure that these groups are enthusiastic, mobilized, and remain firmly ensconced in the Democrats’ corner.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, the politics of the war in Gaza may be a cautionary tale in this regard. Biden and Harris ignored progressive groups by remaining supportive of Israel — but as a result, Harris faced regular criticism from activists and negative coverage throughout the campaign. The groups might not be so effective at winning Democrats votes — but they still might be able to drive some away.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">VALLE DEL CAUCA, Colombia — The chambers look a bit like walk-in refrigerators. Housed inside a research building in southwestern Colombia, they are essentially big metal boxes with large, latched doors. Inside them are concrete floors, plexiglass windows, and air conditioners mounted on the wall.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These chambers serve a noble and highly scientific purpose: measuring burps and farts. Specifically, the ones produced by animals.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a few months, scientists at an agriculture research organization called Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT — which built eight of these chambers — will place live sheep inside each one. Then they’ll wait for the animals to pass gas. Over the course of 24 hours, that gas will run through high-tech machines that measure its contents.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/9-Juan-Pablo.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A sheep inside one of the hermetically sealed chambers that measures methane gas. | Juan Pablo/Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT" data-portal-copyright="Juan Pablo/Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">What exactly are they looking for? Among other things: methane.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These chambers are part of a multiyear project to lower the amount of methane produced by farm animals. This is important. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, responsible for <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/methane/?intent=121">roughly 20 to 30 percent</a> of global warming since the Industrial Revolution. The <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/methane-tracker-2021/methane-and-climate-change">bulk</a> of global methane emissions stem from human activities, and the <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/methane-tracker-2021/methane-and-climate-change">largest single source</a> among them is agriculture —&nbsp;namely, the burps of ruminant animals such as cattle, goats, and sheep, as well as their manure.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/IMG_8651-rotated.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,30.366492146597,100,39.267015706806" alt="Interior showing several large stainless steel chambers with aisles between." title="Interior showing several large stainless steel chambers with aisles between." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A view of several chambers from the outside at Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT, an agriculture research center outside of Palmira, Colombia. | Benji Jones/Vox" data-portal-copyright="Benji Jones/Vox" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The amount of methane an animal produces is tied to what it eats. And that’s the key premise of the new CIAT project. Starting in February, researchers led by Jacobo Arango will feed sheep —&nbsp;which have very similar digestive systems to cattle —&nbsp;different kinds of plants, such as legumes and grasses. Then they’ll put the animals inside the chambers with more food to measure how much methane the animals produce. The idea is to identify specific types of forage that result in fewer greenhouse gases, with an ultimate goal of lowering global methane emissions and, thus, fighting climate change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Testing 6,000 plants</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The researchers are aiming to test around 6,000 varieties of forage, many of which are stored as seeds in a gene bank not far from the chambers, at a CIAT research center near Palmira, Colombia. The bank, known as <a href="https://alliancebioversityciat.org/future-seeds">Future Seeds</a>, houses roughly 67,000 samples, including the world’s largest collection of seeds for tropical forage plants.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It was stifling outside when I visited the bank one afternoon in October, yet I had to wear a winter jacket to go inside. The seeds are kept in a room at -9.4 degrees Fahrenheit and stored in vacuum-sealed packets made of laminated aluminum foil. Inside the room were rows and rows of seed packets sitting on mobile shelves like those in a college library.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/IMG_8731_968d13.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.621783349163,100,78.756433301674" alt="Silver foil packets on wire shelves with numerical labels." title="Silver foil packets on wire shelves with numerical labels." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Shelves full of seed packets at Future Seeds, a gene bank at Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT. | Benji Jones/Vox" data-portal-copyright="Benji Jones/Vox" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">For the methane project, scientists are using seeds from the bank and growing them into forage. From there, the experiment has two main phases. The first is testing the plant material in a lab, with no animals. Researchers essentially replicate the stomach of a ruminant, like a cow, in a test tube, put some forage inside, and see how much gas it produces. Only the plant varieties that produce little methane — and meet other requirements related to things like nutrition and drought tolerance —&nbsp;will then be fed to sheep. They will be put into the chambers, at which point their burps and farts and feces will be measured.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The researchers may also eventually put cattle in the chambers as a final test, said Arango, a senior scientist at the Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"><img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/3-Anny-Yedra.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Saplings of a legume called Asian pigeonwings. | Anny Yedra/Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT" data-portal-copyright="Anny Yedra/Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT" />

<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/5-Anny-Yedra.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A forage legume. | Anny Yedra/Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT" data-portal-copyright="Anny Yedra/Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT" /></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lab testing is now underway, and several forage varieties already show promise, Arango said. Most of those are legumes, such as <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-024-01046-y">Leucaena diversifolia</a>,&nbsp;a plant species with feather-like leaves and flowers that look like spiky balls.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are many reasons why certain plants might produce less methane. Some legumes, for example, are high in compounds called condensed tannins. Tannins, which are also found in things like wine, giving reds their astringent taste, can suppress microbes that produce methane in the guts of a cow.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Burp detectors against climate change</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Without addressing emissions from the food sector, it’s impossible to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, beyond which climate change will be catastrophic. Lowering meat (and especially beef) consumption is probably the most important part of that effort, but it’s an uphill battle as meat consumption is <a href="https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/09e88a46-b005-4d65-8753-9714506afc38/content#:~:text=Growth%20in%20global%20consumption%20of,by%20income%20and%20population%20growth.">projected to rise</a> globally over the next few years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That makes identifying better forage a promising tool in at least moderating the climate impact of all that carnivory, said <a href="https://www.wri.org/profile/richard-waite">Richard Waite</a>, director of agriculture initiatives at the World Resources Institute, a research group. A <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9171756/">review published in 2022</a> found that various changes to the diets of farm animals, such as giving them tannin-rich foods, can cut the methane they produce every day by an average of more than 20 percent, without reducing how much milk or meat they yield.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">High-tech approaches to reduce methane from farm animals, from methane-lowering feed <a href="https://drawdown.org/insights/are-livestock-feed-additives-the-future-or-folly">supplements</a> to <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/05/10/arkeabio-cow-emissions-bill-gates">vaccines</a>, are already under development. It’s not yet clear, however, whether enough farmers, many of whom are in developing nations, will want to adopt these approaches or be able to pay for them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The advantage of the new CIAT project is that it’s simple and useful for farmers in poorer parts of the world, where beef consumption is growing quickly. The idea, Arango said, is to identify a range of forages that will all help lower methane emissions if farmers plant them in their cattle pastures. It’s also a way to add plant diversity to the pasture landscape, which comes with other benefits, such as more habitat for wildlife.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, while measuring how much gas a sheep passes may sound like a joke, this is serious science, said Waite, of the World Resources Institute. “It’s funny because it’s burps and farts&nbsp;— mostly burps —&nbsp;but it’s really important,” Waite said. “It’s a big chunk of emissions. So anything we can do to reduce those emissions while feeding more people is going to be really helpful.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Presidents have a lot of Constitutional powers: the power to wage war; the power to veto laws; the power to pardon criminals; the power to appoint Supreme Court members and other judges. But President-elect Donald Trump and his inner circle are hoping to add a new power to the repertoire, one which would constitute one of the largest expansions of presidential power in modern history: impoundment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Their theory is that the president has a constitutional authority to withhold, or “impound,” spending from projects after that spending has already been authorized by Congress. Advocates <a href="https://americarenewing.com/the-history-of-impoundments-before-the-impoundment-control-act-of-1974/">cite examples</a> of past presidents impounding various programs until Congress shut down the practice with 1974’s <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/095406">Impoundment Control Act</a>, which Trump allies view as an unconstitutional law and a congressional power grab.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump himself attempted to use impoundment and related powers several times during his first term, most famously to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/9/30/20883584/trump-impeachment-whistleblower-ukraine">delay paying aid to Ukraine</a> in an attempt to force a prosecution of Joe Biden’s family in that country; this act directly led to Trump’s first impeachment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s second term, though, could see a much more extensive use of the power. His nominee to run the Office on Management and Budget, Russ Vought, was on the frontlines <a href="https://rollcall.com/2021/01/19/trump-budget-office-slams-1974-impoundment-law-on-way-out/">fighting for broad impoundment power in the first term</a>, and has sought sweeping cuts to programs like <a href="https://ccf.georgetown.edu/2023/02/27/center-for-renewing-america-budget-plan-would-cut-federal-medicaid-spending-by-one-third-repeal-affordable-care-acts-coverage-expansions/">Medicaid</a> and <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/house-republicans-proposals-could-take-food-away-from-millions-of-low">food stamps</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If, as is likely, Congress <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/383186/trump-vance-medicaid-food-stamps-obamacare-poverty">resists these cuts</a>, Trump and Vought, as well as their flashy spending-cut consultants <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/384904/trumps-department-of-government-efficiency-sounds-like-a-joke-it-isnt">Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy</a>, could attempt to use impoundment power anyway, sending the fight into courts. There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_v._City_of_New_York">multiple</a> Supreme Court <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_v._City_of_New_York">decisions</a> suggesting such an attempt would be illegal and unconstitutional — but today we have a court where Trump himself appointed a third of the members, and which <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship">recently granted</a> him sweeping immunity from prosecution.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the Court sides with Trump in such a fight, it could set the precedent that presidents can effectively cut spending without Congress, which could have vast, far-reaching implications for everything from health care to defense to science.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here is what impoundment power is, how it has historically worked, how Trump’s team wants it to work, and why Trump’s view of the power could set the stage for a massive executive power grab, altering fundamentally the relationship between Congress and the president.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Impoundment, explained</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The official definition of “impoundment,” per the <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-05-734sp.pdf#page=65">Government Accountability Office</a> (GAO) that oversees the practice, is “any action or inaction by an officer or employee of the federal government that precludes obligation or expenditure of budget authority.” In other words: any time someone in the federal government doesn’t spend money that Congress has ordered it to spend.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This takes two forms: <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-05-734sp.pdf#page=89">rescission</a>, and <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-05-734sp.pdf#page=47">deferral</a>. In rescission, the spending is simply canceled, while in deferral it is withheld temporarily, in theory to be spent in the future. Under the Impoundment Control Act, passed in 1974, both rescissions and deferrals can be passed by Congress at any time, and they can also be requested by the president. But any presidential requests have to be approved by Congress to take effect, and that has happened quite rarely.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From fiscal year 1974, when these provisions took effect, and 2018, the last year when a president invoked this provision, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/pbaf.12372#page=5">presidents have proposed $92 billion in rescissions</a>, of which only $25 billion were approved by Congress. To put that in context, combined federal spending from 1974 to 2018 was <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/data/budget-economic-data#2">about $83.6 trillion</a>, and approved presidentially suggested rescissions amount to 0.07 percent of that. No Impoundment Control Act rescission has been approved since 2000, and George W. Bush and Barack Obama did not so much as propose any. The act is just not a very important part of the budget process, typically.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The GAO has also recognized a practice called “programmatic delay,” which it views as not technically impoundment but which is closely related. Programmatic delays occur when the government is trying to spend money Congress has instructed it to spend, but factors outside their control preclude this. The GAO has <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/ogc-94-17.pdf#page=4">offered as an example</a> a program in which the government is supposed to provide a certain amount of money in loans, but where there are few applicants so the program simply cannot lend out the total amount Congress has set aside for this purpose.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another more recent example was Biden’s executive order upon taking office instructing a pause in the construction of border walls and fences with Mexico. While Congress had appropriated money specifically for border barriers, <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/b-333110-0">the GAO ruled that the Biden administration was merely “programmatically delaying” the project</a>, because the delays were chalked up to environmental reviews and other hurdles that it was legally required to clear before continuing construction.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Programmatic delay does offer the executive branch some flexibility in spending, but only a bit. Otherwise, the Impoundment Control Act is very clear: The president cannot refuse to spend money that Congress has told him to spend. The GAO is empowered to challenge the president if it sees this limitation being contradicted, <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/b-331564">as it did when Trump withheld funds</a> from Ukraine in 2019. In that case, the funds were eventually <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2019/09/12/white-house-releases-250-million-in-ukraine-military-aid/">released</a> and the incident led to Trump’s impeachment.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The history of impoundment and impoundment control</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you read enough about impoundment, you&#8217;re going to hear about the gunboats.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 1803, Congress had appropriated $50,000 (about <a href="https://www.officialdata.org/us/inflation/1803?amount=50000">$1.4 million</a> in today’s dollars) for some gunboats on the Mississippi River, <a href="https://www.americanheritage.com/impoundment">provoked by France&#8217;s refusal to offer the US access to the Port of New Orleans</a> at the end of 1802. President Thomas Jefferson declined to purchase the gunboats, however, because he had enlisted Secretary of State James Madison to negotiate with Napoleon in secret with another goal in mind: simply buying all of France’s North American territories. In July 1803, the Louisiana Purchase was announced, rendering the gunboats unnecessary. All in all, it was a much better deal.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In October, <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/third-annual-message">Jefferson explained the decision</a> in his State of the Union message to Congress, telling representatives that, “The favorable and peaceable turn of affairs on the Mississippi rendered an immediate execution of that law unnecessary.” The historian <a href="https://www.americanheritage.com/impoundment">Allan Damon notes</a> that this was technically a deferral, not an impoundment, because Jefferson wound up buying the gunboats in 1804, as part of his more general efforts to build out the embryonic Navy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To advocates of impoundment — most notably Mark Paoletta, who served as general counsel for the Office on Management and Budget in Trump&#8217;s first term and has written extensively in defense of a broad impoundment power — this kind of history proves that impoundment is as American as apple pie. In a <a href="https://americarenewing.com/the-history-of-impoundments-before-the-impoundment-control-act-of-1974/">detailed report</a> with co-authors Daniel Shapiro and Brandon Stras, Paoletta observes, “The Jeffersonians recognized that Congress’s power of the purse was a power to set a ceiling on appropriations. The power of the purse did nothing to encroach the Executive’s inherent discretion to spend less than the amount appropriated.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Critics with a more mainstream view of the issue think this wildly misunderstands the history. <a href="https://www.yalejreg.com/nc/the-president-has-no-constitutional-power-of-impoundment-by-zachary-s-price/">Zachary Price, a professor at UC Law San Francisco</a>, notes that the underlying statute appropriating the $50,000 for the gunboats &#8220;authorized expenditure without requiring it.&#8221; The text of the law &#8220;authorized and empowered&#8221; Jefferson to order the construction of &#8220;a number not exceeding fifteen gun boats&#8221; with &#8220;a sum not exceeding fifty thousand dollars.&#8221; Through that wording, Congress was giving the president the discretion to spend as much as $50,000 on the boats, but also the discretion to decline.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More to the point, Congress and the president for most of the 19th and 20th centuries operated with a shared understanding that spending bills offered this kind of flexibility. &#8220;Both Congress and the executive branch …&nbsp;seem to have followed a default understanding that appropriations statutes conferred implicit authority to forego spending when it proved unnecessary or when statutory goals could be accomplished with a smaller expenditure,” Price writes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most historical impoundments, according to Georgetown law professor Eloise Pasachoff, were also for efficiency rather than policy reasons: if Congress, say, instructed the government to build a bridge for $100 million, and the bridge wound up only costing $90 million, the president might decline to spend $10 million because he could accomplish the same goal at a lower cost. “If you look at these examples that they’re bringing out, they mostly fall in the category of ‘Congress has appropriated money for something but it turns out we don’t need the full extent of that money,’” Pasachoff told Vox.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So you can certainly find examples from Jefferson to LBJ of presidents declining to spend money that had been authorized. Paoletta sees this as evidence that the president has a broad power to impound funds. Price and Pasachoff see it as evidence that Congress intended this flexibility: Impoundment was a power that Congress granted to the president in specific, limited contexts, but not an inherent power of the president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This governing order, of Congress allowing impoundments on the understanding that the president would use the power responsibly, broke down in the 1970s under the Nixon administration. Both the Senate and House were solidly Democratic for Richard Nixon’s entire presidency, and he sought to use impoundment as a means of influencing spending without needing their approval. His <a href="https://goodauthority.org/news/good-to-know-what-is-impoundment/">attempts were far more sweeping than previous presidents</a>, including gambits like an effort to outright eliminate the Office of Economic Opportunity, a key agency of LBJ&#8217;s war on poverty, and simply refusing to spend money on anti-water pollution efforts even after Congress had appropriated money for the effort over his veto. He declared that this was an <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-86">absolute Constitutional power of the presidency</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He was more or less alone in that. In 1969, Assistant Attorney General William Rehnquist (who two years later would be appointed to the Supreme Court and 15 years after that become chief justice) <a href="https://www.justice.gov/file/147706/dl?inline=">wrote a memo</a> concluding that there is no constitutional right to impoundment. This was a very conservative Nixon official, one who Nixon would himself promote to the highest court in the land a few years later, concluding that the constitutional argument was bunk.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 1975, after Nixon had already resigned in disgrace, the water pollution case made its way to the Supreme Court, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_v._City_of_New_York">ruled unanimously that Nixon&#8217;s Environmental Protection Agency had illegally withheld the funds</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 1974, Congress sought to clarify matters by passing the Impoundment Control Act as part of a legislative package that also set up the modern budget process and created the Congressional Budget Office. The law did not so much make impoundment illegal as it clarified that impoundment, when not explicitly authorized by Congress in spending laws, <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/faqs-on-impoundment-presidential-actions-are-constrained-by-long-standing">was always illegal</a>, and set up a process through which presidents could seek to roll back spending in an orderly way, but only with Congress’s participation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s not like the Impoundment Control Act took away the legal ability of the president to do that,” <a href="https://spp.umd.edu/our-community/faculty-staff/philip-joyce">Philip Joyce</a>, a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland and an expert on the budget process, told me. “The courts had already found there was no legal authority for the president to impound funds.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Can Trump actually do this?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump, in his first term, sought to bring back impoundment power to a degree not seen since Nixon. In 2018, he <a href="https://rollcall.com/2018/06/25/from-a-scream-to-a-whisper-rescissions-push-goes-dark/">sought $15.2 billion in rescissions</a>, the bulk coming from the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program, which supports state programs to insure children, usually through Medicaid.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The House first shaved half a billion off the cuts before narrowly passing them, then two Senate Republicans (Richard Burr and Susan Collins) voted against the package, enough to doom it given the Republicans’ narrow majority in the Senate. Despite that setback, his team kept repeatedly considering rescission packages, especially against <a href="https://www.devex.com/news/trump-administration-resurrects-rescission-proposal-in-latest-attack-on-us-aid-spending-95437">foreign aid</a>, only to back down under pressure from Congress.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The most infamous invocation of this power came in 2019, when the Office on Management and Budget sought unilaterally to delay aid to Ukraine, without asking Congress. The GAO eventually ruled that while <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/b-331564.1">the non-military aid delay was legal</a> (it was a &#8220;programmatic delay&#8221; necessitated by circumstances), withholding <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/b-331564">$214 million in military assistance</a> was not.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Later in 2019, the public learned that Trump had, in a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, stated, &#8220;I would like you to do us a favor&#8221; <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/25/20883420/full-transcript-trump-ukraine-zelensky-white-house">in exchange for the aid</a>, specifically investigating the Biden family for corruption as well as a conspiracy theory that a Ukrainian, not Russia, hacked Democrats in 2016. The revelation that the aid was withheld specifically in a move to leverage a foreign nation into attacking a political opponent led to <a href="https://www.vox.com/c/2020/2/6/20914280/impeachment-trump-explained">Trump’s first impeachment</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But while Trump’s rescissions became a background detail to a broader scandal, his team continued to insist upon the power. As Trump was leaving office, Office of Management and Budget director Russ Vought and his general counsel Mark Paoletta <a href="https://rollcall.com/2021/01/19/trump-budget-office-slams-1974-impoundment-law-on-way-out/">wrote a letter</a> to the House Budget Committee <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Response-to-House-Budget-Committee-Investigation.pdf">arguing</a> that the Impoundment Control Act &#8220;should be significantly reformed or repealed.&#8221; They <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/14/trump-billions-cut-covid-vaccine-distributor-459496">sent a final rescission package to Congress</a> in January 2021, despite knowing it was dead in the water, underlining their seriousness about the procedure. Vought and Paoletta have since gone further and now argue that the Impoundment Control Act and its limits on impoundment powers are not just unwise, but unconstitutional.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The least dramatic way that Trump could use impoundment is by submitting rescission packages to Congress and watching them be approved, by a simple majority vote of each house. Rescission packages cannot be filibustered, so in principle the narrow Republican majority in the House and Senate could simply rubber-stamp the measures.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The power becomes truly interesting, however, if Trump insists upon cuts that Congress will <em>not</em> approve. One could imagine a repeat of the 2017 fight to repeal Obamacare, except, when enough Republicans defect to doom the effort in Congress, Trump and Vought opt to simply impound funds for the Medicaid expansion and Affordable Care Act premium subsidies unilaterally. This would inevitably provoke a legal challenge that could make its way to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a fool’s errand to predict what the Court would say on the matter, but we know a few things. Court precedent is solidly against a presidential impoundment power. In 1838, the Court ruled in <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/37/524/"><em>Kendall v. United States ex Rel. Stokes</em></a> that the executive branch could not fail to pay a debt that Congress had instructed it to pay, writing, &#8220;that the obligation imposed on the President to see the laws faithfully executed, implies a power to forbid their execution, is a novel construction of the constitution, and entirely inadmissible.” <a href="https://americarenewing.com/the-history-of-impoundments-before-the-impoundment-control-act-of-1974/">Paoletta and co-authors</a> argue that because this was not technically an impoundment, it&#8217;s not a binding precedent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the 1975 Supreme Court case on the Nixon EPA dispute, <em>Train v. City of New York</em>, did directly speak to impoundments, and reached the same conclusion. <a href="https://americarenewing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-Presidents-Constitutional-Power-of-Impoundment-1.pdf">Paoletta counters</a> that the opinion in that case was written narrowly and based on the reading of the statute authorizing the EPA’s spending; it &#8220;does not address the President&#8217;s constitutional impoundment power.&#8221; That feels somewhat unconvincing though; as <a href="https://goodauthority.org/news/good-to-know-what-is-impoundment/">Bowdoin College political scientist Andrew Rudalevige has noted</a>, “presumably, if the president had inherent impoundment authority grounded in the Constitution, statutory language could not have set it aside.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All that said, the current court famously set aside a 49-year-old precedent when it <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/6/24/23181720/supreme-court-dobbs-jackson-womens-health-samuel-alito-roe-wade-abortion-marriage-contraception">overruled <em>Roe v. Wade</em></a>, and a 40-year-old precedent when it <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/357900/supreme-court-loper-bright-raimondo-chevron-power-grab">overruled <em>Chevron v. NRDC</em></a>. It could surely overturn <em>Train</em> and <em>Kendall</em> too, should it so desire; it could also assert a presidential impoundment power and massage its ruling such that it does not have to technically overrule those precedents, perhaps by parsing the decisions narrowly the way that Paoletta does.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the Court were to agree with the Paoletta argument, we’d be in a whole new world in terms of federal spending. Presidents would suddenly have a significant power to make spending cuts without congressional buy-in. Importantly, the power would be asymmetrical, tilted toward slashing programs versus building them. President Bernie Sanders could not use this power to set up a Medicare-for-All program, but a Republican president could use it to end Medicare outright.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such a world feels so fantastical from the standpoint of the last half-century of budget battles that to imagine it almost feels like playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons. But Trump has assembled a team dedicated to bringing us into such a world, and it may encroach upon our reality sooner than we expect.</p>

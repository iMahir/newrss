<p class="has-text-align-none">Columbia University president Minouche Shafik is stepping down after protests over the war in Gaza roiled the university community and spread to campuses nationwide, and in Europe, last spring.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This period has taken a considerable toll on my family, as it has for others in our community,” Shafik said in a letter announcing her resignation Wednesday. “Over the summer, I have been able to reflect and have decided that my moving on at this point would best enable Columbia to traverse the challenges ahead.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Shafik has faced pressure to resign for months. Both those who supported the spring protests and those who opposed them have criticized how Shafik handled the demonstrations, as did a number of right-wing politicians, who claimed the president failed to do enough to protect Jewish students. House Speaker Mike Johnson called her resignation “<a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/15/us-news/columbia-president-minouche-shafiks-resignation-reacted-by-mike-johnson-other-pols/">long overdue</a>” on Wednesday.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Not all of the spring protests — which largely involved students demanding that their schools <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/5/7/24150638/divest-israel-protesters-bds-columbia-meaning-fossil-fuel">divest</a> from companies linked to Israel amid its ongoing war in Gaza — reached the intensity of those at Columbia. Some schools <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-05-14/uc-berkeley-protestors-dismantle-pro-palestinian-encampment">managed to negotiate with protesters</a> to voluntarily dismantle their pro-Palestinian encampments without any police intervention. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At Columbia, however, Shafik swiftly <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottwhite/2024/05/16/columbia-president-goaded-into-calling-in-policegets-no-confidence-vote/">called the police</a> on protesters who had erected an encampment on the university’s main lawn in a display of force that sparked widespread outrage. That decision fueled protests with more escalatory tactics thereafter, and also resulted in a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/16/us/university-of-washington-protests-antisemitic-graffiti/index.html">faculty vote of no confidence</a> in her leadership. Things progressed to the point where some protesters eventually <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/columbias-hamilton-hall-takeover-photos-from-inside.html">took over a campus building</a> before they were forcibly removed by police and arrested. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, Shafik has become one of several Ivy League presidents who <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/1/17/claudine-gay-harvard-presidency-feature/">departed</a> their <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/10/business/liz-magill-upenn-resignation-timeline/index.html">roles</a> amid the campus furor. The question is not just where that leaves Columbia — now headed by interim president Katrina Armstrong, the CEO of the Columbia University Irving Medical Center — but all universities as students return to campus this fall. Demonstrations are expected to resume as the war in Gaza, in which <a href="https://apnews.com/article/gaza-war-hamas-dead-graves-40000-988d16b648e06e222f04964dc9440da0">more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed</a>, continues and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/15/new-round-of-gaza-ceasefire-talks-in-doha-where-do-hamas-israel-stand">yet another round of ceasefire talks has begun</a>. And it will be incumbent on administrators to find a way to avoid a repeat of the spring.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think tensions are going to be high, higher than I think they already were,” said <a href="https://www.thefire.org/about-us/our-team/nico-perrino">Nico Perrino</a>, executive vice president of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), a nonpartisan group that advocates for free speech. “Hopefully policies are in place and discussions are happening with students and faculty surrounding how to respond in case encampments go up or students are being threatened or denied access to different portions of campus.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Gaza protests could return in the fall. Universities should start preparing now.&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are two key lessons other university administrators might take away from Shafik’s missteps ahead of what is expected to be a contentious semester:</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Universities should communicate openly and clearly with protesters</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the spring, protests escalated to the point that normal university operations couldn’t continue.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Columbia held <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/22/business/columbia-tensions-passover-virtual-classes/index.html">virtual classes</a> in the final weeks of the spring semester. UCLA also <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/education/ucla-cancels-classes-after-dueling-protesters-clash-on-campus-over-the-war-in-gaza">canceled classes</a> after pro-Palestinian protesters came under attack by masked agitators and campus police failed to intervene for three hours. USC <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestine-war-campus-protests-fbd7dd06431f32d24d0f8abcc8a56b8b">scrapped a commencement speech </a>by its pro-Palestinian valedictorian over safety concerns. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Universities should be planning now for how they can prevent that from happening again. If protests escalate this fall to the level of requiring the invention of campus public safety or police, then “something’s already gone terribly wrong,” said <a href="https://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/frederick-m-lawrence/">Frederick Lawrence</a>, the former president of Brandeis University and a lecturer at Georgetown Law.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The most important step schools can take now is to set clear ground rules for protests that will be applied neutrally — no matter who’s involved or what their cause — such as prohibiting occupying buildings or blocking students from getting to class.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ahead of the fall semester, Lawrence said, university administrators and protesters should plan for a reset that begins with communication.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This is a good time to be reaching out to student leaders on all sides of this and other related issues, and listening to them, but also trying to bring them on board, to try to find constructive ways of having demonstrations, having expressions of views, but doing it in a way that’s constructive for them and constructive for the university,” Lawrence said. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Universities have to carefully consider when to weigh in&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none">University administrators have dual responsibilities to uphold free speech and keep their community safe. Their ability to carry out those responsibilities is compromised when they aren’t seen as neutral mediators.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some university administrators learned this the hard way earlier this year when their statements about the Gaza war were copiously picked apart in the media and in <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/12/15/24001823/antisemitism-college-harvard-penn-mit-free-speech">widely publicized congressional hearings</a> — as well as on their own campuses, as some student protesters at Stanford <a href="https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2024/06/05/pro-palestine-protesters-occupy-stanford-presidents-office/">occupied the offices of their college president</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the spring, some universities did decide that it is not the role of a university to take stances on issues at an institutional level. Harvard, for instance, announced that it would <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/5/28/harvard-institutional-neutrality-report/">no longer comment</a> on contentious issues that do not directly relate to the university. That change in policy came after former Harvard president Claudine Gay was <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/10/10/harvard-statement-criticized/">heavily criticized </a>for her initial statement on the war. The beleaguered Gay <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/1/17/claudine-gay-harvard-presidency-feature/">resigned</a> after facing a later plagiarism scandal.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perrino framed Harvard’s approach as a positive development.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“That should hopefully alleviate some of the messaging concerns around these colleges,” he said. “Universities are the hosts and sponsors of critics. They are not themselves the critics, and by becoming the critics, they put their thumb on the scale of the campus debate.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rather than issuing blanket statements, there may be a more nuanced role for educators to play, by discouraging certain kinds of speech, even if it is permitted under university rules. For example, Yale president Peter Salovey <a href="https://president.yale.edu/president/statements/against-hatred">stated</a> in the spring that “Chants or messages that express hatred, celebrate the killing of civilians, or contain calls for genocide of any group are utterly against our ideals and certainly are not characteristic of our broader community.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those kinds of warnings can have the effect of lowering the temperature.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“A lot of things get said in the heat of the moment that are not helpful, and it is useful for the administration to deescalate and to say, ‘You can communicate that in a way that’s not deeply offensive to your classmates,’” Lawrence said. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Blake Lively’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/366523/blake-lively-drama-justin-baldoni-it-ends-with-us-hoover-movie-feud"><em>It Ends With Us</em></a> is the second biggest movie in America, but it’s the <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/366523/blake-lively-drama-justin-baldoni-it-ends-with-us-hoover-movie-feud">conflict</a> surrounding the film — not the film itself — that everyone’s talking about.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Apparently, Lively and her co-stars are feuding with lead and director Justin Baldoni. Baldoni and Lively <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/justin-baldoni-hires-pr-crisis-manager-melissa-nathan-it-ends-with-us-1235973715/">reportedly</a> didn’t get along, and he allegedly “<a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a61877865/blake-lively-justin-baldoni-fat-shaming-lingering-kiss/">fat-shamed</a>” her by asking someone how much Lively weighed — a scene involving the two requires he pick her up and he was afraid of hurting his back. And according to whispers, he didn’t very much enjoy Lively inviting her husband Ryan Reynolds on set to direct some scenes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But while Baldoni is getting plenty of static here (he’s gone so far as to hire a <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1406111/it-ends-with-us-justin-baldoni-hires-crisis-pr-manager-amid-feud-rumors">veteran crisis PR manager</a> who counts Johnny Depp among her clients), the hullabaloo has many online looking a little more closely at Lively, who is showing her face on the big screen for the first time in four years. Many have noted that Lively has taken a peculiar approach in <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/natashajokic1/it-ends-with-us-blake-lively-justin-baldoni">promoting</a> this film. In an attempt to sell this movie, Lively has promised viewers the giggliest, girliest of times. At the same time, the actor, known for her beautiful hair, launched a haircare line. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This sisterhood of traveling <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24031385/stanley-craze-tumbler-best-water-bottle">Stanley</a> cups approach is in stark contrast to the <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/365988/colleen-hoover-it-ends-with-us-explained">movie’s plot</a>: Lively’s protagonist, a budding florist named Lily Bloom, falls in love with a physically abusive man (Baldoni). Lively’s seeming lack of concern or emotional intelligence about this sensitive topic has raised questions and backlash about whether she knows what kind of movie she’s made, and it’s making some question what we thought we knew about Lively herself.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Blake Lively’s<em> It Ends With Us </em>press tour has been about selling Blake Lively’s stuff&nbsp;</h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Movie press tours are not a thrilling business. They mostly consist of actors fielding the same questions over and over from a variety of media outlets, all in the hopes that they say something that spurs you to see the film they’re promoting. The monotonous repetition of the cinematic publicity cycle is exactly why Lively and<em> It Ends With Us</em>’s unusual tour has been so attention-grabbing. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For starters, Lively and director and co-star Baldoni have been promoting the film separately — an extremely strange thing for leads to do. They’re also doing these interviews, as my colleague <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/366523/blake-lively-drama-justin-baldoni-it-ends-with-us-hoover-movie-feud">Kyndall Cunningham detailed</a>, amid a rash of back-and-forth gossip alleging the two fell out on set. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But what Lively has been saying in the promotion of the film is also drawing attention. In a video clip promoting the movie on TikTok, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@itendswithusmovie/video/7400133808219032878?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7402348493942408735">Lively says to</a> “grab your friends, wear your florals, and head out to see it!” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition to Lively’s quip about girls’ night out to watch intimate partner abuse, she has been promoting both her new haircare line <a href="https://www.target.com/b/blake-brown/-/N-q643leebz0w">Blake Brown</a> and her beverage company Betty Buzz. She’s used the <a href="https://deadline.com/gallery/it-ends-with-us-premiere-red-carpet-photos/">red carpet</a> to keep the public thinking about her husband’s new film, the hyper-violent and profane Marvel blockbuster <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>, while giving Reynolds — not screenwriter Christy Hall or author Colleen Hoover — <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/natashajokic1/it-ends-with-us-ryan-reynolds-blake-lively">credit</a> for writing the movie’s “iconic” rooftop scene.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One promotional clip has her giggling with her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-Z2rXzx7KT/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=9f3edee9-9480-4e00-a68d-b117dd3b53d0">co-stars about their zodiac signs</a>, while another has <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@people/video/7402692327157828907?lang=en">Lively talking about wearing her own clothes</a> in the movie — a move that seems to be connected to Lively styling one of her costars on one of the movie’s red carpets. And in one of her interviews, she’s asked by a journalist who’s clearly familiar with the movie’s sensitive themes about how the movie may inspire people to reach out to her and talk about abuse. <a href="https://x.com/SophRossss/status/1823931352175071394">Lively flippantly dismisses</a> the question as a joke about hypothetically not sharing her location or phone number with those fans instead of, as many would have preferred, promoting <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/leylamohammed/blake-lively-backlash-dismissive-response-it-ends-with-us">domestic violence services</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lively’s critics pointed out the disconnect between Lively framing her movie like a celebratory girls’ night and the actual content, in which a woman experiences violence from her romantic partner. Wearing florals and rounding up the girlies to watch a woman get physically abused by her partner seems, at best, a strange missing of the point and at worst, extremely insensitive or out of touch with the subject of her movie. Either Lively doesn’t fully comprehend the subject of the movie she made or she does and is capitalizing on it to sell her wares anyway. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While tabloids like <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/08/14/blake-lively-justin-baldoni-fat-shamed-it-ends-with-us/">TMZ are reporting</a> on a behind-the-scenes PR war between Lively and Baldoni, this part of the backlash comes from Lively, all on her own, answering these questions the way she’s chosen to.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Blake Lively’s <em>It Ends With Us</em> press tour fits a pattern of bad interviews she’s had&nbsp;</h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When actors have these moments where they seemingly stop acting like fun, good people, it often causes civilians to question whether said celebrity has always been like this or if they’re exhibiting some uncharacteristic behavior. Lively rose to fame playing the rich, carefree Serena van der Woodsen on Gossip Girl, and in many ways that character’s glamorous but selfish image has combined with her own. In her film hiatus, she’s been known more for her relationships than anything else — with Reynolds but perhaps more notably with <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/08/14/entertainment/blake-lively-gushes-over-best-friend-taylor-swift-amid-it-ends-with-us-drama/">Taylor Swift</a>. This popularity perhaps contributes to, as one commenter put it, a “<a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/14/entertainment/reporter-calls-out-blake-lively-for-uncomfortable-interview/">mean girl</a>” vibe. Unfortunately for Lively and her image, she’s done some rather off-putting interviews that have been easy to find. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of those interactions is a <em>Café Society </em>press junket on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2-2RBi1qzY">YouTube with the title</a> “The Blake Lively interview that made me want to quit my job.” Journalist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Flaawsometalk">Kjersti Flaa</a> uploaded her 2016 clip with Lively on August 10, right in the middle of this kerfuffle. In it, Flaa congratulates Lively on her pregnancy which Lively takes passive-aggressive offense to and responds by “congratulating” the not-pregnant Flaa on her own “bump.” (Prior to her interaction with Flaa, Lively had confirmed her pregnancy to the press.) After Lively’s quip, she and co-star Parker Posey barely make eye contact with Flaa, and Lively continues to dismiss or react aggressively to Flaa’s questions about the movie, almost pretending as if Flaa weren’t in the room. </p>

Lively has conducted her press tour from the movie separately from co-star Justin Baldoni. | Cindy Ord/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Cindy Ord/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">During that same press tour, Lively also said that <em>Café Society</em> director Woody Allen was good, actually. At the time, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/my-father-woody-allen-danger-892572/">Ronan Farrow</a> had recently written a column in the Hollywood Reporter criticizing the movie industry’s response to his sister Dylan Farrow’s sex abuse allegations against their father. Lively, when asked about Allen, <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/blake-lively-says-woody-allen-is-empowering-to-women-in-new-interview-290662/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20could%20%5Bonly%5D%20know,is%20he's%20empowering%20to%20women.%E2%80%9D">said</a>: “I could [only] know my experience. And my experience with Woody is [that] he’s empowering to women.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Going back further, critics found Lively’s first foray and faux pas into lifestyle branding. Back in 2014, Lively created a digital lifestyle and e-commerce site called Preserve. One of the first spreads was titled “<a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/10/13/6969341/blake-lively-preserve-slavery-antebellum">The Allure of the Antebellum</a>,” putting the site’s name in, let’s say, a certain light. The shoot was a romanticized version of the pre-Civil War South, and failed to address the reality that these cute outfits were anchored in a time of slavery. It’s also worth noting that Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds got married on a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/ryan-reynolds-blake-lively-apologize-plantation-themed-wedding-n1235770">South Carolina plantation in 2012</a> (and later apologized), which may contextualize Lively’s fascination with antebellum aesthetics — though the actor was born and grew up in Los Angeles. (Reynolds, for his part, is famously from Canada.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lively’s Preserve <a href="https://www.gawkerarchives.com/blake-lively-finally-deletes-her-antebellum-obsessed-li-1733782406">lasted about one year</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not difficult to connect the dots between Lively praising Woody Allen being good to women, Lively being palpably mean to a journalist, and Lively glossing over the egregious trauma and pain of slavery with the blithe way she’s behaving on the <em>It Ends With US </em>promotional circuit. While being famous and having every word you say recorded, especially ones that you regret, is not an easy job, this behavior fits a pattern that Lively has shown before.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A more telling frame for this messy kerfuffle might be recognizing that Lively and her husband have become more and more interested in the business side of their acting careers, perhaps even more than the acting.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition to Lively’s hair care line, soda line, and seemingly imminent fashion foray, Reynolds has invested in — and made himself the face of — more than a few companies. He has an ownership stake in telecom company <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rRpYZrNxQc">Mint Mobile</a>, the Welsh soccer club <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/ryan-reynolds-complicated-relationship-father-29738505">Wrexham</a>, and had, until recently, a similar stake in <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ryan-reynolds-made-over-450-222854697.html">Aviation Gin</a>. He’s even the CEO of a marketing company, aptly called <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffconway/2022/03/15/ryan-reynolds-on-how-mntn-and-maximum-effort-are-changing-the-advertising-world-as-we-know-it/">Maximum Effort</a>. Lively and Reynolds are arguably more talented at selling their lifestyle and their names than they are at acting. To many people, drinking the same booze as Ryan Reynolds or having the same hair as Blake Lively is more desirable than watching a Ryan Reynolds or Blake Lively movie. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When movies are so clearly secondary to their personal brand, as we’ve seen with Lively and <em>It Ends With Us</em>, their films become commercials, avenues to further promote their brands and themselves. During the <em>It Ends With Us</em> press tour, Lively spoke not only about how <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2024/08/it-ends-with-us-cast-drama-blake-lively-justin-baldoni.html">Reynolds tinkered</a> with the script, but shots in the film as well, and brought in <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/it-ends-with-us-sony-blake-lively-1235974889/"><em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine </em>editor Shane Reid</a> to help cut the movie. The plugs function as cross-promotion for her husband’s movie and his credibility as a director and actor. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With <em>It Ends With Us</em>, Lively was faced with a high-profile movie that features content that her brand probably doesn’t want to be associated with. Blake Lively the brand was at odds with Blake Lively the actor. In this case, the brand won out; Lively chose to put her efforts behind her brand. Unfortunately for that brand, it’s Blake Lively’s movie — and her complicated image — we can’t stop talking about.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ukraine’s invasion into the Kursk region of Russia shocked Ukrainians, their allies, and most of all, Russia.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ukrainian units have mounted brief, overnight raids into Russian territory before, including one into the Kursk region — near Russia’s western border — earlier this year. But those were quick incursions followed by hasty retreats. This time is different: Ukraine has managed to capture <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-incursion-kursk-afa42b9613323901bef07800ac2cae9e">nearly 400 square miles</a> so far, as well as hundreds of Russian soldiers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Ukrainian offensive began more than a week ago, on August 6. Ukrainian troops — how many is unclear, though <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/ukraine-russia-kursk-incursion-war.html">US officials have said several thousand</a> — and armored vehicles crossed the border from northeastern Ukraine. It’s also unclear how much fighting has taken place, though <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-kursk-offensive.html">reporting suggests Ukrainian forces</a> have faced at least some Russian defenses.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ukraine has yet to say what its military objective is, and it likely has more than just one.&nbsp;No officials other than President Volodymyr Zelenskyy have spoken publicly about those objectives; the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cm2n77mvrz4t">president said that</a> “Russia has brought war to others, and now it is coming home.” Still, the sustained invasion has proved to be a morale boost for Ukrainians sorely in need of one after two and a half years of grinding war.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Russia’s response to the Kursk operation has been extremely slow. Part of that may be because its military apparatus is extremely hierarchical — which can delay rapid action as decisions work their way up the chain — and because it has gone through major destabilizing changes of late. Crucially, its forces are also tied up in Ukraine’s east, where they have been making gains in recent months.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Russia’s rhetorical response has also been quite muted. President Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin’s military apparatus are referring to efforts to rebut the Ukrainian advance as an anti-terror campaign rather than a full military operation. Part of Russia’s strategy overall has been to simultaneously portray its war in Ukraine as existential and not that serious; it refers to its invasion as “a special military operation,” making it sound less concerning to Russians than an all-out war, and assures them that it doesn’t affect their lives.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ukraine’s strategy in the Kursk region makes that harder to maintain, since so far <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraine-attack-russia-evacuations-state-of-emergency/story?id=112833027">around 200,000 Russians</a> have evacuated from their homes due to the invasion — and the Russian government is only offering <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/putin-says-displaced-residents-of-kursk-oblast-will-be-paid-115/">about $115 to compensate</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What does Ukraine gain from this?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ukraine’s continuing incursion into Russia is politically useful, especially in drawing attention and potentially support from US and other allies. Two and a half years into the war, global attention has shifted away from Ukraine’s front line to Israel’s war in Gaza, and now the upcoming US elections.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Support for Ukraine has waned within the US, too. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/house-ukraine-aid-speaker-ouster-c525efc953d532242d6d441c55724992">Republicans in Congress</a> have tried to cut or eliminate critical US military assistance, and overall US support <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-had-very-good-call-with-ukraines-zelenskiy-friday-2024-07-19/">could be at risk</a> if Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump manages to recapture the White House in November.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This successful and sustained incursion into Russia indicates that Ukraine is still a very disciplined fighting force that can actually successfully execute on battlefield objectives with sophisticated strategy. Reminding outside powers that Ukraine can be militarily successful, and could still win this, could help shore up support that’s crucial for maintaining the flow of ammunition, fighting vehicles, fighter jets and spare parts, and other gear.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The invasion is also beneficial practically. To counter Ukraine’s attack, Russia will need to pull some troops from the front line in Ukraine. However, its options are limited for doing so; it is trying to avoid redeploying soldiers away from fighting in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, which Russia falsely claims is its own territory.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Troop movement is already occurring according to <a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/press-media/staff-bios/riley-bailey">Riley Bailey</a>, a Russia analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/world/europe/russia-ukraine-kursk-incursion-troops.html">though not at the scale that Russia really needs</a> to repel the attack and regain territory.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We’ve seen reports of up to 11 Russian battalions redeploying from other sectors of the front to form kind of this hastily-put-together force grouping in Kursk Oblast,” Bailey told Vox. That part of the border was poorly defended on the Russian side, which probably influenced Ukraine’s decision-making.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s impossible to predict what impact Ukraine’s offensive will have on the end of the war. But it will have an immediate, wider-ranging effect, particularly for Russia, Bailey said. “They’re going to have to make a whole lot of theater-wide decisions that they otherwise weren’t going to make before.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And ultimately, the incursion could also give Ukraine leverage further down the road, in the form of prisoner swaps and potentially negotiations to end the war — if, that is, they’re able to hold on to the territory.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Things are still tough for Ukraine, and this operation won’t necessarily “turn the tide”</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ukraine has been extremely tight-lipped about the entire operation thus far, which speaks to a high level of operational sophistication. But there’s a serious question as to how long Ukraine can maintain this operational tempo and whether they can hang on to this territory — which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/world/europe/russia-ukraine-kursk-incursion-troops.html">they plan to do</a>,<strong> </strong>according to <a href="https://www.forsvaret.no/en/research/staff/zysk-katarzyna">Katarzyna Zysk</a>, professor of international relations and contemporary history at the Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ukraine has already committed troops to this incursion who could also be effective on other front lines; in trying to force Russian resources from the east, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-incursion-gamble-battlefield-e862afd58c65d6d2d5b7b3747423ca4d">it’s diverting its own from a crucial front</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ukraine is already struggling with troop numbers, and there’s simply a limit to the number of people it can mobilize.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Back in July, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-mobilisation-campaign-picks-up-despite-faltering-enthusiasm-2024-07-15/">according to a Reuters report</a>, morale was flagging; Zelenskyy had lowered the draft age from 27 to 25, and fighters on the front have become exhausted after two years of nonstop battle.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And even if this battlefield success turns into a successful recruitment drive, that doesn’t mean that suddenly Ukraine will have thousands of highly qualified and effective soldiers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Inasmuch as you can get anyone to drive a truck or clean toilets, you can&#8217;t get effective warfighters that easily,&#8221; Mathieu Boulègue, a defense analyst for the Center for European Policy Analysis, told Reuters.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ukraine remains outnumbered and outgunned; Russia is obtaining drones, ballistic missiles, and ammunition from partners like Iran, China, and North Korea, and is still working on improving its weapons manufacturing domestically, though that’s somewhat challenging given the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60125659">sanctions on its economy</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And the Kursk invasion doesn’t change the fact that Russia is still devastating Kharkiv and has made advances in Crimea, although part of the Kursk invasion seems to be aimed at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/world/europe/russia-ukraine-airfields-kursk.html">weakening Russia’s air capabilities</a> and potentially further mobilize forces away from Crimea.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As of now, Ukraine’s sneak attack may have disrupted the idea that Russia —&nbsp;and Putin — is in control of the war. But it hasn’t yet significantly eased pressure on the eastern front line or stopped Russia’s assaults on Ukrainian cities and towns. It will be increasingly&nbsp;difficult for Ukraine to sustain this level of intensity as more Russian reinforcements arrive —&nbsp;and that’s exactly what needs to happen for Ukraine to be able to have real leverage over Russia in future territorial exchanges or peace negotiations.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) estimated that <a href="https://data.unicef.org/resources/progress-on-household-drinking-water-sanitation-and-hygiene-2000-2020/">2 billion people</a> worldwide lack access to clean water.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Roughly a quarter of the world’s population might seem bad enough. But on Thursday, a <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adh9578">new study published</a> in<em> Science</em> reported that 2 billion was a huge underestimate. New analyses reveal that 4.4 billion people across low- and middle-income countries — over half of the world’s population — don’t have safe household drinking water. It’s not that billions more people lost access to water. Rather, how researchers measure access became much more accurate, and those new measurements showed the problem is much worse than previously thought.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’ve always had clean running water at home, it’s easy to forget that drinkable tap water isn’t a given for much of the planet.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In developed countries like the US with sanitation systems, water is siphoned from a lake, river, or underground reservoir, and passed through a treatment plant to filter out dirt, bacteria, and harmful chemicals. From there, it’s stored in something like a water tower and piped into homes. If everything goes right, that water is safe to drink.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even then, this process doesn’t go 100 percent right. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/water-loss-infrastructure-broken-pipes-poor-neighborhoods-2d747180d294ba62cdbf0906f9305802">Leaky pipes</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/8/31/23329604/jackson-mississippi-water-crisis">aging infrastructure</a>, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/12/15/10237054/flint-lead-poisoning">chemical contamination</a> limit access to safe water in even the wealthiest countries. If it’s a logistical hurdle for those countries — where the vast majority of water is clean, cheap, and plentiful — the burden for low- and middle-income countries in providing everyone with safe drinking water is far more challenging, especially in rural areas, where limited sanitation infrastructure, conflict, and inadequate funding can impede water access. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sufficient access to clean, reliable, affordable drinking water is a human right, though, and the <a href="https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/human_right_to_water.shtml#:~:text=The%20human%20right%20to%20water%20and%20sanitation&amp;text=On%2028%20July%202010%2C%20through,realisation%20of%20all%20human%20rights.">United Nations has urged</a> governments to funnel resources toward building and maintaining water infrastructure. (One of the UN’s <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal6">sustainable development goals</a> is for every community to have clean water — a far-off goal.) Better funding is vital, but unless money is strategically directed toward the right places and programs, throwing cash at the problem <a href="https://www.vox.com/22620076/jackson-mississippi-water-infrastructure-bill">won’t necessarily fix it</a>. That’s where the new data comes in.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/esther-greenwood-71a314133/?originalSubdomain=ch">Esther Greenwood</a>, doctoral candidate at the Federal Institute of Technology Zurich and <a href="https://www.eawag.ch/en/">Eawag, an aquatic research institute in Switzerland</a>, noticed huge gaps in information about drinking water services for over half of the world’s population. By filling these gaps, Greenwood and <a href="https://www.eawag.ch/en/about-us/portrait/organisation/staff/profile/tim-julian/show/">principal investigator Tim Julian</a> aimed to highlight regions where investment in drinking water testing is needed the most.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The fact that so many people around the world do not have reasonable access to safe drinking water must give us pause for thought,” Eawag director <a href="https://usys.ethz.ch/en/people/profile.martin-ackermann.html">Martin Ackermann</a> said. “This could be avoided.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>More people lack safe drinking water than was thought — a lot more</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Figuring out how many people have access to safe water is no small feat, especially in rural areas where this data matters the most. Historically, UNICEF has relied on <a href="https://mics.unicef.org/">household surveys</a>, sending teams of people to conduct in-person interviews from a sample of homes in a given country. They ask <a href="https://mics.unicef.org/tools?round=mics6#survey-design">questions like</a>, <em>“</em>Can you please provide me with a glass of water that members of your household usually drink?” and “Where was this water collected from?” — all of which provides a decent snapshot of a family’s current water situation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But these surveys are labor-intensive and expensive, so information is only gathered once every five to 10 years. Anything that affects water use at a shorter timescale, from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/emergency/sanitation-wastewater/animal-feeding-operations.html#:~:text=Animal%20waste%20(manure)%20from%20animal,coli">livestock farming</a> to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26405847/">seasonal changes in rainfall</a>, won’t be captured. And until recently, surveys <a href="https://washdata.org/unicef-multiple-indicator-cluster-surveys-mics">didn’t ask about water quality</a> at all, Greenwood added. For most regions, only one survey’s worth of data on drinking water contamination exists so far, which makes it difficult to assess trends over time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Greenwood’s team incorporated 39 different sources of geospatial data in their study, gathered on land and via satellite, in addition to survey data from over 64,000 households across 27 countries between 2016 and 2020. They used all of this information to train <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/4/28/23702644/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-technology">machine learning models</a> to estimate whether the water in a given place met <a href="https://washdata.org/monitoring/drinking-water">four safety criteria</a> from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP), which collects data on water supply, sanitation, and hygiene: improved (as in, from a source that could be safe, like pipes, rather than an unprotected well), and whether it was available when needed, accessible without a commute, and free from fecal contamination.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the past, water quality has been measured by averaging survey results across a country’s entire population. Greenwood said that the JMP generally tries to average survey responses relating to all of its water safety criteria, then highlight the lowest value. Say that a survey in one country finds that 80 percent of people get water from an improved source, 50 percent have water at home, 40 percent have consistent water access, and 30 percent have clean, non-contaminated water — the JMP would report that 30 percent of people have safe drinking water.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This washes out a lot of the nuances of people’s individual experiences. What if you have access to clean water, but you have to walk to a kiosk three miles away to get it? Or have consistent water access at home, but it’s <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-mexico-city-is-having-trouble-getting-water-to-its-22-million-residents">piped into tanks via weekly truck deliveries</a> (an “unimproved” water source)?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To get around this problem, Greenwood’s team instead calculated data at the household level, and divided land into smaller chunks than full-blown countries to create a more accurate map of safe drinking water use. They found that two-thirds of people living in low- and middle-income countries had no household access to safe drinking water in 2020. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to clean up water</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/videos/359516/paris-olympics-seine-swimming-poop">Fecal contamination</a>, or high levels of E. coli, was the biggest problem for nearly half of the population studied. When people or animals defecate near a water source, or sewage isn’t effectively contained, E. coli appears in drinking water downstream. Drinking contaminated water like this leads to diarrheal disease — an annoyance for adults but a mass killer for the young, with <a href="https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-health/diarrhoeal-disease/#:~:text=Diarrhoea%20is%20a%20leading%20killer,of%20a%20simple%20treatment%20solution.">over 1,000 young children dying from the disease every day</a>, primarily in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the technology required to measure E. coli levels is widely available, actually collecting drinking water samples and testing them is expensive, especially in remote rural areas. As a consequence, Greenwood said, “We still lack national data on drinking water contamination for approximately half of the global population.” Other chemicals like <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/arsenic">arsenic</a> and <a href="https://www.epa.gov/safepestcontrol/drinking-water-and-pesticides">pesticides</a> can also cause health problems when they wind up in drinking water, but data on these contaminants was even more limited than that for E. coli — too limited for Greenwood’s team to include in their training data.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Greenwood’s team found that environmental factors, like tree density and how much rainfall changes with the seasons, were another major predictor of drinking water quality. This aligns with what researchers already knew — water quality is shaped in part by the weather. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Runoff after a big rainstorm, for example, can pick up bacteria, dirt, and pollutants on its way back to rivers and lakes. <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.2c07284">Heat waves</a> also correlate with spikes in water contamination, especially in low-income areas. As the Earth continues getting hotter, this will become an increasingly pressing concern — low-income countries currently facing water insecurity <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/01/climate-crisis-poor-davos2023/">are also the most vulnerable</a> to the effects of climate change.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Landscape and urban development also come into play. Sometimes, water is scarce because humans built a city in a dry place, or that city outgrew its water supply. South Africa’s Cape Town was <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/08/cape-town-was-90-days-away-from-running-out-of-water-heres-how-it-averted-the-crisis/">almost forced to shut off its water supply</a> in 2018 after a years-long drought, and narrowly avoided a massive crisis through a combination of restricting water supply and reducing demand.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But often the problem is less how much water there is than its quality and its availability to homes. <a href="https://washmatters.wateraid.org/publications/functionality-wastewater-treatment-plants-low-middle-income-countries">Too often wastewater treatment plants are poorly managed</a>, or <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X21002400">insufficient water pressure</a> prevents piped water service from running consistently. <a href="https://www.vox.com/24152402/mexico-city-day-zero-water-resource-management-solutions">Mexico City</a>, for example, may also run out of water in the not-too-distant future due to a combination of climate change and human mismanagement. When city pipes run dry, alternate sources of water like bottled water or <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:A_water_kiosk_in_Chipata_(7642999604).jpg#/media/File:A_water_kiosk_in_Chipata_(7642999604).jpg">kiosks</a> are usually available, but these can <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X21002400">cost up to 52 times as much</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tackling huge policy problems like water insecurity requires a lot of data. Greenwood’s team began to fill in some of the gaps left open by the JMP, but she said that the kind of information they really need — frequent, hyperlocal measurements of water use over time — still doesn’t exist. This longitudinal data will be especially important for understanding how climate change is affecting drinking water services. Since climate and weather fluctuate faster than once-in-a-decade surveys can capture, surveys alone won’t cut it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Household data also don’t necessarily reflect someone’s daily water use, either. People also drink water and go to the bathroom at work, school, and other public facilities — and there are still huge gaps in information about <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adh9578">public water use</a>. This study also didn’t address the <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/03-05-2021-affordability-of-wash-must-be-defined-and-tracked-if-2030-global-goals-are-to-be-met-new-report">affordability of drinking water</a>, or the disproportionate <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-02037-8#:~:text=In%20rural%20households%20lacking%20access,physical%20strain%20and%20mental%20distress.">burden that water insecurity places on the women</a> often tasked with fetching water when it’s not available at home.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the kind of geospatial data Greenwood’s team used can’t necessarily answer those questions, it can help point resources in the right direction. Areas with especially high levels of fecal contamination, or especially densely populated areas with limited water sources, could be flagged for prioritization by the government.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Greenwood hopes that by demonstrating what a big effect accounting for geospatial information has on water safety estimates, their team can mobilize policymakers “towards improving monitoring of water quality globally, particularly in regions where there are current data gaps.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A new and deadlier version of mpox is spreading internationally. In recent months, cases and deaths were being detected only in parts of central and east Africa, but on Thursday, Sweden <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/sweden-confirms-first-case-mpox-2024-08-15/">confirmed</a> its first case. The announcement comes just one day after the World Health Organization <a href="https://apnews.com/article/who-mpox-africa-health-emergency-cc9bdf31b49d06bec5efd44fb55d5e42" data-type="link" data-id="https://apnews.com/article/who-mpox-africa-health-emergency-cc9bdf31b49d06bec5efd44fb55d5e42">declared</a> mpox an international public health emergency for the second time in two years. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The risk to the general public in the US is “very low,” the Department of Health and Human Services <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/08/14/united-states-governments-response-clade-i-mpox-outbreak-democratic-republic-congo-other-countries-region.html">stated</a> in the wake of the World Health Organization’s announcement.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mpox, previously known as monkeypox, is an infectious disease closely related to but much less severe than smallpox, and is suspected to originate in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/about/index.html#:~:text=Monkeypox%20virus%20was%20discovered%20in,regions%20where%20mpox%20is%20endemic.">African rodents and non-human primates</a>. Mpox <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/if-sick/transmission.html">spreads</a> through close contact with an infected person, including from sexual and skin-to-skin-contact. Pregnant people can also pass the virus to their child during pregnancy and after birth. The most common <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/symptoms/index.html">symptom</a> of mpox is a blister-like rash that typically lasts for two to four weeks. Other symptoms include fever, fatigue, muscle aches, cough, and sore throat.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/monkeypox#:~:text=The%20monkeypox%20virus%20was%20discovered,occasionally%20from%20animals%20to%20people.">For decades</a>, mpox has caused sporadic cases and outbreaks in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and several&nbsp;other African countries. But in <a href="https://www.who.int/europe/emergencies/situations/monkeypox">May 2022</a>, countries outside of Africa, including many that had never dealt with mpox, suddenly started recording cases. That July, the World Health Organization declared the pandemic a public health emergency of international concern for the first time. In just one year, more than <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/response/2022/world-map.html">100 countries</a> had recorded nearly 90,000 mpox cases and over <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mpox">150 deaths</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fortunately, public health agencies around the world acted quickly to improve disease surveillance efforts, increasing awareness among high-risk populations, particularly men who have sex with men, and <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/monkeypox-response-in-europe">encouraging</a> safe sex practices. In the US and Europe, where there were just over 30,000 and 25,000 mpox cases respectively between May 2022 and May 2023; officials also disseminated over a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7220a2.htm">million</a> vaccine doses. Consequently, mpox transmission in most countries quickly dwindled. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In <a href="https://www.who.int/europe/emergencies/situations/monkeypox">May 2023</a>, the World Health Organization lifted the emergency status and although at the time the public health body no longer considered mpox an international health emergency, countries around the world continued to report cases but much fewer than at the height of the epidemic. In June 2024, there were 175 cases reported across North, Central, and South America; 100 cases were reported in Europe, and 11 cases were reported in Southeast Asian countries, according to a <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20240812_mpox_external-sitrep_35.pdf?sfvrsn=62a5fea1_4&amp;download=true">situation report</a> published by the World Health Organization. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the Democratic Republic of the Congo in central Africa; however, the outbreak <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON522">continued</a> largely unabated. As of May 2024, there have been <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON522">7,851</a> mpox cases and 384 deaths reported in the country. On Tuesday, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://time.com/7010665/mpox-health-emergency-africa/">declared</a> mpox a continent-wide public health emergency.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The version of the virus circulating in the DRC was different than the one that spread globally. There are two <a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/mpox#:~:text=Mpxv%20virus%20variants%20are%20referred,Clade%20IIa%20and%20Clade%20IIb.">main strains</a> of mpox: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/about/index.html">clade I</a>, which causes more severe illness and has historically been confined to central Africa, and clade II, which has historically caused infections in west Africa. Clade II was the version that spread to over 100 countries in 2022 and 2023. But clade I was spreading in the DRC. And it is clade I that has now started spreading out of the DRC into <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/08/1153141">four countries in east Africa</a> — Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda — and now Sweden. </p>

Let’s talk about it.</a></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The new international spread of mpox clade I is spurring concerns that a deadlier<em> </em>mpox pandemic might be on the horizon and triggered the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization to designate the ongoing mpox outbreaks as health emergencies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Africa CDC is the public health <a href="https://africacdc.org/">agency</a> of the African Union, which represents 55 African states. It is the first time the agency has designated any outbreak a continental emergency.&nbsp;Other African countries are also facing resurging mpox outbreaks caused by the clade II virus. In May, there were a total of <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20240812_mpox_external-sitrep_35.pdf?sfvrsn=62a5fea1_4&amp;download=true">465</a> mpox cases documented across all African countries and in June there were 567, a 22 percent increase.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We declare today this public health emergency of continental security to mobilize our institutions, our collective will, and our resources to act swiftly and decisively,” said Africa CDC Director General Jean Kaseya in a press briefing Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Outbreak response efforts in the DRC and other African countries have once again been hamstrung by the same challenges health officials faced during previous outbreaks and pandemics, <a href="https://www.vox.com/22759707/covid-19-vaccine-gap-covax-rich-poor-countries-boosters">including Covid</a>: a lack of global solidarity and an unwillingness to share life-saving resources. While vaccine doses were rapidly disseminated in the US and Europe in 2022, vaccines are only now starting to trickle into the DRC. But even so, only a couple hundred thousand vaccines will be available for a population of more than <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL">100 million</a> people.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Slowly, national governments and multinational organizations such as the African Union are working to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/1/24/24048361/mpox-covid-outbreak-africa-cdc-public-health">improve</a> domestic public health infrastructure and technical capacity and to reduce dependency on donor countries. While Africa CDC’s unprecedented move to designate the mpox outbreaks a regional health emergency signals a continuation of these efforts, it is unclear if the designation will help spur the rapid influx of resources needed to respond to the mpox outbreaks.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Mpox origins and unknowns</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mpox was first discovered in <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/monkeypox#:~:text=The%20monkeypox%20virus%20was%20discovered,occasionally%20from%20animals%20to%20people.">1958</a> in a colony of monkeys in a research facility in Denmark, and the first case of mpox in a human — a nine-month-old infant — was not documented until <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/about/index.html">1970</a> in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Researchers and physicians could <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2480792/pdf/bullwho00192-0028.pdf">not determine</a> exactly how the infant became infected; however, close contact with an infected monkey may have caused the infection. Small rodents, monkeys, and mammals <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/about/index.html">can pass</a> the virus on to humans but outbreaks typically take off when humans infect each other.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2005, additional mpox cases in humans were recorded in the DRC, and thousands of suspected cases have been reported every year since then. Since 2017, mpox has also caused frequent infections in Nigeria.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although mpox has been around for a long time, there are still many unknowns about how the virus spreads and why it suddenly spread around the world in 2022. What researchers do know is that the virus has been rapidly mutating in recent years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Interestingly and maybe worryingly, while most genetic mutations have no effect at all, some can cause viruses to become deadlier or more effective at spreading. When geneticists compared the 2022 mpox genome to a sample collected in 2017, they <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02456-8">found</a> some <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/06/02/mutations-in-monkeypox-virus-explainer/">40</a> genetic <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-023-01675-2#Sec4">mutations</a> had occurred. Some researchers have <a href="https://theconversation.com/mpox-why-the-viruss-continued-rapid-mutation-since-the-2022-global-outbreak-remains-a-concern-228338">suggested</a> that these mutations have improved how easily the virus can spread from person to person, but it seems that there is no firm <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/06/02/mutations-in-monkeypox-virus-explainer/">consensus</a> yet.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In September 2023, an entirely new mpox clade I variant, tentatively called clade IB, was <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON522">discovered</a> in the DRC. The World Health Organization has not confirmed if the new variant causes more severe disease or can be spread more easily.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rosamund Lewis, the mpox technical lead at the World Health Organization, posits that genetic mutations are not behind the sudden global surge of mpox. Instead, she suggests that the virus happened to start infecting new populations — sex workers and men who have sex with men — and that has in turn fueled wider transmission. Mpox is reminiscent of the origins of HIV, when <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3234451/#:~:text=Approximately%20one%20century%20ago%20in,the%20AIDS%20pandemic%20in%20humans.">chimpanzees</a> infected humans in southwestern Cameroon before taking firm <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/why-kinshasa-1920s-was-perfect-place-hiv-go-global-180952953/">root</a> in the booming urban center — and among the large sex worker population — of Kinshasa, the capital of the DRC.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sexual transmission among adults may only be one of the main drivers of mpox transmission. In the DRC, some <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/about/mpox-risk-assessment.html">70 percent</a> of mpox cases recorded this year were among children who were likely exposed through close contact with infected animals or household members who were infected.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the biggest risk factors for severe mpox infection and <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)00273-8/fulltext">death</a> is preexisting <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/prevention/hiv.html">HIV infection</a>. Unfortunately, about <a href="https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/hivaids#:~:text=There%20are%2025.6%20million%20people%20living%20with%20HIV%20in%20the%20African%20region.&amp;text=In%202022%2C%20about%20380%2C000%20people,AIDS%20related%20illness%20in%202022.">25.6 million</a> people in Africa have HIV, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/363716/africa-hiv-aids-sub-saharan-progress">more</a> than any other region in the world,<strong> </strong>meaning many African nations may experience deadlier outbreaks than other parts of the world. The dual burden of mpox and HIV was also a major factor that prompted the Africa CDC to declare the mpox outbreaks a continental emergency, Kaseya explained.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>There is an mpox vaccine shortage. Will emergency designations help?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are at least two vaccines — <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/jynneos">Jynneos</a>, also called <a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/imvanex">Imvanex</a> in Europe, which is made by Danish company Bavarian Nordic, and <a href="https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/vaccines/lc16-kmb-mpox-smallpox-vaccine#:~:text=LC16%20is%20a%203rd%20generation,emergency%20investigational%20new%20drug%20program.">LC16</a>, which is manufactured by Japanese company KM Biologics — that are effective against mpox. The US Food and Drug Administration <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-live-non-replicating-vaccine-prevent-smallpox-and-monkeypox">approved </a>the Jynneos vaccine for use against smallpox and mpox in 2019.&nbsp;LC16 was developed for smallpox but is also effective against mpox.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When the US and Europe started recording mpox cases in 2022, health officials quickly disseminated millions of doses of existing vaccines. For the first two years of the pandemic, however, no vaccines were available in the DRC.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The DRC, like most countries in Africa, <a href="https://africacdc.org/news-item/africa-calls-for-new-public-health-order/">does not have</a> the infrastructure to produce its own vaccines nor can it afford to pay for millions of doses. (The mpox vaccine costs just under $100 per dose, according to Kaseya; GDP per capita in the <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=CD">DRC is just $649</a>.) Thus, these countries must rely on donations from the US, Europe, and other countries. Following the Covid-19 pandemic, the Africa CDC started leading <a href="https://africacdc.org/news-item/africa-calls-for-new-public-health-order/">efforts</a> to fill this crucial gap, but progress has been slow.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the void, officials in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other African countries have been carrying on their outbreak responses without vaccines. It wasn’t until last month that the first shipments of mpox vaccines started arriving in the DRC. But the country received only 200,000 doses, according to Lewis, forcing personnel to cobble together a plan outlining how they will utilize such finite resources. Kaseya did not elaborate on how Africa CDC will aid in this process.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Donor governments have been providing technical and financial support for mpox outbreak responses in Africa. Last week, the US Agency for International Development, or USAID, announced that it will surge <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/aug-07-2024-united-states-announces-424-million-additional-assistance-democratic-republic-congo">$10 million</a> in funds to support the mpox response in DRC.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It remains unclear if the new emergency designations will have any impact on mpox vaccine availability. Still, the Africa CDC and World Health Organization are increasing financial resources for the mpox response.  Earlier this month, the African Union released <a href="https://africacdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Emergency-Approval-of-10.4-Million-to-Africa-CDC-for-Mpox-Outbreak-Respons.pdf">$10.4 million</a> in funds for the mpox response. The World Health Organization has promised <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/08/1153176">$1.45 million</a> in emergency funds, according to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, with more to follow in the coming days.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This is a fight for all Africans and we will fight it together,” Kaseya said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Update, August 15, 1:35 pm ET: </strong>This story was originally published on August 13 and has been updated multiple times, most recently to include a statement from the US’s CDC about the risk of mpox to Americans as well as the news of the first case outside of Africa in Sweden.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If your utility bill confuses you and makes you sweat every month when it demands hundreds of your hard-earned dollars, you’re not alone. The price of electricity is continuing to rise across the United States, and there’s no end in sight.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Why are our electricity bills getting so expensive? Energy prices have been creeping up across the nation for over a decade. The latest consumer price index <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/14/business/cpi-inflation-fed">saw inflation dip below 3 percent</a> for the first time since 2021, but inflation for electricity prices nationwide <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm">remains stubbornly high at 4.9 percent</a>. There’s no single reason why electricity keeps getting more expensive in any one place, however.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The drivers behind rising energy costs <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-09/interest-rate-cuts-unlikely-to-lower-energy-costs-for-americans?sref=qYiz2hd0">are myriad, overlapping, and vexing</a>. Inflation, rising energy demands, volatile natural gas prices, and extreme weather are all contributing factors. The transition to renewable energy is, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/electricity-prices-get-political-in-trumps-world/">what you’re hearing from Republicans</a>, the transition to clean energy is not the driving force behind rising electricity costs, <a href="https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Clean-Energy-Isnt-Driving-Power-Price-Spikes.pdf">according to a July report from Energy Innovation</a>, a think tank. Building wind, solar, and battery infrastructure is expensive, and connecting those new clean energy resources to the grid is complicated. Rather than making those investments, which save customers money in the long run, many utilities are doubling down on fossil fuel and existing infrastructure in an effort to ensure the grid is reliable.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For example, PJM, a utility company that serves customers from the mid-Atlantic region to the Great Lakes, <a href="https://www.pjm.com/-/media/about-pjm/newsroom/2024-releases/20240730-pjm-capacity-auction-procures-sufficient-resources-to-meet-rto-reliability-requirement.ashx">recently picked mostly natural gas over renewables</a> at its annual capacity auction, where it buys the electricity it needs to keep the lights on for the year ahead, and its customers <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/prices-just-spiked-in-the-biggest-us-power-market-blame-the-grid-backlog">will see more big price spikes</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The United States electric grid <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/22/why-we-need-nationwide-electric-grid-in-the-us-but-dont-have-one.html">is a messy patchwork of thousands of local utilities</a>, many of which are for-profit businesses governed by a complex web of policies and regulations. Throw in those aforementioned variables — inflation, growing energy demand, volatile fuel prices, extreme weather — and you can start to make sense of why your electricity bill won’t stop rising.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, there’s good evidence that by <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/rapid-rollout-of-clean-technologies-makes-energy-cheaper-not-more-costly#">updating those regulations and investing more in clean energy</a>, we can meet that demand, confront those challenges, and keep prices down for decades to come. And we’re only going to need more electricity in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“As [cooking our food] gets electrified, transportation gets electrified, and weather gets more extreme, those demand spikes are becoming larger,” said Paul McDonald, VP of product strategy at Oracle Water and Power, whose team builds AI-powered software that helps shift utility customer behavior towards better energy efficiency.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s a lot you can do to make sure you’re using your energy efficiently, even without the help of AI: Even a few degrees on your thermostat makes a big difference, and cranking it up past 72, even past 76 (<a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/358898/best-thermostat-setting-save-energy-money-ac">yes! really</a>) on hot days will save you money and still keep you pretty comfortable. Heat pumps or solar panels, if you can afford the up-front cost, will save you money in the long term. You can also take a closer look at where your energy comes from and play a more assertive role in how you spend your kilowatt hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before we get into what behavior changes big and small could mean for your out-of-control electric bill, however, it’s helpful to take a deep dive into the numbers on that bill and what’s behind them.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Your electric bill is more complicated than it looks</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent years, inflation has been the easy explanation for rising energy prices in the US. The cost of electricity <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-09/interest-rate-cuts-unlikely-to-lower-energy-costs-for-americans?sref=qYiz2hd0">has outpaced rising prices for food and the wider consumer price index</a> since early 2021, and there are strong indicators that those prices will keep rising as inflation cools.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To understand why this is happening, it’s helpful to understand that your electric bill is actually two bills: You’re paying one for supply and the other for delivery.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/GettyImages_1213009672.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.729057198914,100,78.541885602173" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Utility companies often replace aging or damaged infrastructure components, rather than repair them. | Brent Stirton/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Brent Stirton/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Electricity supply is the stuff that comes from power plants. Those plants might be powered by coal or natural gas, or by renewables, like wind and solar. The cost of delivery, or transmission and distribution, reflects the many moving parts it takes to get that supply from the power plant to your living room. This includes operating and maintaining the grid as well as any big investments to repair or upgrade the grid by, for example, installing new high-voltage transmission lines that could be used to connect renewable energy sources to the grid.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, clean energy is not the culprit when it comes to rising electricity prices, <a href="https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Clean-Energy-Isnt-Driving-Power-Price-Spikes.pdf">according to the recent report from Energy Innovation</a>. Volatility in natural gas prices, including the huge spikes following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, has certainly contributed to some price increases on the supply side. But the transmission and distribution costs have actually been going up at twice the rate of inflation nationwide, the report’s author, Brendan Pierpont, told me. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“That trend of increasing transmission and distribution costs is something that is noticeable all across the country, and so I think it’s an underlying factor in rate increases everywhere,” Pierpont said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Utility companies have a lot of freedom in setting rates for transmission and distribution — and that directly contributes to how much profit they make. Utilities get to pick what gets upgraded when, and they also have an incentive to spend heavily, thanks to regulations that allow them to collect return on investment, <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/research/electric-beats-gas-in-exceeding-authorized-equity-returns-over-past-15-years">usually around 10 percent</a>, for those expenditures. This is actually built into the price most people pay for electricity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s how it works: Every year, utility companies ask regulators to approve a “revenue requirement,” which is basically a budget for what the utilities think it will cost to deliver enough electricity to their customers. Those estimates include spending on new equipment but not the cost of repairing old equipment. It also includes that return on investment, or profit, which regulators <a href="https://haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/WP329.pdf">regularly approve</a>. In Pierpont’s words, “That rate of return has a direct link to the costs that customers pay for electricity.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What utilities don’t seem to be doing, however, is expanding the grid in a way that would benefit clean energy producers, the Energy Innovation report finds. Investments tend to cover local upgrades, like installing new metering equipment, rather than installing the high-voltage transmission lines that renewable energy sources need to connect to the grid. Meanwhile, consumers <a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/annual/html/epa_11_01.html">are facing more frequent outages that last longer</a>, while utilities keep making more money for installing new, potentially unnecessary equipment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s like the utilities have a rewards credit card,” said Joel Rosenberg of Rewiring America, a nonprofit focused on electrification. “And they get to keep the rewards for how much they spend, and the [customers] have to pay off the bill, even if that bill takes 80 years to pay off.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This plays right into the misconception that investment in renewables leads to higher rates.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many of the states leading the way to clean energy are actually seeing lower energy prices than the rest of the country. Data from the US Energy Information Administration shows that 17 states, including California and Massachusetts, <a href="https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Clean-Energy-Isnt-Driving-Power-Price-Spikes.pdf">have increased their share of renewable energy sources by more than 20 percent</a> since 2010. And with the exception of California, all of those states have seen the price of residential rate increases rise more slowly than inflation. The higher rates in California can be explained, in part, by <a href="https://www.kqed.org/science/1985398/california-regulators-set-to-vote-on-pges-newest-rate-increase-plan">rate increases to account for wildfire prevention</a>. In Massachusetts, natural gas is the problem.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">States where residents are seeing electricity bills that outpace inflation tend to be the ones with the highest reliance on natural gas, as highlighted in the Energy Innovation report. Some states in New England, including Massachusetts, have depended on natural gas for around 60 percent of electricity generation since 2020 and have seen prices increase by around 10 percent in the same period. Volatility in the price of natural gas also means that some of the highest price spikes <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-electricity-bills-higher-summer-2023/">are spread out over several years</a>, so there could be more high prices in these states’ futures. </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/GettyImages_1213009661.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.729057198914,100,78.541885602173" alt="Utility workers look up as they work on power lines." title="Utility workers look up as they work on power lines." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Many utilities focus their investment on local equipment upgrades instead of things like long-distance transmission lines, which would make it easier to connect more renewable sources to the grid. | Brent Stirton/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Brent Stirton/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">And none of this takes into account the effects of extreme weather. Hurricane season <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/366041/climate-hurricane-debby-drenches-the-southeast">is just now approaching its peak</a>, after Hurricane Debby already <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-tropical-storm-debby-flooding-d90428b0417df35fa1cae8b24793f5c5">dumped rivers of rain</a> on the southeast US, and La Niña, which brings colder and stormier conditions in the north, <a href="https://weather.com/news/weather/news/2024-08-08-la-nina-outlook-august-update-noaa">is forecast to emerge in the fall</a>. Thanks to climate change, extreme weather events <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/352234/how-one-weather-extreme-can-make-the-next-one-even-more-dangerous">are compounding</a> and getting even more extreme. That’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/04/24/us-grid-outages-extreme-weather">taking a toll on the grid</a>, and somebody has to pay.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Biden administration, for its part, has taken several steps toward making the grid more resilient without raising prices. It’s spent <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/28/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-launches-federal-state-initiative-to-bolster-americas-power-grid/">over $10 billion</a> on grid resilience and innovation, while also providing local utilities <a href="https://liftoff.energy.gov/innovative-grid-deployment/">with guidance</a> on how to invest in the grid in the near term without passing costs along to customers. This week, the Department of Energy <a href="https://www.energy.gov/policy/articles/clean-energy-resources-meet-data-center-electricity-demand">also released a plan to use clean energy to power data centers</a>, which account for a large share of growing energy demand.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Policy typically takes time to change the lives of everyday Americans, who might feel powerless when confronted with the rising cost of electricity. This tension has fueled <a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/energy-and-utilities/whats-the-difference-between-an-electric-co-op-and-a-utility/">the rise of energy cooperatives</a>, where customers have a say in how the grid gets upgraded and how prices are set. If that’s an option where you live, it’s worth a look. Otherwise, you can look inside your home to save money on your next electric bill.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>When all else fails, use less electricity</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On any given day, there’s not a lot you can do to control how utility companies set the price for electricity transmission and distribution. If you live in a state with a deregulated energy market, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/energy-and-utilities/compare-electricity-rates-new-york/">like New York</a>, you might be able to choose where your energy supply comes from. You can also decide to lessen your reliance on the grid by <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/guides-and-how-tos/ask-these-10-questions-if-you-want-to-get-rooftop-solar">installing solar panels on your roof</a> or <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/guides-and-how-tos/what-is-community-solar-and-how-can-you-sign-up">participating in a community solar project</a>. Otherwise, you can just choose to control your electricity usage.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You’ve probably already heard about some easy tricks to bring down your power bill. You can <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/358898/best-thermostat-setting-save-energy-money-ac">set your thermostat higher in the summer</a> or install a smart thermostat. You can <a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/energy-and-utilities/peak-and-off-peak-energy-explainer-heres-the-cheapest-time-to-use-electricity/">run big appliances like dishwashers and dryers at night</a>, when energy might be cheaper. You can turn down your hot water heater, which comes with the benefit of <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/do-it-yourself-savings-project-lower-water-heating-temperature">hundreds of dollars in potential savings</a> as well as not being scalded by your shower.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The harder problem is planning for a future in which electricity costs continue to rise. In order to prepare for that — and it is somewhat inevitable, if only because you’ll use more electricity <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electrification/home-of-the-future-climate-friendly-electrified-and-closer-than-ever">as more of your life becomes electrified</a> — there are a few steps to consider. The first is to <a href="https://homes.rewiringamerica.org/projects/energy-audit-homeowner">do an energy audit</a> and make a plan from there.</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Un<strong>derstanding how to save energy — and money</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Electrifying our future requires, well, a lot of electricity. And that comes at a cost, not only for the planet but also for consumers. Vox writers have been explaining how we got here and what you can do to adapt:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/23340991/power-demand-response-blackout-consumer-climate-change-california-texas-cop27">Consumers, not corporations, saved the power grid. What else can we do?</a></p>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/358898/best-thermostat-setting-save-energy-money-ac">Stop setting your thermostat at 72</a></p>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24047383/winter-storm-heating-electricity-grid-power-polar-vortex">Your home’s cleaner, better heating system comes with one major cost</a></p>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24126621/energy-efficiency-appliances-stove-washing-machine-climate">Our appliances are more efficient than ever. Why doesn’t it feel like it?</a></p>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/2023/4/7/22954507/inflation-reduction-act-renters-home-rebates">A renter’s guide to the Inflation Reduction Act</a></p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Making a plan is a really important thing,” Rosenberg told me, “particularly because when these big appliances fail, it becomes an emergency replacement situation, whether it’s your water heater or your air conditioner or your furnace,” said Rosenberg, pointing me to <a href="https://www.rewiringamerica.org/electrify-home-guide">Rewiring America’s guide to electrifying everything in your home</a>. If your furnace fails in the middle of winter, you might be inclined to pay for the quickest fix, rather than the most efficient or cost-effective.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If any of those three big appliances break, by the way, you should get in the heat pump game. Integrating heat pumps both for heating and cooling as well as hot water can save the average homeowner <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/products/ask-the-experts/heat-pump-water-heater-right-your-home#:~:text=Compared%20to%20a%20standard%20electric,savings%20of%20more%20than%20%245%2C600!">over</a> <a href="https://carbonswitch.com/heat-pump-carbon-reduction-and-savings-potential-report/">$1,000 a year</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Buying a heat pump doesn’t mean you have to rip out your furnace, either. You can <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/renters-you-too-can-get-a-heat-pump-a-micro-one-at-least">install micro heat pumps</a>, some of which look like window unit ACs, to supplement your existing system during all seasons. Micro heat pumps don’t yet qualify for rebates under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), so it’s worth considering a regular heat pump. Installing a heat pump air conditioner/heater or heat pump water heater lets you <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/about/federal-tax-credits/air-source-heat-pumps">claim a $2,000 tax credit</a> in any single year. The IRA offers <a href="https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/energy-efficient-home-improvement-credit">an additional $1,200 for other energy-saving improvements, like new insulation</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s up to $3,200 of free government money every year, so if you want to install a heat pump this year and get free money and then install another one next year and get free money, the US government welcomes that ambition. (For a handy guide to the IRA’s consumer incentives, <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electrification/your-cheat-sheet-to-the-climate-laws-consumer-incentives">check out Canary Media’s cheat sheet</a>, and you can check your state’s rebate offers <a href="https://www.energy.gov/save">at the Department of Energy’s website</a>.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The list of tips for saving electricity in the long and short term goes on, and <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/do-it-yourself-savings-project-lower-water-heating-temperature">the Energy Star website is a great resource</a> if you’re interested in learning about them. If your life is even more electrified — if you <a href="https://advocacy.consumerreports.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Maintenance-Cost-White-Paper-9.24.20-1.pdf">drive an EV</a> or <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/guides/solar/savings-with-solar-panels/">have solar panels installed</a>, for instance — there are even more opportunities for savings. Many of these efforts require a significant upfront investment, though. <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/how-where-speak-out-climate-action">Reaching out to your local leaders</a> to see what can be done to connect more low-cost renewable energy sources to the grid, well, that’s free.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We’re presently in what appears to be the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/covid-us-largest-summer-wave-cdc-high-transmission-rcna165765">worst Covid-19 summer surge in several years</a>, especially in the southern US. According to data from the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/about/rt-estimates.html">Centers for Disease Control (CDC)</a>, all of the metrics related to Covid-19 that we should be worried about are going up — not just cases, but hospitalizations and deaths, too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even if we’re no longer in the depths of the pandemic, and we have treatments to lessen its severity and vaccines for protection, contracting Covid-19 carries risks. That’s particularly true for people over 65, people with comorbidities like heart or lung disease, or those who are immunocompromised. And the lingering health challenges of <a href="https://www.vox.com/coronavirus-covid19/2023/3/13/23627229/long-covid-science-symptoms-treatments">long Covid</a> remain a risk.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The good news is that on the whole, Americans are much better protected than we once were against serious illness, because most people have been infected, vaccinated, or both. However, it’s still important to take precautions as Covid-19 cases increase <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/about/rt-estimates.html">in most states across the US</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s what we know so far about the surge this year, and what you can do to keep yourself and your community healthy.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How do we know we’re in a summer surge?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Centers for Disease Control has found that cases are increasing or likely increasing in 32 states. This follows a seasonal pattern that’s begun to emerge with Covid. We saw a similar surge last summer, though according to CDC data, cases are <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home">exceeding levels from around this time last year</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It&#8217;s not just last summer — even when we were having the pandemic, if you look at the graphs, infection was always very high during the summer and also during the winter,” said <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/kizzmekia-s-corbett/">Kizzmekia Corbett-Helaire</a>, assistant professor of immunology and infectious diseases at Harvard’s School of Public Health.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We don’t know exactly why the summer surge happens, Corbett-Helaire said. Some of it could be due to the underlying characteristics of the virus, and some due to human behavior, like increased travel.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the moment, <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home">Covid hospitalizations and deaths</a> are rising but still relatively low — the latest data shows that 1.5 percent of deaths in the US are the result of Covid, and 2.3 percent of emergency room visits during the week ending August 3 were diagnosed as Covid-19.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">CDC data comes from a variety of sources. But one important source for tracking transmission rates is wastewater testing, which involves tracking the amount of virus in local sewage. Early in the pandemic, before at-home testing was accessible, data from clinical testing was used to track infection rates. Now, however, fewer Americans are testing and reporting their status, making test-based tracking unreliable.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That makes wastewater testing the best available metric for getting a timely picture of the presence of illness in a community, according to <a href="https://centerforhealthsecurity.org/who-we-are/our-people/amesh-adalja-md-fidsa">Amesh Adalja</a>, senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s kind of becoming the way of the future” and is being used to test for the presence of other illnesses, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/366903/mpox-monkeypox-africa-continental-emergency-drc-who-clade">including mpox</a>, he told Vox.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#wastewater-surveillance">the wastewater says</a> the US is in the midst of a surge approaching infection levels not seen since last winter, which was the worst increase since 2022.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the variants driving it? And how are they transmitted?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s no one variant of the virus that’s dominant right now — there’s a group of variants referred to as FLiRT, which come from the <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/what-to-know-about-covid-flirt-variants">JN.1 variant</a>. The <a href="https://www.today.com/health/coronavirus/new-covid-variant-flirt-name-meaning-rcna152650">name FLiRT</a> refers to the technical names for where the mutations that created this variant occurred; in this case, on the spike protein on the virus, which helps it connect to a cell and infect it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">LB.1, which has many similarities with the FLiRT variants, but has one additional mutation, is also circulating. LB.1 may be more transmissible than other dominant variants, but experts don’t know that for sure. And, as a CDC spokesperson told Vox, “there are no data at this time indicating that this variant causes more severe COVID-19.” The symptoms, the spokesperson said, are similar to that of other variants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to the <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-summary">latest CDC data</a> (from July 21 to August 3, 2024) LB.1 accounted for about 16 percent of US Covid cases. The FLiRT variants, meanwhile, represented more than half of all cases.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In terms of transmission, not much has changed, either — you can still get these strains of Covid from an infected person if you’re in close quarters with them, especially indoors in a crowded or poorly ventilated space. Masking and vaccination remain the best ways to prevent transmission.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>When are you contagious if you have Covid?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">FLiRT is no different from other variants when it comes to contagion — you are definitely contagious as long as you are testing positive on an at-home test.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You might be contagious one to two days before you have symptoms, though, <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/infections-diseases/covid-19#:~:text=People%20with%20COVID%2D19%20can,few%20days%20of%20symptom%20onset">and that’s when you tend to be most likely to infect others</a>. Sneezing, coughing, talking, singing, cheering, or breathing heavily (like you might during exercise) transmit the virus through aerosol particles, which can stay in a room and infect others even after you’ve departed.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>If I have Covid, what should I do?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Covid-positive people should isolate until at least 24 hours after their symptoms are improving and they no longer have a fever, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/guidance/faqs.html">according to the latest CDC guidance</a> (which applies to the flu and RSV as well).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But you may still be contagious even if you’re feeling better. So if you must break your isolation, it’s important to wear a mask that fits well (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/publicppe/community-ppe.html">ideally one like an N95 or KN95</a>), maintain distance from others, and ensure you’re in well-ventilated areas for at least the next five days.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Do boosters help protect against the latest variants?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Boosters can help prevent the spread of Covid, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/well/coronavirus-vaccine-booster.html">current boosters</a> are unlikely to be as effective against the latest variants. Current boosters were formulated to be effective against pre-JN.1 omicron variants, and the lastest mutations hadn’t happened yet when the inoculations now available were released. Still, you might consider getting one if you meet the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are 65 years of age and older</li>



<li>Are moderately or severely immunocompromised or have underlying medical conditions</li>



<li>Living in a long-term care facility</li>



<li>Have never received any doses of a Covid-19 vaccine</li>



<li>Are pregnant and have not received a 2023–2024 dose —&nbsp;especially those in late pregnancy</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The good news is a new formulation that targets the FLiRT variants should be available soon, in preparation for a likely winter surge. The CDC recommends that everyone ages 6 months and older receive an updated 2024–2025 Covid-19 vaccine when it is available this fall, though those vaccines haven’t been approved or authorized yet. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Again, while most Americans do have a baseline level of immunity against the virus, the new version of the vaccine will, at the very least, help prevent serious illness, hospitalization, and death, especially for vulnerable populations like the elderly and immunocompromised.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The CDC continuously updates its recommendations for boosting; <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html">the latest can be found on its website</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As for exactly how protective the new vaccine will be against infection, that’s impossible to know: “The last two updates have missed targets in terms of preventing infections, but we know they protect against serious disease and death,” Adalja said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even if the newest vaccines aren’t as effective as we hope, there are several tools available for the treatment of at-risk populations, including Paxlovid, and a monoclonal antibody called Pemgarda, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/clinical-care/outpatient-treatment.html#:~:text=Pemivibart%20(Pemgarda%E2%84%A2)%20is%20a,FDA%2Dauthorized%20conditions%20for%20use.">which can be used as a prophylactic for the severely immunocompromised</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Amid the surge, perhaps the most important thing to keep in mind is that Covid “is always going to be a threat,” Adalja said. “It’s an endemic respiratory illness that is part of the human condition.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This summer’s surge is making that very clear.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>This story is the second feature in a Vox special project,&nbsp;</em>Changing With Our Climate<em>, a limited-run series exploring Indigenous solutions to extreme weather rooted in history — and the future.</em> </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Silas Yamamoto’s favorite part of his job is starting fires.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a prescribed fire technician with the Karuk Tribe and the <a href="https://www.mkwc.org/">Mid Klamath Watershed Council</a> based in Happy Camp, a small town in Northern California, Yamamoto sets controlled burns — smaller, deliberate fires that can help prevent bigger wildfires, reduce habitat for invasive species, and improve plant and soil health. Yamamoto has been setting a lot of fires in his ancestral homelands and lately, he’s been traveling around the country to help set fires in other communities, too. The goal is to decolonize our relationship to wildfires, remove barriers to using good fire, and prepare us for a world more impacted by the effects of climate change.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But he’s still not burning nearly as often as he would like to.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Across the country, wildfires <a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/global-trends-forest-fires#:~:text=Using%20data%20from%20researchers%20at,year%20over%20that%20time%20period.">are getting worse</a>. In addition to the billions of dollars in damage from destroyed homes and infrastructure, these fires are increasingly deadly: Every year, wildfire smoke <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/04/18/1245068810/wildfire-smoke-contributes-to-thousands-of-deaths-each-year-in-the-u-s">contributes to thousands of deaths</a> in the US alone, not to mention other <a href="https://www.epa.gov/wildfire-smoke-course/health-effects-attributed-wildfire-smoke">health impacts</a> like reduced lung function and increased risk of <a href="https://aaic.alz.org/releases-2024/exposure-wildfire-smoke-raises-dementia-risk.asp">dementia</a>.<strong> </strong>And climate change makes extreme wildfires all the more likely as landscapes <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/report/spreading-wildfire-rising-threat-extraordinary-landscape-fires?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwiOy1BhDCARIsADGvQnBT5YUJwv7RW_kcUWMkwR9ohpBhffrHmWmKVIq37-GguASuKzozUQ8aAps0EALw_wcB">become warmer, drier, and more flammable</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of this means that understanding how to control wildfires is more important than ever.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Yamamoto, fire is a way of connecting with his tribal community and land, but he has bigger ambitions, too: He wants to organize major collaborative projects — between different states, sovereign Indigenous nations — that would spread fire across arbitrary property lines.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the barriers to effective fire management is the tangled web of property ownership across the country. Good fire mitigation techniques — like clearing flammable understory on corporate-owned land — aren’t as effective if the family land next door doesn’t do the same. To truly confront out-of-control wildfires and climate change, fire management will have to transcend those lines, which means understanding the land we live on as a shared responsibility, rather than a collection of individual properties.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Fire doesn’t recognize property lines, right?” Yamamoto said. “That’s a very human construction.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fire has always been a part of Yamamoto’s Karuk culture, but until recently, state and federal authorities saw all fires as bad — a force of nature to suppress, not live with. For decades, the US embraced a <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/about-agency/features/only-you">policy of fire suppression</a>, underscored by Smokey Bear’s “Only you can prevent forest fires” ads, that caused forests to become denser, and fires more frequent and powerful. Fire suppression in California, for example, undid generations of Indigenous land stewardship, which cultivated a landscape where fire, people, and plants could coexist. By lighting frequent, smaller fires, they created a sustainable cycle that cleared underbrush, regenerated plants and soils, and prevented the sort of “mega fires” we see today. But that stewardship was mercilessly extinguished in the 19th and 20th centuries: According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/16/california-wildfires-cultural-burns-indigenous-people">Bill Tripp</a>, the director of natural resources and environmental policy for the Karuk Tribe, up until the 1930s, Karuk people were shot by white settlers for starting fires.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“Fire doesn&#8217;t recognize property lines, right? That’s a very human construction.”</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today there’s been an important and encouraging <a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/fire/indigenous-fire-practices-shape-our-land.htm">shift</a> back toward more Indigenous burning practices. But even as Indigenous fire management finally begins to <a href="https://www.hcn.org/issues/55-1/indigenous-affairs-wildfire-what-if-indigenous-women-ran-controlled-burns/">gain more respect</a>, Indigenous fire practitioners are still limited by restrictive burning policies, land access, resources, and bureaucracy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We’re caught in a negative feedback loop of scarier and more destructive fires. Yamamoto believes we should be spreading fire — not suppressing it: That’s why Yamamoto is working to spread Indigenous fire culture to non-Native fire practitioners across the country and develop partnerships that can tackle these challenges together.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Prescribed fire isn’t going to be the one way that we’re going to be able to get out of this, it needs to be a variety of different factors,” Yamamoto said. “Whether or not we’re going to be able to start doing all of that before the whole forest burns down is something that’s on my mind.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>It’s not just fire —&nbsp;it’s healing</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When he was around 10 years old, Yamamoto’s mother started taking him to burn bear grass for regalia and baskets. Those more positive experiences shaped the way he thinks about fire just as much as the negative impacts he has seen. “It’s always been a part of our culture,” Yamamoto said. “Always has been, always will be, but folks outside of it are just now starting to realize the importance of it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2020, Silas Yamamoto’s family home burned down in the Slater fire, a devastating blaze that destroyed over 100 homes in his hometown of Happy Camp, California. The Slater fire was part of a <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/climate/news/californias-2020-wildfire-season-numbers">record-breaking fire season</a> in California that saw thousands of fires burn millions of acres across the state, leading to dozens of deaths and billions in damage.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yamamoto and his parents were forced to live out of a hotel room for over a month. After Red Cross money for the hotel ran out, they moved to a rental trailer that he says was way too small for three adults and their dogs. Yamamoto eventually moved out, renting a room from a local family. Yamamoto’s parents are still living in a trailer and have considered leaving the area completely. “It’s hard to live in an area that used to be so lush and green and beautiful that is now brush and standing matchsticks that will burn in the future,” he said. “It’s going to burn in the future. It’s just when.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These days, Yamamoto is constantly juggling a busy schedule — traveling across the country or quickly shifting gears from a meeting with Cal Fire to helping out with an <a href="https://www.hcn.org/issues/55-1/indigenous-affairs-wildfire-what-if-indigenous-women-ran-controlled-burns/">Indigenous Women-in-Fire Training Exchange</a> program or heading out on fire assignment somewhere in state.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Starting this fall, with funding from the US Fish and Wildlife Service, Yamamoto plans to lead a crew dedicated to prescribed burns in California, but they will also travel three months out of the year, learning from communities across the country. Yamamoto also hopes that his crew can bring an Indigenous perspective of cultural fire to areas that may be comfortable with fire but less familiar with an Indigenous approach to it. As fire risk and intensity increases, this kind of collaborative approach may be the key to surviving a more fiery world.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Fire is just a part of the natural order of things, and if you remove that for long periods of time, you get these devastating mega fires where absolutely everything is burned up,” Yamamoto said. “You can’t fight nature, and it’s pointless to try to fight something that we don’t fully control.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although fire has always been a part of Yamamoto’s life, Indigenous-controlled burns have <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/about-agency/features/tribal-and-indigenous-fire-tradition">steadily gained </a><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/12/3/new-california-law-affirms-indigenous-right-to-controlled-burns">wider acknowledgment</a> in recent years. These practices work because they embrace the beneficial role that fire can have on plants and land. Prescribed burning can clear the landscape of fuels that might lead to larger and less controllable wildfires. Fire can also help <a href="https://www.uow.edu.au/media/2024/research-shows-indigenous-cultural-burning-promotes-soil-health-ecosystem.php">soil health</a> and <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecs2.3851">seed germination</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Indigenous fire has long been about more than just reducing the risk of a destructive wildfire.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/ACullen_Happy-Camp-wildfires_07.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,32.549738219895,100,34.900523560209" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Silas Yamamoto poses for a portrait at the property where his mother and stepfather live in Happy Camp, California. Some of the family’s property and belongings burned during the Slater fire in 2020. | Andrew Cullen" data-portal-copyright="Andrew Cullen" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s not just fire,” said <a href="https://geog.ku.edu/people/melinda-adams">Melinda Adams</a>, a member of the N’dee San Carlos Apache Tribe and an assistant professor at the University of Kansas. Adams’s research focuses on cultural fire, particularly in California and the Midwest. “It’s healing a lot of trauma that our peoples went through, and healing the landscapes that have also gone through degradation and trauma.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Indigenous people, cultural and community fire has always been a way of building a relationship with land and each other. “Not only are you tending to that space with fire, but then you&#8217;re coming back in and utilizing and having a relationship with that space because of the fire stewardship,” said <a href="https://www.csuchico.edu/geop/department/dhankins.shtml">Don Hankins</a>, a Miwkoʔ (Miwok) traditional cultural practitioner and a professor of geography and planning at California State University, Chico.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As climate change continues to threaten our way of life, Hankins says that these relationships will become even more essential. If you understand the land and the fact that you cannot control it, you are more likely to find ways of adapting to it, rather than trying to force it to adapt to you. Hankins says that Indigenous people have always embraced this kind of evolution, responding to different conditions in the climate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So even as climate change and the legacy of fire suppression present new challenges, he believes Indigenous ways of thinking are ready to meet the moment. But that means that policymakers need to start listening to Indigenous people more.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hankins is working to push for changes like recognizing the role of Indigenous stewardship and prescribed burning under the National Environmental Policy Act, the law that requires federal agencies to assess the environmental impacts of their actions, and the Endangered Species Act and Clean Air Act. These changes could make more space for Indigenous fire management, and pave the way for more resources and freedom for Indigenous fire practitioners.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One idea that Yamamoto is especially keen to get moving is cross-boundary burns. The Forest Service, for example, might start a burn on federal land that continues onto private land, where a partner organization like the Mid Klamath Watershed Council can take it over. But developing processes and systems to coordinate those projects requires a level of collaboration that is unfamiliar to some partners more used to operating on their own.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As land co-management agreements pop up between tribes and government agencies, Indigenous experts stress that while these partnerships are a good step, they only work if tribes are not treated as junior partners. “We will never achieve what we need to do at scale until everybody’s participating together,” Don Hankins said. “I think that’s a really important thing, but it has to be Indigenous-led.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To ensure that happens, Hankins, Yamamoto, and others are working to find the kind of scientific evidence that policymakers might find more convincing than generations of successful Indigenous stewardship. To do that successfully, Indigenous experts say a mindset shift is needed just as much as a policy shift.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There’s definitely a lot of education that needs to happen with the public understanding the importance of Indigenous knowledges and not just conceptualizing them as a trope or as something that’s in the past,” Melinda Adams said. “This is something that’s going to save our planet.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How do you solve a problem like <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf"><em>Trump v. United States</em></a>?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Supreme Court’s recent opinion in <em>Trump</em>, which held that presidents have <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship">sweeping immunity from criminal prosecution</a> for any official act — even something like ordering the Justice Department to round up and arrest their political foes — is such an unimaginable betrayal of the justices’ oath to “<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/453#:~:text=Each%20justice%20or%20judge%20of,that%20I%20will%20faithfully%20and">administer justice without respect to persons</a>” that it casts a shadow over every decision these justices have ever handed down.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s like if you learned that your daughter’s third-grade teacher gave her cocaine. Some acts of betrayal are so profound that they shatter your ability to trust someone again and cause you to rethink every single thing they’ve done in the past — even the good things.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Under the <em>Trump </em>decision<em>, </em>a president who took advantage of the powers that decision grants would be the type of dictator the United States’ political structure is meant to guard against — a leader fully incompatible with the idea of constitutional democracy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That easily makes <em>Trump</em> the worst decision the Roberts Court has ever handed down, but it is only the latest in a series of decisions that weaken our democracy and our Constitution. In the few years since former President Donald Trump remade the Supreme Court, the Court’s new majority has allowed states to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/7/25/23277211/supreme-court-gavin-newsom-sb-8-abortion-guns-california-assault-rifle-law">nullify entire constitutional rights</a>. They’ve claimed so much power that they now effectively <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/23791610/supreme-court-major-questions-doctrine-nebraska-biden-student-loans-gorsuch-barrett">control both the judiciary and most of the executive branch</a> — they’ve literally <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/357900/supreme-court-loper-bright-raimondo-chevron-power-grab">given themselves a veto power</a> over any regulatory decision made by a federal agency — of the federal government. And as they’ve done so, they’ve thrown lower courts into chaos by <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/356267/supreme-court-us-rahimi-domestic-abuse-guns-second-amendmen">creating nonsensical new legal standards</a> judges across the nation have struggled to follow. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Worse, only one of America’s two major political parties appears to have a problem with how the Supreme Court is reshaping America’s institutions. While Republicans have mostly cheered the Court’s actions, top Democrats have proposed several solutions to the legal mess the Court has created.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the wake of the uniquely awful <em>Trump </em>decision, President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/363557/supreme-court-biden-kamala-harris-reform-term-limits-ethics">proposed a constitutional amendment to eradicate <em>Trump</em></a>, along with separate proposals for term limits and a binding code of ethics for the justices. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), meanwhile, wants to use a rarely invoked congressional power known as “<a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/364438/supreme-court-chuck-schumer-trump-immunity">jurisdiction stripping</a>” to neutralize Trump’s immunity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Realistically, however, none of these ideas are likely to rein in the Court because they are unlikely to ever become fully enforceable law. Amending the Constitution is <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/364438/supreme-court-chuck-schumer-trump-immunity">virtually impossible</a>, and it is literally impossible if either major political party opposes an amendment. Even if some of these reforms can be enacted through ordinary legislation, moreover, the Court’s Republican majority would probably just strike them down anyway.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another solution is court-packing — adding seats to the Supreme Court to relegate the Court’s Republicans to the minority. This idea has the virtue of being constitutional — the Court has had <a href="https://www.vox.com/23186373/supreme-court-packing-roe-wade-voting-rights-jurisdiction-stripping">as few as five seats and as many as 10 in the past</a> — and it could be done at any time through ordinary legislation. But it also comes with enormous risks. Packing the Court would almost certainly <a href="https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/51/lets-think-about-court-packing-2/">destroy the legitimacy of the federal judiciary</a> in the eyes of many Republicans and would lead to massive resistance from red states. It’s also unlikely to happen unless Democrats win massive majorities in Congress; even at the height of his popularity, President Franklin Roosevelt <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/10/30/20930662/pete-buttigieg-court-packing-anthony-kennedy-citizens-united">struggled to sell a court-packing plan</a> after the Court tried to sabotage the New Deal.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet, as the Republican Party has shown with its own successful takeover of the Court, there are steps that Democrats — and supporters of constitutional democracy more broadly — can take now to start undermining this Court’s worst decisions. The Republican takeover of the federal judiciary, and the <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/7/8/23784320/supreme-court-2022-term-affirmative-action-religion-voting-rights-abortion">rush of decisions overruling seminal Supreme Court precedents</a> that quickly followed, was the culmination of decades of organizing, fixating on decisions that Republicans wanted to see overruled, campaigning against those decisions as illegitimate, and identifying candidates for judicial office who could be counted on to overrule those decisions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Roe v. Wade</em>, for example, fell because the Republican Party unified around treating <em>Roe </em>as illegitimate. State lawmakers <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/6/25/23182753/roe-overturned-abortion-access-reproductive-rights-trigger-laws">routinely passed legislation defying it</a>, and forced the courts to strike that legislation down. These legal fights, in turn, reinforced the Republican Party’s identity as the anti-abortion party and reminded voters who oppose abortion that the way to end <em>Roe</em> was to vote for the GOP.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similar things can be said about other Supreme Court precedents which until recently were good law, including the Court’s affirmative action decision in <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/438/265/"><em>Regents of the University of California v. Bakke</em></a> (1978), its <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/12/2/21726876/supreme-court-religious-liberty-revolutionary-roman-catholic-diocese-cuomo-amy-coney-barrett">mostly overruled</a> decision establishing that religious conservatives have to follow the same laws as everyone else in <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/494/872/"><em>Employment Division v. Smith</em></a> (1990), its church/state separation decision in <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/403/602/"><em>Lemon v. Kurtzman</em></a> (1971), and its decision limiting the scope of the Court’s policymaking authority in <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/467/837/"><em>Chevron v. National Resources Defense Council</em></a> (1984).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In all of these cases, the basic pattern is the same. Republicans — whether at the grassroots level or through elite <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/5/2/23706535/supreme-court-chevron-deference-loper-bright-raimondo">groups like the Federalist Society</a> — identified the cases they wanted to destroy. They united in opposition to them. They appointed justices who would loyally follow the GOP’s judicial agenda. And then they won.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is a playbook those concerned about the current Court’s anti-democratic tendencies can follow, but it also requires them to unite much like Republicans did. Before they can get to that point, Democrats, and others concerned about the Court’s actions, need to reach a consensus about which of the Court’s decisions deserve the same treatment that the GOP gave to <em>Roe</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Several recent Supreme Court decisions arguably belong on this list of irredeemable decisions, but I would like to propose four. These four cases<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/12/14/22832257/supreme-court-gavin-newsom-abortion-guns-assault-weapons">undermine the very concept of a written constitution</a>. They <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/6/30/23779903/supreme-court-student-loan-biden-nebraska-john-roberts">centralize power in an unelected judiciary</a>. They are <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/356267/supreme-court-us-rahimi-domestic-abuse-guns-second-amendmen">so incompetently drafted</a> that even sitting judges complain that they are unworkable. And they <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship">invite rule by gangsters and thugs</a>. In short, all of them are fundamentally incompatible with constitutional democracy.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Trump v. United States</em></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf"><em>Trump v. United States</em></a> (2024) is the rare Supreme Court decision that grows more alarming as you dig deeper into the nuance of the decision.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The six Republican justices held that Trump, a man who <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/6/10/23162442/january-6-committee-hearing-june-10-trump-fascist">literally tried to overthrow the duly elected government of the United States</a>, had broad freedom to commit crimes while he was in office and that he would also be free to violate criminal laws if he returned to the White House. The Court’s holding that presidents may use their official powers to commit crimes has no basis in constitutional text or American legal tradition, and it’s hard to imagine a decision more incompatible with the idea that the United States is a democratic nation governed by the rule of law.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <em>Trump</em> decision breaks down presidential actions into three categories and gives <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship">different levels of immunity to each</a>. The most important thing to understand about the opinion, however, is that it places some of the most authoritarian actions a president could possibly take in the category with the highest level of immunity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Republican justices held that when the president exercises authority vested exclusively in them by “the Constitution itself,” they may do so even if those actions are “incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress” — including an Act of Congress declaring such actions to be criminal. Similarly, the Republican justices concluded that “the courts have ‘no power to control [the President’s] discretion’ when he acts pursuant to the powers invested exclusively in him by the Constitution.” So a court cannot try a president who commits a crime while exercising these powers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One reason why this decision is so alarming is that the Constitution states that “the President <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii">shall be commander in chief</a> of the Army and Navy of the United States.” As Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned in dissent, “when [the president] uses his official powers in any way, under the majority’s reasoning, he now will be insulated from criminal prosecution. <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf">Orders the Navy’s Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune</a>. Organizes a military coup to hold onto power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune. Immune, immune, immune.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In fairness, the majority opinion did not explicitly state that Trump could order Navy SEALs to assassinate his rivals — it only implied it — but it rather explicitly says that Trump could have ordered the Justice Department to round up and arrest those rivals. “Investigation and prosecutorial decisionmaking is ‘the special province of the Executive Branch,’” the Republican justices conclude, adding that “the Constitution vests the entirety of the executive power in the President.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, the Republican justices went even further, holding that Trump could not be prosecuted even if he ordered the Justice Department to act based on “shams” or “for an improper purpose.” Under <em>Trump</em>, that type of behavior does “not divest the President of exclusive authority over the investigative and prosecutorial functions of the Justice Department and its officials.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Republican justices’ decision does not even attempt to make the case that presidential immunity can be found anywhere in the Constitution. Instead, the opinion is rooted in the GOP justices’ policy judgment that the president should not be chilled from taking “bold and unhesitating action” by “<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf">the threat of trial, judgment, and imprisonment</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of this is why the <em>Trump </em>immunity decision is one of the most reckless decisions ever handed down by a court of the United States. It strongly suggests that a president can have their rivals killed, and it explicitly permits a president to round up their enemies and prosecute them on fabricated charges. And it does all of this in response to the prosecution against a former president who tried to illegally remain in office after he lost his bid for reelection.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Whole Woman’s Health v. Jackson</em></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21-463_3ebh.pdf"><em>Whole Woman’s Health v. Jackson</em></a> (2021) established that any state can neutralize literally any constitutional right, simply by writing a law that is enforced solely by private bounty hunters.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the law at issue in <em>Jackson</em>, a Texas law known as SB 8, targeted abortion rights, <em>Jackson</em>’s reasoning <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/7/25/23277211/supreme-court-gavin-newsom-sb-8-abortion-guns-california-assault-rifle-law">would apply equally</a> to a law allowing bounty hunters target anyone who criticizes a state governor, or that sics these bounty hunters on any Black family that sends their child to a majority-white public school.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Like the <em>Trump</em> immunity decision, <em>Jackson</em> is incompatible with constitutional democracy and must be overruled.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To understand <em>Jackson</em>, it’s important to first understand the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/8/31/22650303/supreme-court-abortion-texas-sb8-jackson-roe-wade-greg-abbott">Rube Goldberg-like mechanism</a> that SB 8 uses to ban nearly all abortions in the state of Texas. In <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-supreme-court/209/123.html"><em>Ex parte Young</em></a> (1908), the Supreme Court established that a plaintiff alleging that a state law is unconstitutional should sue the state officer charged with enforcing that law. So, for example, if Texas had passed a law requiring state troopers to blockade abortion clinics, a plaintiff might sue the chief of the state’s police force.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">SB 8, however, provides that this anti-abortion law “<a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB8/2021">shall be enforced exclusively through … private civil actions</a>.” It provides that “any person, other than an officer or employee of a state or local governmental entity in this state” may bring a lawsuit against anyone who performs an abortion after the sixth week of pregnancy. Plaintiffs who prevail collect a bounty of at least $10,000 from the abortion provider, and there is no cap on the size of this bounty.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thus, the law sought to make an end run around <em>Young</em> by preventing state officials from directly enforcing the law. And five of the Supreme Court’s six Republicans signed onto this gambit, prohibiting anyone from filing a federal lawsuit seeking to block the law.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Roberts, the only Republican to dissent in <em>Jackson</em>, said of the Texas law, “the clear purpose and actual effect of S. B. 8 has been to nullify this Court’s rulings” in <em>Roe</em> and <em>Casey</em> (<em>Jackson</em> was decided several months before the Supreme Court overruled those decisions). <em>Jackson</em> established that a state can effectively immunize an unconstitutional law from federal judicial review simply by using bounty hunters to enforce it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In fairness, <em>Jackson</em> does allow someone who has already been sued by a bounty hunter to argue in that lawsuit that SB 8 is unconstitutional and that the suit should be shut down. But this remedy is meaningless because SB 8 also places no limit on the number of suits that could be filed against any one individual. A single person who is suspected of performing an abortion in Texas could potentially be hit by thousands of lawsuits. Even if they win all of them, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/7/25/23277211/supreme-court-gavin-newsom-sb-8-abortion-guns-california-assault-rifle-law">their legal bills would bankrupt them</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And, again, nothing in <em>Jackson</em> prevents other states from enacting SB 8-style laws to nullify any other constitutional right.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Jackson</em>, in other words, must be overruled because it is fundamentally hostile to the idea that states must respect the constitutional rights of individuals.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Biden v. Nebraska</em></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/22-506_nmip.pdf"><em>Biden v. Nebraska</em></a><em> </em>(2023) involved a significant policy dispute between the Democratic and Republican parties. The Biden administration announced a new policy that would have <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/6/30/23779903/supreme-court-student-loan-biden-nebraska-john-roberts">forgiven at least $10,000 worth of student loans for most borrowers</a>. Republicans almost universally opposed this policy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Reasonable people can disagree about who was right about the wisdom of this policy. But there’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/6/30/23779903/supreme-court-student-loan-biden-nebraska-john-roberts">no plausible argument</a> that the Biden administration’s policy was illegal. The loan forgiveness policy was authorized by a federal law known as the <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-117/pdf/STATUTE-117-Pg904.pdf#page=1">Heroes Act</a>, which gives the US secretary of education the power to forgive student loans during a national crisis.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet, despite unambiguous statutory authorization, the six Republican justices decided to implement their party’s preferred student loan policy from the bench.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Under the <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-117/pdf/STATUTE-117-Pg904.pdf#page=1">Heroes Act</a>, the education secretary has broad authority to “waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision applicable to the student financial assistance programs &#8230; as the Secretary deems necessary in connection with a war or other military operation or national emergency.” The Biden administration’s student loan program was one of many financial relief programs tied to the Covid-19 pandemic. Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/02/10/notice-on-the-continuation-of-the-national-emergency-concerning-the-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-pandemic-3/">declared the pandemic a national emergency in 2020</a>, and Biden left his declaration in place until mid-2023.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Several other provisions of the law, moreover, should have removed any doubt that the Secretary of Education, and not the Supreme Court, got to decide whether to forgive loans during the Covid pandemic.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Among other things, the Heroes Act waives a lengthy process known as “notice and comment” that federal agencies normally must undergo before changing a federal policy — allowing officials to prioritize quick and decisive action over following normal procedural rules. The law also provides that the secretary may dole out student loan relief <em>en masse</em> (“the Secretary is not required to exercise the waiver or modification authority under this section on a case-by-case basis”). And the law even contained a provision instructing courts not to interpret other federal statutes to limit the secretary’s authority unless that statute was “enacted with specific reference to” the Heroes Act.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thus, even if the Republican justices had been able to point to a statute that explicitly forbids the very same loan forgiveness program created by the Biden administration, courts were still required to uphold that program unless this hypothetical statute specifically stated that it overrides the Heroes Act.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet, all six Republican justices <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/6/30/23779903/supreme-court-student-loan-biden-nebraska-john-roberts">reached the implausible conclusion</a> that the Heroes Act did not authorize the Biden administration’s student loan forgiveness program.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps recognizing that their statutory argument is weak, the same six Republicans also claimed that the program violates something called the “<a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/23791610/supreme-court-major-questions-doctrine-nebraska-biden-student-loans-gorsuch-barrett">major questions doctrine</a>,” a doctrine that was recently invented by the Supreme Court, and that calls for courts to treat significant policy decisions by federal agencies with skepticism, unless that decision is unambiguously authorized by Congress. As the Court has described this doctrine, “<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/12-1146.pdf">we expect Congress to speak clearly</a> if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast ‘economic and political significance.’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But, even setting aside the fact that the major questions doctrine <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/23791610/supreme-court-major-questions-doctrine-nebraska-biden-student-loans-gorsuch-barrett">appears nowhere in the Constitution or in any federal statute</a>, Congress spoke clearly when it enacted the Heroes Act. It gave the secretary broad authority. It waived procedural constraints on the secretary. It explicitly gave the secretary power to dole out relief to many borrowers at a time. And it forbade courts from reading any federal statute to limit the secretary’s authority unless that statute specifically mentioned the Heroes Act.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Republican justices, in other words, claimed the power to override both elected branches of government, even when no law or constitutional provision authorizes them to do so. That realignment of power — like the ones seen in <em>Trump</em> and <em>Jackson</em> — is not compatible with the American system of constitutional democracy.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><em>New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association v. Bruen</em></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At least on the surface, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-843_7j80.pdf"><em>New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association v. Bruen</em></a> (2022), a Second Amendment decision that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/6/23/23180205/supreme-court-new-york-rifle-pistol-clarence-thomas-second-amendment-guns">cast a cloud of uncertainty over every single gun law in the United States</a>, has a greater claim to legitimacy than the other cases on this list. Unlike, say, the major questions doctrine, the Second Amendment is a real thing that actually can be found somewhere in the Constitution.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But <em>Bruen</em> is also a showcase of the Roberts Court’s arrogance and incompetence. The New York State gun law struck down by <em>Bruen</em>, which limited who could carry a gun in public, was <a href="https://www.vox.com/22745312/supreme-court-guns-second-amendment-nyc-bruen">108 years old</a> when it reached the Supreme Court. So, for more than a century, no court took issue with this law until the current crop of Republican justices suddenly claimed that they’d found a constitutional problem with it that every other judge in the last century had somehow missed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Republican justices’ decision in <em>Bruen</em>, moreover, is an unworkable mess. One federal judge, a Trump appointee, complained that “the Supreme Court has <a href="https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-love-206">created mountains of work for district courts</a> that must now deal with <em>Bruen</em>-related arguments in nearly every criminal case in which a firearm is found.” Another judge wrote that <em>Bruen</em> is “<a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23863670/reeves-order.pdf">filled with methodological flaws</a>.” In a 2024 opinion criticizing <em>Bruen</em>, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson quoted a dozen lower court opinions <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/356267/supreme-court-us-rahimi-domestic-abuse-guns-second-amendmen">begging the Court to tell them how <em>Bruen</em> is supposed to work</a>. One of them warns that “courts, operating in good faith, are <a href="https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/22/22-60596-CR0.pdf">struggling at every stage of the <em>Bruen</em> inquiry</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Briefly, <em>Bruen</em> held that all gun laws are unconstitutional unless the government can “demonstrate that the regulation is consistent with this Nation’s <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-843_7j80.pdf">historical tradition of firearm regulation</a>.” As the lower courts’ confusion shows, no one seems to know what the hell that means.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Bruen</em> also casts special scorn on gun laws that seek to address “a general societal problem that has persisted since the 18th century” — like murder — if 18th-century lawmakers did not seek to solve that problem in the same way as modern-day legislatures.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Almost immediately after <em>Bruen</em> was decided, a federal appeals court declared, in <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/united-states-v-rahimi/"><em>United States v. Rahimi</em></a>, that a federal law prohibiting people subject to domestic violence restraining orders from possessing guns is unconstitutional. And the most astounding thing about this lower court decision is that <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/10/24/23914235/supreme-court-domestic-violence-abusers-gun-policy-us-rahimi">it was correctly decided under <em>Bruen</em></a>. Domestic violence, after all, existed in the 18th century. But no state made it a crime for a married person to beat their own spouse until 1871.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To its credit, the Supreme Court recognized in the <em>Rahimi</em> case that allowing people who are a violent threat to their own romantic partners to arm themselves is untenable, and it upheld the federal law at issue in that case. But <em>Rahimi </em>did nothing to clarify the incomprehensible legal rule announced in <em>Bruen</em>. Now, under <em>Rahimi</em>, “a court must ascertain whether the new law is <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/356267/supreme-court-us-rahimi-domestic-abuse-guns-second-amendmen">‘relevantly similar’ to laws that our tradition is understood to permit</a>” — again, whatever the hell that means.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This whole saga exposes a Republican Supreme Court majority that is <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/359206/supreme-court-incompetent-abortion-trump-immunity">simply terrible at their jobs</a>. Set aside the policy question of how much gun regulation should exist in the United States. The core job of the Supreme Court is to articulate legal rules that can be consistently applied by all of the thousands of judges in the United States. Yet, in <em>Bruen</em>, they failed at that task so miserably that judges from across the political spectrum complained that they simply could not figure out how <em>Bruen </em>is supposed to operate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And then, when confronted with those complaints, the Court doubled down on its vague appeal to “tradition” that no one can figure out.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The uncertain case of <em>Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization</em></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Having identified four of the least defensible decisions handed down by the Court’s current Republican majority, allow me to finish this essay by saying something controversial: I am unsure whether <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf"><em>Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization</em></a> (2022), the decision overruling <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, belongs on the list of cases that are fundamentally hostile to constitutional democracy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I say this, not because <em>Dobbs</em> was correctly decided, and not because I have a wavering commitment to abortion rights. Rather, I say it because <em>Dobbs</em> revealed an unfortunate truth about all constitutional rights. A Supreme Court decision protecting a particular right — whether it is the right to abortion, the <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/365418/supreme-court-first-amendment-donald-trump-thomas-alito-gorsuch">right to free speech</a>, or any other right — is only worth something as long as there are five justices who will uphold that decision. Once that majority is lost, the right disappears.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Worse, while a precedent like <em>Roe v. Wade</em> cannot protect abortion patients from the whims of the Supreme Court, it can lull them into a sense of false security.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One lesson we’ve learned since <em>Dobbs</em> is that the right to have an abortion <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/fact-sheet/public-opinion-on-abortion/">enjoys overwhelming majority support</a> among US voters, even in some very red states. Fifty-nine percent of <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23290714/kansas-abortion-referendum-primary-turnout-charts">Kansas voters decided to keep abortion legal</a> in a 2022 referendum. Abortion rights <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/11/8/23952090/ohio-election-results-issue-1-abortion-virginia-kentucky-roe-dobbs">won by a 13-point margin in red Ohio</a>. In Gov. Ron DeSantis’s Florida, a new abortion rights ballot measure appears to be cruising to victory — a recent poll found that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/20/arizona-florida-could-send-big-message-abortion-rights/">60 percent of Floridians</a> believe that the right to an abortion should be written explicitly into the state’s constitution. Only 20 percent oppose that position.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet, when <em>Roe</em> was still good law, many voters who support the right to choose nonetheless voted for Republicans like Donald Trump, who appointed three members of the <em>Dobbs</em> majority to the Supreme Court. <em>Roe</em> convinced many of these voters that abortion rights were safe, even though Republicans <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/whole-womans-health-v-cole/">only needed to replace one member</a> of the Court’s pro-abortion majority to eliminate <em>Roe</em> on the day that Trump was elected.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If two members of the <em>Dobbs</em> majority leave the Court tomorrow, to be immediately replaced by Biden appointees, then I would support overruling <em>Dobbs</em>. Among other things, such a decision would end the suffering of women who are being <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/3/12/23631278/supreme-court-abortion-texas-medically-necessary-sepsis-zurawski">forced to wait until their lives are in danger</a> before their red-state doctors are willing to risk jail time by terminating their pregnancy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But, realistically, clawing back the Court’s Republican majority will probably take years, or even decades. By that point, abortion may once again be legal throughout the United States — either because of state-by-state campaigns like the Ohio ballot initiative or because <a href="https://www.vox.com/20930358/codify-roe-wade-womens-health-protection-act-supreme-court-nancy-pelosi-democrats">Congress enacts legislation legalizing abortion in all 50 states</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In that world, it is far from clear that overruling <em>Dobbs</em> would help the cause of abortion rights. Again, as <em>Dobbs</em> itself shows, a Supreme Court precedent is a weak guarantor of fundamental rights. And, as Trump’s election shows, a Supreme Court decision protecting abortion rights can fool voters into thinking that it is safe to elect anti-abortion candidates.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Leaving <em>Dobbs</em> on the books, by contrast, could lead to a durable electoral majority that will lock out of power any party that attempts to take away the right to reproductive freedom. That’s a far more powerful safeguard against abortion bans than some rinky-dink court decision.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In any event, there is no need to resolve this question of whether <em>Dobbs</em> belongs on the same roll of dishonor as <em>Trump</em> or <em>Bruen</em> today. We will know a great deal more about how <em>Dobbs</em> has changed the political landscape after the 2024 election. And it is very likely that there will be several more elections before the Court’s current, Republican majority can be broken up.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Economic data released this week suggests inflation is continuing to cool, paving the way for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, which would relieve some of the pressure high borrowing costs put on consumers and businesses.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to the July Consumer Price Index (CPI) report released Wednesday, year-over-year inflation dipped to 2.9 percent overall, lower than any month since March 2021. The CPI captures the change in prices of representative goods and services purchased by consumers compared to the same month in the previous year and is considered a standard measure of inflation. Though the report found costs associated with <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/cpi-report-for-july-inflation-expected-to-rise-again-after-last-month-s-surprise-fall/card/child-care-costs-keep-rising-faster-than-overall-prices-4wnNJD91W3xygHPTPbbU">child care</a> and <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/cpi-report-for-july-inflation-expected-to-rise-again-after-last-month-s-surprise-fall/card/shelter-inflation-increase-disappointing-but-not-worrying-economists-say-UoGbmaBktFEPNbh6Jjyg">renting a home</a> continue to rise at a higher rate than prices overall, inflation has dropped significantly since its peak of 9.1 percent in June 2022, and it is now inching closer to the Fed’s 2 percent target rate. And if it were not for rental inflation, the overall inflation rate would be below that 2 percent target. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It follows another good day of data on Tuesday, when the latest Producer Price Index report, which measures the change in prices for goods and services sold by producers to retailers, indicated that wholesale inflation had also come down to 0.1 percent, on par with low pre-pandemic levels. High wholesale inflation can sometimes indicate that prices will rise for consumers because retailers have to recoup higher costs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These numbers suggest a better economy for consumers, but the overall picture certainly isn’t perfect. The US only added <a href="https://apnews.com/article/economy-recession-jobs-unemployment-c7f1985b1ab3a7b781920c2693cd0438">114,000 jobs</a> in July, below expectations of about 150,000, and unemployment rose to 4.3 percent — higher than any month since October 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These numbers are not in and of themselves a crisis: The unemployment rate is still relatively low, and the underperformance in hiring isn’t catastrophic, but both have been taken as signals that the US economy might be showing some cracks.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What low inflation means for the economy and interest rates</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This week’s news has many economists and finance experts arguing that the time has come for the US Federal Reserve — which sets interest rates, manages the money supply, and purchases assets as a steward of the US economy — should cut interest rates. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Today’s inflation data provides further support for aggressive Fed rate cuts beginning in September,” said Morningstar’s chief US economist Preston Caldwell.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">An interest rate cut would make it easier for consumers and businesses alike to pay off debt and borrow money. That could eventually improve hiring and lead to overall economic growth. But there’s some uncertainty about just how much a rate cut would help the overall economy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fed chair Jerome Powell has been making statements in the last month that left open the possibility the Fed will cut rates at its September 17 meeting without fully committing. “The overall sense of the committee … is that we&#8217;re getting closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to begin to dial back restriction. We&#8217;re not at the point yet,” he said on August 1. “We want to see more good data.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Caldwell said that Morningstar is projecting a 0.25 percent cut in September, rather than the 0.5 percent cut that other analysts are expecting.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The urgency of cutting rates has increased in recent weeks given the troubling job numbers as well as a <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/365271/stocks-dow-nasdaq-recession-us-economy-fed">brief global stock market meltdown</a> linked to trading activity in Japan. Both were seen as signs the economy could use a little stimulation. But even lower interest rates might not immediately relieve the existing pressures on the economy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is growing unease, among both financial analysts and consumers, that a recession is on the horizon. Caldwell said Morningstar is projecting a deceleration in economic activity in the next year. Some other analysts warn that the US economy could <a href="https://qz.com/ubs-ceo-sergio-ermotti-slowdown-1851621953">see a downturn</a> even without an official recession — which is defined as two straight quarters of negative economic growth. And there’s a question of how much Fed policy can actually avert that.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Consumer confidence also dipped in July, with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/14/heres-why-the-economy-feels-recession-like-for-many-americans.html">3 in 5 Americans</a> falsely believing the US is already in a recession in a recent survey by Affirm. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The fundamentals of the economy are still relatively strong. As Matt Colyar, an economist at Moody’s Analytics, <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/365271/stocks-dow-nasdaq-recession-us-economy-fed">recently told me</a>, households and businesses have handled their debt relatively well, and hiring has remained solid for much longer than most people anticipated. But it might take a while before individuals struggling with inflation or to find jobs in a tough market feel the relief they’re looking for.&nbsp;</p>

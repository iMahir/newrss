<p class="has-text-align-none">The Menendez brothers, Lyle, now 56, and Erik, now 53, probably never had an incestuous relationship. There has never been any evidence presented anywhere that they did, and in court, both have <a href="https://people.com/monsters-lyle-and-erik-menendez-fact-fiction-8718956">vehemently denied</a> a sexual relationship.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of this stops <em>Monsters</em>, the new Ryan Murphy-helmed Netflix drama about the brothers — who were convicted of murdering their powerful Hollywood parents, José and Kitty Menendez, in 1989 — from suggesting that they did.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The show is a spin-off of <em>Monster</em>, Murphy’s wildly popular series about Jeffrey Dahmer, another notorious killer whose trial in the 1990s scandalized Americans.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That series <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23375811/netflix-jeffrey-dahmer-monster-victims-controversy-backlash">drew significant backlash</a> from survivors for heavily fictionalizing the crimes committed by Dahmer. And any true crime fans who wanted <em>Monsters </em>to take steps forward from that controversy must be recoiling in disbelief at the direction Murphy has chosen to go instead — not only fictionalizing details, but almost certainly fabricating a relationship between the brothers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This portrait rests atop a depiction of the pair as greedy, entitled fortune hunters who coveted the $14 million estate of their father, a producer at RCA Records. Along the way, the drama suggests not only that Lyle&nbsp;(Nicholas Alexander Chavez)&nbsp;was a sociopath who used his brother’s affection to manipulate him, but that Erik (Cooper Koch) was a confused, closeted gay man — though, again, there is no evidence anywhere to suggest this.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The show does gain some complexity as Murphy and his longtime collaborator Ian Brennan (who also co-wrote <em>Monster</em>) begin to peel back years of emotional, physical, and sexual abuse the brothers <a href="https://youtu.be/GnFKUmVUwPo?t=304">say they endured</a> from their father and mother. The brothers have maintained for over three decades that abuse underpinned their crime.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But<em> Monsters</em>, with its slick, oversaturated ’80s filter, seedy tone, and obsession with wealth, mostly undermines the nuances of the notorious case at nearly every turn. It ultimately suggests that the pair made the whole thing up for sympathy — despite recently uncovered <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/menendez-brothers-await-decision-they-hope-will-free-them-48-hours/">compelling evidence</a> that suggests they were telling the truth all along.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the time of their convictions, the brothers and their defense were entirely culturally dismissed; it would have been hard to find anyone in the ’90s and early 2000s who didn’t believe the Menendez brothers were guilty.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rather than turn those assumptions on their head, Murphy’s approach in <em>Monsters</em> is to give them a new platform. It’s a tremendous, infuriating shame, because this case, and the way Americans understand and treat abuse victims at trial, particularly male abuse victims, is undergoing a slow public reckoning. Numerous other documentaries and <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alessadominguez/the-right-time-to-revisit-the-menendez-murders">articles</a> have offered a different, extremely belated, and revelatory take: What if they had been telling the truth?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To understand how much <em>Monsters</em> overlooks, and how much it distorts, it’s helpful to examine the facts of the Menendez brothers’ story.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The way the public saw the Menendez case in the ’90s was very different from how we see it now</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Media outlets have called <em>Monsters</em> “<a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/netflix-monsters-erik-lyle-menendez-show-ryan-murphy-rcna172337">irresponsible</a>” and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/review-monsters-sexualizes-the-menendez-bros-true-story.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vulture.com/article/review-monsters-sexualizes-the-menendez-bros-true-story.html">suggested that steamy scenes</a> between the brothers “blurs the lines between what’s ‘hot’ and what is absolutely inappropriate.” It’s also drawn <a href="https://people.com/monsters-controversy-explained-why-lyle-and-erik-menendez-call-it-a-lie-8717807">scathing criticism</a> from both brothers, and provoked <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/monsters-casts-comments-about-menendez-inaccuracies-incest-backlash/">defenses</a> from nearly every member of the main cast. In a statement <a href="https://x.com/TammiMenendez1/status/1836967482013229168">shared on X</a> by his wife, Erik Menendez called <em>Monsters</em> a “vile and appalling character portrayals of Lyle and me” — particularly of Lyle, who was the target of a “caricature” that was “rooted in blatant lies.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Murphy, for his part, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/ryan-murphy-defends-menendez-brothers-netflix-incest-storyline-1236154358/">rebutted</a> this in an interview with Entertainment Tonight, arguing that Erik had “issued a statement without having seen the show,” and that “60 to 65 percent of our show in the scripts and in the film … center around the abuse and what they claim happened to them.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many of the show’s depictions of the brothers are rooted in the actual coverage of the case from the 1990s. In a famous 1996 interview with both brothers, for example, Barbara Walters downplayed the pair’s allegations of abuse and instead <a href="https://youtu.be/LU6H8JOK0wM?t=1035">grilled Erik</a> about whether he was gay. Erik firmly denied it. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The prosecutor brought that up because I was sexually molested,” Erik replied, “and he felt in his own thinking that if I was sodomized by my father that I must have enjoyed it, and therefore I must be gay, and the people that are gay out there must be sexually molested or they wouldn’t be [gay].”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It was a trenchant summing-up of the prevailing cultural assumptions of the broadly anti-LGBTQ decade. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In fact, corroboration that there was abuse in the Menendez home has<strong> </strong>come from at least three family members, all of whom took the stand in the brothers’ first trials. One of them, a cousin, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/menendez-brothers-inside-the-notorious-case-48-hours/">witnessed</a> José repeatedly physically abuse the brothers, and claimed he saw José go to shower with the boys; two others <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-10-13-me-45197-story.html">claimed</a> that <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-08-19-me-25245-story.html">Erik and Lyle separately told them</a> about the abuse as a child. They each still stand by these claims and <a href="https://people.com/crime/menendez-brothers-cousin-who-testified-at-trial-says-she-still-believes-they-were-sexually-abused/">believe the brothers</a> today. In 2023, lawyers for the brothers announced the recent discovery of <a href="https://lamag.com/news/letter-calls-into-question-menendez-brothers-murder-conviction-attorneys-say">a letter</a> written by Erik Menendez eight months before the murders — a letter to a cousin in which he goes into harrowing detail about the ongoing abuse:</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I&#8217;ve been trying to avoid dad,” Erik writes in the letter. “It’s still happening Andy but it’s worse for me now. … Every night, I stay up thinking he might come in. … I’m afraid … He’s crazy. He’s warned me a hundred times about telling anyone, especially Lyle.” <strong> </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In their interview in the mid-1990s, Walters, apparently barely holding back an eye roll, called the brothers out on the “abuse excuse,” a phrase coined by lawyer<strong> </strong>Alan Dershowitz in <a href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/alan-m-dershowitz/the-abuse-excuse/">a 1994 book</a> and applied to this case by the prosecution in the Menendez brothers’ second trial. When she challenged Erik on why he was comfortable confessing to the murders to his therapist but not to the alleged years of sexual abuse, Erik explained, “Unless you’ve been molested, you can’t realize how hard it is to tell.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Because of shame?” Walters asked skeptically.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Because of shame,” Erik confirmed.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What actually happened in the Menendez brothers’ trials</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Arguably because of the compelling nature of the brothers’ abuse claims, their first trials — the two were initially tried separately — each ended in <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-01-29-mn-16587-story.html">deadlocked</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/29/us/the-other-menendez-trial-too-ends-with-the-jury-deadlocked.html">juries</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the main stumbling blocks in the first round of trials was whether or not to convict the pair of manslaughter or murder; in Lyle’s trial, the decision was <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/menendez-brothers-served-long-enough/26087/">split by gender</a>, with female jurors voting for the lesser charge and male jurors voting for murder.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the second trial, in which the brothers were tried together, however, a number of things changed. Judge Stanley Weisberg <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-04-18-mn-55958-story.html">disallowed</a> nearly all defense evidence related to the brothers’ abuse claims, including mental health experts and medical experts, as well as the “<a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-04-18-mn-55958-story.html">minutiae</a>” of evidence testifying to the abuse the brothers suffered in their daily lives, which wiped out a vast majority of the testimony on José’s controlling, temperamental, and physically violent behavior. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Both defense attorneys for the duo have <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/menendez-bros-attorney-speaks-out-case-amid-appeal">since stated</a> that given what we now know about the impact of long-term abuse on children, a manslaughter conviction, which would have carried a much lighter sentence, would have been more appropriate for both Lyle and Erik.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead, the brothers were convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life without parole.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now attorneys for the duo are hoping to use the new facts in the case to win their clients’ retrials.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Murphy’s depiction of the case undermines all abuse survivors</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Monsters</em> could well bring about another tidal shift against the brothers and their quest for a cultural reframing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Murphy has returned the Menendez brothers’ narrative to “an era when the prosecution built a narrative on a belief system that males were not sexually abused, and that males experienced rape trauma differently than women,” Erik Menendez wrote in the <a href="https://x.com/TammiMenendez1/status/1836967482013229168">statement</a> shared on X. “How demoralizing to know that one man with power can undermine decades of progress in shedding light on childhood trauma.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Erik Menendez is right. Ryan Murphy has compellingly depicted the trauma and repression of the queer closet in his musical film <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/22169687/the-prom-movie-netflix-review"><em>The Prom</em></a> as well as in <em>Dahmer</em> and an <em>American Crime Story</em> installment, <em>The Assassination of Gianni Versace</em>, which he executive produced. His ability to accurately depict the impact of lifelong abusive situations on the innocent, and even the guilty, isn’t in doubt.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Murphy has <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/ryan-murphy-defends-menendez-brothers-netflix-incest-storyline-1236154358/">claimed</a> that <em>Monsters</em>&nbsp;attempts a “<em>Rashomon</em> kind of approach,” referring to Akira Kurosawa’s famous film in which the story of a sexual assault is depicted from multiple conflicting points of view. He further argued that he had an obligation to the “storytellers” to include their perspectives.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s an incredibly disingenuous framing of the show Murphy made. It chooses to further victimize the Menendez brothers with a shocking and unfounded accusation, building the sibling incest narrative over the course of its nine episodes despite compelling evidence of&nbsp;extreme abuse at the hands of a parent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&nbsp;It’s not just an extremely irresponsible take on an extremely complicated case — it’s the most backward, regressive, and confounding approach Murphy could possibly have taken.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“[V]iolence against a child creates a hundred horrendous and silent crime scenes darkly shadowed behind glitter and glamor,” Erik wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He could easily have been describing <em>Monsters</em> itself.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The scenes from North Carolina are shocking: roads and bridges washed away. Houses ripped from their foundations. Entire towns reduced to mud and debris.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Thursday night, Hurricane Helene slammed Florida&nbsp;as a Category 4 storm with winds reaching 140 miles per hour.&nbsp;In coastal communities, Helene knocked down trees and power lines, and caused <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/09/28/helene-storm-surge-city-impact/">record storm surge</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet some of its most devastating impacts were farther inland as the storm moved across the Southeast. Even before the bulk of the storm arrived in North Carolina, Helene started dumping rain in southern Appalachia —&nbsp;and loads of it. Over the last several days some regions in western North Carolina recorded more than <a href="https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html?fbclid=IwY2xjawFnj-FleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHQqOqR_oagJDph7eil_N509txd3OqBKDRXp32EW-RoBFI7FQBsXg0QAghg_aem_P0uioRN-URPjEzaFxpwkmA">2.5 feet</a>.</p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We have biblical devastation through the county,” Ryan Cole, the assistant director of Buncombe County Emergency Services, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/v/UsLVoZt8WvSfqi4y/">said</a> in a press briefing Saturday afternoon. “We’ve had biblical flooding here.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Government officials have so far attributed more than <a href="https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2024/09/30/weather/hurricane-helene-recovery-cleanup-monday">100</a> deaths to Helene across six states, including Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina. That number is almost certain to rise. Hundreds of people are still unaccounted for, in part because millions of households have lost power and there are still widespread cell outages. Many roads are also inaccessible, making rescue operations challenging.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Stunned by the devastation, some residents <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/09/28/helene-flooding-carolinas-tennessee-destruction/">have compared</a> flooding in parts of North Carolina to the impacts from Hurricane Katrina, which made landfall in Louisiana in 2005. Katrina claimed more than 1,800 lives. The weeks to come may indeed reveal Helene as one of the deadliest US hurricanes in recent history.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Helene is also a brutal reminder that climate change — which can intensify hurricanes and flooding — costs human lives. Record-warm water in the Gulf of Mexico supercharged the storm and filled it with moisture. Plus, hot air in general holds more water. These dynamics provided the fuel that enabled Helene to become a deadly, super-wet storm.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And as Helene reveals, it’s not just coastal communities that are vulnerable. Asheville, North Carolina <a href="https://www.thenewlede.org/2022/08/dubbed-a-climate-haven-a-north-carolina-community-braces-itself/">has been dubbed a climate haven</a> — a refuge from the impacts of warming and its consequences. But in reality, few places are completely safe. </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/flooding.webp?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4613147178592,100,93.077370564282" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="The main street in Tarpon Springs, Florida inundated with water on September 27. | Joe Raedle/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Joe Raedle/Getty Images" />
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">1) How bad is the damage?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After developing in the Caribbean early last week, Helene strengthened quickly into a Category 4 storm by late Thursday, when it slammed into the Big Bend region of Florida. That’s the area where the panhandle meets the peninsula. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Helene broke storm surge records along Florida’s Gulf Coast, inundating coastal towns like Cedar Key with sand and seawater. It left <a href="https://x.com/VortixWx/status/1840740671667228942">homes in ruins</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Much of the worst damage was farther inland, in mountain regions of Georgia, Tennessee, and especially North Carolina, all of which are far less familiar with the threat of tropical storms than the Florida coast. The main problem was abundant, unceasing rain, which caused rivers to balloon in populated areas like Asheville.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Videos and images over the weekend showed much of Asheville’s River Arts District —&nbsp;which hugs the French Broad River, southwest of downtown —&nbsp;inundated with water. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">State officials <a href="https://drivenc.gov/">said</a> all roads in western North Carolina, including parts of Interstate 40, were closed and should only be used by emergency vehicles. In nearby Tennessee, meanwhile, more than a dozen bridges are closed and five of them “are completely gone,” the state’s Department of Transportation <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/v/keWHTMT8dia6dF6g/">said</a> Sunday.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Power outages and water shortages are also rampant across the Southeast. As of late Monday morning, more than 2 million people were without electricity across South Carolina, Georgia, North Carolina, Florida, and Virginia, according to <a href="http://poweroutage.us">PowerOutage.us</a>. Parts of western North Carolina are under a boil water advisory, due to a disruption in the public water supply. Emergency workers will deliver bottled water in Asheville on Monday afternoon.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">2) How much will the storm cost?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It will take weeks to get a full tally of all the damage, but Helene’s expansive swath of destruction has already put initial estimates in the billions of dollars. <a href="https://www.corelogic.com/press-releases/corelogic-hurricane-helene-wind-storm-surge-cause-an-initial-estimated-3-5-billion-in-insured-losses/">CoreLogic</a>, an analytics firm, put its initial damage tally between $3 and $5 billion in insured losses. <a href="https://www.theinsurer.com/news/moodys-analytics-says-helene-like-idalia-but-worse-with-cost-estimated-at-up-to-34bn/">Moody’s Analytics</a> expects a toll from $20 billion to $34 billion. <a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/hurricane/helene-aftermath-dozens-dead-historic-flooding-millions-without-power-amid-catastrophic-destruction/1697545">AccuWeather</a> is setting the price tag between $145 billion and $160 billion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These are all coarse initial estimates, but they give an indication of the magnitude of the devastation. The higher projections would put Helene in the top tier of costliest storms in the US. Hurricane Katrina, currently the most expensive weather disaster in US history, extracted about <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-20-633r">$170 billion from the economy</a>. <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/01/08/hurricane-harvey-was-years-costliest-us-disaster-125-billion-damages/">Hurricane Harvey</a> in 2017 wreaked $125 billion in havoc.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The dollar value, however, doesn’t tell the whole story. Damage estimates are typically based on insurance claims, but with rising premiums across the country, more homes and businesses are <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/06/23/americans-not-buying-homeowners-insurance/74144566007/">going without financial protection</a>. The insured value of a property doesn’t directly translate into suffering, either. A multi-million dollar coastal vacation home getting swept down a hillside will register as a higher loss on an insurance company’s balance sheet than a destroyed mobile home that’s the sole residence and store of wealth for a family.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">3) Why was flooding in North Carolina so extreme?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For one, Helene was gigantic —<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/09/26/hurricane-helene-storm-size-miles/">&nbsp;stretching more than 400 miles wide</a> —&nbsp;which means its impacts were felt far from the eye of the storm. Most hurricanes are around <a href="https://www.weather.gov/source/zhu/ZHU_Training_Page/tropical_stuff/hurricane_anatomy/hurricane_anatomy.html">300 miles in diameter</a>. Plus, it traveled over an exceptionally hot Gulf of Mexico. Hurricanes are fueled by evaporating hot water that sends columns of moisture up into the storm, so the unusual heat in the Gulf only further charged the storm.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even before Helene made landfall in Florida, bands of moisture from the hurricane, which was churning in the Gulf, were pulled into Appalachia. Satellite imagery showed almost the entire East Coast shrouded in cloud cover. That means that some regions were already starting to flood even before the bulk of Helene arrived.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Recent rainfall in these areas, especially the southern Appalachians, have left the grounds saturated and the river tributaries running high,” the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/communities-need-to-prepare-for-catastrophic-life-threatening-inland-flooding-from-helene-even-well">warned</a> last Wednesday. “Additional rainfall from Helene will exacerbate the existing flood risk.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This storm only added water to an already wet area. The areas surrounding Asheville are temperate rainforests, full of streams and rivers that run alongside human communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though we’re still in the initial phase of the fallout, Hurricane Helene’s destruction underscores that the destruction from a storm is not simply a function of wind speed and rain totals. It’s also influenced by the amount of people and property in harm’s way and how ready they are to face a disaster head-on.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">4) How does Helene compare to storms like Katrina and Harvey?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We know that Helene is already on course to join the ranks of the costliest storms in US history. What all those storms have in common is that they made landfall in the continental US at high intensities in populated areas: Harvey struck the Texas coast at <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/01/08/hurricane-harvey-was-years-costliest-us-disaster-125-billion-damages/">Category 4 strength</a>, Katrina rammed into Louisiana and Mississippi as a <a href="https://www.weather.gov/mob/katrina">Category 3 storm</a>, while Helene was a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/26/weather/video/landfall-hurricane-helene-storm-florida-john-berman-lcl-digvid">Category 4</a> when it hammered Florida’s Big Bend region.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/8/29/22647117/hurricane-ida-categories-explained">hurricane category ranking system</a> is mainly based on wind speed, while the most dangerous element of these storms is the sheer quantity of water in the form of rainfall and storm surge. All three of these storms caused extensive flooding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Their destruction also compounded on top of local vulnerabilities. Houston suffered intense flooding after Harvey because of the inordinate amount of rain it received, but also because the city is densely populated, relatively flat, and close to sea level. Sections of New Orleans sit below sea level and when Katrina struck, the city’s flood control infrastructure <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/orleans/how-nf.html">catastrophically failed</a>. Helene landed in Florida’s Big Bend region, which is still recovering <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/23850601/hurricane-idalia-florida-wind-forecast-storm-surge-flood-rapid-intensification">from the last major hurricane</a>, before moving further inland and dumping rain on regions that have much less experience and infrastructure to cope with extraordinary volumes of water.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2024/05/07/population-growth-in-most-states-lags-long-term-trends">growing number of people</a> are also living in areas most likely to get hammered by hurricanes, and these states are building more property and infrastructure to accommodate them. That means that when a storm does make landfall, it puts more people in danger and damages more homes, offices, roads, and power lines.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">5) What is the government doing to help?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before Helene made landfall, forecasters at NOAA put out a <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/communities-need-to-prepare-for-catastrophic-life-threatening-inland-flooding-from-helene-even-well">rare news release and blunt warning</a> about the storm’s impending damage. The agency said that the hurricane would cause “catastrophic, life-threatening inland flooding.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Evacuation orders were issued for <a href="https://www.readync.gov/stay-informed/evacuation-orders">parts of North Carolina</a>, <a href="https://www.tn.gov/tema/news/2024/9/28/flash-report--5-hurricane-helene.html">Tennessee</a>, and <a href="https://www.flgov.com/2024/09/25/governor-ron-desantis-issues-updates-on-state-preparedness-efforts-ahead-of-hurricane-helene/">Florida</a>, but <a href="https://www.firstcoastnews.com/article/news/local/taylor-county-sheriffs-office-birthday-on-body/77-d6ee689f-bac3-445d-acc0-a7ff258f958a">some residents didn’t obey them</a>. The governors of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina heeded these alerts and submitted <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/27/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administrations-life-saving-and-life-sustaining-response-efforts-to-hurricane-helene/">emergency declaration requests</a> to the White House. Disaster declarations allow the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to get involved in the response with emergency shelters, medical aid, and grants for helping people recover. More than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/29/us/helene-destruction-florida-north-carolina.html">1,270 rescuers</a> were sent to the afflicted areas. States also <a href="https://www.army.mil/article/280098/national_guard_assists_with_hurricane_helene_response_in_southeast">mobilized National Guard units</a> to assist with rescue and relief efforts. President Joe Biden said he will <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-recover-biden-visit-823be75adbed4fa1d7c108a207dbb3e3">visit afflicted communities</a> once rescue efforts wind down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ad hoc networks of local volunteers have also sprung up to provide assistance and relief, even <a href="https://wlos.com/news/local/sunday-helene-asheville-updates-death-toll-rises-schools-close-resources-coming">deploying private airplanes and helicopters</a> to bring supplies to areas now isolated by floods and destroyed roads.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">6) What did climate change have to do with it?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though hurricanes are uncommon in many of the places where Helene tore through, a few have passed directly through inland regions like western North Carolina before. </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/tropicalstorms.webp?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.987964914666,100,78.024070170667" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Tropical storms and hurricanes have run through western North Carolina in the past. | NOAA" data-portal-copyright="NOAA" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Tracing out the specific role of climate change in Helene’s destruction will take some time, but there are now some established ways that rising temperatures amplify the harms from hurricanes. Hotter air and water make the strongest hurricanes stronger and fuel <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2022/9/28/23376761/hurricane-ian-rapid-intensification-climate-change">rapid intensification</a>, where a storm’s winds pick up by 35 miles per hour or more in less than 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Warmer air holds onto more moisture, which means that hurricanes dish out more rain. A hotter climate also makes the ice caps melt and causes the ocean itself to expand, lifting sea levels and expanding the reach of storm surges. Combined, these two factors <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/23850601/hurricane-idalia-florida-wind-forecast-storm-surge-flood-rapid-intensification">create more flooding</a> in the wake of a hurricane. Floods are often the deadliest and more destructive aspect of hurricanes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Helene arose amid one of the hottest years on record, with ocean temperatures near record highs and atmospheric conditions <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24145756/la-nina-2024-el-nino-heat-hurricane-record-temperature-pacific">suited for hurricane formation</a>. NOAA anticipated that this year’s hurricane season would be <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-predicts-above-normal-2024-atlantic-hurricane-season">above average</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div><div><iframe title="How climate change makes hurricanes worse" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_0TCrGtTEQM?rel=0" allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></div></div>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And risks are mounting. According to the most recent <a href="https://nca2023.globalchange.gov/chapter/22/">National Climate Assessment</a>, a US government report, the growing population in the region hit by Helene, particularly in cities, has created new vulnerabilities to warming. “Over the last few decades, economic growth in the Southeast has been concentrated in and around urban centers that depend on climate-sensitive infrastructure and regional connections to thrive,” according to the report.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">7) How can I help?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Local news outlets have some of the most up-to-date reports of the situation on the ground and where help is needed. Check out <a href="https://www.citizen-times.com/">Citizen Times</a>, the <a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/">Charlotte Observer</a>, <a href="https://www.knoxnews.com/">Knox News</a>, and <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/">Tampa Bay Times</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some state emergency responders have websites set up to collect donations for hurricane relief. Civic groups and food banks in affected communities are also collecting goods and money to help people who were hurt by the storm.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You can donate to Helene disaster relief efforts at <a href="https://t.co/3nPyCAXftL">https://t.co/3nPyCAXftL</a>. <a href="https://t.co/QDniaT6RYW">https://t.co/QDniaT6RYW</a></p>&mdash; NC Emergency Management (@NCEmergency) <a href="https://twitter.com/NCEmergency/status/1840722552961798166?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 30, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Local emergency managers are also providing guidance for what resources they do and don’t need. Please take this to heart. The <a href="https://x.com/TennesseeEMA/status/1840439256327827927">Tennessee Emergency Management Agency</a>, for instance, specifically asks people not to self-deploy to disaster areas and to only donate things requested by local emergency coordinators.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Recently, trauma suffered by NFL stars has raised fresh concerns about the league’s ongoing issues with head injuries — and raised questions about whether there is more the NFL could do to protect its players. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In early September, Tua Tagovailoa, a quarterback for the Miami Dolphins, suffered a frightening third (diagnosed) concussion, prompting some fans and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5764581/2024/09/13/tua-tagovailoa-concussion-reaction-retirement/">former players</a> to urge his retirement. In the wake of that injury, former Green Bay Packers star quarterback Brett Favre disclosed a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease during congressional testimony on Tuesday, noting that repeated head trauma was likely a major factor. And on Thursday, Malik Nabers, a rookie wide receiver for the New York Giants, set <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/41467264/giants-malik-nabers-sets-record-suffers-concussion-vs-cowboys">a receiving record before leaving the game with a concussion</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It isn’t news that professional football can be dangerous: The NFL first admitted the connection between football and CTE — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-traumatic-encephalopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20370921#:~:text=Overview,an%20autopsy%20of%20the%20brain.">chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain condition</a> — in 2016. CTE is most often found in athletes who suffer repeated hits to the head and members of the military who are exposed to explosive blasts, and has been tied to the deaths of famous football players, including Andre Waters and Mike Webster. More than 300 former football players have been <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/23/nx-s1-5121019/nfl-players-cte-survey#:~:text=More%20than%20300%20former%20NFL,memory%20loss%20and%20mood%20swings.">diagnosed with CTE following their deaths</a>. (The condition requires a brain autopsy to accurately diagnose.) </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Due to concerns about CTE and other conditions related to brain trauma, the <a href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/sports/how-the-nfl-is-working-to-prevent-concussions-and-protect-players">league has invested in</a> improving the equipment that players wear, changed rules for practice and game day, and promoted techniques intended to reduce head contact. This season, those changes include allowing players to wear new headgear meant to better protect players’ brains. This week, however, was a reminder that major problems remain for America’s most popular sport.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">The NFL is working on protections. It’s not clear they’re enough.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent years, the NFL has made major changes to helmets and protective gear, as well as shifts to in-game rules aimed at reducing collisions, NFL Chief Medical Officer Allen Sills told Vox.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps one of the most noticeable this season is the introduction of a new type of headgear called “Guardian Caps” — layers of foam padding worn over a helmet — during games. The caps, which most players have been required to wear when practicing since 2022, are intended to reduce the impact that players experience if they get hit in the head, potentially by about 10 percent, according to the NFL.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GettyImages-2172209609.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="A player in an orange puffy guardian cap weaves between two other players." title="A player in an orange puffy guardian cap weaves between two other players." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="The guardian cap at work. | Mike Carlson/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Mike Carlson/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">There are a few issues with the caps, however. One, players aren’t required to wear them during games, and <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/sports/nfl/nfl-players-wearing-guardian-caps-2024-season/3505271/">relatively few players</a> have chosen to do so thus far, limiting their impact.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And independent studies also haven’t confirmed whether they’re effective. Despite the NFL’s findings, separate teams of researchers from the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/30/health/football-head-injury-guardian-cap-research/index.html#:~:text=When%20the%20testing%20simulated%20the,to%2035%25%2C%20he%20said.">University of North Carolina and the University of Nevada-Reno</a> both found limited reductions in force for players wearing the caps, while <a href="https://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2023/03/28/padded-helmet-cover-shows-little-protection-for-football-players/">a third study, from Stanford,</a> saw force reductions in the lab but not when athletes wore them on the field. Sills argues this variability comes from differences in the researchers’ methodology and the NFL’s, and notes that the NFL intends to publish its research within the next few months.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The NFL also claims its researchers found that Guardian Caps reduced concussions by roughly 50 percent when worn in practice, a finding that some physicians have been skeptical of.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One main issue, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/briefing/nfl-guardian-caps.html">doctors told the New York Times</a>, is that better helmets and Guardian Caps shield the head, but they don’t shield the neck — which can be critical for preventing concussions. Hits and twisting of the neck play a major role in causing concussions, they note. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Jamshid Ghajar, a neurosurgeon, told the Times, race car drivers’ helmets, like those used in Formula 1 racing, are more effective at preventing concussions because they stabilize the neck even in cases of a crash. The NFL has disputed the Times’s characterization of concussions, and Sills argued that concussions aren’t predominantly caused by what he characterized as “neck forces.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The NFL has also touted its use of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/04/09/nfl-new-helmets/">12 new helmet models this season,</a> which are supposed to protect players from position-specific blows, and a new rule meant to make kickoffs — a part of the game in which players run toward one another, often at high speeds — safer. The effectiveness of these changes is still unclear, and it’s important to note that even with these changes, the fundamental issue of football involving bodily collisions and head contact remains.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Julie Stamm, a neuroscientist at the University of Wisconsin Madison, notes, “the best way to prevent [head trauma] is to not have impacts.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The inflammation chatter is everywhere, and it’s coming for your legumes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I first heard it from a friend recovering from surgery, who blamed her unusual post-op incision site irritation on foods TikTok had (incorrectly) informed her were inflammatory, like lentils. Antibiotics ultimately fixed her pain — turns out the incision was infected. Who knows what happened to the nutrition hearsay that lodged in her mind?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Plenty of good science shows that lentils, beans, and other legumes actually have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10945126/">anti-inflammatory effects</a>, but fad diets like Whole 30 <a href="https://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/eat-run/articles/2018-10-11/your-anti-inflammatory-diet-is-probably-just-the-opposite">demonized them</a> years ago. Those rumors are back, along with many others, as influencers exhort people to avoid <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@claire.elis/video/7249090810921307438?_r=1&amp;_t=8q14Uwnjkty">all</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTFBRdtVL/">kinds</a> of foods with the ultimate goal of banishing inflammation from the body.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s not something anyone would want if they understood inflammation’s complexities, says Shilpa Ravella, a Hawaii-based gastroenterologist whose book <em><a href="https://shilparavella.com/">A Silent Fire</a></em> explores the subject in detail. But it’s typical of the binary approach popular on social media, “where it’s either all good or all bad.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In reality, inflammation is a double-edged sword: It’s an ancient weapon that has enabled human bodies to fight off pathogens, poisons, and traumas for millennia, but it’s also a biological process that can damage and debilitate. It’s the subject not only of thousands of TikToks, but reams of scientific research.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s how inflammation can help us and hurt us, and what you need to know about reducing the risk it might pose to you.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Is there such a thing as good inflammation?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Inflammation involves the immune system, but not all immune system activity is inflammation, says <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/david-hafler/">David Hafler</a>, a neurologist and immunobiologist at Yale who specializes in the autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In inflammatory states, the immune system has been switched into attack mode, which on a microscopic level means a variety of specialized cells are fighting what they perceive as invaders. They often do this either by attacking their adversaries directly or by releasing toxic chemicals that create intolerable conditions for them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many experts split inflammation into two varieties, acute and chronic. Acute inflammation is the kind that happens in the hours and days after an injury or infection. It’s rarely quiet, says Ravella: “Blood flow is increasing, fluid and protein are leaking out of the vessels,” and as a result, people experience symptoms like swelling, redness, fever, and pain either all over or at the site of a specific injury or infection. “You can feel this,” she says, “and you know that kind of inflammation is helping to heal the wound.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When it’s short-lived — typically on the order of days to weeks — this type of inflammation is beneficial to us. Without it, we wouldn’t heal wounds or fight off infections. When acute inflammation is suppressed by an immunocompromising condition or medication, people are at higher risk of getting seriously ill due to small injuries or ordinary cough-and-cold viral infections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In other words, there is such a thing as too little inflammatory activity, says Ravella: “We don&#8217;t want to go down to zero.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What makes inflammation bad?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unlike fast-moving acute inflammation, chronic inflammation — which typically lasts from months to years — is associated with <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0675-0">collateral damage that limits both the quality and length of life</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of the most prominent examples of chronic inflammation are <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1267091/full">autoimmune diseases</a>, in which the immune system turns against the body — conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis), and lupus. These diseases are initially easy to confuse with acute, infection-related inflammation because they include so many of the same symptoms. While these symptoms don’t cause harm to our bodies when they’re directed at an invader, they can hurt us when they’re directed at our own tissues.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, chronic inflammation can also be physically silent, causing few observable symptoms for years until it culminates in disease states. A lot of cardiovascular diseases, kidney diseases, and cancers overlap with this kind of systemic chronic inflammation. Because chronic inflammation is harder to detect on routine lab tests than acute inflammation is, it’s harder to diagnose and intervene.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What causes chronic inflammation, and what does chronic inflammation cause?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While experts for years thought chronic inflammation was merely a consequence of these illnesses, there’s now mounting evidence that in some cases, inflammation itself can actually lead to disease.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The paradigm shift in the science started around 2017, says Ravella, with a clinical trial showing that in heart attack patients who had abnormally high blood levels of an inflammation-associated protein, taking an anti-inflammatory drug <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/news/2017/drug-targeting-inflammation-could-lower-risk-heart-disease">lowered the risk of a second heart attack</a> by 15 percent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The data for causation is stronger for some conditions — like heart disease and cancer — than for others,” says Ravella. For conditions like obesity, neurodegenerative disease (like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases), and some psychiatric diseases (like depression), disentangling cause from effect is more challenging.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">David Furman, a Stanford immunologist who uses genomics data to study links between aging, the immune system, and cardiovascular health, says chronic inflammation is more common in people with chronic pain, older people, and those with obesity. One effect of having the immune system always set to simmer is a “boy who cried wolf” situation: It’s so used to being saturated with inflammatory proteins that “when the real threat comes in, cells don’t respond,” he says.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>One effect of having the immune system always set to simmer is a “boy who cried wolf” situation</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That might explain why people in these groups were at such a vastly increased risk of death due to Covid-19 infection early in the pandemic, and why they are at higher risk for other diseases.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Scientists are exploring other triggers in the world around us that could cause chronic inflammation, including poisons in our air; disruptions to our circadian rhythm and other stressors; problems with our food and water; and changes to the microbes that colonize our guts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Researchers call this range of inputs the “<a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/environmental-health-and-engineering/research-and-practice/faculty-research-interests/the-exposome-collaborative-johns-hopkins-university/the-exposome-collaborative-background">exposome</a>.” It’s something we don’t have much control over — “You’re fighting a ghost,” says Furman — and yet a deep bench of research links many of these exposures to inflammatory pathways.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Why is there so much confusing information about inflammation out there?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In general, it’s hard to link any single exposure to a common outcome in humans because scientists cannot ethically control a person’s environment like they can with a lab rat. That makes it hard to do the kind of randomized, controlled human trials that many health experts favor. Researchers still have a lot of open questions about when inflammation is a cause, an effect, or something incidental to a disease or set of symptoms.&nbsp;And where there are gaps in science, people can make money and gain attention by exploiting the public’s understanding.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">TikTok is a showcase for many inflammation myths and scaremongering, much of it peddled by&nbsp;influencers who earn a living from your engagement or in some cases, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@robertwblove/video/7323359750702353710?_r=1&amp;_t=8q3Ofzop9ad">are actively trying to sell you</a> something.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Listing of a bunch of random symptoms to try to sell you a program or a product is unprofessional and predatory, if it’s even coming from a professional,” says dietitian Abbey Sharp in a TikTok debunking the “hidden signs your body is inflamed” genre.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Echoing expert advice about avoiding health misinformation, Sharp suggests consumers should be suspicious of vague, oversimplified, context-free statements about the causes and fixes of inflammation, especially ones from people who make money off your attention.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Additionally, be aware that foods are not necessarily inflammatory just because they make you gassy (hello again, legumes!), cause some people allergic reactions (think: soy), or aren’t tolerated by people with certain conditions. Gluten, for example, causes inflammation for people with celiac disease but is fine for most others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Okay, so what can I do to reduce chronic inflammation?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are ways to reduce your risk for the kind of chronic inflammation that may cause health problems. One of the main recommendations Hafler makes to his multiple sclerosis patients is to avoid processed foods; that nutritional habit, and many others linked to lower markers of inflammation, can also benefit people with risk factors for cardiovascular disease, but also&nbsp;those without specific health conditions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The inflammation-fighting diets actual experts recommend all have something in common: “We have an anti-inflammatory nutrient, perhaps our most anti-inflammatory nutrient,” says Ravella, “and that nutrient is fiber.” She recommends going well beyond the Food and Drug Administration’s recommended daily allowances of fiber — especially soluble fiber, which nourishes microbes in the gut whose work may <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8624670/">help</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8399161/">lower</a> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37483202/">inflammation</a> elsewhere in the body.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Be aware that foods are not necessarily inflammatory just because they make you gassy (hello again, legumes!)</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beans — yes, beans! — and grains are excellent sources of soluble fiber. Leafy greens and cruciferous vegetables also contain compounds that protect against inflammation, as do nuts, seeds, fatty fish like salmon and mackerel, and a whole variety of berries.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fermentation is also a powerful way to boost foods’ anti-inflammatory properties. That’s in part because the process yields good bacteria and fungi that, when eaten raw, fortify the gut microbiome. Even in fermented foods that are cooked — like sourdough bread — the microscopic architecture changes in ways that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9915096/">may have anti-inflammatory effects</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hafler recommends minimizing fat and salt in your diet, and all the experts I spoke to recommended avoiding processed foods, especially those that contain compounds and ingredients uncommon in home kitchens. The methods used in home kitchens are a lot less likely to cause inflammation than the ones used in industrial food production, which makes cooking from scratch really important, says Furman.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That even goes for treats like ice cream, he says: The surfactants and emulsifiers that produce the smooth texture in many mass-produced ice creams temporarily <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-024-06224-3#:~:text=In%20summary%2C%20these%20data%20suggested,relative%20abundance%20of%20beneficial%20microbiomes.">alter the gut’s microbiome</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27957-2#:~:text=The%20consumption%20of%20generally%20regarded,and%20mucus%2Dproducing%20cell%20cultures.">reduce the intestine’s protective layer</a>, which can contribute to inflammation in ways the raw ingredients of a homemade version wouldn’t.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Spending time in nature and with other humans and animals may also reduce inflammation, in part by <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1313731110">diversifying the microbiome</a>, but potentially <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2018457118">through</a> <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1719866115">other</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-35200-w">mechanisms</a>. Exercise, including strength training, is also key — “Muscle is a secretory organ with anti-inflammatory properties,” says Furman — and weight control can lower risk by reducing fat cells’ secretion of pro-inflammatory substances.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, most evidence-based recommendations for an anti-inflammatory lifestyle overlap significantly with what experts have long suggested is a healthy lifestyle. We can always do more — eat ever more pesticide-free food, breathe ever-cleaner air. But “we can&#8217;t go back to being cavemen,” Furman says. It’s really up to us how far we go.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The signature policy proposal of Donald Trump’s third campaign for the presidency is <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/06/25/trump-biden-tariffs-economy-inflation">a tariff</a>: a tax of 60 percent imposed on all imports from China and 10 percent on imports from any other country. Not only does he want this tax hike, which would raise <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/biden-and-trump-tariffs-august-2024/t24-0052-enact-60-percent-tariff-imported">about $291 billion</a> or 1 percent of <a href="https://www.bea.gov/news/2024/gross-domestic-product-second-quarter-2024-advance-estimate#:~:text=Current%E2%80%91dollar%20GDP%20increased%205.2,a%20level%20of%20%2428.63%20trillion.">GDP</a> when fully implemented, but he says he’ll do it unilaterally. “I don’t need Congress, but they’ll approve it,” Trump <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-threatens-to-impose-risky-tariff-scheme_n_66f1f822e4b02f84278bd8f1">declared at a September 23 rally</a>. “I’ll have the right to impose them myself if they don’t.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is a rather enormous policy change for a president to undertake unilaterally, and one of dubious legality. For comparison, the hike Trump is considering is <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/costestimate/52939-hr1628amendment.pdf#page=17">over twice as large</a> as the tax increases used to fund Obamacare. (And make no mistake — tariffs are tax increases.) Experts like former World Trade Organization (WTO) deputy director-general <a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2024/trump-ii-tariffs-who-said-he-could-do">Alan Wm. Wolff</a> have argued that no law passed by Congress gives the president the power to levy across-the-board tariffs along the lines Trump proposes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even so, Congress has given the executive branch a remarkable amount of flexibility to set tariffs. This is a mistake. Members of Congress, whether or not they support Trump’s tariff plans, should be able to agree on this much: As the Constitution lays out in the <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/articles/article-i/clauses/751">taxing clause</a>, it’s Congress’s job to set taxing and spending policy for the United States. It’s been that way for the US’s whole history, it’s the traditional role of legislatures in all democratic countries, and putting this power instead in the president’s hands cuts the people’s representatives out of the process of determining how they are taxed — a concept that goes back to before the American Revolution. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While Congress has in the past given up its power to tax in the case of trade to the president and the cabinet, it should reverse that trend. One way to do so is to pass a bill like <a href="https://www.paul.senate.gov/dr-rand-paul-celebrates-constitution-day/">Sen. Rand Paul’s No Taxation Without Representation Act</a> to ensure that any changes in tariffs are subject to a congressional vote before taking effect.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The president’s tariff powers, explained</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The presidential power to impose tariffs does not originate from a simple bill or program; rather, it slowly accreted over time, with a particular expansion over the past decade as the Trump administration rediscovered authorities in old laws that enabled it to wage a trade war with China and protect the steel industry.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10667">Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962</a>, for instance, gives the president the right to levy tariffs upon the secretary of commerce’s recommendation without asking Congress. This was the authority Trump used to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/3/8/17096510/trump-tariffs-nafta-steel-aluminum">slap tariffs on steel and aluminum back in 2018</a>, tariffs which <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/tax/library/pwc-biden-administration-adjusts-tariffs-on-mexican-steel-imports.html">Biden recently expanded slightly</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11346">Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974</a> gives a similar power to impose tariffs based on unfair trade practices by foreign nations on the advice of the Office of the US Trade Representative. Trump used this power to impose <a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/row/IF10708.pdf">sweeping tariffs against China</a>. Biden has made liberal use of this power, too, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/14/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-action-to-protect-american-workers-and-businesses-from-chinas-unfair-trade-practices/">expanding tariffs</a> on steel, batteries, solar cells, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/2024/3/4/24087919/biden-tariff-chinese-ev-byd-battery-detroit">electric vehicles from China</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, there’s <a href="https://www.usitc.gov/press_room/us_safeguard.htm">Section 201</a> of that same 1974 law, which allows tariffs against imports that “seriously injured or threatened … serious injury” to domestic companies. Trump and Biden have used this to <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-biden-tariffs/">justify tariffs on washing machines and solar cells</a> from most countries. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even if Trump couldn’t implement a full 10 percent tariff on all imports with his executive powers — because the previous authorities apply only to specific industries or specific countries — he could make a lot of progress toward that goal. His 60 percent tariff on all Chinese imports, for instance, may very well be possible because it’s narrowly targeted at one nation. He and Biden have proven that the president can, without Congress, raise taxes on imports very significantly.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I happen to think most of both Trump and Biden’s tariffs were wrongheaded and that Trump’s plan for more sweeping tariffs amounts to a <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/biden-and-trump-tariffs-august-2024/t24-0050-enact-60-percent-tariff-imports-china">significant tax increase on the poor and middle class</a> that would <a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2024/can-trump-replace-income-taxes-tariffs#:~:text=THE%20DOLLAR%E2%80%99S%20EXCHANGE%20RATE%20WOULD%20RISE%2C%20HURTING%20US%20EXPORTS">hurt US exports</a>, invite retaliation from other countries, harm America’s international reputation, and <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2019086pap.pdf">fail to create</a> any <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w32082/w32082.pdf">jobs for people</a> who need them. (Vice President Kamala Harris has <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/read-transcript-kamala-harris-msnbc-interview-rcna172771">attacked the Trump tariff plan as a “sales tax”</a> but hasn’t disavowed Biden’s tariff policies.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, you don’t have to agree with me on the merits of the tariffs to agree with a narrower point about the process: This shouldn’t be the president’s decision. Congress is the branch of government invested with the power to tax and spend, and these trade laws have narrowed its power to the benefit of the executive in a way that is difficult to justify. The Social Security Administration is not allowed to set Social Security taxes, nor is the Department of Health and Human Services allowed to set Medicare taxes, but the Department of Commerce and the Office of the US Trade Representative are explicitly authorized to recommend tariffs that take effect upon the president’s approval. Why is trade the exception?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One possible rationale might be that tariffs are a tool of foreign policy, which is traditionally an area where the executive has more autonomy. But even in that context, the tariff powers are extraordinary. Congressional authority is necessary to approve treaties and declare war; the War Powers Resolution means that armed conflict short of declared war needs congressional approval, too, as does funding conflict. Allowing a tariff increase without any congressional vote at all is a much greater deferral of authority.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are more specific, partisan reasons why Republicans and Democrats should be concerned about the presidential tariff power. For the past half-century, the GOP has been mostly a free-market, anti-tax party, which should naturally lead to skepticism of taxes and especially of unilateral presidential powers to levy taxes. As outgoing Senate Minority Leader <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/4897112-mcconnell-tariffs-trump-trade/">Mitch McConnell</a> (R-KY) put it recently, “I’m not a fan of tariffs. They raise the prices for American consumers. I’m more of a free-trade kind of Republican that remembers how many jobs are created by the exports that we engage in.” The large number of Republicans still holding to that worldview should support curbing the presidential power to levy tariffs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democrats, even those sympathetic to tariffs and skeptical of free trade, should be wary of consigning a whole area of policymaking to Trump’s whims should he win the election. He demonstrated in his first term that he was very willing to use the tariff powers, more willing than any recent president, and his second term should, if anything, see him use them more promiscuously.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Presidential authority on tariffs also opens the door to corruption. Importers are allowed to petition the Commerce Department for specific waivers from tariffs, an allowance corporations <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/trumps-tariffs-mean-big-opportunities">unsurprisingly use to extract special favors</a>. Apple, for instance, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/technology/apple-watch-tariffs.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/technology/apple-watch-tariffs.html">got exemptions from anti-China tariffs</a> for iPhones and Apple Watches. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given what we know about Donald Trump and his <a href="https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/trump-sold-his-dc-hotel-gop-spending-disappeared/">clientelist</a>, <a href="https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/trumps-latest-business-endeavor-is-an-invitation-for-even-more-corruption/">favor-trading</a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/01/trump-second-term-mafia-state/676128/">mode of politics</a>, is that really a kind of power he should have? Is it a power Democrats will trust him to use in a non-corrupt manner? Or should Congress have the ability to curtail tariffs and limit opportunities for abuse?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Congress needs to act sooner rather than later</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some presidential powers, like the power to <a href="https://www.vox.com/22238571/trump-pardons-bannon-broidy-corruption">pardon</a> <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-shadow-of-marc-rich">political allies</a> or <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship">immunity from prosecution</a>, stem from the Constitution or the Supreme Court’s interpretation of it. But the tariff powers stem from statutes passed by Congress, and they can be rescinded by further acts of Congress.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There were some proposals during the Trump years to require congressional approval for section 232 tariffs, most notably the <a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2019/1/warner-introduces-legislation-to-restore-national-security-tariff-authority-to-congress">Trade Authority Act</a> introduced to the Senate by Mark Warner (D-VA) and Pat Toomey (R-PA). That bill has been kept alive in the most recent Congress by <a href="https://beyer.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=5966#:~:text=The%20Congressional%20Trade%20Authority%20Act%20would%20reinstate%20the%20role%20of,for%20alleged%20national%20security%20reasons.">Reps. Mike Gallagher (R-WI) and Don Beyer (D-VA)</a>. But Gallagher has since resigned from Congress, and Toomey retired in 2022. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More to the point, section 232 is only one of the sources of authority the president can use for tariffs. Sections 201 and 301 of the 1974 Trade Act would remain and could be used to raise taxes unilaterally. The Supreme Court could, in theory, strike down tariffs that overstep congressionally delegated authority, but historically, the courts have deferred to the executive on trade.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The only bill I know of that would tackle the full suite of laws authorizing presidential tariffs is the <a href="https://www.paul.senate.gov/dr-rand-paul-celebrates-constitution-day/">No Taxation Without Representation Act</a> from Rand Paul. As Paul put it in a statement upon introducing the bill: “Unchecked executive actions enacting tariffs tax our citizens, threaten our economy, raise prices for everyday goods, and erode the system of checks and balances that our founders so carefully crafted.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I find myself agreeing with Paul on very few issues, but he’s dead right on this one: Taxation is a congressional authority, and that should apply to tariffs as much as anything else.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“To me it’s sensible policy,” Wolff, the former WTO executive and veteran US trade negotiator, told me. He might add carve-outs to give the executive flexibility in emergency cases (like when another nation levies a tariff against us first, or as part of a sanctions regime against a state like Russia or Iran), but broadly, the principle that Congress should authorize tax increases makes sense.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We’re essentially out of time for Congress to act before its <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/2024_schedule.htm">preelection October recess</a>, and action may be harder in November and December when we know who the next president will be, and their copartisans may be less willing to support actions to constrain their powers. But the battle will only get harder once a new president takes office and starts proposing tariffs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The time to act is this year, before that happens and while Congress has an opportunity to reassert its taxing power. The alternative could mean hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of tax increases issued unilaterally by the president, with Congress unable to stop it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In some ways, there have never been more dollars flowing into abortion rights organizing, with philanthropies <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/5/18/23074733/abortion-philanthropy-foundations-funds">finally stepping up</a> and more Americans activated over freedoms <a href="https://perryundem.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PerryUndem-Abortion-Public-Opinion-Survey-2022.pdf">they previously doubted</a> were really at stake. With hundreds of candidates vying for office and abortion rights on the ballot in <a href="https://time.com/7018665/abortion-ballot-measures-2024/">10 states</a>, advocates have been busy raising money to spend through November. In June, the ACLU pledged more than <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-launches-2024-election-push-to-protect-abortion-and-voting-rights">$25 million</a> to protect abortion rights; this was followed by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/planned-parenthood-spending-45-million-2024-election-a6b9252fec64d1e051816ea173dab32f">$40 million weeks later</a> from Planned Parenthood, then another <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/24/abortion-rights-advocates-launch-100-million-campaign-00164528">$100 million</a> from a new coalition of national groups.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But even as money flows toward protecting abortion rights, the financial burden of accessing abortion services has grown more severe, as bans force people to travel further and delay procedures until they are riskier and more expensive.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This strain is overwhelming the nation’s 100 <a href="https://abortionfunds.org/">abortion funds</a>, which are mostly volunteer-led organizations that help people end unwanted pregnancies by paying for their abortions as well as practical support like travel costs —&nbsp;and the tab for this kind of aid quickly adds up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though cheaper methods to safely end a pregnancy <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/12/27/24015092/abortion-pills-mifepristone-roe-reproductive-misoprostol">have emerged over the past two years</a>, many abortion seekers lack knowledge of these new, more affordable options. Funds and clinics also don’t always provide clear guidance on alternatives, driven by a mix of <a href="https://www.plancpills.org/documentary">financial and legal self-interest</a>, as well as a belief that in-person abortion care should be prioritized.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“What we’re seeing is patients are very comfortable embracing telemedicine as an option, but people within our movement have not been as flexible,” said Julie Kay, the co-founder of the <a href="https://www.theactgroup.org/#:~:text=The%20Abortion%20Coalition%20for%20Telemedicine,abortion%20in%20all%2050%20states.">Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine</a>, which formed in 2022 after the Supreme Court overturned <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Wade.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This past year, abortion funds say they’re <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/abortion-funds-running-out-money-dobbs_n_667486b4e4b043a634bd9cd2">fighting for their lives</a>, unable to raise enough money to meet demand. A few are fundraising with <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/186128/abortion-fund-money-dobbs-election" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new state-level partners</a>, but increasingly, funds have had to tell callers they’ve run out of resources, leaving people to scramble for other options or carry unwanted pregnancies to term.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In general, all the money flowing to the 2024 election in the name of reproductive rights feels very siloed from their work paying for abortions, said Alisha Dingus, the development director at the <a href="https://dcabortionfund.org/">DC Abortion Fund</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There is an alarming disconnect between abortion funds … and large national organizations that are advocating for access,” a group of over 30 funds wrote collectively <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/abortion-funds-movement-crisis/">in the Nation</a> in early August. “The national organizations … fundraise endlessly, siphon support from institutional funders and grassroots donors, capitalize on the <em>Dobbs</em> rage donations, and funnel that money into campaign bank accounts.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another challenge is messaging. Abortion funds have always positioned themselves as more radical and unapologetic when it comes to abortion care, priding themselves on avoiding stigmatizing language, whether that’s by using gender-neutral terms or elevating stories of people ending unwanted pregnancies for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/opinion/abortions-necessary-sympathy.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">no traumatic, exceptional reason</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But given the increasingly desperate funding environment, these activists are being forced now to reconsider how they appeal to a public <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/05/13/broad-public-support-for-legal-abortion-persists-2-years-after-dobbs/?utm_source=AdaptiveMailer&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=24-05-13%20Abortion%20GEN%20DISTRO&amp;org=982&amp;lvl=100&amp;ite=13991&amp;lea=3375400&amp;ctr=0&amp;par=1&amp;trk=a0DQm000001nkFdMAI">that is broadly supportive</a> of reproductive rights but is still more moderate on abortion.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“In my experience on ballot campaigns, abortion funds have been incredibly challenging as partners in states that weren&#8217;t blue,” one leader involved with multiple post-<em>Roe </em>ballot measures, who requested anonymity to speak candidly, told Vox. “If you&#8217;re only communicating in very extreme messaging about abortion access, you&#8217;re not broadening your base of donors, you&#8217;re just talking to the 12 people who already agree with you. A lot of people who would love to donate to funds and probably don&#8217;t understand the need are turned off before they even get in the door by the language and behavior.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These kinds of criticisms vex Dingus, who wrestles with whether abortion funds should be more “acceptable and digestible” to the public, as she put it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I came from a more traditional philanthropy space where you had to make sure you never hurt anyone’s feelings or made anyone angry because you might lose a dollar,” she said. “Abortion funds I&#8217;ve always found to be more liberated spaces where we can speak truth to power and push for change and not have to worry about one funder here or one funder there. But we are also seeing the reality of people not getting the care they need, people are going to be forced to give birth, so I think it’s tough.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tensions are rising within the movement as disagreements over a scarce resource — money — intensify. These battles among leaders<em> </em>reflect practical and ideological divisions about the future of abortion access and underscore the messy, unsettled questions that loom over activists more than two years after Americans lost their national right to end a pregnancy.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The 2024 election is dominating abortion-related donations</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When it comes to donations this year, it’s mostly going to one place.<br><br>Despite earlier concern that abortion rights ballot measures would struggle to raise enough money, organizers say those fears have mostly not been realized, and tens of millions of dollars are flowing into the state contests as the election draws near.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These contests are “expensive and high-impact,” said Kelly Hall, the executive director of the Fairness Project, a national progressive group. “We are very grateful that organizations and in-state donors are seeing the opportunity with state ballot measures and are investing the resources that are needed to win.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One newer member of the abortion rights political ecosystem is the House Majority PAC’s <a href="https://www.thehousemajoritypac.com/news/memo-hmp-launches-100-million-reproductive-freedom-accountability-fund">Reproductive Freedom Accountability Fund</a>, a $100 million investment to mobilize voters in swing districts sympathetic to abortion rights. “In 2022, 42 percent of our ads mentioned abortion, and I think it will be that much again if not higher,” said C.J. Warnke, a spokesperson for the congressional PAC.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, making sense of the amount of abortion-rights money flowing into political campaigns can be difficult.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some lower-profile elections, <a href="https://azmirror.com/2024/09/18/campaigns-battle-over-the-fate-of-2-az-supreme-court-justices-who-ushered-in-the-1864-abortion-ban/">like two high court contests</a> in Arizona, have struggled to raise money, despite their importance for reproductive rights. And in June Planned Parenthood, one of the largest abortion rights advocacy groups,&nbsp; announced it would be spending $40 million during the 2024 cycle, less than the group spent <a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-2022-midterm-elections-health-congress-71871318f3c725a7df0bbe183e6c84be">in either of</a> the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/16/planned-parenthood-to-spend-45-million-in-2020-elections.html">previous two</a> election cycles. Their announcement came shortly after it announced it would also need to <a href="https://rewirenewsgroup.com/2024/08/13/following-national-funding-cuts-july-was-pure-hell-for-abortion-funds/">reduce its subsidies</a> for abortion care through its Justice Fund program.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Planned Parenthood says it can spend less simply because other organizations are spending more and because candidates themselves are more emboldened on reproductive rights. But elections are more expensive now and there are more political contests to fund than during the midterms, so the explanation is puzzling.&nbsp; (The group also declined to share details of its Justice Fund or to direct patient assistance broadly, citing “<a href="https://rewirenewsgroup.com/2024/08/13/following-national-funding-cuts-july-was-pure-hell-for-abortion-funds/">disclosure policy</a>” restrictions.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In some ways, this is likely to be the last big year for spending on abortion rights ballot measures, simply because there aren’t many additional states that allow for such citizen initiatives. “It’s not an either-or” on funding, said Ashley All, who led the communications strategy for the <a href="https://www.vox.com/23273455/kansas-abortion-roe-dobbs-ballot-initiative-constitutional-amendment">winning Kansas abortion rights ballot measure</a> in 2022<em>. </em>“We have to do these ballot campaigns because if we don’t then people will lose access to care.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, while national activists and fundraisers are spinning things in a more positive light, emphasizing that more money will be available to fund direct services soon, many local abortion fund leaders are skeptical things will really improve financially when election season ends.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to Lexis Dotson-Dufault, executive director of the <a href="https://www.abortionfundofohio.org/">Abortion Fund of Ohio</a>, no new donors contributed to the organization following the passage of Issue 1, the abortion rights ballot measure that prevailed in Ohio last year by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/11/07/us/elections/results-ohio-issue-1-abortion-rights.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=election-results&amp;context=election_recirc&amp;region=RaceLink">a 13-point margin</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We have seen nothing but an increase in need and we got no new funders from Issue 1,” she told Vox. “In 2022, we saw about 1,200 folks, in 2023 we saw about 4,500, and this year so far between February and August we’ve seen almost 4,000 people.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dingus, of the DC Abortion Fund, said election season has made their financial challenges more difficult. “It’s tough to see, not just the ballot measures but the <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/364410/kamala-harris-white-people-zooms-race-intersectionality-crenshaw">Zooms for Harris</a> that raised millions of dollars in 30 minutes,” she said. “It can be really demoralizing to see that and then look at our budgets and know we continually have to cut back and maybe will have to get rid of staff.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cheryl Wolf, an organizer with <a href="https://www.cascadesabortionsupport.org/">Cascades Abortion Support Collective</a> in Portland, Oregon, said it’s been hard to convince the public that donating to small local funds over large political campaigns is a more reliable way to ensure their money directly supports abortion care.<br><br>“When they make their donations to national organizations, so much of it goes to overhead, salary, campaigning, advertising,” she told Vox. “Rather than directly into the hands of abortion seekers.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This pressure has all been <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/abortion-funds-running-out-money-dobbs_n_667486b4e4b043a634bd9cd2">exacerbated by recent national funding cuts</a>; since July, the National Abortion Federation, along with Planned Parenthood, announced they’d only be able to subsidize up to 30 percent of abortion costs, down from their previous cap of 50 percent.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wolf described these cuts from the National Abortion Federation as “detrimental,” particularly because most of the collective’s money comes from small one-time or monthly donations from individuals. “We are definitely not raising enough,” she added, noting they bring in about $500 every month and spend about $9,000. “We’re definitely looking at running out of money in the next couple months if we don’t have some kind of miracle.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As travel costs rise, some abortion rights leaders say the movement has been too focused on elevating travel for those living in states with bans.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kay, of the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine, formed her more critical perspective while working in Ireland when abortion was criminalized. “The Irish solution to abortion bans was travel, but not everyone has the privilege or means to travel,” she said. “It’s alienating, stigmatizing, and expensive.” Prioritizing travel today, Kay thinks, reflects a movement that hasn’t “pivoted to the reality of what we&#8217;re living in now” with more options and more restrictions.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A difference of philosophy — and why it matters</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Across the abortion rights movement, leaders are grappling with how best to engage voters and donors while also debating how much compromise is acceptable in the pursuit of broader support.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2023, when Ohio activists were pushing for an abortion rights ballot measure, leaders with the Abortion Fund of Ohio were frustrated by compromises these ballot measure activists were willing to make. “I’m not really ever into hearing things about trimester limits or viability standards, or hearing language that’s very trauma-focused,” said Dotson-Dufault. “Something I say is a lot of the reason you feel the need to use that type of language is because we haven’t been doing the deep community destigmatization work.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In other states, abortion fund staff and volunteers are experiencing similar discomfort. In South Dakota, a local abortion fund has publicly <a href="https://www.vox.com/24078960/south-dakota-abortion-ballot-measure-dobbs">criticized the abortion rights ballot measure</a> citizens will be voting on this November, even as the red state has a near-total abortion ban. Other funds are wrestling with messaging choices.<strong> </strong>“A lot of campaigns like <a href="https://floridiansprotectingfreedom.com/about/">Yes on 4</a> [the Florida abortion rights ballot measure] use gendered language, while we always use ‘pregnant people’ or ‘people who are pregnant,’” said Bree Wallace, the director of case management at the <a href="https://tbafund.com/">Tampa Bay Abortion Fund</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When I asked Brittany Fonteno, the president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation, how her organization balances their more bold, progressive rhetoric with their recent funding cuts to local affiliates, she said it comes down to “investing time and energy in educating people, and helping them to evolve their own perspective.” Fonteno then cited her own journey growing up in a more conservative and religious environment, and her path to abandoning abortion stigma. “It took time for me to evolve and become someone who is not pro-choice but pro-abortion, pro-reproductive freedom,” she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet rejection of terms like “pro-choice” from activists like Fonteno stands in sharp contrast to how <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/03/1102872199/gallup-poll-pro-choice-roe-v-wade-supreme-court">most Americans who support reproductive rights</a> feel about it. Election pollsters have also found that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/7/13/23204957/roe-wade-abortion-dobbs-persuasion-midterms">some of the most effective</a> abortion rights-related messages with voters are the same ones that activists argue are too gendered, stigmatizing, and patronizing (like that the decision to end a pregnancy should be “between a woman and her doctor” or that “victims of rape and incest would be forced to give birth.”)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2022, under pressure from activists, the House Pro-Choice Caucus <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahnferris/status/1524792388677402626">circulated new talking points</a> that warned “choice” is “harmful language” for reproductive rights, and should be replaced with the “helpful” alternative of “decision.” This generated some ridicule, but other aides and leaders were upset that activists would seek to ditch the well-known and popular “pro-choice” label at such a high-visibility moment, and without real survey research to support it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are no simple answers to the movement&#8217;s future direction, though progressive activists rightly note that <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/May-2-Release-FINAL.pdf">public opinion</a> is <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NPR_PBS-News-Hour_Marist-Poll_USA-NOS-and-Tables_0426_202304211458.pdf">increasingly</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/support-for-legalized-abortion-grows-since-dobbs-ruling-wsj-poll-shows-11662210020">shifting in favor</a> of abortion rights. Some activists are wary about prematurely abandoning the long-held goal of restoring accessible in-person clinic care nationwide, while others worry that leaders&#8217; refusal to adapt to new realities will come at the expense of pregnant people.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wallace, of the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund, said that after <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Wade </em>was overturned, her fund received 755,000 individual donations, but by 2023, that number fell to 272,000. “People are donating more toward the election and Yes on 4 right now, and we all want Yes on 4 to pass, but people don’t understand that even if it does, people still don’t have money for abortion, people still don’t have ways of traveling to their appointments,” she said. “Next year is going to be all about holding people to account.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Advocates said it would be a modest law setting &#8220;clear, predictable, <a href="https://time.com/7015197/ai-legislation-protects-more-than-just-people/">common-sense safety standards</a>&#8221; for artificial intelligence. Opponents argued it was a dangerous and arrogant step that will “<a href="https://pelosi.house.gov/news/press-releases/pelosi-statement-opposition-california-senate-bill-1047">stifle innovation</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In any event, SB 1047 — California state Sen. <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/361562/california-ai-bill-scott-wiener-sb-1047">Scott Wiener’s proposal</a> to regulate advanced AI models offered by companies doing business in the state — is now kaput, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/californias-gavin-newsom-vetoes-controversial-ai-safety-bill-d526f621?mod=hp_lead_pos4" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/californias-gavin-newsom-vetoes-controversial-ai-safety-bill-d526f621?mod=hp_lead_pos4">vetoed</a> by Gov. Gavin Newsom. The proposal had garnered wide support in the legislature, passing the California State Assembly by a <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billVotesClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB1047">margin of 48 to 16</a> in August. Back in May, it passed the Senate by 32 to 1. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The bill, which would hold AI companies liable for catastrophic harms their “frontier” models may cause, was backed by a wide array of AI safety groups, as well as luminaries in the field like <a href="https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/senator-wieners-landmark-ai-bill-passes-assembly">Geoffrey Hinton</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/08/15/yoshua-bengio-californias-ai-safety-bill-will-protect-consumers-innovation-tech/">Yoshua Bengio</a>, and <a href="https://safesecureai.org/experts">Stuart Russell</a>, who have warned of the technology’s potential to pose massive, even existential dangers to humankind. It got a surprise last-minute endorsement from <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1828205685386936567">Elon Musk</a>, who among his other ventures runs the AI firm <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/27/24165619/elon-musk-xai-startup-6-billion-funding">xAI</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lined up against SB 1047 was nearly all of the tech industry, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24225648/openai-letter-california-ai-safety-bill-sb-1047">OpenAI</a>, <a href="https://static.politico.com/e0/fd/e56dfaad40b39f29dd1dfa1164da/sb-1047-letter-6-25-24.pdf">Facebook</a>, the powerful investors <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91175604/big-tech-lobbyists-ai-safety-bill-gavin-newsom">Y Combinator and Andreessen Horowitz</a>, and some <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E2yDGXryPhhlwS4OdkzMpNeaG5r6_Jxa/view">academic researchers</a> who fear it threatens <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/2/2/24058484/open-source-artificial-intelligence-ai-risk-meta-llama-2-chatgpt-openai-deepfake">open source</a> AI models. Anthropic, another AI heavyweight, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/364384/its-practically-impossible-to-run-a-big-ai-company-ethically">lobbied to water down the bill</a>. After many of its proposed amendments were adopted in August, the company said the bill’s <a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/files/4zrzovbb/website/6a3b14a98a781a6b69b9a3c5b65da26a44ecddc6.pdf">“benefits likely outweigh its costs.”</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite the industry backlash, the bill seemed to be popular with Californians. In a poll designed by supporters and a leading opponent of the bill (meant to ensure that the poll questions were worded fairly), <a href="https://theaipi.org/voters-support-sb1047-in-collaborative-poll/">Californians backed the legislation by 54 percent to 28</a> after hearing arguments from both sides. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The wide, bipartisan margins by which the bill passed the Assembly and Senate, and the public’s general support (when not asked in a biased way), might make Newsom’s veto seem surprising. But it’s not so simple. Andreessen Horowitz, the <a href="https://a16z.com/about/">$43 billion venture capital giant</a>, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91175604/big-tech-lobbyists-ai-safety-bill-gavin-newsom">hired Newsom&#8217;s close friend and Democratic operative Jason Kinney to lobby</a> against the bill, and a number of powerful Democrats, including <a href="https://democrats-science.house.gov/imo/media/doc/2024-08-15%20to%20Gov%20Newsom_SB1047.pdf">eight members of the US House</a> from California and former Speaker <a href="https://pelosi.house.gov/news/press-releases/pelosi-statement-opposition-california-senate-bill-1047">Nancy Pelosi</a>, urged a veto, echoing <a href="https://x.com/GarrisonLovely/status/1824236448310022453">talking points from the tech industry</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That was the faction that eventually won out, keeping California — the center of the AI industry — from becoming the first state to establish robust AI liability rules. Oddly, Newsom <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SB-1047-Veto-Message.pdf">justified</a> his veto by arguing that SB1047 did not go far <em>enough</em>. Because it focuses &#8220;only on the most expensive and large-scale models,&#8221; he worried that the bill &#8220;could give the public a false sense of security about controlling this fast-moving technology. Smaller, specialized models may emerge as equally or even more dangerous than the models targeted by SB 1047.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Newsom’s decision has sweeping implications not just for AI safety in California, but also in the US and potentially the world.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s inside SB 1047</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To have attracted all of this intense lobbying, one might think that SB 1047 was an aggressive, heavy-handed bill — but, especially after several rounds of revisions in the State Assembly, the actual law proposed to do fairly little. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It would have offered <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/353933/openai-open-letter-safety-whistleblowers-right-to-warn">whistleblower protections to tech workers</a>, along with a process for people who have confidential information about risky behavior at an AI lab to take their complaint to the state Attorney General without fear of prosecution. It would have also required AI companies that spend more than $100 million to train an AI model to develop safety plans. (The extraordinarily high ceiling for this requirement to kick in was meant to protect California’s startup industry, which objected that the compliance burden would be too high for small companies.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So what about this bill would possibly prompt months of hysteria, intense lobbying from the California business community, and unprecedented intervention by California’s federal representatives? Part of the answer is that the bill used to be stronger. The initial version of the law was based the threshold for compliance on computing power, meaning that over time, more companies would have become subject to the law as computers continue to get cheaper (and more powerful). It would also have established a state agency called the “Frontier Models Division” to review safety plans; the industry objected to the perceived power grab.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another part of the answer is that a lot of people were falsely told the bill does more. One prominent critic <a href="https://www.hyperdimensional.co/p/californias-effort-to-strangle-ai">inaccurately claimed</a> that AI developers could be guilty of a felony, regardless of whether they were involved in a harmful incident, when the bill only had provisions for criminal liability in the event that the developer <a href="https://safesecureai.org/responseletter">knowingly lied under oath</a>. (Those provisions were subsequently removed anyway). <a href="https://lofgren.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/lofgren.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/8.7.24%20to%20Senator%20Wiener.pdf">Congressional representative Zoe Lofgren of the science, space, and technology committee wrote a letter</a> in opposition falsely claiming that the bill requires adherence to guidance that doesn’t exist yet.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the standards do exist (<a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.800-1.ipd.pdf">you can read them in full here</a>), and<em> </em>the bill did not require firms to adhere to them. It said only that “a developer shall consider industry best practices and applicable guidance” from the US Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute, National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Government Operations Agency, and other reputable organizations. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A lot of the discussion of SB 1047 unfortunately centered around straightforwardly incorrect claims like these, in many cases propounded by people who should have known better.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">SB 1047 was premised on the idea that near-future AI systems might be extraordinarily powerful, that they accordingly <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/21/18126576/ai-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-safety-alignment">might be dangerous</a>, and that some oversight is required. That core proposition is extraordinarily <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/21/18126576/ai-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-safety-alignment">controversial</a> among AI researchers. Nothing exemplifies the split more than the three men frequently called the “godfathers of machine learning,” Turing Award winners Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton, and Yann LeCun. Bengio — a <a href="https://www.vox.com/23924495/yoshua-bengio-scientific-director-mila-quebec-ai-institute-future-perfect-50-2023">Future Perfect 2023 honoree</a> — and Hinton have both in the last few years become convinced that the technology they created may kill us all and argued for regulation and oversight. Hinton <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/technology/ai-google-chatbot-engineer-quits-hinton.html">stepped down</a> from Google in 2023 to speak openly about his fears. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">LeCun, who is chief AI scientist at Meta, took the opposite tack, declaring that such worries are nonsensical science fiction and that any regulation would strangle innovation. Where Bengio and Hinton find themselves supporting the bill, LeCun opposed it, especially the idea that AI companies should face liability if AI is used in a mass casualty event. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In this sense, SB 1047 was the center of a symbolic tug-of-war: Does government take AI safety concerns seriously, or not? The actual text of the bill may have been limited, but to the extent that it suggested government was listening to the half of experts that think that AI might be extraordinarily dangerous, the implications were big. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s that sentiment that likely drove some of the fiercest lobbying against the bill by venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, whose firm a16z worked relentlessly to kill the bill, and some of the highly unusual outreach to federal legislators to demand they oppose a state bill. More mundane politics likely played a role, too: <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/california-playbook/2024/08/19/ai-pelosi-house-seat-00174542">Politico reported</a> that Pelosi opposed the bill because she’s trying to court tech VCs for her daughter, who is likely to run against Scott Wiener for a House of Representatives seat.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Why SB 1047 is so important&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It might seem strange that legislation in just one US state had so many people wringing their hands. But remember: California is not just any state. It’s where several of the world’s leading AI companies are based.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And what happens there is especially important because, at the federal level, lawmakers have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/15/technology/ai-schumer-roadmap-congress.html">dragging out</a> the process of regulating AI. Between Washington’s hesitation and the looming election, it’s falling to states to pass new laws. The California bill, if Newsom gives it the green light, would be one big piece of that puzzle, setting the direction for the US more broadly.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rest of the world is watching, too. “Countries around the world are looking at these drafts for ideas that can influence their decisions on AI laws,” Victoria Espinel, the chief executive of the Business Software Alliance, a lobbying group representing major software companies, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/10/technology/california-ai-regulation.html">told</a> the New York Times in June.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even China —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23621198/artificial-intelligence-chatgpt-openai-existential-risk-china-ai-safety-technology">often invoked as the boogeyman in American conversations</a> about AI development (because “we don’t want to lose an arms race with China”) — is showing signs of <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2024/08/25/is-xi-jinping-an-ai-doomer">caring about safety</a>, not just wanting to run ahead. Bills like SB 1047 could telegraph to others that Americans also care about safety.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Frankly, it’s refreshing to see legislators wise up to the tech world’s favorite gambit:&nbsp;claiming that it can regulate itself. That claim may have held sway in the era of social media, but it’s become increasingly untenable.&nbsp;We need to regulate Big Tech. That means not just carrots, but sticks, too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now that Newsom has killed the bill, he may face some sticks of his own. A poll from the pro-SB1047 <a href="https://theaipi.org/april-voters-prefer-ai-regulation-over-self-regulation-2-3-2/">AI Policy Institute</a> finds that 60 percent of voters are prepared to blame him for future AI-related incidents if he vetoes SB 1047. In fact, they’d punish him at the ballot box if he runs for higher office: 40 percent of California voters say they would be less likely to vote for Newsom in a future presidential primary election if he vetoes the bill. <br></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Welcome to the first issue of Within Our Means, a biweekly newsletter about ending poverty in America. If you’d like to receive it in your inbox, please sign up here:</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’ve always been interested in how race and class shape our society and my work often focuses on topics like <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24025691/shoplifting-scare-criminal-justice-reform">criminal justice</a>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/12/the-criminalization-of-gentrifying-neighborhoods/548837/">housing</a>, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/358193/the-death-of-the-summer-job-is-a-good-thing">the social safety net</a>. But while I like to point out problems, I also think that’s only half of my job. The other half is to ask, “Now what?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s what this newsletter will do. Some issues will dig into the specific ways that poverty punishes people across the country. Others will look at policies that either exacerbate or alleviate poverty. The overarching goal is to find tangible solutions to improve people’s lives. And so if you, like me, think that poverty is a problem that can be eradicated in the United States, then think of this newsletter as a way for us to envision what a realistic path toward that future could look like.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why so many Americans are poor</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">America has gone through many ups and downs since the civil rights era, but one thing has remained remarkably constant: In 1970, <a href="https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/1971/demographics/p60-77.pdf">12.6 percent of Americans</a> were considered poor; in 2023, that number was <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2024/demo/p60-283.html#:~:text=Official%20Poverty%20Measure%3A,and%20Table%20A%2D1).">11.1 percent</a> — or 36.8 million people. “To graph the share of Americans living in poverty over the past half-century amounts to drawing a line that resembles gently rolling hills,” the sociologist Matthew Desmond <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/09/magazine/poverty-by-america-matthew-desmond.html">wrote last year</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It might seem as though the persistence of poverty in the United States says something about how intractable the problem is. This is, after all, the richest country in the world. If America can’t rid itself of poverty, then who can? But it’s not that America <em>can’t </em>do it; it’s that it chooses not to.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, there isn’t a single answer to why so many Americans continue to be stuck in poverty. It is true, for example, that the American welfare system is broken, consistently undermined, and, in some cases, set up to fail. Studies have shown that programs like <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/expanding-work-requirements-would-make-it-harder-for-people-to-meet">work requirements don’t work</a>, and states have been <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/states-are-hoarding-52-billion-in-welfare-funds-even-as-the-need-for-aid-grows">caught hoarding billions of dollars</a> worth of welfare funds instead of distributing them among the people they’re intended for.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it’s also true that an extraordinary amount of money and effort go into establishing and administering antipoverty programs, and many of them do succeed. Social Security, for example, keeps <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/social-security/social-security-lifts-more-people-above-the-poverty-line-than-any-other">more than 20 million people</a> above the poverty line.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent years, America showed just how much of a choice poverty is: The short-lived pandemic-era child tax credit expansion cut child poverty by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/25/us/politics/child-tax-credit.html">more than a third</a>. And the bolstered social safety net from Covid relief bills nearly halved child poverty in a single year — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/25/us/politics/child-tax-credit.html">the sharpest drop on record</a>. Once those programs expired, however, the child poverty rate <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/09/10/child-poverty-rate-america-2023#">bounced right back</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>One reason poverty is so stubborn</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last year, many homeowners in Lexington, Massachusetts came out to oppose zoning changes that would allow for more housing to be built in the wealthy Boston suburb. The people who needed the new housing were, understandably, not impressed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“How do you think it makes me feel when some people from a point of great privilege say that they don’t want the type of multifamily housing that I live in because it may look ugly or doesn’t fit the essence of this town?” one young resident, whose family relied on multifamily housing to be able to live in Lexington, <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/04/14/opinion/lexington-town-meeting-zoning-reform/">told the town legislature</a>. “Are we really setting the bar of entry to be a $1 million dollar house to join our community?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This situation is one answer to the question of what makes the problem of poverty so complicated: competing interests. The reality is that <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/poverty-in-america-book-matthew-desmond-interview/674058/">too many people benefit</a> from the existence of poverty. The economy already pits too many groups against each other, leaving many Americans afraid that they have too much to lose should we choose to build a more equitable society.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Homeowners are told that their homes are the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/369525/kamala-harris-housing-plan-corporate-landlords-homeownership">key to building wealth</a>, so they reasonably want their property values to keep rising. For renters, on the other hand, any increase in housing costs is a loss. So while renters might want lawmakers to make room for more housing, <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/04/14/opinion/lexington-town-meeting-zoning-reform/">homeowners often resist</a> any change that could make their home prices stagnate.<br><br>This is one theme we’ll be exploring in Within Our Means — who stands to benefit and who stands to lose from the policies our lawmakers choose to pursue. We’ll also be looking at questions about fairness, political viability, and why antipoverty programs ought to be viewed as investments rather than handouts. And though we’ll often look at economic arguments, we also won’t shy away from arriving at morally driven conclusions. Sometimes, a program that helps the most vulnerable people is still worth paying for even if it doesn’t necessarily help the economy grow.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>It doesn’t have to be this way</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even when divergent interests exist — like those between renters and homeowners — change is possible: Lexington <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/04/13/business/with-high-costs-little-new-housing-lexington-becomes-first-town-meet-ambitious-new-zoning-law/">ended up approving</a> the necessary zoning changes to build more housing, and <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/boston-business-journal/brookline-oks-zoning-changes-aimed-at-increasing-multi-family-housing/3191287/#:~:text=Brookline%20is%20now%20one%20of,MBTA%20stations%20as%20of%20right.">neighboring towns followed</a> its lead.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This was not, by any means, an inevitable or easy outcome. For <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/the-second-and-third-battle-of-lexington">many decades</a>, Lexington and its neighbors had been <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/05/17/opinion/brookline-housing-zoning-mbta-communities-harvard-street/">symbols of liberal hypocrisy</a> — the kinds of places where you might see “Black Lives Matter” and “refugees are welcome” signs, but vehement opposition to any new housing project that would help desegregate the region.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But one lesson out of Lexington is that sometimes people need a push. It wasn’t just that the town residents had a sudden change of heart — though some residents <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-massachusetts-town-leads-a-way-out-of-the-housing-crisis">had clearly been troubled</a> by their own history. The state <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2024/05/09/mbta-communities-act-zoning-map">had enacted a law</a> requiring jurisdictions served by public transit to authorize building more multifamily housing if they wanted to receive certain state funding. Whether the town ends up building the housing units that would make the suburb more affordable depends on whether residents put their money where their mouth is. But at least now, the door has been opened.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of the changes needed to eradicate poverty are small, unsexy bureaucratic adjustments, like local zoning reforms in Lexington and elsewhere. Others require an ambitious rethinking.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The project of ending poverty will be costly, but it’s long been clear <a href="https://prospect.org/power/much-money-take-eliminate-poverty-america/">that America can afford it</a>. If more than two-thirds of household wealth is <a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/institute-for-economic-equity/the-state-of-us-wealth-inequality">concentrated among the top 10 percent</a> while the bottom half of households own a mere 2.5 percent, then nobody should be living in squalor.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Now there is nothing new about poverty,” <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/02/martin-luther-king-hungry-club-forum/552533/">Martin Luther King, Jr. said nearly 60 years ago.</a> “What is new at this point though, is that we now have the resources, we now have the skills, we now have the techniques to get rid of poverty. And the question is whether our nation has the will.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But is climate despair really as tempting and reasonable as it seems?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The problem isn’t imaginary. Climate change is real and terrifying, but even if it’s as bad as the worst predictions suggest, do we gain anything by resigning ourselves to that fate? What effect might our despair have on our ability to act in the present?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Is our fatalism undercutting our capacity to tackle this problem?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On a recent episode of <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area"><em>The Gray Area</em></a>, I invited Ayana Elizabeth Johnson on to talk about how we might collectively address climate change without falling into despair or getting mired in false hope. She’s a marine biologist, a co-founder of the non-profit think tank Urban Ocean Lab, and the author of a new book called <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/645855/what-if-we-get-it-right-by-ayana-elizabeth-johnson/"><em>What If We Get it Right?</em></a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a curated series of essays and poetry and conversations with a wide range of people who are all, in their own ways, trying to build a better future. And this is not a blindly optimistic book: The point <em>isn’t</em> that everything is fine. The point is that we have to act as though the future is a place we actually want to live in — not centuries into the distant future but now and in the decades to come.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to Johnson, there are already many concrete climate solutions. If we were motivated by a belief in a better tomorrow — not a worse one — we would implement more of those solutions (and find new ones).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, if you’re someone looking for inspiration, or reasons to feel hopeful — or, even better, for guidance on what to do and where to start — then this book, and this conversation with Johnson, is for you.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You&#8217;re a marine biologist, which I think is a standard top-five dream job for kids. Was that your gateway to environmentalism? Is that why you do this work? </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Ayana Elizabeth Johnson</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Super common dream job — like many 5- to 10-year-olds are very into marine biology as a life path. But I was really just a kid who loved nature, which is honestly not very unique. How many kids like bugs and fireflies and shooting stars and octopuses and autumn leaves and all the rest of it? I was just like, “This all seems very cool.” That innate curiosity — that <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/biophilia">biophilia</a>, as E.O. Wilson calls it, the magnificent entomologist — is just part of who we are as humans. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s normal to love the world. It&#8217;s less common to make that your job. But of course, once you fall in love with nature — whether it’s with one ecosystem or a few specific species — and you find out that it’s threatened, you&#8217;re like, “Wait a second, what are we doing about this? Is there a grown-up who&#8217;s already on top of this? Is this not sorted? Seems like we should protect forests and coral reefs and all the rest.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">My mom was cleaning out the closet and found these old school papers, and apparently I was writing the same essays since I was like 10 about nature being great and how we should protect it. So, it wasn&#8217;t always going to be the ocean. I wanted to become a park ranger at one point, an environmental lawyer at another. But the ocean seemed like it needed more advocates at the particular moment that I was thinking about graduate school. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You open your book by saying that any time you tell people that you do climate work, they invariably ask, and I&#8217;m quoting you — “how fucked are we?” Well, Ayana, how fucked are we? </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Ayana Elizabeth Johnson</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We&#8217;re pretty fucked, but there&#8217;s a lot we could do to have a better possible future. And I think it&#8217;s important to always hold both of those things together.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We have already changed the climate. We are already seeing the intense heat waves and floods and droughts and wildfires and hurricanes. All of that is already supercharged by our changed climate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there&#8217;s still so much we can do. We basically have the solutions we need. We&#8217;re just being really slow at deploying them, at implementing them. We already know how to transition to renewable energy and stop spewing fossil fuels. We know how to protect and restore ecosystems that are absorbing all this carbon. We know how to green buildings, insulate buildings, shift to better public transit, improve our food system — the solutions are all right there. My book has a reality check chapter where I lay out all the bad news, but that&#8217;s three pages. And then the rest of the book asks, what are we going to do about it? </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There&#8217;s no point anymore in talking about how to solve the problem of climate change, right? I mean, that ship has sailed. It&#8217;s all about adaptation now.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Ayana Elizabeth Johnson</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yeah. I mean, the climate has already changed. There&#8217;s not a time machine back to before we put a completely mind-boggling amount of excess carbon into the atmosphere. Whether and how well we address the climate crisis determines the outcomes of life on Earth for all 8 million species and whether hundreds of millions of people live or die, and how well we all can live. So even though perfection is not an option, there&#8217;s such a wide range of possible futures, and we just need to make sure we get the best possible one. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is really about degrees of suffering and the consequences of specific choices we make — or won&#8217;t make, as it might be. The difference between temperature spikes of 2 and 4 degrees is the difference between lots of people living and dying. Right? </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Ayana Elizabeth Johnson</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s easier for me to think about it in terms of the human body running a fever: the difference between you having a fever of 100 and 102 or 103 is a huge difference. And that&#8217;s the level of sensitivity to temperature that all species and ecosystems have. If we can prevent a half a degree of warming or a degree of warming, that actually makes a big difference. It&#8217;s worth the effort.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">People like to use different words to describe the project ahead of us — words like “sustainability” or “revolution.” You like to use the word “transformation.” Why is that a better way to frame this? </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Ayana Elizabeth Johnson</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The two words that I pair together are “possibility” and “transformation.” There’s this wide spectrum of possible futures. I&#8217;m not an optimist. I&#8217;m not particularly hopeful given human history because we don&#8217;t have a great track record of addressing collectively major challenges that we face. There are some important exceptions to that, but the sense of possibility really drives me because the future is not yet written. Like, what if we just wrote a better one than the trajectory that we&#8217;re on? </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How do we reshape and reimagine how we live on this planet and with each other? I can get excited about possibility and transformation — like, what kind of future do we want to create together?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Ayana Elizabeth Johnson</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Okay, you can’t see me right now but I&#8217;m wiggling — I’m wiggling my fingers, gesturing with like, possibility, excitement, sparkles. I just feel like we need to be asking more big questions of ourselves and each other in this moment. We&#8217;re at this inflection point in human history. We either get our shit together or we don&#8217;t. And obviously I would like us to at least try. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But you don&#8217;t like the word “sustainable,” right? You feel like that&#8217;s setting the bar too low? </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Ayana Elizabeth Johnson</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s sort of just an <em>everywhere word</em>. It is useful — but it doesn&#8217;t have a lot of meaning. It&#8217;s very general. A useful analog I&#8217;ve heard is: If someone asked you how your marriage was going and you were like, “Eh, it&#8217;s sustainable,” I would probably say, “Well, okay, don&#8217;t want to trade lives with you.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, yes, I would say we should set a higher bar than sustainability, especially given that we&#8217;ve already degraded nature so much that I don&#8217;t want to just sustain what we have. I want to protect and restore.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A beautiful question you pose in your book is: What if climate adaptation is beautiful? So, let’s talk about that. What if climate adaptation <em>is</em> beautiful? What then? Is it rainbows and sunshine? What are the kind of things we have to look forward to?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Ayana Elizabeth Johnson</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, I think we will always have rainbows and sunshine. That&#8217;s the good news. But imagine if we were just deliberate about building things that were aesthetically pleasing and durable and could be deconstructed and repurposed instead of demolishing things. Some cities and towns are now passing essentially deconstruction ordinances that say you have to take apart buildings instead of demolishing them, instead of just pulverizing everything and sending it to the landfill. You have to take it apart so the pieces can be reused like Legos, which seems obvious, almost like, “Why wouldn&#8217;t we always have been doing that?”  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are so many choices that we&#8217;re currently making that shape our societal trajectory. Every day, we are building a piece of the future, something that will be here in 10 years or a century or more. So let&#8217;s just be really thoughtful about all that and make it nice. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Are you encouraged by the direction of the climate movement as it stands at the moment? What are your major concerns?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Ayana Elizabeth Johnson</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">My primary concern is that we&#8217;re just not moving fast enough, given that we have basically all the solutions that we need to begin to make a difference. It&#8217;s just incredibly frustrating how politics are holding us back. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I mean, in this country, there’s division between the two major parties about whether climate change exists and whether it&#8217;s something we should address, which is just so retrograde, I don&#8217;t even know where to start. And it&#8217;s especially frustrating because most Republican politicians are literally just pretending they don&#8217;t think it exists; they are fully aware that climate science is real, but it&#8217;s untenable politically for them to admit that. That&#8217;s a huge part of why we&#8217;re in this mess, as well as the fact that the fossil fuel lobby is ridiculously powerful in this country. And, you know, so many politicians are bought and paid for in one way or another, even though the fossil fuel industry doesn’t account for very many jobs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then you have the banking sector, which is funding all these fossil fuel corporations to continue expanding their extraction and infrastructure. Since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015, 60 banks have provided 6.9 trillion in financing to fossil fuel companies. But the top four US banks alone, JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America, have provided almost $1.5 trillion to finance fossil fuel companies.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, yeah, if you have your money in any of those banks, I would encourage you to do something like move your retirement savings to a place that does not make the problem worse.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What would be the difference between a Harris administration and another Trump administration? What are the stakes on the climate front?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Ayana Elizabeth Johnson</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The stakes are sky high. There are actually graphs projecting the difference in greenhouse gas emissions between the two.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s really remarkable because on one hand, you have Vice President Harris, who was the deciding vote in passing the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest ever investment in climate solutions in world history. This Biden-Harris administration has created the American Climate Corps that has put tens of thousands of young people to work implementing climate solutions from reducing wildfire risk to installing solar panels to replanting wetlands. We have a loan program office in the Department of Energy that has hundreds of billions of dollars that they&#8217;re giving out to businesses that are figuring out this renewable energy transition. All of that could be completely wiped out, essentially on day one of a Trump administration.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And so on the other hand, you have in Trump a candidate who has offered to fossil fuel executives that if they donate $1 billion to his presidential campaign, he will basically do their bidding once he gets into the White House. That is how stark a difference this is.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s part of the book where you write — I&#8217;m quoting again— “Fuck hope. What&#8217;s the strategy?” Do you feel like we, meaning all of us collectively, have a clear, concrete strategy for creating a better future in the face of climate change? Or are we going to keep doing what we&#8217;ve been doing?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Ayana Elizabeth Johnson</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is where I think media, Hollywood, music, art, culture makers broadly matter so much. I cannot literally show you what the future could look like. I can talk about it. I can write about it. I can interview people about it. I can, as I did for this book, commission art about it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But if it’s possible to go through our day-to-day and not encounter anything about climate, that’s a huge problem. Right now, climate coverage accounts for less than 1 percent of the minutes on major TV news stations; that’s actually gone down from recent years, so we&#8217;re going in the wrong direction.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If this is not part of our day-to-day exposure, then it&#8217;s just always on the back burner. There&#8217;s always something more important. And we&#8217;re thinking about climate as something separate from our other concerns, whereas it&#8217;s actually just the context within which everything else right now is playing out. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So there&#8217;s a chapter in the book called “I Dream of Climate RomComs,” where I interview producer Franklin Leonard, founder of The Blacklist out in Hollywood, and Adam McKay, filmmaker, writer, director, about the role of Hollywood in this. Because basically, to date, Hollywood has just shown us the apocalypse, the fire and brimstone, <em>The</em> <em>Day After Tomorrow</em> kind of stuff. And there are very few examples of not like utopian rose-colored glasses stuff, but like literally, what if we just used the solutions we had and projected that forward? What would that look like?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Islamist militant organization and Lebanese political party, has been in conflict with Israel since its founding decades ago. Now the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-airstrikes-28-september-2024-c4751957433ff944c4eb06027885a973" data-type="link" data-id="https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-airstrikes-28-september-2024-c4751957433ff944c4eb06027885a973">death</a> of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in <a href="https://x.com/michaelh992/status/1839993868479074337" data-type="link" data-id="https://x.com/michaelh992/status/1839993868479074337">an Israeli airstrike on Saturday</a>, threatens to take that conflict to a new and even more destructive level. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Israeli military carried out a massive airstrike on Hezbollah’s headquarters in Beirut on Friday in an effort to target the reclusive Nasrallah, who has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/world/middleeast/hassan-nasrallah-hezbollah-leader.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/world/middleeast/hassan-nasrallah-hezbollah-leader.html">led the militant group</a> for more than three decades. At least six people were killed in the strikes and more than 90 were injured, with the toll expected to rise. Israel had reportedly been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/world/middleeast/why-israel-assassinate-nasrallah.html?smid=url-share" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/world/middleeast/why-israel-assassinate-nasrallah.html?smid=url-share">tracking</a> Nasrallah’s movements for months, and struck before he had the opportunity to escape.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nasrallah’s assassination marks a new point in the years-long conflict between Hezbollah and Israel.<strong> </strong>The intensity of the hostilities has waxed and waned over the years, hitting a relative low point before the war in Gaza broke out. The months since October 7, though, have brought a dangerous escalation in fighting that increasingly risks engulfing Hezbollah, Lebanon, and the broader region in all-out war. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire since the war in Gaza started. Hezbollah has vowed not to relent until a ceasefire is reached in Gaza, where more than&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-820486">41,000 Palestinians</a> have been killed. The hostilities have primarily taken the form of airstrikes and have deepened as ceasefire negotiations have stagnated, displacing more than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-war-impact.html?smid=url-share">more than 100,000 people</a> who face daily tit-for-tat attacks on both sides of Lebanon’s border with Israel.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah is allied with Hamas, the Gaza-based group behind the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Both Hamas and Hezbollah have vowed to destroy Israel, have ties to Iran, and are considered terrorist organizations by many countries. While Israeli forces may have significantly weakened Hamas’s capabilities, however, it would likely be much more costly for Israel to go to war with Hezbollah, which is generally considered the most formidable militia group in the region.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah boasts a vast weapons arsenal, including as many as <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/9/20/hezbollah-to-israel-precision-missiles-now-obtained">120,000 missiles</a>, and has deployed it with increasing success inside Israel’s borders since the war in Gaza began. It has demonstrated advanced military tactics such as <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/hezbollah-introduces-new-weapons-tactics-against-israel-as-war-in-gaza-drags-on">using drones to fire missiles at key Israeli targets</a> and effective intelligence capabilities including <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/tool-of-first-resort-israel-hamas-war-in-cyber/">digital espionage</a>. It also has the support of not just Iran’s autocratic regime, but also Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad after it helped him stay in power during the country’s ongoing civil war.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, Israel has exposed some of Hezbollah’s weaknesses. Apparently infiltrating the group’s communications network, Israel reportedly <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/372399/pager-explosions-lebanon-syria-hezbollah-israel-gaza">planted explosives</a> in pagers and walkie-talkies used by members of Hezbollah, detonating them from afar and killing some of its members in Lebanon and Syria. Israel has also assassinated <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-08-13/hezbollah-israel-assassinations">top Hezbollah commanders</a> over the course of the war in Gaza, and now has successfully killed its longtime leader.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While Hezbollah said in a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah-killed-beirut-airstrikes/story?id=114310729" data-type="link" data-id="https://abcnews.go.com/International/hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah-killed-beirut-airstrikes/story?id=114310729">statement</a> after Nasrallah’s death that it will “continue its jihad in confronting the enemy, supporting Gaza and Palestine, and defending Lebanon,” it’s far from clear what capabilities the group will have in the wake of the death of its leader and many of its top commanders. Nor is it<strong> </strong>clear that Hezbollah wants to be responsible for starting a regional war, especially after the group’s last war with Israel, in 2006, led to such heavy casualties. If anything can be learned from that war, it’s that conflict between Hezbollah and Israel would lead to much bloodshed on both sides as well as challenges for their international allies.</p>

But the groups did not elaborate further on their intentions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a delicate and possibly existential<strong> </strong>moment for Hezbollah, an organization whose primary goal is eliminating the state of Israel but that has also amassed significant political power in Lebanon that it is fearful of losing. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“They can take the whole region into a very hard war,” said <a href="https://english.tau.ac.il/profile/abedkan">Abed Kanaaneh</a>, a professor of Middle Eastern studies at Tel Aviv University and author of <em>Understanding Hezbollah: The Hegemony of Resistance</em>. “But they have their own interests, and they need to sustain their popularity in Lebanon. So they have their own calculations to make.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hezbollah’s origins and ideology, briefly explained&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah was founded in Lebanon in 1982 by men inspired by former Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini’s radical brand of Shia theology. The organization was among many that resisted Israel’s invasion of Lebanon that year following an assassination attempt on the Israeli ambassador to Britain orchestrated by Palestinian militants. Though the assassination was carried out by a rebel offshoot of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), a militant group, Israel sought to eliminate all Palestinian militant groups operating from Lebanon.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Following bloody fighting that left <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1982/09/03/war-casualties-put-at-48000-in-lebanon/cf593941-6067-4239-a453-71bdcaf9eba0/">more than 17,000 dead</a>, Israel succeeded in driving out those militants through a US-brokered agreement in 1983, which brought an official end to the war and allowed the PLO to relocate to Tunisia. But Israel continued to occupy Lebanon, creating a militarized security zone in the south that it maintained until 2000 with the stated purpose of protecting Israelis from attacks by Lebanese militants. The occupation, however, “creat[ed] conditions for the establishment and proliferation of Hezbollah,” by angering and radicalizing the local Shia community, wrote Augustus Richard Norton in his book, <em>Hezbollah: A Short History.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Early Hezbollah supporters rally outside the bombed US embassy in 1986, listening to speeches by political and religious leaders.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel<a href="https://ciaotest.cc.columbia.edu/olj/meria/meria997_eisenberg.html"> set up permanent infrastructure</a> in the security zone — military bases, new roads, road signs in Hebrew, and detention camps that Norton notes became notorious for their brutality. When militant groups, including a fledgling Hezbollah, tried to drive out the Israeli forces, civilians were caught in the crossfire.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile,<a href="https://www.vox.com/iran"> Iran</a> was nurturing Hezbollah, offering it training, funding, and weapons. The Iranian government saw Hezbollah as a vehicle to indirectly attack Israel, which it regarded as an<a href="https://www.stimson.org/2023/what-drives-israel-iran-hostility-how-might-it-be-resolved/"> illegitimate state</a> and encapsulation of<a href="https://theconversation.com/the-long-history-of-iranian-distrust-of-the-west-4480"> Western imperialism</a>, as well as a promising group that could<a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/hezbollahs-record-war-politics"> spread their ideas of Shia Islamic revolution</a> across the Middle East. The willingness of Hezbollah’s early leaders to<a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-hezbollah#:~:text=Hezbollah%20bills%20itself%20as%20a,allegiance%20to%20Iran's%20supreme%20leader."> pledge loyalty</a> to Iran’s then-leaders helped facilitate bonds as well.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah shares Iran’s Shia revolutionary ideology, and they both support Palestinians and oppose Israel. But there is disagreement among experts as to how much Iran is really calling the shots with Hezbollah. Some say Hezbollah is an Iranian proxy;<a href="https://tcf.org/experts/thanassis-cambanis/"> Thanassis Cambanis</a>, director of Century International and author of <em>A Privilege to Die: Inside Hezbollah’s Legions and Their Endless War Against Israel</em>, said their relationship can be described as “very closely allied and ideologically aligned with a lot of shared interests,” but Hezbollah also has a “great deal of its own autonomy” and “shouldn’t be understood as a traditional proxy.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Iran has continued to fund Hezbollah over the years, and while it’s unclear exactly how much the organization has received, the US State Department estimates it at<a href="https://www.state.gov/reports/country-reports-on-terrorism-2021/"> hundreds of millions of dollars</a> annually. Most of that goes to Hezbollah’s military wing, and that figure includes weapons supplied by Iran, including an arsenal of drones and rockets. But Hezbollah also has other revenue sources, both legal and illegal: through the Lebanese state, smuggling, money laundering, and other forms of organized crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah laid out its ideology in a 1985 document addressed to the “Downtrodden in Lebanon and in the World.” It identified the United States and the Soviet Union as being among “the countries of the arrogant world” that inflict suffering on those less powerful, and explicitly rejected both the East and the West. It accused the US of using Israel as a “spearhead” against Muslims in Lebanon, and justified fighting the US, often by violent means, as an exercise of its “legitimate right to defend our Islam and the dignity of our nation.” It laid out a vision for Lebanon as an Iranian-style theocracy, though it emphasized the goal of Lebanese self-determination.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And finally, it opposed any attempts to negotiate with Israel, seeking the country’s withdrawal from Lebanon as the first step toward “its final obliteration from existence and the liberation of venerable Jerusalem from the talons of occupation.” The document made clear Hezbollah saw (and still sees) Israel’s existence as a threat to Muslims throughout the region. In that sense, it found common ground with Sunni Muslim militant groups like Hamas, though Hamas’s reasons for wanting Israel destroyed were slightly different, focusing less on regional factors than on the establishment of an independent state in historical <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Palestine">Palestine</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah has hewed closely to this agenda in the years since, even as it has evolved from a guerrilla group to a more professionalized resistance organization, political party, and provider of social services in Lebanon. It did, however, temper its Islamist rhetoric somewhat in<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-hezbollah/hezbollah-cuts-islamist-rhetoric-in-new-manifesto-idUSTRE5AT3VK20091130"> an updated 2009 manifesto</a>, noting that making diverse Lebanon into a state that follows Islamic law is an unrealistic goal and affirming a commitment to “the achievement of true democracy.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At present, Hezbollah has some<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10703"> 20,000 estimated active members</a> and is popular among the Shia, who represent about a third of the Lebanese population. The most heavily armed non-state actor in the world, Hezbollah has a<a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/security-aviation/2023-10-23/ty-article-magazine/150-000-rockets-and-missiles-the-weapons-israel-would-encounter-in-a-war-with-hezbollah/0000018b-573d-d2b2-addf-777df6210000"> large arsenal</a> of long-range missiles that can reach well within Israel’s borders, as well as a comprehensive air defense system and commando force. It has refused to give up its arms despite<a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20091111-hezbollah-warns-new-government-avoid-arms-issue"> repeated</a> domestic and international calls for disarmament, arguing that it<a href="https://mepc.org/journal/rethinking-hezbollahs-disarmament"> needs its weapons</a> so long as Israel continues to occupy what it claims is Lebanese territory in the Golan Heights (territory that Israel annexed in a move that has been recognized only by the US and no other country).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, Hezbollah faces the challenge of balancing its revolutionary aims with governance — and Nasrallah, who helmed Hezbollah since 1992, had at times been criticized within Lebanon and the greater Arab world for putting too much weight on the former. But Nasrallah was also a charismatic leader and orator who bolstered Hezbollah’s legitimacy through a sophisticated communication strategy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“They are cosmopolitan and seasoned professionals, even in pursuit of problematic goals,” said Cambanis<em>.</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is Hezbollah a militant group, a political party, or both?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US designated Hezbollah as a foreign terrorist organization in 1997. Many other countries and organizations have followed suit, though some, including the<a href="https://www.vox.com/european-union"> European Union</a>, distinguish between Hezbollah’s political and militant arms.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some argue that’s a distinction without a difference. Unlike Hamas — in which the political and military leadership are separate and operate out of different locations — Hezbollah is a “very centrally controlled, unified organization,” Cambanis said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Their political leaders all have a military background,” he said. “Their resistance structure, to use their term, necessitates the armed struggle and the political struggle being inextricable.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah became associated with terrorism in the 1980s, during a time when it rejected the notion of participating in Lebanese politics. It viewed the political system, which was designed to split power between the country’s largest religious groups based on their size at the end of France’s dominion, as irredeemably corrupt and unfair. So Hezbollah dedicated itself to pursuing the objective of replacing the secular government with an Islamist one.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Its first step was ridding Lebanon of the foreign influences it believed to be the source of political strife: France and the US. Both countries had deployed peacekeeping forces to Lebanon amid the 1982 Israeli invasion and outbreak of civil war. From the US perspective, the most devastating <a href="https://www.vox.com/terrorism">terrorist attack</a> was a 1983 suicide bombing on its military barracks in Beirut, an event that killed more than 300 American and French troops and Lebanese civilians. The Americans blamed Hezbollah for the attack and pulled all of their forces from the country. There was also the June 1985 hijacking of TWA flight 847 to Beirut, in which militants who later escaped without being captured killed a passenger and threatened to kill more unless Israel released hundreds of Lebanese prisoners. (Hezbollah denies involvement in either incident.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Between 1982 and 1992, Hezbollah took more than 100 foreign hostages, mostly Westerners, seemingly with the aim of winning concessions from Western countries. In one such incident, known as the Iran-Contra affair, then-US President Ronald Reagan traded weapons to Iran, which was then subject to an arms embargo, for the release of hostages held by Hezbollah. Hezbollah also kidnapped Israeli soldiers, conducted cross-border raids on the Israeli border, and fired rockets and missiles into Israel, again with the goal of ending Israel’s occupation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those tactics continued through the 1990s, even as Hezbollah changed its strategy and decided to enter politics. Hezbollah members were elected to the Lebanese Parliament for the first time in 1992, following the end of the 15-year Lebanese civil war that had seen various religious and secular subgroups clash. It was then that Lebanese leaders associated with Hezbollah came to recognize the “need to come to a modus vivendi with the state rather than remain outside the political system and judge it as abhorrent in strictly Islamic terms,” Norton wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Interestingly, Hezbollah built its political following on non-religious themes, which Norton identifies as “battling economic exploitation and underdevelopment, inequities in the political system, personal freedom and opportunity, and, of course, security.” But it wasn’t until after 2000, when Israel finally withdrew from the security zone it had established in southern Lebanon, that Hezbollah really gained popularity.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though Israeli leaders insisted that their withdrawal from Lebanon was a unilateral political decision,<a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/twenty-years-after-the-israeli-withdrawal-from-lebanon-hezbollah-faces-host-of-challenges/"> many Lebanese credited Hezbollah</a> with driving out the army by stepping up its attacks. That — along with Hezbollah’s investment in schools, clinics, youth programs, and other social services — drove up the organization’s profile in Lebanon. It went on to progressively gain seats in Parliament over the years and to run a coalition government alongside its sometimes political rival Amal, which also draws its power from Lebanon’s Shia community. In the most recent Lebanese elections in 2022, Hezbollah won 13 of 128 seats, though the party and its allies lost their majority.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, Hezbollah’s emergence as a political force didn’t mean that the group abandoned its violent tactics, at times undermining its authority as a resistance group. For instance, the United Nations found that four Hezbollah members were responsible for the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in a car bombing that also killed 21 bystanders. And in 2006, the organization killed three Israeli soldiers and kidnapped two others in a cross-border raid. It failed to anticipate the disproportionate Israeli response and the ensuing war, which claimed the lives of more than 1,000 Lebanese and 160 Israelis. Neither side won; a UN-brokered ceasefire ended the conflict after a little over a month.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah has also proved willing to enact violence at the<a href="https://www.mei.edu/publications/hezbollahs-regional-activities-support-irans-proxy-networks"> behest of Iran’s proxy networks</a>, especially following its involvement in the Syrian civil war defending the Assad regime and after the 2020 assassination of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commander Gen. Qassem Soleimani. Hezbollah has deployed militants to other countries — including Iraq and Yemen — to train these proxy groups and fight alongside them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Along with Iran, Hezbollah is closely linked to Syria, though their relationship has been more one of convenience than shared ideology. Syria has long served as a conduit for weapons supply lines between Iran and Syria. As a result and at<a href="https://www.mei.edu/publications/hezbollahs-regional-activities-support-irans-proxy-networks"> Iran’s urging</a>, Nasrallah committed Hezbollah to “<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10703">do everything in [its] power”</a> to protect dictator Bashar al-Assad’s government from largely Sunni rebel groups after civil war broke out in 2011. In a sign of Hezbollah’s role in the war there, news of his death <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/world/middleeast/hezbollahs-victims-are-expressing-relief-at-its-disarray.html?smid=url-share" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/world/middleeast/hezbollahs-victims-are-expressing-relief-at-its-disarray.html?smid=url-share">was met</a> with jubilation in some parts of Syria.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah helped turn the tide of the war in Assad’s favor. When they withdrew most of their forces from Syria in 2019, they left <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/israel/2019-03-08/will-hezbollahs-rise-be-its-downfall">arguably stronger militarily</a> than they were before — raising concerns that they could pose a formidable foe should they enter the conflict with Israel.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hezbollah’s standing — domestically and internationally — is not what it once was&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although Hezbollah’s military wing came out of the last two decades of conflict battle-hardened, its violent adventurism has caused its political wing a lot of harm.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah lost some of its luster domestically and regionally as a result of the 2006 war’s death and destruction. In addition to the many casualties, Israeli attacks led to<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-war-cost/factbox-costs-of-war-and-recovery-in-lebanon-and-israel-idUSL0822571220070709"> $2.8 billion in direct damage</a>. While Hezbollah (using funding from Iran)<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-war-reconstruction/lebanons-postwar-reconstruction-far-from-complete-idUSL0922501920070709"> poured hundreds of millions</a> of dollars into compensation and rebuilding efforts, Lebanon<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/broken-lebanon-cannot-afford-war-hezbollah-knows-it-2023-10-26/"> still took years to recover</a>. The organization’s involvement in Syria <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-hezbollah#chapter-title-0-6">hurt it politically</a>, too. In Lebanon, voters believed that foreign intervention had come at the expense of their domestic concerns, and throughout the region, Sunnis expressed great disillusionment with Hezbollah; they saw the group as having propped up Assad, a vicious leader who routinely oppresses his people.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent years, Hezbollah’s political capital has been further reduced by political issues.<a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2020/1/19/21073004/beirut-lebanon-protests-300-injured"> Mass protests spurred by economic troubles</a> undermined support for Hezbollah and the country’s political elites in 2019. Prime Minister Saad Hariri<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/29/lebanon-prime-minister-saad-hariri-resigns-after-mass-protests"> resigned under public pressure</a>, despite Hezbollah’s desire to keep him in office. Hezbollah members actively sought to suppress the protest movement,<a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/10/29/774356174/lebanons-prime-minister-hariri-resigns-after-weeks-of-protests"> setting fire</a> to a camp of anti-government protesters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah’s popularity<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/is-hezbollah-overplaying-its-hand-inside-lebanon/"> again took a hit</a> following the<a href="https://www.vox.com/world/21451455/beirut-port-explosion-lebanon-political-crisis-hezbollah"> 2020 explosion of a Beirut port</a>, which the organization controlled. The group also resisted calls for an international investigation of the incident, much to the chagrin of the Lebanese public.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even before these issues, Hezbollah was a polarizing force in Lebanese society. The organization has solidified Shia support by being effective in local government and supporting social services but has often struggled to expand its sphere of influence. Lebanon is a fractured society, with different religious and secular groups jockeying for power, and Hezbollah is hated by those who oppose its worldview, with little room for a middle ground.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“They are successful at winning very deep loyalty from their supporters,” Cambanis said. “And they’re successful at being able to violently coerce and intimidate their opponents.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a<a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52750dd3e4b08c252c723404/t/618dbc443f3402756b4b3f35/1636678726963/Lebanon+2021+FINAL.pdf"> 2021 Zogby/NC State University poll</a>, 52 percent of Lebanese said they did not think Hezbollah promotes stability, though significant majorities of Shia, Druze, and Christians — all groups with leaders who’ve partnered with Hezbollah in the past — said that it did. The question is whether these cracks in Hezbollah’s support can be contained as the organization faces the prospect of an all-out war with Israel.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Lebanese are okay with the limited war that Hezbollah is [waging] against Israel right now, but if it will become total war or much deeper war, I can say that Hezbollah’s support will drop off,” Kanaaneh said.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s next for Hezbollah?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah has been reluctant to engage Israel in open combat since the devastating 2006 war, but the situation in Gaza appears to have changed that.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah has “built their own narrative and public image of being part of the resistance axis” around the Palestinian cause, Kanaaneh said. While it was previously reluctant to declare war against Israel in part because of the suffering it would inflict on Lebanon, the situation in Gaza has become dire.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel has decimated Gaza as well as the ranks of Hezbollah’s Sunni ally in Hamas, its link to the broader Islamic world. The fighting has already had a destabilizing effect on life in Lebanon, with tens of thousands of civilians displaced by the conflict and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/5/lebanese-grapple-with-fear-rage-and-tough-choices-as-regional-war-looms">living in fear</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah and Israel have <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/coming-conflict-hezbollah">exchanged thousands of attacks</a>, mostly in the form of airstrikes concentrated on both sides of Lebanon’s border with Israel. Hezbollah has also deployed forces and fired anti-tank guided missiles at Israel from this border region in <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/coming-conflict-hezbollah">violation of a United Nations resolution</a> passed after the 2006 war.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel has responded with targeted assassinations of Hezbollah leaders. That notably included top Hezbollah commander <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/how-israel-killed-a-ghost-73e6db68?mod=hp_lead_pos7">Fuad Shukr</a>, who was drawn onto the seventh floor of his building in Beirut after receiving a mysterious phone call and killed in a missile strike.

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Hezbollah opens up a full-scale war against Israel, it could play out much like the 2006 conflict where there were no victors, though it could potentially be even bloodier. In 2006, Hezbollah was estimated to have 12,000 missiles; now, it is thought to have 10 times that. Its troops have far more experience, including in urban combat, than they did before. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, the last few weeks have shown just how deeply Israel has penetrated Hezbollah, to the point of being able to locate and assassinate Nasrallah, as well as a number of other top leaders. Israel has signaled that it will not let up in its campaign against the militant group, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-lebanon-united-nations-12e02fd82f35a8438aa907ca6762bac0">telling</a> the UN on Friday that it would continue the fight against Hezbollah and Hamas in Gaza until “total victory.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Regardless of how any fighting turns out, “everybody will lose from this,” Kanaaneh said. </p>

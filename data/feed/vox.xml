<p class="has-text-align-none">If Vice President Kamala Harris becomes the Democratic presidential nominee, Republicans have a ready-made case against her: They can say she was President Joe Biden’s “border czar,” in charge of immigration and the border, and she failed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At least seven different speakers at the Republican National Convention over the last week have used that moniker to describe Harris, from the president of Goya Foods to&nbsp;anti-immigration activists to Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s just one problem. The vice president was never in charge of the border. That job belongs to Alejandro Mayorkas, the secretary of homeland security, and to Xavier Becerra, the secretary of health and human services.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, a combination of right-wing spin, media fascination during Harris’s early tenure, miscommunication from the White House, and growing migrant surges during the Biden presidency have all made that label stick. Now, it stands as one of the more serious challenges Harris faces, whether she’s the vice presidential or presidential nominee.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Where the “border czar” label began</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Referring to Harris as the&nbsp;“border czar” isn’t new. Right-wing media, anti-immigrant activists, and Republican politicians have been using the label for the vice president <a href="https://cis.org/Arthur/What-Border-Czar-Kamala-Harris-Doing-Border-Crisis">for years</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It has its roots in March 2021, when Biden announced that he would be giving Harris essentially the same assignment he got during his own vice presidency: coordinating diplomatic relationships to address the “root causes” of migration into the United States.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I’ve asked her, the VP, today — because she’s the most qualified person to do it — to lead our efforts with Mexico and the Northern Triangle and the countries that help — are going to need help in stemming the movement of so many folks, stemming the migration to our southern border,” Biden said during a White House meeting on migration on March 24, 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The idea behind this approach is a long-term strategy: Border surges were just one symptom of deeper economic, diplomatic, and security problems these countries face that cause people to make the trek north. The assignment was a bit cursed from the start —&nbsp;a “politically treacherous job with little short-term payoff,” as <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/newsletter/2022-02-16/essential-politics-kamala-harris-vp-portfolio-migration-voting-rights-essential-politics">it was described</a> by the Los Angeles Times — because any benefits from addressing these root causes would obviously take time to appear. Meanwhile, the border saw more legal as well as illegal crossings every month.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Senior White House officials who briefed reporters before the announcement emphasized at the time that this was a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/24/kamala-harris-immigration-border-surge-477810">diplomatic assignment</a>: a two-pronged approach to build diplomatic ties with these countries and to oversee investment and implementation of foreign aid to these countries to address infrastructure, grow business, and strengthen civil society.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From the start, though, media coverage and the White House’s communication about the role were muddled. Headlines described Harris as the “<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/24/kamala-harris-immigration-border-surge-477810">point person on immigration</a>” and “<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9444413/Kamala-Harris-not-visited-Mexico-border-taking-charge-migrant-crisis.html">placed in charge of migration crisis</a>,” while senior officials <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/confusion-clouds-harris-immigration-role-n1263671">later said</a> Harris would “oversee a whole-of-government approach” to dealing with migration. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The White House’s communications team spent much of that early time trying to clarify the assignment, but as migrant border crossings continued to rise, much of the press and the public’s attention became focused on why Harris and the administration were not more focused on addressing short-term problems.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Adding to the mess were Harris’s own missteps. She was widely criticized in the press for being defensive during her first <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/09/politics/kamala-harris-foreign-trip/index.html">international trips</a> to Mexico and Guatemala in June 2021, and by immigrant rights activists for a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/06/07/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-and-president-giammattei-of-guatemalain-joint-press-conference/">speech</a> in which she urged “folks in this region who are thinking about making that dangerous trek to the United States-Mexico border: Do not come. Do not come.” She also evaded questions about why neither she nor Biden had been to the southern border when she was talking about the border abroad, leading to criticism by Republicans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then came a <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/557282-vp-harris-not-discounting-concerns-about-events-at-us-border-during/">widely derided interview</a> with NBC News’ Lester Holt during that trip, in which she appeared to mock Holt’s question about why she hadn’t visited the southern border if she was working to try to stem the flow of migration north. “At some point, you know, we are going to the border,” Harris told Holt. “We’ve been to the border. So this whole thing about the border. We’ve been to the border. We’ve been to the border.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Holt pointed out that she hadn’t, she seemed to discount the question, replying that she hadn’t “been to Europe. And I mean, I don’t &#8230; understand the point that you’re making. I’m not discounting the importance of the border.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This was a significant moment in the context of Harris’s criticism: During this first year of the Biden-Harris term, Harris and her office were facing intense media scrutiny over the VP’s role, ability to communicate to the public, and her office’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/18/politics/ashley-etienne-kamala-harris/index.html">internal</a> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/01/politics/symone-sanders-leaving-white-house-harris/index.html">strife</a>. Questions <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/14/politics/kamala-harris-frustrating-start-vice-president/index.html">swirled</a> in the press about whether Harris was plugged into Biden’s inner circle, whether she had a discernible portfolio of assignments, and whether her team was equipped to help her perform her duties if they were at odds with the president’s staff or leaving her office entirely.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On top of all this, Harris got another doomed assignment: to lobby for <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/15/harris-voting-rights-push-527186">voting-rights reforms</a> in a tied Senate, where Biden and House Democrats’ legislative proposals could not pass a filibuster.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Border crossings would continue to surge over the next three years, further fueling criticism of Harris. As my colleague Nicole Narea <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24153132/us-border-crisis-mexico-migrant-immigration-asylum">has explained</a>, the nature of these immigration surges began to change, too, making Harris’s “root causes” work even more difficult:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">Under the Trump administration, most migrants arriving at the southern border were from Central America’s “Northern Triangle”: Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. In the last few years, however, the number of migrants coming from those countries has been eclipsed by those coming from South America — particularly Venezuela, Colombia, and Nicaragua — and the Caribbean, including Haiti and Cuba. They have been driven out by recent compounding political and economic crises and natural disasters in their home countries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Republicans and conservative commentators had a field day with all of this, picking on immigration as a key line of attack during the 2022 midterms. They introduced legislation tying Harris to the term “border czar,” introducing a “<a href="https://jackson.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=348">Border Czar Accountability Act</a>” and <a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hres253/BILLS-118hres253ih.pdf">resolutions</a> calling on Harris to be stripped of the assignment. They spent hours on cable news and in Congress talking about the Guatemala trip and the Holt interview. They ran ads during the midterms about immigration, tying Biden and Harris to the border “crisis.” <br><br>Ultimately, they managed to blur the line between the assignment Harris got and the worsening conditions at the southern border.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Why Republicans are zeroing in on this attack now</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Republican National Convention has now offered a preview of how this line of attack will be used against Harris as the general election nears.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Searches for the term have spiked recently, per Google Trends <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=border%20czar&amp;hl=en">data</a>, similarly to how they spiked when Harris was first given the root-causes assignment, before the 2022 midterm elections, and during previous moments of news coverage about the border.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Former presidential candidate Nikki Haley previewed on Tuesday night how Republicans plan to harness the&nbsp;confusion: “Kamala had one job. One job. And that was to fix the border,” she said. “Now imagine her in charge of the entire country.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other speakers this week have referenced “border czar Kamala Harris” being responsible for “encourag[ing] millions of illegals to invade America &#8230; and put[ting] the welfare of illegals over their own citizens,” as the Ohio GOP Senate candidate Bernie Moreno put it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even the Trump campaign’s chief has <a href="https://x.com/SmithInAmerica/status/1813978601609724108">acknowledged</a> this is their best line of attack against the VP.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The White House and the Biden campaign, meanwhile, don’t seem to have a robust answer to these attacks, calling them “lies” and “smears” while pointing to the vice president’s diplomatic work over the last few years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s been less media and White House attention paid to the actual assignment she was given, but the administration has <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/25/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-announces-new-initiatives-to-strengthen-the-u-s-guatemala-relationship-and-address-the-root-causes-of-migration-from-guatemala/">routinely</a> <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/19/report-on-the-u-s-strategy-for-addressing-the-root-causes-of-migration-in-central-america/">provided</a> <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/02/06/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-at-the-central-america-forward-launch-event/">updates</a> on the “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/25/fact-sheet-update-on-the-u-s-strategy-for-addressing-the-root-causes-of-migration-in-central-america-3/">Root Causes Strategy</a>.” She only visited Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico once during the first year of the assignments, though she did hold <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/07/statement-from-senior-advisor-and-chief-spokesperson-symone-sanders-on-vice-president-kamala-harriss-virtual-bilateral-meeting-with-president-andres-manuel-lopez-obrador-of-mexico/">virtual</a> and <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/readout-vice-president-kamala-harriss-meeting-with-mexican-president-andres-manuel-lopez">in</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORCyY2b5mgo">-person</a> <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/26/statement-by-senior-advisor-and-chief-spokesperson-symone-sanders-on-vice-president-kamala-harriss-virtual-bilateral-meeting-with-president-alejandro-giammattei-of-guatemala/">meetings</a> with heads of state from the region. Still, it doesn’t seem as though Central America or Mexico has been an actual focus for the vice president, especially since the midterm elections and the overturning of <em>Roe v. Wade.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A White House official pointed me to the visits and roundtables Harris has held on this assignment, citing $5.2 billion of investments Harris has announced in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador to expand internet access and combat corruption. A Biden campaign official, meanwhile, pointed to the attempts the White House made in 2021 to clarify Harris’s assignment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As I’ve written before, Republicans’ attacks on the Biden administration’s immigration efforts <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/361155/rnc-2024-republican-immigration-border-biden-policy-invasion-legal-gop">aren’t going to go away</a> anytime soon. The American public’s mood on immigration and the border has <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/351535/3-theories-for-americas-anti-immigrant-shift">soured dramatically</a> in the last two years, and the specifics of Harris’s original assignment may not matter to voters who just want less immigration, period. As long as the public continues its anti-immigration tilt, it seems likely the “border czar” nickname will be here to stay.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In late June, Democrats throughout the country simultaneously realized that their presidential nominee could <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357746/biden-trump-debate-democrats-replace-dnc">no longer reliably speak</a> in complete sentences.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President Joe Biden’s age was no secret, but the extent of his cognitive and rhetorical decline <a href="https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/whats-news/how-president-bidens-inner-circle-kept-his-signs-of-aging-under-wraps/e8688b6b-4160-4226-b442-d1c56bdfd502">had been closely guarded</a>. The president spoke in public far less often than his predecessors. He repeatedly <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2024/02/03/biden-turns-down-super-bowl-interview-for-second-straight-year/">turned down Super Bowl interviews</a>, rare opportunities to convey his message to a massive national audience.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This limited calendar set off alarm bells <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/16/opinion/ezra-klein-biden-audio-essay.html">among some pundits</a>. Still, it was possible to imagine that the White House team was unduly risk-averse. Biden’s age was undoubtedly a liability, and his rhetorical chops significantly diminished, but maybe he was still okay. Given widespread <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/02/16/senior-democrats-joe-biden-old-00083129">doubts about his vice president’s electability</a>, unifying behind Biden was plausibly the party’s best bet.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Until it wasn’t.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The president’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357788/biden-trump-debate-winners-losers">disastrous debate performance</a> broke through Democrats’ collective denial. The simplest explanation had been the correct one: The White House had been hiding Biden from the public because he had something to hide.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There was no precedent for the challenge this posed to the Democratic Party, and there was no straightforward mechanism for resolving it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For weeks, Democratic leaders floundered in search of a consensual path forward. Some <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360812/democrats-replace-biden-trump-shooting">entertained blindly following Biden</a> into the wilderness.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After some delay, however, party leaders prioritized their constituents’ interests in victory over their own desire to avoid blame or interpersonal conflict. Over the past 24 hours, it has become clear that the Democrats are in array.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Wednesday, ABC News <a href="https://x.com/jonkarl/status/1813713397437104272">revealed</a> that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer had personally told Biden last Saturday that he could best serve the party by getting out of the race. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/17/jeffries-schumer-biden-hurting-democrats/">told him the same</a>. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/nancy-pelosi-biden-conversation/index.html">told</a> the president that polling showed he could not beat former President Donald Trump and that staying in the race would destroy Democrats’ prospects of winning back control of the House.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When the president refused to take this advice, all three Democratic leaders evidently let word of their views leak. When confronted with reports of their private conversations with Biden, Pelosi, Schumer, and Jeffries all pointedly refused to deny the accuracy of such news stories.</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Understand the push to replace Biden</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">President Joe Biden has come under mounting pressure from Democrats to reconsider his 2024 reelection bid.</p>

</ul>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Also on Wednesday, the film producer Jeffrey Katzenberg — who has served as Biden’s campaign adviser and conduit to deep-pocketed Democrats in Hollywood and finance — <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/07/17/2024/donors-cash-is-drying-up-jeffrey-katzenberg-warns-biden-in-private-meeting">told the president</a> that donors were withdrawing their support out of a conviction that he cannot win, a development that would make it difficult to sustain an adequate presence on swing-state airwaves through November.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Around the same time, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2024/07/18/the-walls-close-in-around-biden-00169335">scrapped plans</a> to formally confirm Biden as the party’s nominee in a virtual roll call vote next week. That event had initially been scheduled when it looked as though waiting until the Democratic National Convention in late August to officially nominate a candidate would deprive the Democratic nominee of access to the ballot in Ohio. But the DNC persisted with plans for a roll call <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360917/biden-trump-harris-dnc-delegates">even after Ohio passed a law resolving that issue</a>. The virtual nomination process therefore came to be seen as a tool for Biden to run out the clock and foist himself upon a mutinous party.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Schumer and other top Democrats implored the DNC to postpone the roll call, which is now scheduled for the first week in August.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, on Thursday, the Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/18/obama-says-biden-must-consider-viability/">reported</a> that former President Barack Obama had “told allies in recent days that President Biden’s path to victory has greatly diminished and he thinks the president needs to seriously consider the viability of his candidacy.” When asked about this revelation, a spokesman for Obama declined to deny it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This concerted pressure campaign from blue America’s most powerful political and economic actors appears to be paying dividends.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/us/politics/dnc-biden-nomination.html">reported</a> Wednesday that Biden has “become more receptive in the last several days to hearing arguments about why he should drop his re-election bid,” and “been willing to listen to rundowns of new and worrying polling data and has asked questions about how Vice President Kamala Harris could win.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Thursday, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/18/president-biden-drop-out-election-democrats">Axios</a> reported that several “top Democrats privately tell us the rising pressure of party congressional leaders and close friends will persuade President Biden to decide to drop out of the presidential race, as soon as this weekend.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether Biden does, in fact, step aside remains to be seen. But whatever the president does from here, the Democratic Party as an institution has done its part. Congressional leaders cannot drag Biden kicking and screaming from the campaign trail, but they are doing just about everything in their power to depose him and give their party a better chance of keeping Trump and his allies out of power.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’ve been <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360812/democrats-replace-biden-trump-shooting">critical</a> of the Democratic leadership’s apparent complacency in recent weeks, but there is no question that Biden’s decline put them in a genuinely difficult position. American political parties are weak and disorganized. Power is much less centralized within national leadership than it is in most parliamentary democracies. And unlike parliamentary parties, Democratic congressional caucuses cannot remove politically damaged presidents through a vote of no confidence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Removing a presidential nominee — against their will, after they have already won an overwhelming majority of primary votes — is a task for which American parties have no manual.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thus, to mount a concerted campaign to push Biden to the sidelines, Democratic leaders had to be willing to stick their necks out, without the protection of any legitimizing precedent. It was entirely plausible that they might lack the will to do this.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After all, the president did not bend in the face of his fellow Democrats’ doubts and attacked those calling for his exit as “<a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/30/us-news/biden-campaign-rips-bedwetting-brigade-in-blast-touts-poll-pegging-him-stronger-than-other-dems/">bedwetters</a>” and anti-democratic “<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/08/joe-biden-morning-joe-interview-2024-00166784">elites</a>.” Meanwhile, few in the party had much confidence in the electability of Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrat best positioned to inherit the nomination should Biden step aside. And although Biden lost support in national public polls following his debate performance, Trump’s advantage <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/">stayed below 3 percentage points</a> in polling averages. Harris has been performing slightly better than Biden in polls against Trump, but the difference is fairly marginal.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thus, for self-interested, risk-averse politicians, it would have been tempting to conclude that the party was going to lose no matter what they did, and it would be better to let Biden take the blame than claim ownership of Harris’s inevitable loss.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rejecting such fatalism required both commitment to the best interests of the party writ large and a modicum of sophistication in political analysis.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris does appear most likely to inherit the Democratic nomination, should Biden step aside. And it’s true that she does not currently look like an especially formidable candidate. But her <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/">disapproval rating</a> is lower than <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/joe-biden/">Biden’s</a>. Voters’ views of her are less fixed. She therefore offers higher upside. And when you are heading toward near-certain defeat with a candidate who’s been losing in swing-state polls for months — and is physically incapable of communicating effectively with the public — it’s better to roll the dice on a candidate with a higher ceiling, even if she has a potentially lower floor.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, if Democratic leaders believe that the party could consolidate around a stronger standard-bearer — perhaps, one with a proven record of winning office in a swing state — they should work toward achieving that outcome.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In any event, persisting with Biden would be profoundly damaging for the Democratic Party. It would force many Democrats to repeatedly tell a lie, and one that an <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/06/30/poll-biden-mental-age-debate/74262195007/">overwhelming majority of voters</a> recognize as such: that Biden is clearly fit to serve another four years as president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/us/politics/dnc-biden-nomination.html">Times</a>, one recent internal Democratic poll indicated “that voters are deeply distrustful of elected officials who vouch for the president’s mental capacity and endorse him.” Whatever one makes of Harris’s odds, avoiding tainting down-ballot Democrats’ perceived integrity in the eyes of swing voters is grounds enough for making the switch.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is still conceivable — if doubtful — that Biden will refuse to step down. At this point, his persistence will tell us more about his personal pathologies than those of his party.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Faced with an unprecedented political crisis, Democratic leaders unified behind a coherent strategy to advance the party’s best interests, in defiance of a president who struggled to recognize the unsustainability of his position. With Biden’s belated help, and further strategic ruthlessness, they will give their coalition a fighting chance to win in November. The Democrats are in array.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Amazon’s 48-hour Prime Day sale — in which the multinational e-commerce corporation offers a wide range of discounts to its endless catalog of products, from $24 Hydro Flask tumblers to $80 Beats earbuds — is over. It’s a barrage of deals that few can refuse, made even sweeter by Amazon’s same-day, one-day, or two-day delivery service.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unsurprisingly, it’s an incredibly profitable day for Amazon. Last Prime Day, the company saw <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/13/business/prime-day-shopping-numbers/index.html">$12.7 billion</a> in sales and <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/2023/7/first-day-of-prime-day-was-the-single-largest-sales-day-ever-on-amazon-helping-make-this-the-biggest-prime-day-event-ever">over 375 million items purchased</a>, the largest numbers it’s seen since Prime Day launched nearly 10 years ago in 2015. Adobe Analytics, an organization that studies e-commerce data, predicted that this year’s sale will be another record-breaker, with a forecast of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-prime-day-sales-hit-record-14-billion-data-firm-says-2024-07-15/">$14 billion dollars</a> in sales.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Amazon’s <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/2024/7/amazons-10th-prime-day-event-offers-deep-discounts-and-millions-of-deals-from-top-brands-exclusively-for-prime-members">self-proclaimed customer celebration</a> comes at a cost. While Prime members can purchase goods with the ease of a few clicks year-round, getting those millions of products to arrive at their doorsteps in just a day or two is far more intensive — and even dangerous, as <a href="https://thesoc.org/what-we-do/same-day-injury-amazon-fails-to-deliver-safe-jobs/">research</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/16/bernie-sanders-amazon-investigation/">investigations</a> into the company show — for the warehouse workers and delivery drivers that Amazon employs and relies on. The speed and scale is worse on Prime Day, when even more consumers are buying things.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Workers have long been vocal about the risks they face on the job to keep up with consumer demands. On July 15, the eve of Prime Day, a group of former and current Amazon workers <a href="https://x.com/warehouse_life/status/1812915104805232652">showed up to the corporation’s New York City office</a> to deliver stories from workers about injuries and deaths on the job and to request a meeting with the vice president of Amazon’s Global Workplace Health and Safety, Sarah Rhoads.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Speakers <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LifeInWarehouses/videos/1199344564846918?notif_id=1721059868993828&amp;notif_t=live_video_schedule_viewer&amp;ref=notif">shared</a> their experiences of getting hurt, being overworked, and being denied workers’ compensation. One of the banners held up by workers read, “Same-day delivery, lifetime of injury.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It shouldn’t shock anyone that working in a warehouse for long hours can be grueling, tiresome work. But the frequency at which Amazon workers are hurt on the job — with injuries ranging from musculoskeletal disorders developed from <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/hazardous-by-design-after-pandemic-boom-amazon-faces-safety-reckoning/">repetitive, uncomfortable movements and heavy lifting</a> to <a href="https://prismreports.org/2023/11/06/amazon-workers-injuries/">broken bones</a> — is not the industry standard.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Prime Day’s pressure on workers</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kat Cole, a worker at Amazon’s JFK8 warehouse in Staten Island, New York, and an organizer with the Democratic Reform Caucus of the Amazon Labor Union (ALU), says that regardless of what time of year it is, working a shift at one of Amazon’s warehouses is difficult. But during the week of the Prime Day sales, the pressure is up.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“You have people breathing down your neck,” Cole told Vox. That increased volume of work puts stress on workers and leads to more injuries, she added. She’s no stranger to injuries herself, even outside of Prime Day and other big sales weeks. “I go home with at least one huge black and blue bruise on my legs, at least once a week.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/gettyimages-2161655440.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.737892056687,100,78.524215886627" alt="A person wearing a yellow safety vest scans an apple-branded package in a warehouse." title="A person wearing a yellow safety vest scans an apple-branded package in a warehouse." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A worker prepares an Apple iPad package at an Amazon same-day delivery fulfillment center on Prime Day, in the Bronx, New York City, on July 16, 2024. | Stephanie Keith/Bloomberg via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Stephanie Keith/Bloomberg via Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">She says her coworkers have suffered from a variety of injuries and illnesses while on the job: concussions, slipped discs, a sprained wrist, a broken ankle.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Luke Cianciotto, an Amazon delivery driver in the northern Chicago area, says the increased workload doesn’t just include more deliveries. To accommodate for the influx of work on Prime Day, he says more drivers are hired leading up to it, and more veteran drivers are tasked with training them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“What ends up happening is you put these drivers on the road, setting them up for failure,” Cianciotto told Vox. “They do a bad job. And they don’t deserve that.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While Cianciotto and his fellow delivery drivers have been on <a href="https://teamster.org/2024/06/illinois-amazon-drivers-strike-over-unfair-labor-practices/">strike for the last three weeks</a>, his experience with Prime Day in the past includes drivers working late into the night, delivering hundreds upon hundreds of packages that fill their vans “wall to wall, floor to ceiling.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On an average week for full-time Amazon warehouse employees, shifts can be anywhere between 10 to 12 hours. Cole said that during weeks with increased consumer demand from events like Prime Day, it’s common for Amazon to schedule “mandatory extra time” — additional hours or days added on to workers’ shifts to assist with these surges, on top of this already demanding schedule.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With Prime Day being in the middle of July, some Amazon employees aren’t just working under extra pressure — they’re <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/356217/osha-federal-workplace-heat-standard-protections">working through severe heat, too</a>, with temperatures rising as high as 85 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit in the warehouse. At the JFK8 facility, Cole and her fellow union organizers have taken it upon themselves to hand out Gatorade and ice pops to her coworkers before they start their shifts. Cole says Amazon will put up signs reminding people that the company cares and to take breaks. Amazon will also try to “lighten the mood,” Cole says, with novelties like DJs or offering lemonade. But she says that’s not what workers need.<br><br>“They need the warehouse to be cooler, they need safer working conditions, they need to know that they can take these breaks when they need them without penalty or retaliation,” Cole said. “That’s what we need.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a statement to Vox, Amazon said its heat mitigation practices “meets or exceeds state requirements and federal guidance” and included a link to the company’s <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/how-amazon-keeps-employees-and-drivers-safe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heat prevention measures</a>. (Note: While the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) provides <a href="https://www.osha.gov/heat-exposure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guidance on heat</a>, there is currently <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/356217/osha-federal-workplace-heat-standard-protections" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no enforceable federal workplace</a> standard to protect workers from heat specifically, nor is there a workplace heat illness prevention requirement in <a href="https://nynow.wmht.org/blogs/politics/new-york-lags-behind-setting-worker-protections-for-extreme-heat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York</a>, where the JFK8 warehouse is located.)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Shipping may be free, but the labor behind it comes at a price</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In today’s market, companies are competing with Amazon by offering their <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/360028/amazon-prime-day-2024-target-walmart-temu">own version of Prime Day sales</a> and rapid delivery dates. But even with growing competition from the likes of Target and Walmart, Amazon is still one of the leaders in the pack of e-commerce giants — and that includes leading in workplace injuries.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In April 2021, the company published <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2020-letter-to-shareholders">a letter from then-CEO Jeff Bezos</a> about its commitment to being “Earth’s Safest Place to Work.” Just a month later, the company <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/2021/5/from-body-mechanics-to-mindfulness-amazon-launches-employee-designed-health-and-safety-program-called-workingwell-across-u-s-operations">announced</a> its health and safety program called WorkingWell, with a goal to cut its recordable incident rate (RIR) — or how often injuries or illness occur in the workplace per 100 full-time employees&nbsp;— in half by 2025.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When the announcement was made, the RIR was 7.6 per 100 full-time employees, according to Amazon’s most recent <a href="https://cdn-safety.aboutamazon.com/ea/c3/d72d03394d0db22e336048031ec8/amazon-safety-report-2022-v41.pdf">annual safety report</a>. Amazon would need to reduce its incident rate by at least 10 percent each year in order to slash the RIR by half. In 2022, the RIR was 6.7, a reduction of 11.8 percent from the previous year, appearing to be on track.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But one <a href="https://thesoc.org/what-we-do/same-day-injury-amazon-fails-to-deliver-safe-jobs/">report</a> released this past May from <a href="https://thesoc.org/">the Strategic Organizing Center</a> (SOC), a coalition of labor unions, challenges Amazon’s self-report. In its analysis of data from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the center found that in 2022, there were 6.9 injuries for every 100 full-time employees, compared to 7.9 injuries in 2021. That’s an injury reduction of 12.7 percent in Amazon facilities, which includes warehouses, logistics, and delivery facilities. While these numbers are slightly different from the ones found in Amazon’s safety report, that’s still a notable decrease. But in 2023, SOC found in its report that those numbers only fell to 6.5 injuries per 100 full-time employees — a reduction of 5.8 percent, just a little over half of what it needs to average each year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">SOC researchers also noted that while these numbers fell from 2021 to 2023, injuries that required workers to be reassigned to lighter duties increased, while injuries that necessitated losing time at work decreased. There are two ways to interpret this: one being that Amazon has taken steps to meaningfully reduce severe injuries that would require an absence from work. The other possibility is that Amazon has shifted workers into lighter duties to keep them working when they should be resting and recovering from their injuries, which is misleading and puts workers at risk of injuring themselves again.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/final_workplace_injuries.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,21.425411105376,100,57.149177789249" alt="Chart titled &quot;workplace injuries reported at Amazon facilities,&quot; showing a sharp increase in light duty cases and a decrease in lost time cases." title="Chart titled &quot;workplace injuries reported at Amazon facilities,&quot; showing a sharp increase in light duty cases and a decrease in lost time cases." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The latter is what SOC has claimed Amazon is doing. Amazon’s own reasoning is not too far from this assertion: In its 2022 annual safety report, the company said that one of the main drivers of reducing the number of injuries that required time away from work was its “Return to Work” program, allowing workers to “continue to work while recovering from work-related injuries or illnesses.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cole&nbsp;— who was born with only one hand and uses a prosthetic arm — has experienced the push back to work soon after an injury. Once during a shift, she injured her hand and went to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/amazons-first-aid-clinics-push-injured-employees-to-keep-working/">AmCare</a>, Amazon’s in-house first aid clinic. “I was in a lot of pain,” Cole said. After wrapping her hand up, management told her to return back to work. “I said, ‘Listen, I have one hand. I live with this hand. And it’s injured right now. I’m not going back on the floor to injure it further.’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The SOC report also found that there were more than 38,300 recordable injuries at Amazon facilities in 2023 alone, with 94 percent of the injuries identified by SOC as serious — meaning employees were either placed on lighter work duties or forced to miss work entirely. It also found that Amazon’s serious injury rate was more than twice as high as non-Amazon warehouses.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Injuries become much more common during events like Prime Day and other big sales, too. The week of Prime Day 2023, there were 1,066 recorded cases of serious injuries at Amazon facilities, according to the SOC report — the highest number of injuries recorded all year, and far above the average of 691 injuries per week. Those cases represented a 48 percent increase in injuries from the previous week, and were followed closely by cases recorded on Cyber Monday (1,015 serious injuries) and Prime Big Deals Day (898 serious injuries).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In an email to Vox, Amazon spokesperson Maureen Lynch Vogel called the SOC report “misleading,” emphasizing that the switch-up between rates and raw numbers builds a “false narrative” and that the report should start at 2019, which would indicate a reduction to injuries by 28 percent.  “The fact is, there are far more people working in the buildings during these times and more total hours worked by those employees,” she wrote.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Additionally, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee launched a yearlong investigation into Amazon’s labor practices. According to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/16/bernie-sanders-amazon-investigation/">the Washington Post</a>, an interim report, led by committee chair <a href="https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/labor/senator-bernie-sanders-help-committee-dangers-injuries-warehouses-amazon-prime-day-518713/" data-type="link" data-id="https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/labor/senator-bernie-sanders-help-committee-dangers-injuries-warehouses-amazon-prime-day-518713/">Senator Bernie Sanders</a>, found that nearly 45 out of 100 employees were injured during the week of Prime Day in 2019, and injuries peaked again during other holiday sales.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Amazon, which had cooperated with the investigation, pushed back on Senator Sanders’s preliminary report via an email to Vox, saying it “ignores our progress and paints a one-sided, false narrative using only a fraction of the information we’ve provided.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The HELP Committee is not the only federal investigation that’s found Amazon to have troubling safety issues. From January 2023 to August 2023, <a href="https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/region2/08032023">several investigations</a> from OSHA found that Amazon <a href="https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/national/01182023">exposed</a> workers to well-known <a href="https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/national/02232023-0">ergonomic hazards</a>, like lifting packages up and down constantly, handling heavy items, and bending and twisting in awkward positions, all for hours at a time. “Amazon’s operating methods are creating hazardous work conditions and processes, leading to serious worker injuries,&#8221; said assistant secretary for occupational safety and health Doug Parker in a February 2023 <a href="https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/national/02012023">press release</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">OSHA also found that when Amazon workers were injured, the company failed to provide treatment. In one news release from OSHA, the agency <a href="https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/national/04282023">wrote</a> that “at least six employees with head injuries and four with back injuries did not receive timely, necessary medical care.” Amazon disagreed with OSHA’s characterizations and appealed them. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Amazon Labor Union (ALU), which has won only one election with the workers of Amazon’s JFK8 warehouse in Staten Island, New York, has made safe working conditions one of its primary goals in a first contract. However, Amazon still refuses to recognize the union and, in turn, has made no movement on its side to bargaining a collective agreement. There’s also been <a href="https://labornotes.org/2023/07/reform-caucus-rises-sues-elections-amazon-labor-union">conflict</a> within the union on how to best bring Amazon to the bargaining table and organize other warehouses.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But in June, the ALU <a href="https://labornotes.org/2024/06/amazon-workers-affiliate-teamsters-next-electing-top-officers">voted to affiliate</a> with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters — a powerful union with resources that could help change the tides for the workers of JFK8 and other Amazon facilities. That same month, the New York State Assembly passed <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S5081/amendment/A">the Warehouse Worker Injury Reduction Act</a>, which now sits on Gov. Kathy Hochul’s desk.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Amazon has repeatedly <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/read-amazons-response-to-oxfams-workplace-safety-allegations">rejected</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/02/amazon-safety-citations-osha-department-of-justice" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/02/amazon-safety-citations-osha-department-of-justice">claims</a> that it’s not meaningfully working to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/09/18/amazon-working-conditions-safety-osha-doj/">improve workplace safety</a>. But even if we take it at its word, the data shows that it still has a long way to go before it can call itself “Earth’s Safest Place to Work.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Update, July 18, 2 pm ET: </strong>This story, <em>originally published July 17,</em> has been updated twice: once to include<em> statements from Amazon and clarify that the interim report was from Sanders alone, not the HELP committee at large, and again to include </em>an additional statement from Amazon regarding workplace conditions in the heat.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A few weeks ago, a Reddit poster decided to ask about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/moviecritic/comments/1dyj570/what_actor_do_you_think_we_are_being_forced_feed/">which actors audiences were being “force fed to accept” as movie stars</a>. They had what they felt was a prime example at their fingertips: Glen Powell.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I feel like this guys [sic] is everywhere doing anything,” the poster mused. Yet they found Powell’s work to be “all just Meh.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is Glen Powell’s summer. After spending decades in the Hollywood trenches, Powell is now the star of <em>Twisters</em>, out this week, and of <em>Hit Man</em>, now streaming on Netflix, which he also co-wrote and produced. He’s got big glossy profiles in <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/glen-powell-interview-2024">GQ</a>, the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/glen-powell-interview-hit-man-movie-texas-move-1235905159/">Hollywood Reporter</a>, and <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/the-rise-of-glen-powell">Vanity Fair</a>. He’s been anointed, crowned, and feted as the next big thing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Powell has worked for this moment. He’s been acting since he was a teenager, when he got a bit part in <em>Spy Kids 3</em>, and spent years toiling away as an also-ran before he reached the movie star crown. Still, his current level of omnipresence came on so suddenly that it feels jarringly abrupt.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One minute, Powell had a few supporting roles in a couple of big movies<strong> </strong>and a streaming hit or two. He was someone whose name you didn’t have to know even if you were the kind of person who pays attention to movies.  Now, he’s got two big blockbusters and is the subject of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/movies/2024/07/16/glen-powell-twisters-hitman/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">multiple</a> think <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/glen-powell-twisters.html?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-new-darker-era">pieces</a> about how he’s the next big movie star. It can feel like whiplash.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Part of why Powell’s sudden rise feels so notable is its strangely retro vibe. Today’s ambitious young actors, like <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024/3/1/24087053/dune-2-timothee-chalamet-worms-denis-villeneuve">Timothée Chalamet</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/22564986/black-widow-post-credits-scene-florence-pugh-hawkeye-future-mcu">Florence Pugh</a>, usually flit back and forth between Marvel or some other big action series — to build their names and paychecks — and quirky off-beat films made by auteurs that will get them critical recognition. Powell, in contrast, has stuck to the genres that conventional wisdom has long held were dead: Romantic comedies. Middlebrow adult dramas not based on an existing franchise. You know, ’90s kind of stuff.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&nbsp;“I’m working to try to be you,” <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/glen-powell-interview-hit-man-movie-texas-move-1235905159/">Powell told Tom Cruise</a> when he was cast in a supporting role in <em>Top Gun: Maverick, </em>according to an interview in the Hollywood Reporter earlier this year. But&nbsp;Powell also seems to know that his dream is unlikely because the industry doesn’t really make Tom Cruises anymore.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“First of all, there will never be another Tom Cruise,” <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/glen-powell-interview-hit-man-movie-texas-move-1235905159/">he continued in the profile</a>. “That is a singular career in a singular moment, but also movie stars of the ’80s, ’90s, early 2000s, those will never be re-created.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All the same, Powell looks an awful lot like he’s going to make a play for it&nbsp;—&nbsp;by sheer force of will, if necessary. After all, he’s had a lot of practice.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The post-movie star era</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&nbsp;“I’ve probably been told, ‘You’ll never make it in this town’ more than any individual alive,” <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/the-rise-of-glen-powell">Powell mused to Vanity Fair earlier this year</a>. “The odds are so slim that people hand that quote out like candy.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Powell grew up in Austin as a kid with the film bug. As a teenager, he got cast in a single scene of 2003’s <em>Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over</em>. After that, he kept auditioning — especially for <em>Friday Night Lights</em>, which filmed locally.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I auditioned for it like three or four times,” <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/glen-powell-interview-2024">he said in GQ earlier this year</a>. “I was really right for the role and kept not getting it.” His friends kept making it into the show instead; some of them, like Jesse Plemmons, into major roles.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Powell got his first big break when he was a senior in high school and was cast in a supporting role as a smarmy Harvard student in Denzel Washington’s 2007 film <em>The Great Debaters</em>. Eager to make a good impression, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/glen-powell-interview-hit-man-movie-texas-move-1235905159/">he wore a tuxedo to the table read</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The impression was good enough that Washington introduced Powell to his agent, the legendary Ed Limato. <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/glen-powell-interview-hit-man-movie-texas-move-1235905159/">Powell told THR that it was Limato</a> who told Powell that he had something and that he should think about moving to Hollywood.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All did not go smoothly for Powell when he got there . He couldn’t get cast. Within a few years of his arrival in LA, Limato died, leaving Powell without a champion. Limato’s agency dropped him. He experimented with producing and writing his own projects, and some of them sold, but most of them didn’t make development.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Part of the issue was just that Powell was young and unproven, and it takes a long time to make it in Hollywood. There was another issue, a structural problem for any kid dreaming of being a movie star: Hollywood had stopped making them in the classical sense of the term.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Movie stars have to be cultivated and built, created by the chemical reaction between the right actor and the right movie</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are still prestigious A-list actors — the Emma Stones and Chalamets of the world, who can do <a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/11/21/16552862/call-me-by-your-name-review-timothee-chalamet-armie-hammer">artsy</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23992608/poor-things-oscars-review-emma-stone-best-actress-yorgos-lanthimos">Oscar-winning</a> work and also headline a <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23987560/wonka-timothee-chalamet-paddington-paul-king-roald-dahl">box office</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Help_(film)">hit</a> here and there, particularly if it’s based on familiar IP. Movie stars, though, are classically defined as the kind of actors who can headline any kind of movie, no matter what it’s about, and get audiences to show up to theaters in droves to watch them. They are Julia Roberts, Sandra Bullock, Tom Cruise, Will Smith: larger-than-life charismatic figures who are so fun to watch that almost anyone will pay good money to see them do almost anything.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Movie stars don’t just arrive out of nowhere, though. They have to be cultivated and built, created by the chemical reaction between the right actor and the right movie. Historically, the right movie has been a crowd-pleasing middlebrow picture, frequently a dramatic thriller or a romantic comedy, that lays out a story in broad strokes and then depends on its star to command the screen around them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tom Cruise became a movie star in the raunchy coming-of-age sex comedy <em>Risky Business</em>, his signature commitment powering him through the iconic scene where he dances around in his underwear. Julia Roberts became a movie star when she flashed her megawatt smile at the camera in the cheesy-but-satisfying <em>Mystic Pizza</em>. These were movies that weren’t stupid but weren’t particularly challenging either, simple and goofy mid-budget fare that almost anyone would want to see.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the late 2000s going into the 2010s, <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/2/14/14604300/romantic-comedy-dead-netflix-crazy-rich-asians">Hollywood pretty much stopped making that kind of movie</a>. DVDs and then streaming, along with the rise of prestigious cable shows, eroded the audience. As the domestic box office collapsed, the international market became more important, driving a push toward spectacle-laden action franchises. The only thing reliably making money anymore was the ascendent Marvel Cinematic Universe, which in the early 2010s was just entering the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe:_Phase_Two">Phase 2</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The new financial path for studios became: Focus most of your money on a big flashy action franchise, ideally one based on familiar IP with a built-in fanbase. Allow some money on the side for movies that have a solid chance at the Oscars. Let a more intimate movie get made here and there, but give it a budget that looks like a rounding error, which means it won’t have any stars. Mid-budget movies? Those are for streaming.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In this new landscape, there was no room for movie stars. But Glen Powell kept trying.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">15 years of working toward movie stardom</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Powell auditioned a lot. He got close sometimes. <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/glen-powell-interview-2024">According to an interview in GQ</a>, he auditioned for Captain America and made it to the final round of callbacks for Han Solo. He didn’t start to pick up traction until 2014, though, and Powell’s theory is that he’s not the one who changed around then. It was the industry.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> was the big hit of 2014, making a star out of blond, goofy, burly Chris Pratt. Which meant Powell, also blond, goofy, and jacked, had suddenly become someone casting agents could sell as a Chris Pratt type, he <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/glen-powell-interview-2024">told GQ</a>. He could even be a Chris Hemsworth type, once the Thor franchise got funny.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Chris Pratt theory is a characteristic Powell insight. Powell likes to talk straightforwardly with the press about the capricious nature of Hollywood stardom, about how much making it depends on lucky timing. Frequently, he comes off as a nerd about the business, someone who cares a lot and has spent a lot of time thinking about it. It’s the kid in the tux coming out in him, and it’s one of the things people like about him in celebrity profiles. It’s almost the opposite of the energy Powell plays onscreen, which is mostly smarmy types who have a hidden interiority.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Buoyed by the wake of Pratt’s rise, Powell got a job in 2014 in Ryan Murphy’s <em>Scream Queens</em>, playing a wealthy frat guy. Murphy liked his energy, but Powell didn’t want to be tied to TV.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>It’s the kid in the tux coming out in him, and it’s one of the things people like about him in celebrity profiles</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Being a movie star was always Glen’s dream,” <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/glen-powell-interview-hit-man-movie-texas-move-1235905159/">Murphy told the Hollywood Reporter earlier this year</a>. “He could have done any TV series, but he made it clear that he was chasing something. And I’d get a little mad at him, like, ‘What do you mean you’re waiting? What are you doing?’ But he was smart, and he was right.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2016, Richard Linklater cast Powell in a supporting role in his college baseball hangout movie <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/4/7/11350426/everybody-wants-some-richard-linklater-boyhood"><em>Everybody Wants Some!!</em></a> There, Powell played a smooth-talking lothario, stealing the show enough to get an approving shoutout in <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/04/11/everybody-wants-some-and-miles-ahead-reviews">Anthony Lane’s New Yorker review</a>. (“Best of all &#8230; played with a runaway charm &#8230;”)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Powell was on an upswing with movies. He played supporting roles in <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2016/12/23/14005812/hidden-figures-review-taraji-henson-octavia-spencer-janelle-monae-john-glenn-nasa"><em>Hidden Figures</em></a> (he’s John Glenn) and <em>The Expendables 3</em> (he’s the hacker). Finally, he landed his first lead in the Netflix sleeper hit <a href="https://www.vox.com/summer-movies/2018/6/29/17513562/set-it-up-review-netflix-romantic-comedy-romcom"><em>Set It Up</em></a>. There, Powell played a smarmy finance bro who is revealed in the end to have a vulnerable heart of gold. The film went massively and unexpectedly viral when Netflix released it in 2018, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/06/set-it-up-netflix-review/563237/">suggesting to some onlookers</a> that it might spark a revival of the good old-fashioned ’90s romantic comedy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Powell, meanwhile, had his sights set on the biggest ’90s throwback of all: Tom Cruise’s new <em>Top Gun</em> sequel. Powell auditioned for the crucial role of Goose’s son and, once again, got close, <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/glen-powell-interview-2024">he told GQ</a>. Not close enough: The part went to Miles Teller. Still, Cruise, who liked Powell’s screen test, offered him the part of Slayer, the equivalent of the Val Kilmer role&nbsp;from the original movie.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Powell said no. He didn’t think Slayer worked in the script. The kid in the tux in him who had put in a lot of time analyzing the way movies worked foresaw himself ending up all over the cutting room floor.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cruise felt strongly enough about Powell’s potential that he personally called him to give him career guidance. If Powell really wanted to be the next Tom Cruise, he told him, the key wasn’t to pick a great role. It was to pick a great project and then make the role great. He got Powell to sign on as Slayer, and then he got Slayer rewritten into a new character, now called Hangman, who would fit Powell’s smarmy golden boy skill set.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/23141487/top-gun-maverick-us-military-hollywood-oscar-winner-best-sound"><em>Top Gun: Maverick</em></a> was the first blockbuster of the post-pandemic era. It was also definitively Tom Cruise’s hit. Powell’s turn as Hangman wasn’t on the cutting room floor, but it wasn’t central enough to the film to be part of the narrative of its success.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/gettyimages-1848895277.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney laughing in front of the movie premiere backdrop screen." title="Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney laughing in front of the movie premiere backdrop screen." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney attend the &lt;em&gt;Anyone But You&lt;/em&gt; New York premiere on December 11, 2023, in New York City. | John Lamparski/WireImage" data-portal-copyright="John Lamparski/WireImage" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">For that kind of cred, Powell had to wait for <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24010895/glen-powell-sydney-sweeney-anyone-but-you-review-chemistry"><em>Anyone But You</em></a> in 2023. The second Glen Powell rom-com to unexpectedly become a huge sleeper hit, it took off not on streaming but in movie theaters. Powell says that path was an intentional choice made by both himself and co-star Sydney Sweeney.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We said, ‘If we make this on a streamer, it won’t have any cultural impact,’” <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/glen-powell-interview-hit-man-movie-texas-move-1235905159/">Powell told the Hollywood Reporter</a>. “And everyone was saying rom-coms were dead theatrically so we knew we could get hosed, but we thought, ‘Let’s take the gamble,’ because what if we could bring them back?” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Improbably enough, the gamble worked. <em>Anyone But You</em>, which cost a mere $25 million to make, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/the-secrets-of-anyone-but-yous-surprise-box-office-success.html">rode a viral TikTok dance trend straight into a $200 million box office payday</a>. By January of this year, Glen Powell was officially the lead of a box office smash.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Reviews, however, were not kind to <em>Anyone But You</em>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24010895/glen-powell-sydney-sweeney-anyone-but-you-review-chemistry">which Vox’s own Alex Abad-Santos described straightforwardly as “bad.”</a> (Abad-Santos did note that Powell “is solidly in his wheelhouse as a smarmy finance bro.”) To develop his critical cred, Powell returned to <em>Everybody Wants Some!!!</em> director Richard Linklater.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Powell brought Linklater a pitch: an old Texas Monthly article about an unassuming civilian who posed as a hit man for hire to make arrests with the Houston police. Linklater liked the premise, but he didn’t see the movie in it. Where was the arc? How did things change? Powell, in turn, proposed using the story as a jumping-off point, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/movies/2024/07/16/glen-powell-twisters-hitman/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">Linklater told the Washington Post</a>. What happens if the fake hit man falls in love? What happens if he falls in love with someone who’s trying to hire him to kill?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the resulting movie, <em>Hit Man</em>, which dropped on Netflix after two weeks in theaters earlier this summer, Linklater and Powell share a writing credit and Powell stars. The movie premiered at the Venice film festival in 2023 to a delighted reception, and this time, all the attention was on Powell. “If Glen Powell’s not already a star,” <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/richard-linklaters-hit-man-review-glen-powell-a-star.html">decreed Vulture</a>, “this picture might well make him one.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Like <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em> and all those rom-coms, <em>Hit Man</em> is a bit of a ’90s throwback. It’s a middlebrow movie for grownups that isn’t based on a comic book and has enough sex in it that <a href="https://www.vox.com/23196838/china-hollywood-red-carpet-schwartzel">its place in the international market doesn’t feel entirely secure</a>. The kind of story that usually shows up on prestige TV these days, not the movie theater. A movie that lives and dies by the charisma and versatility of its lead actor. A movie that might never make all that much money —&nbsp;but that can, by god, turn a working actor into a movie star.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Glen Powell wanted to become a movie star. When Hollywood stopped making them, the kid in the tux made the kind of movie that can mint a star himself.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The test with <em>Twisters</em> is going to be whether Powell can prove the blockbuster draw he demonstrated with <em>Anyone But You</em> wasn’t just a one-off.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">If Hollywood stops making movie stars, can you DIY one?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If this story makes it sound like Glen Powell is an underdog, that’s inaccurate, in the same way <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/ten-long-years-of-trying-to-make-armie-hammer-happen">it was inaccurate to push that narrative about Armie Hammer a few years back</a>. Powell is a tall and handsome white dude who could afford to stick it out through a decade or so of under-employment because he was getting mentored by Denzel Washington and Tom Cruise. He’s not an underdog. He’s doing a different thing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The thing about Glen Powell that comes through most strongly in profiles is this: You have never read a more earnest celebrity interview than the ones he gives. This man <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/glen-powell-interview-2024">keeps a bingo board</a> where he tracks all the character types he wants to play. He’s currently <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/glen-powell-interview-hit-man-movie-texas-move-1235905159/">finishing his final college credits</a> because he thinks it would mean a lot to his mom. He’s got a book he calls <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/glen-powell-interview-hit-man-movie-texas-move-1235905159/">an icon wisdom journal</a> he fills with advice from his mentors, most notably Cruise. He wore that tux. He’s a hard worker who is very earnest about the value of hard work.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Powell mostly masks this earnestness by playing insufferable assholes, less a Chris Pratt than a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Czuchry">Matt Czuchry</a>. It may be that the closest fit onscreen to Powell’s real personality is the before character in <em>Hit Man</em>, mild-mannered philosophy professor Gary, before he transforms himself into a cold-blooded killer.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet ironically, Gary pre-transformation is one of Powell’s least convincing performances. Powell doesn’t seem to know how to fold his broad shoulders in or soften his big Hollywood grin so that he looks less than confident, even when the character he’s playing is lecturing a bored class of college students or letting his co-workers mock him to his face. Part of the reason Powell pops is that whenever he shows up on camera, he gives every evidence of believing he belongs there.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Powell seems to have applied that handsome dude confidence and that A-student earnestness for decades to chip away at the problem of how to become a movie star if you break out 15 years after Hollywood stops making those. The solution he’s hit upon is to write and produce his own material, look for roles in the genres that have previously turned actors into stars, and push for theatrical releases whenever possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Maybe it keeps working. Maybe it doesn’t. Everyone who rooted for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/09/arts/television/taylor-kitsch-painkiller.html">Taylor Kitsch</a> knows what it looks like when Hollywood decides an up-and-coming male star can’t pull in enough box office to be worth the investment. All of that is still to come, yet to be decided, in the fast-approaching future.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the meantime, here we are, still in Glen Powell’s summer. His moment isn’t over yet.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Days after the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, lawmakers and watchdogs are taking the US Secret Service to task over how a gunman could have made it to a rooftop with an AR-15-style rifle just <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/14/politics/trump-rally-shooting-distance/index.html">400 feet</a> away from the former president, let alone fire a weapon.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As more details trickle in, it’s clear that the Secret Service failed to properly do its job. “It was unacceptable,” the agency’s director, Kimberly Cheatle, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-rally-shooting-unacceptable-secret-service-director-abc-exclusive/story?id=111962314">told ABC News</a>, adding that she doesn’t plan on resigning.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Onlookers, for example, spotted the suspicious man on the roof and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2024/07/15/trump-rally-shooting-witness-warning/">reported him to police</a> before the shooting. And according to CBS News, three snipers assisting the Secret Service were <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/trump-rally-shooting-investigation/">actually stationed inside the building</a> that the shooter used during the campaign rally. While the Secret Service has argued that some blame lies with local law enforcement, which it partnered with for the rally, the agency is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/secret-service-trump-rally-blame/index.html">ultimately responsible for securing the event</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Secret Service’s failures over the weekend aren’t some isolated incident, but can be viewed as the natural outcome for a scandal-ridden agency that has long been in need of reform. The Secret Service has been dogged by controversies in the past decade, from <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/03/trump-arrest-secret-service/673440/">Trump’s politicization</a> of the agency to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/07/14/1111618620/secret-service-erased-texts-from-two-day-period-spanning-jan-6-attack-watchdog-s">a lack of transparency around the January 6 insurrection</a>, when it <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/04/06/homeland-security-watchdog-secret-service-texts/">deleted its agents’ text messages</a> in the days leading up to the attack.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Several other high-profile incidents have shown the Secret Service caught flat-footed, as was the case in 2014, when an intruder with a knife jumped the White House fence and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/white-house-fence-jumper-made-it-far-deeper-into-building-than-previously-known/2014/09/29/02efd53e-47ea-11e4-a046-120a8a855cca_story.html">walked in through the front door</a>. The general culture at the agency has also received plenty of criticism, too, like when allegedly drunk agents <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/03/11/politics/drunk-secret-service-agents-white-house/index.html">crashed a car at the White House</a> in 2015 or when agents had to be <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/us-secret-service-agents-recalled-from-colombia/2012/04/13/gIQAEdW9FT_story.html?hpid=z1">sent back home from Colombia</a> in 2012 after hiring sex workers while providing security for then-President Barack Obama. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps most importantly, one of the agency’s chief failures has been a lack of transparency and a reluctance to admit when mistakes happen. That’s especially alarming given that the Secret Service is tasked with protecting the nation’s highest-ranking officials, all while <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-political-violence-and-violent-threats-are-on-the-rise-in-the-united-states">political violence is on the rise</a>. If events like the assassination attempt over the weekend are to be avoided in the future, the agency needs to change.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Secret Service should be more transparent</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2011, a gunman with a semi-automatic rifle fired multiple shots at the White House. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/secret-service-stumbled-after-gunman-hit-white-house-residence-in-2011/2014/09/27/d176b6ac-442a-11e4-b437-1a7368204804_story.html">According to reporting by Washington Post reporter Carol D. Leonnig</a>, who has extensively covered the Secret Service, “nobody conducted more than a cursory inspection of the White House for evidence or damage.” In fact, it took days for the agency to realize that bullets had actually hit the White House — only after a housekeeper had noticed broken glass — and to alert President Barack Obama of the shooting.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That incident underscores how slow the agency can be when it comes to recognizing or reporting security lapses. It also shows how reluctant it is sometimes to learn from its mistakes. “There was no, ‘Hey, let’s get everyone together and let’s review what happened,’” Jonathan Wackrow, a former Secret Service agent who served on Obama’s security detail, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jeboI9HX54">told CBS News in 2021</a> about the incident.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s why the agency requires more routine oversight, which starts with being more publicly transparent about its failures.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After the Trump assassination attempt, Congress <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/release/comer-announces-hearing-with-u-s-secret-service-director-on-the-attempted-assassination-of-president-trump/">announced</a> that it will hold a hearing with the Secret Service director on July 22. President Joe Biden also said he’s ordered an <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/watch-live-today-trump-shot-biden-remarks-2024-07-14/">independent review</a> of the event to understand what happened. Those are good steps.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But what’s clear is that the Secret Service is in need of more oversight generally, and not just after major operational failures.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One solution is for Congress to broaden its investigation of the Secret Service beyond what happened at Trump’s rally and make its findings public. It should answer questions like how many close calls there have actually been — incidents where luck played more of a role in security than actual protocol. Have there been <a href="https://www.pogo.org/investigations/hundreds-of-oath-keepers-have-worked-for-dhs-leaked-list-shows">growing ties</a> between white supremacist groups and the Secret Service? Has the agency fully addressed issues <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/the-frat-boy-culture-of-the-secret-service/2021/05/12/0a8c238e-a205-11eb-a774-7b47ceb36ee8_story.html">surrounding its “frat boy” work culture</a>? Is the Secret Service properly reviewing its own security procedures after incidents like the White House shooting in 2011? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Time and time again, the Secret Service has chosen to cover up a problem rather than fix it,” Leonnig, who wrote the book <em>Zero Fail: The Rise and Fall of the Secret Service</em>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jeboI9HX54">told CBS News</a> in 2021. “This is a great agency &#8230; but it needs a house cleaning; it needs help.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How the Secret Service has evolved</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most people think of the Secret Service as the organization that protects the president and other high-profile officials. But when it was founded in 1865, the Secret Service was part of the Treasury Department and tasked with detecting fraud and counterfeit currency. It wasn’t until 30 years later that it started providing informal protection of then-President Grover Cleveland. And after the assassination of President William McKinley, the Secret Service added protecting presidents to its official duties.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Secret Service still investigates financial crimes and fraud and provides protective details to presidents, their families, and other officials like the vice president or presidential candidates. But in 2003, in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the agency was moved to the Department of Homeland Security.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the most visible ways that the agency has changed is how many more people it protects today than in the past. <a href="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/napa-2021/USSS-Final-Report-9.17.20211.pdf">According to a 2021 report</a> by the National Academy of Public Administration, while the Secret Service declined to provide an exact number of how many people it protects, it showed that the number of travel visits by protectees increased from just under 3,200 in 2010 to over 4,000 in 2018. That’s in part because Trump <a href="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/napa-2021/USSS-Final-Report-9.17.20211.pdf">designated Secret Service protection</a> for his adult children, who often traveled internationally, and other staff members in his administration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Secret Service can generally decline providing protection for people other than those required by statute — like the president and vice president — based on its assessed security risk, but it often provides protection well beyond what is required of it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Where the Secret Service goes from here</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Transparency is the first step to a reformed Secret Service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But what’s already known about the agency shows there’s plenty of room for improvement. John Koskinen, the former commissioner of the IRS who worked on the 2021 NAPA <a href="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/napa-2021/USSS-Final-Report-9.17.20211.pdf">report</a> on the Secret Service’s workforce, found that the agency needed more staffing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The place ran better if they had enough people, but they were chronically understaffed,” Koskinen said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to the report, employee turnover and a lack of sufficient hiring resulted in a staff that was less experienced, overworked, and stretched too thin. “The major finding was that as the staffing increased, employee satisfaction increased,” Koskinen said, meaning that more staffing would lead to less turnover as a result of burnout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Koskinen believes Congress should focus on the lack of sufficient staffing, especially given the expanding scope of the Secret Service’s mission. The number of people it protects, for example, has grown, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-extended-secret-service-protection-for-13-members-of-his-family-as-he-left-office/2021/01/20/31ef3e9e-5b3c-11eb-b8bd-ee36b1cd18bf_story.html">with requests like Trump’s</a> for Secret Service protection for his adult children and top officials just before he left office.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not clear, however, whether staffing problems had anything to do with the security lapses at Trump’s rally. The agency did <a href="https://www.secretservice.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2024-01/fy23-annual-report-final-pages.pdf">hire over 600 new employees</a> in 2023, and the Secret Service had recently <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/iran-plot-assassinate-trump-secret-service/index.html">bolstered security</a> around the former president before the incident. That’s all the more reason for Congress to expand its investigation beyond what went wrong at Trump’s rally to get a full picture of how big of a problem staffing actually is — before committing more funding to the agency so that, if needed, the money can be properly directed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One question that Congress should ask that could help address the Secret Service’s needs — from transparency to resources — is whether the Department of Homeland Security is where it should be housed. Before the 9/11 attacks, the Secret Service was part of the Treasury Department. But since it moved to Homeland Security in 2003, people have questioned <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/save-the-secret-service-11621549106">whether it receives enough scrutiny or accountability</a>, blending into a massive bureaucracy of <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/about-dhs">over 250,000</a> employees.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Are they given the right visibility in light of the importance of their job, or do they get lost day in and day out of that huge organization?” Koskinen said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, with the Secret Service under renewed scrutiny, Congress has a chance to review the agency’s transparency, staffing problems, and the scope of its mission. And it might be time to rethink how the agency approaches all three.</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Last week, the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs released the <a href="https://population.un.org/wpp/">World Population Prospects</a>, the international body’s annual report on the current and future state of global population.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The headline was clear: We are well past the days of <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/book-incited-worldwide-fear-overpopulation-180967499/">worrying about having more people than the Earth can handle</a>. The UN’s demographers now expect the number of people on the planet to peak at a bit under 10.3 billion in 2084.<br><br>That’s two years earlier than the UN was predicting peak population as recently as 2022, and considerably earlier than forecasts from just a few years before, when population wasn’t expected to peak until the 22nd century.<br><br>10.3 billion, of course, is some 2 billion more people than the planet currently holds, so population growth isn’t stopping anytime soon, but it is slowing down rapidly. Women on average now have one less child than they did in 1990, and in more than half of all countries and areas, the lifetime fertility rate is less than 2.1 — the number needed for a population to replace itself through birth alone. And as of 2024, total population had already peaked in 63 countries or areas including Russia, Germany, and China, which last year was <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/4/30/23702471/indian-china-population-united-nations-demographics-fertility-rate-poverty">passed</a> by India as the world’s most populous nation. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s impossible to discuss global population without landing in the middle of a culture war, whether it was over supposed overpopulation in the 1970s or now, when the right, <a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/11/02/hillbilly-elegy-author-faces-backlash-over-remarks-connecting-nationalism-to-fertility-rate/">very much including</a> new Republican VP candidate J.D. Vance, is increasingly <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/abortion-bans-pronatalism/">pushing</a> controversial pronatal policies designed to increase family sizes. What you think about population change — whether you welcome it or fear it — will depend on which side you fall in these fights.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The battles over population policy will continue to be fought and they are important, involving reproductive rights, fiscal policy, and cultural values. But when it comes to the sweep of demography in the 21st century, they are largely beyond the point. That’s because of something called “<a href="https://populationmatters.org/news/2023/11/the-mystery-of-demographic-momentum/">population momentum</a>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given that fertility rates are falling everywhere and pronatal government policy <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/05/23/why-paying-women-to-have-more-babies-wont-work">has almost totally failed to alter that fact</a>, population in the future is mostly going to be a function of how many adults of reproductive age a country has, which is already largely fixed. The UN’s demographers may be off by a few years or a few hundred million people, but the changes are generally baked in. “All populations,” John Wilmoth, head of the UN Population Division, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/un-world-population-growth-e2adab27719bb94ea19626dc53c57384">told the AP,</a> “are following a similar path.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Which means the important question we’re facing isn’t how to change a world headed toward peak population in 60 years. It’s how to understand it and respond to it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Extreme decline</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The UN population report is full of startling predictions, but perhaps none so much as this: China, where the fertility rate is now just one child per woman, is forecast to see its population drop from 1.4 billion today to 633 million by 2100. That’s a drop of more than half, and it would see China, a country long synonymous with population size, reaching a level it hasn’t experienced since before 1960.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">China is part of the nearly 20 percent of the world that has “ultra-low fertility,” according to the UN report — meaning fewer than 1.4 children per woman. Another country in that group is South Korea, which has the world’s <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68402139">lowest fertility rate at 0.72</a>. By 2100, South Korea’s population is expected to halve, to just 27 million people. Even more surprising: just 800,000 South Koreans by then are forecast to be children under the age of 5, while some 11 million will be 65 or older.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">China&#8217;s and South Korea’s population declines will be extreme, but other countries will be right behind them. Another 48 countries and territories — including Brazil, Turkey, and Vietnam — are projected to see population peak between 2025 and 2054.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before they get there — and continuing well after — these countries and much of the rest of the world will get much older. That’s in part a success story — after dipping during the Covid-19 pandemic, global life expectancy <a href="https://populationmatters.org/news/2024/07/the-road-to-10-billion-world-population-projections-2024/">is on the rise again</a>, reaching 73.3 years in 2024 and projected to continue to rise to 77.4 years in 2054. The upshot, though, will be global graying: while today children under 18 globally outnumber those 65 and above <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/graphics-2024-united-nations-world-population-prospects-report-data-rcna160017">by a nearly three to one ratio</a>, by the late 2070s, there will be more elderly than children.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">The importance of immigration</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US is an exception in the rich world in that its population is projected to keep growing through the 21st century, reaching some 421 million by 2100. But that’s much less a function of fertility — US fertility has been below replacement level for years — than it is of the country’s openness to immigration. Recent census projections show that if immigration to the US stopped tomorrow, the US population would begin to fall immediately and <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/new-census-projections-show-immigration-is-essential-to-the-growth-and-vitality-of-a-more-diverse-us-population/">hit just 226 million by 2100</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That fact underscores that while meaningfully shifting fertility rates may be impossible, countries can control immigration, which gives the US more influence over just how big or how small it will be decades into the future. But even that’s a relative change. Unless we start getting off-world immigrants, every new citizen to one country is a population loss to another.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">A new world order</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even while population growth in the world as a whole slows down and eventually reverses, some countries with younger populations and relatively higher fertility rates — chiefly in sub-Saharan Africa — will see massive growth.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The result is that by the end of the century, the makeup of the world will look very different. Nigeria is projected to become the world’s second-most populous country after India, with a population that will more than triple to over 700 million. Pakistan’s population is expected to increase by more than 100 million. The Democratic Republic of Congo, which ranks 15th in the world in population now, is forecast to reach seventh place with 388 million people — more than the US has today.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We’re only beginning to grapple with what an older, shrinking world will feel like. Population change is a bit like climate change: a mega-trend that will do much to shape the kind of future we and our declining number of descendants will live in. The difference is that it remains in our control to alter the trajectory of climate change through energy and environmental policy. Despite the culture war rhetoric, that’s largely not the case for demography. All we can do is adapt.<br></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Amid calls for President Joe Biden to step aside as the Democratic nominee following his disastrous debate performance last month, he has turned to an unlikely set of allies for support: progressives.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden has long billed himself as a moderate. In the 2020 Democratic primary, he positioned himself as the pragmatic and less polarizing choice than the more progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). Throughout his first term, Biden has often clashed with the more leftist elements of the party on issues ranging from <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/06/biden-border-move-infuriated-progressives-00162171">immigration</a> to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/26/politics/joe-biden-israel-support-college-campus-protests/index.html">Israel</a>, even though he’s also found common ground with them on the <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/167408/progressives-inflation-reduction-act-biden">Inflation Reduction Act</a> and advanced progressive ideas like a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/11/bidens-2025-budget-marries-progressive-tax-hikes-with-populist-campaign-planks.html">billionaire tax</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now Biden is again seeking their help — and they’re willingly offering it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Just as Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) <a href="https://x.com/elwasson/status/1813616471727100242">publicly urged</a> Biden to step aside Wednesday, the New Yorker published an interview with Sanders where he <a href="https://x.com/IChotiner/status/1813631026931105852">threw his support behind Biden’s candidacy</a>. This comes after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), a member of the progressive so-called “Squad,” <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/aoc-sanders-stick-biden-2024-turmoil-push-bolder-agenda-rcna160882">left no room for doubt</a> that Biden should be the nominee and said, “I support him and making sure that we win in November.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden’s need for allies — wherever he can get them — may have created an opportunity for progressives to negotiate with him on policy. AOC made this explicit in her comments earlier this month, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/aoc-sanders-stick-biden-2024-turmoil-push-bolder-agenda-rcna160882">saying</a> that Biden should “lean in” to a bolder economic agenda “and move further towards the working class.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That seems to be what’s happening. Biden is suddenly pushing progressive priorities from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-16/biden-to-propose-supreme-court-reforms-including-term-limits?srnd=homepage-americas&amp;embedded-checkout=true">Supreme Court reforms</a> to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/16/rent-cap-5-percent-increases-housing/74415521007/">capping rents</a>. He has also renewed his calls for an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/17/biden-assault-weapons-ban-ar15-trump/">assault weapons ban</a> following the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360489/trump-shot-thomas-matthew-crooks-secret-service-butler-rally">assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump</a> at a rally last weekend.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Two questions loom over this push from Biden. One, are these proposals actually achievable — especially since, if he wins the presidency, he likely won&#8217;t have the congressional majorities needed to enact his agenda? And two, can this late push help him politically?&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Biden’s new progressive priorities</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The progressive policies Biden is pushing have little chance of becoming law, even though they might be popular among Democratic base voters, not just those on the left flank.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/16/biden-supreme-court-reforms/">reportedly weighing</a> legislation that would impose term limits on Supreme Court justices who currently serve for life (or until they decide to retire), and introduce a new ethics code in the wake of several scandals involving conservative Justices <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-scotus-undisclosed-luxury-travel-gifts-crow">Clarence Thomas</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/05/30/alito-scotus-flag-00160450">Samuel Alito</a>. Such legislation would likely be dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled House, and would struggle in a Senate full of members <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/1/19/22881837/senate-filibuster-vote-voting-rights-joe-manchin-kyrsten-sinema">hesitant to fiddle with institutional rules</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He is also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/16/biden-supreme-court-reforms/">reportedly considering</a> a constitutional amendment that would roll back the recent Supreme Court decision providing <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship">broad presidential immunity</a> from prosecution for official actions. As any amendment requires the approval of 38 states — a tall order that hasn’t been fulfilled in decades — this constitutional change seems unlikely.&nbsp;That said, endorsing such policies would mark a big shift for a president who was previously reluctant to touch the Supreme Court amid leftist calls to pack the court with more justices, sometimes referred to as Democrats’ <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/7/2/17513520/court-packing-explained-fdr-roosevelt-new-deal-democrats-supreme-court">nuclear option</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Tuesday, Biden revived his calls for a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/17/biden-assault-weapons-ban-ar15-trump/">national assault weapons ban</a>. The shooter who attempted to assassinate Trump used an AR-style assault weapon, which he said has “killed so many others, including children.” The president’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/3/28/23660290/louisville-shooting-biden-assault-weapon-ban">last effort on this front</a> failed due to a lack of congressional interest; though there have been a number of high-profile shootings since then, little has changed with Congress’s willingness to engage with gun reform.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Also on Tuesday, Biden proposed legislation to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/16/economy/biden-rent-increase-5-percent-cap-plan/index.html">limit rent increases</a> in an environment in which housing inflation has remained higher than overall inflation figures for the year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden would prevent landlords who raise rent by more than 5 percent annually from obtaining tax credits starting in 2024 and for the next two years. More than 20 million rentals would be affected under the plan, which applies only to landlords who own more than 50 units and would exempt newly constructed or renovated properties.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is disagreement among <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-01-18/yup-rent-control-does-more-harm-than-good?sref=Y5NzbMHF">economists</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-04/rent-control-scored-a-big-election-night-victory?sref=Y5NzbMHF">housing advocates</a> as to whether this would help renters. Even setting that aside, this proposal, like the others, isn’t likely to be passed by Congress before the November election.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And even if Biden wins a second term, his current performance in the polls is now <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/07/biden-out-trump-polls-house-senate-democrats-downballot.html">endangering down-ballot Democrats</a> who would need to win overwhelmingly to get the numbers in Congress required to pass such ambitious legislation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What is Biden’s strategy?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of that raises the question: What exactly is Biden’s game plan here? These proposals are unrealistic even in the best of times for Democrats, and right now is <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360812/democrats-replace-biden-trump-shooting">definitely not</a> the best of times for Democrats.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These policies might shore up support for Biden among Democratic base voters at a moment when his candidacy is in doubt. Nearly two-thirds of Democrats now want Biden to withdraw from the race, according to a recent&nbsp; <a href="https://apnorc.org/">AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research</a> poll.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But less than four months from the election is not a time when a candidate should have to worry about drumming up support in any wing of their party. In a normal election, a nominee’s position would be secure; They could spend their time courting swing voters who are <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/insights/2024/5/30/measuring-the-swing-evaluating-the-key-voters-of-2024/#views-key-issues">especially likely to identify as moderate</a> and whose support they also need to win.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/trump-tempers-his-outbursts-in-pitch-for-moderate-voters-b832c901">appears to be what Trump is doing</a>. His former rivals in the Republican primary have largely rallied around him. The message the former president is pushing at the Republican National Convention (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/17/donald-trump-rally-shooting-unity-message">however disingenuous</a>) is <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-pivoting-unity-assassination-attempt-1235060318/">one of unity</a> in a divided America.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden, however, is still seeking to negotiate with his own party for support — a perilous place to be.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Donald Trump’s allies have <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/07/22/trump-2025-radical-plan-second-term">laid out sweeping plans</a> to reshape the executive branch of the federal government if he is returned to power, plans that involve firing perhaps tens of thousands of career civil servants and replacing them with handpicked MAGA allies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But how far, exactly, would Trump go in trying to tear down what he calls the “deep state?” The answer hasn’t been clear.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In picking J.D. Vance as his vice president, he’s picked someone who will egg him on to go very far indeed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If I was giving him one piece of advice” for a second term, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/04/inside-the-new-right-where-peter-thiel-is-placing-his-biggest-bets">Vance said</a> on a 2021 podcast:</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Fire every single midlevel bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state, replace them with our people.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That was no idle talk. To an extent unusual for a politician — and perhaps because he hasn’t been in politics very long — Vance is interested in big ideas. He’s been deeply influenced by thinkers on the movement known as the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/11/19/22787269/conservatives-america-chris-rufo-patrick-deneen">New Right</a>, who want to seize and transform societal institutions they believe are dominated by the left.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A big part of that would involve a restored President Trump purging any resistance to him, or checks on his power, from the executive branch.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Vance is deeply committed to the project of seizing institutions away from the left</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has long had figures in orbit urging him to act to remake the executive branch, such as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/top-wh-strategist-vows-a-daily-fight-for-deconstruction-of-the-administrative-state/2017/02/23/03f6b8da-f9ea-11e6-bf01-d47f8cf9b643_story.html">Steve Bannon</a>, who called for “deconstruction of the administrative state” at the start of his brief White House tenure. In the chaos of Trump’s first term, such plans didn’t get very far at first. Trump grew increasingly frustrated by what he viewed as resistance to his agenda among permanent federal employees and his inability to get “loyal” people in place.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, younger conservatives on the outside of the administration — like Vance — were wondering why President Trump was struggling to enact his agenda and grappling with the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/3/22/18259865/great-awokening-white-liberals-race-polling-trump-2020">leftward movement</a> of the nation on social justice issues. Many of them gravitated toward explanations offered by writers on the New Right.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The New Right put forth an institutional theory for why conservatives couldn’t get what they wanted. Per this theory, the left had ultimate power due to their control of important institutions, from the media and academia to tech companies and the federal bureaucracy. The task ahead for the right was to fight for and seize control of these institutions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One particularly extreme New Right thinker is the blogger Curtis Yarvin, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23373795/curtis-yarvin-neoreaction-redpill-moldbug">whom I profiled in 2022</a>. Yarvin has argued that a new right-wing president should “Retire All Government Employees” — fire them all — and rebuild the government anew. (He also supports toppling American democracy and replacing it with a monarchy.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance cited Yarvin approvingly during that podcast appearance in which he discussed how Trump should fire “every civil servant.” He said: “There’s this guy, Curtis Yarvin, who has written about some of these things.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Vance would likely push Trump to go further on reshaping the government</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Trump was about to leave office in 2020, he finally got around to trying to do something about the supposed “deep state”: He issued an executive order known as Schedule F.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This order laid the groundwork for reclassifying as many as 50,000 career civil servant jobs as political appointees who could then be fired and replaced by Trump. He was out of office before it could be implemented, however, and Biden quickly revoked it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s been much fear about Trump restoring this policy in his second term, replacing a great many nonpartisan career experts with political hacks or ideologues willing to go along with his extreme or corrupt plans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such a move could be implemented in any number of ways, from the more limited and less disruptive to more sweeping and very disruptive. Considering Trump has only intermittent interest in the details of policy and implementation, I’ve thought that how this plays out would depend on who staffs his administration, since he could be pulled in various directions. Advisers worried about chaos and political blowback could counsel restraint.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance would not do that. He would be a key voice in Trump’s administration urging him to go very big indeed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Elsewhere in the podcast, Vance said that the courts would inevitably “stop” Trump from trying to fire so many employees. When they do, Vance went on, Trump should “stand before the country like Andrew Jackson did, and say, ‘The chief justice has made his ruling. Now let him enforce it.’” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That is: Vance urged that Trump radically remake the executive branch even if the Supreme Court said doing so was illegal.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Vance’s Silicon Valley backers also want major disruption to the federal government</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This interest in disruption makes more sense once you know that Vance’s top political backers include several famous figures on the Silicon Valley right — like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/technology/jd-vance-tech-silicon-valley.html">Peter Thiel</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/16/us/politics/trump-vance-vp-decision.html">Elon Musk</a> — who similarly loathe the left and want sweeping overhauls to left-dominated institutions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thiel has been perhaps the leading intellectual influence on Vance, who as a Yale law student attended a talk Thiel gave at the school in 2011. Vance was starstruck, <a href="https://thelampmagazine.com/blog/how-i-joined-the-resistance">later calling</a> the talk “the most significant moment of my time at Yale Law School” and Thiel “possibly the smartest person I’d ever met.” Vance <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/technology/jd-vance-tech-silicon-valley.html">soon made</a> Thiel’s acquaintance, eventually getting a job at a <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/16/jd-vance-venture-capital-career">Thiel-founded</a> investment fund, and much later getting $15 million from Thiel to back his Senate campaign.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thiel has written about his own disillusionment with American institutions, <a href="https://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/04/13/peter-thiel/education-libertarian/">writing in 2009</a>, “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.” He has also backed many in the New Right, including Yarvin, whose startup <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/09/24/urbit-is-web3-weird-and-wonderful-and-i-dont-care-who-made-it/">he funded</a>. (“He’s fully enlightened,” Yarvin later <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/josephbernstein/heres-how-breitbart-and-milo-smuggled-white-nationalism#.rmomGXmLr">wrote of Thiel</a> in an email, “just plays it very carefully.”)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Musk, meanwhile, put the “seize the institutions” strategy into practice when he bought Twitter and remade it <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-12/elon-musk-has-made-x-more-right-leaning-study-shows?sref=qYiz2hd0">into a more right-wing-friendly platform</a>. Musk <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/tech/elon-musk-bbc-interview-twitter-intl-hnk/index.html">cut</a> about 80 percent of the company’s staff and abandoned most content moderation and hate speech policies, sending liberals fleeing. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Could Trump and Vance try something similar — taking a wrecking ball to the permanent civil service? Even if the courts try to stop them? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We don’t know for sure, but Vance’s selection increases the odds for maximum chaos in the federal government.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We are in a late republican period,” Vance <a href="https://jackmurphylive.libsyn.com/jd-vance-jml-070">said in that 2021 podcast</a>, alluding to the fall of the Roman Republic. “If we’re going to push back against it, we’re going to have to get pretty wild, and pretty far out there, and go in directions that a lot of conservatives right now are uncomfortable with.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many have <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/international-content/2024/07/jd-vance-vice-president-donald-trump-republican-ticket">interpreted</a> Donald Trump’s selection of J.D. Vance as <a href="https://x.com/matthewstoller/status/1813200322304541042">signaling</a> a new age of Republican economic populism.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In this view, until now, the precise ideological contours of Trumpism had been muddy, as the mercurial demagogue oscillated between populist heresies and conservative orthodoxy — vowing to impose <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/20/politics/trump-unveils-controversial-drug-price-rules/index.html">price controls on pharmaceutical companies</a> one day, fighting to <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/05/study-trump-tax-cuts-failed-growth-investment.html">slash taxes</a> for the rich and <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/05/biggest-outrage-of-trumpcare-continues-to-be-medicaid-cuts.html">gut Medicaid</a> the next.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance is one of the few Republicans who has actually tried to translate Trump’s populist impulses into a coherent agenda, one that “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/15/vance-trump-economy-gop/">unnerves business elites</a>” and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-oren-cass.html">thrills</a> “<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/09/conservative-case-for-organized-labor.html">pro-worker</a>” conservatives.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given that Trump is 78 and ineligible for a third term, Vance is well-positioned to become the Republican standard-bearer in the near future, a development that could transform the GOP into a worker’s party, according to his populist admirers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance cultivated that impression during his address to the Republican National Convention Wednesday night.&nbsp; Vance characterized the GOP as a movement that would stand up for working-class communities like the one he was raised in and stand against the “ruling class” that had sold them out.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We’re done catering to Wall Street, we’ll commit to the working man,” Vance said. “We’re done importing foreign labor, we’re going to fight for American Citizens and their good jobs and their good wages. We’re done sacrificing supply chains to unlimited global trade and we’re going to stamp more and more products with that beautiful label, ‘Made in the USA.’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance’s commitment, though, to flipping the Republican Party’s class allegiances — and his prospects for doing so — have both been greatly exaggerated.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">J.D. Vance’s economic outlook is distinct from the market fundamentalism of Ronald Reagan or Paul Ryan. Vance is skeptical of free trade and immigration, believing that both erode the bargaining power of native-born workers by providing corporations access to cheap labor at home and abroad. In his telling, were US employers forced to rely on a smaller labor pool, they would have no choice but to pay higher wages and invest more in productivity-enhancing technology.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance also supports state subsidies for the domestic production of cutting-edge products. As a Senate candidate, Vance <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/jd-vance-quietly-supports-bill-his-gop-allies-hate-and-his-opponent-tim-ryan-sponsored">voiced support</a> for Joe Biden’s CHIPS Act, which subsidizes semiconductor manufacturers who operate in the United States. Once in Congress, he co-authored <a href="https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-baldwin-vance-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-ensure-taxpayer-funded-inventions-are-made-in-america">bipartisan legislation</a> that would require companies that develop new technologies with taxpayer support to manufacture the resulting products within the US.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He has also been willing to antagonize discrete segments of the capitalist class. With Elizabeth Warren, he <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/06/01/warren-vance-failed-banking-crackdown-bill-00099579">cosponsored</a> a bill that would claw back the pay of executives at large failed banks, a measure aimed at discouraging reckless risk-taking. And he has given <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/15/vance-trump-economy-gop/">rhetorical support</a> to the Biden administration’s aggressive antitrust enforcement.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most heretically, Vance <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91157177/j-d-vance-says-he-is-pro-worker-heres-what-he-really-believes">claims to support</a> organized labor in theory, even if he’s less than enthusiastic about the trade union movement that actually exists. The senator has said that more American workers should be able to collectively bargain over pay and benefits but that the mainstream labor movement is <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/international-content/2024/07/jd-vance-vice-president-donald-trump-republican-ticket">“irreconcilably hostile to Republicans</a>” and that left-wing unions like Starbucks Workers United <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/03/15/mr-maga-goes-to-washington-00147054">deserve conservatives’ opposition</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, Vance’s ascension to the highest echelon of Republican politics is unlikely to transform the GOP into an effective steward of working-class interests. This is true for (at least) four reasons:</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">1) Where Vance’s ideas have broad Republican buy-in — as on trade and immigration — his policy preferences would be more likely to reduce native-born Americans’ living standards than increase them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">2) Vance’s concrete legislative proposals for increasing government intervention in the economy have tepid support from other Republicans and in any case would have only a marginal impact on US workers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">3) The Republican Party is structurally incapable of acting on Vance’s genuinely radical ideas about organized labor and the Ohio senator has done absolutely nothing to advance them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">4) The GOP has little incentive to betray the interests of its most well-heeled and organized constituencies for the sake of better serving working-class voters. After all, the party has already discovered that it can grow its support among blue-collar workers without making any significant concessions to their material interests.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Vance’s views on trade and immigration are anti-market but not pro-worker</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance is nothing if not an economic nationalist. He favors dramatically reducing immigration — particularly of undocumented and low-skill workers — and protecting domestic goods producers through expansive tariffs, such as Trump’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/24137666/trump-agenda-inflation-prices-dollar-devaluation-tariffs">proposal for a 10 percent across-the-board duty</a> on all foreign imports.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s unclear how many Republicans support trade restrictions that radical. Trump has succeeded in cultivating broad support within the GOP for at least some forms of protectionism and immigration restriction.&nbsp;Yet such nationalism offers little of material value to the typical American worker.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance detailed his populist case for immigration and trade restrictions in an interview with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/13/opinion/jd-vance-interview.html">New York Times</a> in May. In his account, both free trade and expansive immigration erode American workers’ living standards by reducing their bargaining power: If companies can access laborers who hail from poorer countries (and thus have lower wage expectations) — whether they come to the United States or employers go to them — then native-born Americans will be unable to compete unless they accept lower compensation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are two fundamental problems with this outlook. The first is that there is little evidence that immigration substantially harms native-born workers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance is correct that workers benefit from tight labor markets, where firms are forced to bid against each other for scarce employees, but high levels of immigration are compatible with such markets. When immigrants enter America, they expand the economy’s labor supply but also its labor demand, since immigrants (like all humans) consume goods and services.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The immigrant share of America’s labor force surged as the Covid-19 pandemic eased, hitting <a href="https://x.com/hshierholz/status/1759990590115021159">a record high in 2023</a>. This did not prevent US workers from seeing <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CES0500000003">large increases</a> in their nominal wages and reductions in unemployment over the same period, as demand for labor in many sectors outstripped its supply.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is plausible that a sudden surge of less-skilled immigrants into a given local labor market might, for a period of time, reduce the bargaining power of similarly skilled native-born workers in some sectors. Viewed in the aggregate, though, high levels of immigration appear to be economically beneficial for the native-born working class.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The theory that immigrants drive down wages and employment opportunities for the native-born has been repeatedly tested. The consensus of the empirical literature suggests they generally do not. Studies have searched for an adverse impact on wages or jobs from the <a href="https://www.peri.umass.edu/publication/item/1050-is-it-merely-a-labor-supply-shock-impacts-of-syrian-migrants-on-local-economies-in-turkey">mass influx of displaced Syrians into Turkey</a>, <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w13276/w13276.pdf">Dust Bowl migrants</a>’ immigration to other parts of the US during the Great Depression, <a href="http://www.su.se/polopoly_fs/1.123856.1360740401!/menu/standard/file/SULCIS%20WP%2020131.pdf">refugee migration to Sweden between 1999 and 2007</a>, refugees immigrating to <a href="http://ftp.iza.org/dp8961.pdf">Denmark in the 1980s and ’90s</a>, the mass movement of <a href="https://tad.colman.ac.il/paper-all/8212.pdf">Russian Jews to Israel after the fall of the USSR</a> — and in every case, found none. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10109-010-0111-y">Meta-analyses</a> of the research on <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1088876">immigration’s labor-market impacts</a> have found little to no negative consequences for native workers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By contrast, empirical evidence strongly suggests that immigration increases labor productivity. A <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w32389">recent working paper</a> from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that, between 2000 and 2019, immigration to the U.S. increased the wages of non-college-educated native-born workers by enabling a greater degree of labor specialization and, thus, productivity. Research from Harvard economist George Borjas <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2001/01/2001a_bpea_borjas.pdf">has similarly</a> found that immigration increases labor efficiency, thereby producing between $5 billion and $10 billion worth of economic value for native-born workers each year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, immigration increases the ratio of prime-age workers to senior citizens in the United States, which makes it <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/2024071633/social-security-depends-on-immigrants-especially-those-in-the-us-unlawfully">easier to sustain entitlements</a> at existing benefit levels.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another problem with Vance’s plan to increase working-class prosperity through economic nationalism is that tariffs benefit manufacturing workers at the expense of all other workers, and the former comprise only a tiny minority of the US labor force. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/09/economy/manufacturing-jobs/index.html#:~:text=Today%20less%20than%2010%25%20of,81%25%20more%20than%20retail%20jobs.">Fewer than 10 percent</a> of American workers are employed in the manufacturing sector. That is not merely a consequence of trade policy: Even at the end of World War II, only a minority of US workers labored in a factory.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most US workers will therefore be primarily consumers of physical goods rather than producers of them, even if trade protection increases manufacturing employment at the margin. As a result, tariffs reduce the purchasing power of the typical American worker without increasing their bargaining power. At a time when Americans have expressed a profound sensitivity to rising prices, it is unlikely that many US workers would respond positively to a 10 percent tax on all foreign-made goods, were Trump and Vance to put their tariff plan into place.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Vance’s support for small-scale populist reforms is clear. The authenticity of his avowed desire for radically increasing worker power is not.&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of Vance’s more idiosyncratic populist proposals are often more worthwhile. The senator’s plans, however, for increasing <a href="https://rollcall.com/2023/03/22/vance-rail-safety-legislation-is-not-big-government/">safety regulations in the railway industry</a>, punishing reckless bankers, and promoting domestic production of advanced technologies have won very limited support from fellow Republicans. As a result, none have made it into law.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is conceivable that the GOP might grow more open to these reforms were Vance to eventually win the presidency, but only because they do not threaten to dramatically shift the balance of power between business owners and workers in the United States. Perhaps a Vance-led Republican Party might be willing to antagonize a small segment of corporate America, such as the executives of failed banks or railroad companies, but increasing labor’s leverage over capital throughout the economy is a different story.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance has expressed interest in that radical pursuit. In <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/international-content/2024/07/jd-vance-vice-president-donald-trump-republican-ticket">an interview</a> with the populist conservative Sohrab Ahmari, the senator voiced support for sectoral bargaining: an arrangement in which all the workers in a given industry collectively bargain with all of its employers over minimum pay, benefits, and working conditions. <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/09/the-nerd-trying-to-turn-the-gop-populist.html">Oren Cass</a>, a conservative policy wonk closely aligned with Vance, has also endorsed such a system.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sectoral bargaining would radically change America’s political economy, to the benefit of workers. Low-wage employers would no longer be able to secure a competitive advantage through union-busting, and the overwhelming majority of American workers who do not belong to a union would win greater leverage over their bosses.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Vance has not introduced legislation to establish a system of sectoral bargaining. In fact, as far as I can tell, he only mentions that policy when <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/03/15/mr-maga-goes-to-washington-00147054">asked by reporters</a> why he does not support any of the existing bills to increase union power in America, such as <a href="https://www.vox.com/22319838/house-passes-pro-act-unions">the PRO Act</a> (Vance’s line is that the bill would further consolidate the nation’s status-quo labor model instead of moving it toward a sectoral system).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, although Vance has rhetorically <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91157177/j-d-vance-says-he-is-pro-worker-heres-what-he-really-believes">opposed right-to-work laws</a> (which undermine unions’ finances by enabling workers who benefit from collective bargaining to shirk dues) and stood for <a href="https://www.vance.senate.gov/press-releases/senator-vance-visits-uaw-picket-line-in-toledo-ohio/">photo-ops with striking workers</a>, while in office he has done little to nothing to aid organized labor. In 2023, Vance voted with <a href="https://aflcio.org/scorecard/legislators/jd-vance">the AFL-CIO</a> on 0 percent of the positions it endorsed; the average among all Senate Republicans was 3 percent.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyond strengthening unions, federal policymakers can increase workers’ leverage by expanding the welfare state, thereby making it easier for Americans to walk away from exploitative employers. Yet Vance has evinced little interest in growing the safety net. Although he shares Trump’s rhetorical opposition to cutting Medicare or Social Security’s retirement benefits, Vance has not proposed any major new social programs. He has reportedly <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/15/vance-trump-economy-gop/">pledged to the anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist</a> that he will oppose any proposal for raising taxes and told the Times that America can’t run “massive structural deficits indefinitely,” a pair of stances that effectively prohibit large expansions of social benefits.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">The GOP is a party of, by, and for bosses</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even if Vance’s alleged “pro-labor” politics were indisputably genuine and thoroughgoing, the odds of the GOP embracing an authentically pro-worker agenda would be slim.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is true that the Republican coalition has grown markedly more working-class over the past eight years. In every presidential election between 1948 and 2012, white voters in the top 5 percent of America’s income distribution <a href="https://twitter.com/thomasjwood/status/1375231548237213699">were more Republican</a> than those in the bottom 95 percent. Since Trump’s ascent, this pattern has reversed, with rich whites voting to the left of middle-class and poor ones in both 2016 and 2020. In the latter election, Trump made some gains with <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/12/why-democrats-are-losing-ground-with-hispanic-voters.html">working-class nonwhite voters,</a> and polls suggest he is poised to <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/351563/one-explanation-for-the-2024-elections-biggest-mystery">build on those gains</a> in November.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Among <a href="https://twitter.com/electionstudies?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@electionstudies</a> 2020 respondents, Trump replicated his (poor) 2016 performance among high income whites. <a href="https://t.co/T6HSTIrMRS">pic.twitter.com/T6HSTIrMRS</a></p>&mdash; Tom Wood (@thomasjwood) <a href="https://twitter.com/thomasjwood/status/1375231548237213699?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 25, 2021</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But just because Republican voters are getting more blue-collar doesn’t mean that the party’s agenda will inevitably get more pro-worker. When it comes to determining the content of a party’s policies, the views its voters express in opinion polls matter less than the demands its most powerful interest groups lay out in memos.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump voters might be a bit more sympathetic to labor than Mitt Romney’s voters were in 2012. Economically left-leaning Republican voters, though, are not organized; they do not collectively fund institutions that monitor GOP lawmakers’ voting behavior and punish disloyalty through negative ad campaigns. Right-wing Republican capitalists do.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-small-business/wp/2016/10/12/study-republicans-are-24-percent-more-likely-than-democrats-to-be-business-owners/">Business owners</a> in general — and staunchly anti-union ones, in particular — form the backbone of the institutional GOP. This is part of the New Deal’s long legacy: Once the Democratic Party aligned itself with organized labor, American businesses that could not tolerate an alliance with unions because their operations were labor-intensive and their profit margins were thin <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo3624792.html">sorted into the GOP</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Through industry lobbies like the Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers — and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Hands-Making-Conservative-Movement/dp/0393059308">myriad think tanks</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/5/29/18629799/federalist-society-brett-kavanaugh-olin-foundation-jane-mayer">legal organizations</a> bankrolled by industrialists — anti-union businesses built the literal and figurative foundations of the conservative movement.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They have remained very much in control of the GOP in the Trump era. During his first term as president, Trump <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/1/24/21078559/republicans-tax-cuts-congress-profits">enacted large tax cuts for businesses</a> and appointed a conservative National Labor Relations Board, which made it <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/unprecedented-the-trump-nlrbs-attack-on-workers-rights/">more difficult for workers to organize</a>, particularly at <a href="https://www.eater.com/2017/12/15/16780404/joint-employer-nlrb-trump">low-paying fast food franchises.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Business owners’ supremacy in the GOP may be most vivid at the state level. As Jamelle Bouie of the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/23/opinion/the-small-business-tyrant-has-a-favorite-political-party.html">has noted</a>, over the past two years, Republican lawmakers in Texas, Florida, Kentucky, and Louisiana have advanced legislation rolling back such basic worker protections as mandatory water breaks for outdoor workers, restrictions on working hours for child laborers, and lunch breaks for working minors. In some cases, the lawmakers backing these bills were business owners themselves.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance’s selection will not change the class composition of the Republican Party’s political class nor shift the fundamental material interests of the most well-organized and well-resourced interest groups in conservative America. Even if the Trump-Vance ticket succeeds in expanding the GOP’s blue-collar wing, that will not reduce elected Republicans’ incentives to cater to low-road employers. To the contrary, if Trump proves yet again that Republicans can win working-class votes merely through immigration restrictionism and populist gestures, they will have little reason to offer such voters forms of material uplift that would threaten corporate America’s profit margins.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The GOP is far less likely to remake itself in Vance’s image than vice-versa. After all, the vice presidential nominee has already proven willing to <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360283/jd-vance-trump-vp-vice-president-authoritarian">transform himself ideologically</a> as the political winds shift. Between 2016 and his Senate race in 2022, Vance went from being <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/07/opioid-of-the-masses/489911/">a NeverTrump conservative</a> to an unabashed <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/08/politics/fact-check-jd-vance-capitol-charges/index.html">champion of the January 6 rioters</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The path of least resistance for a power-hungry Republican in today’s GOP is to be a populist in the streets but a servant of the bosses in the C-suites. In all likelihood, ambition will guide Vance in that direction. Or at least, so the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/08/politics/fact-check-jd-vance-capitol-charges/index.html">militantly anti-labor</a> <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/elon-musk-and-tucker-carlson-secretly-lobbied-trump-to-pick-jd-vance">tech</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/technology/jd-vance-tech-silicon-valley.html">billionaires</a> who propelled him to the vice presidential nomination seem to believe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

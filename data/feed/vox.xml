<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/358323/hurricane-beryl-rapid-intesification-caribbean-climate">Beryl</a>, the first major hurricane of the year, has finally dissipated, but it’s still casting a long shadow in Texas. As of Tuesday afternoon, more than a week after the storm made landfall in the state, <a href="https://poweroutage.us/area/state/texas">more than 100,000 electricity customers</a> still didn’t have power — the vast majority of them in the Houston metropolitan area. Now <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/07/13/houston-power-outage-hurricane-beryl/1381720896872/">intense heat and humidity</a> have blanketed the region, leaving many vulnerable residents without the cooling they need to endure the hot, muggy weather with the heat index topping <a href="https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?textField1=29.7606&amp;textField2=-95.3697">100 degrees Fahrenheit</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While Beryl reached Category 5 strength earlier in the year than any hurricane on record, it landed in Texas as a much weaker Category 1 storm. It also hit a region that’s not just familiar with hurricanes — the catastrophic Hurricane Harvey was only seven years ago — but all sorts of extreme weather, including <a href="https://apnews.com/article/houston-texas-flooding-severe-weather-117b0f63c9bd53be31ee34e11547da21">torrential downpours</a>, <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/152843/derecho-darkens-houston">thunderstorms</a>, <a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/05/at-least-23-killed-in-long-weekend-swarm-of-severe-weather/">tornadoes</a>, and merciless heat that have all hit the state this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That raises an unavoidable question: Why wasn’t the local energy infrastructure better able to withstand the storm? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the height of Beryl’s impact, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-beryl-texas-7dfd5353671ee30d0c6d11518ea5a370">almost 3 million customers had lost power</a>. The Public Utility Commission of Texas, the state’s main energy regulator, announced on Monday it was <a href="https://www.kxan.com/news/texas/public-utility-commission-of-texas-to-launch-investigation-into-centerpoint-energy-over-beryl-response/">opening an investigation into CenterPoint Energy</a>, the main power utility in Houston. The inquiry will look into the utility’s preparation ahead of the storm and its response in the aftermath — both of which seem to have been lacking.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“What CenterPoint is showing us by its repeated failure to provide power, is they seem to be just incapable of doing their job,” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-beryl-houston-power-outage-23bb8aa69874c8019de237e5299492b0">Associated Press</a>. “This isn’t a failure of the entire system … This is an indictment of one company that’s failed to do its job.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the problems with Houston’s energy system didn’t start with Hurricane Beryl, although the tempest exposed its faults. As the Atlantic Ocean braces for an <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24145756/la-nina-2024-el-nino-heat-hurricane-record-temperature-pacific">active hurricane season</a>, the Texas coast may soon be tested again. And with global average temperatures increasing as humans change the climate, storm surges are rising and rainstorms are dishing out more water, <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/352234/how-one-weather-extreme-can-make-the-next-one-even-more-dangerous">compounding severe weather’s destructive potential</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">This isn’t Houston’s first rodeo</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For some Houstonians, Beryl brought back memories of Hurricane Harvey. “This one gives us PTSD, I have to tell you,” said <a href="https://uh.edu/hobby/about/faculty/pablo-pinto/">Pablo Pinto</a>, a professor of public policy at the University of Houston whose home was damaged during Harvey.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harvey landed in Texas at Category 4 strength. Though it weakened to a <a href="https://www.weather.gov/crp/hurricane_harvey">tropical storm as it approached Houston</a>, it <a href="https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20230425/historic-disaster-response-hurricane-harvey-texas">dumped an astounding 4.5 feet of rain</a> in <a href="https://www.weather.gov/crp/hurricane_harvey">four days</a>, and left behind <a href="https://tdem.texas.gov/disasters/hurricane-harvey">$125 billion in damages</a>, making Harvey the second-most expensive storm to make landfall in the continental US.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pinto co-authored a <a href="https://uh.edu/news-events/stories/2022-news-articles/august-2022/08252022-harvey-anniversary-flood.php">2022 report looking back at Harvey</a> and its lasting impacts on Houston. It found that almost one in five residents surveyed said they still hadn’t fully recovered from the storm. The storm also changed people’s attitudes toward building regulations in a city famous for <a href="https://www.houstontx.gov/planning/DevelopRegs/">not having zoning laws</a>. More than 90 percent of respondents said they were in favor of policies like restricting construction in flood plains, blocking development in wetlands, and building codes requiring flood-prone homes to be elevated.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, many of these measures target the losses specific to Harvey, which were mainly caused by extreme flooding rather than the high winds that might wreak havoc in a stronger storm. “We tend to prepare for the last war. That’s how we allocate resources,” Pinto said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And many of the post-Harvey proposals have been ignored.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Houston’s city council did approve some <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/04/04/houston-city-council-approves-changes-floodplain-regulations-narrow-vo/">new regulations to address flooding risk</a>, but people are still <a href="https://kinder.rice.edu/research/2021-state-housing-harris-county-and-houston">building homes in floodplains</a> and <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-weather/hurricanes/article/Houston-keeps-paving-over-Katy-prairie-development-17392801.php">paving over wetlands</a> that buffer flooding, in an effort to accommodate the city’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/houston/2024/03/19/texas-population-increase-htx">booming population</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-2162260335.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.736990722712,100,78.526018554576" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Jose Grinan, 71, holds extension cables he used for his generator to power his home after Hurricane Beryl caused major power outages. | Raquel Natalicchio/Houston Chronicle via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Raquel Natalicchio/Houston Chronicle via Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Beryl, on the other hand, moved faster through Houston and inflicted most of its damage from the strong winds and the tornadoes it spawned. Those <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/153035/beryl-makes-landfall-in-texas">80 mph gusts</a> knocked over utility poles and dropped trees onto power lines, which led to the widespread electricity outages. In addition to cutting off air conditioning during a heat wave, the blackouts interrupted power to fuel pumps, forcing residents to <a href="https://abc13.com/post/hurricane-beryl-recovery-long-lines-gas-groceries-kroger-heb-open/15047040/">wait hours for gasoline and diesel</a> from the remaining operational stations. That’s a major blow in a <a href="https://www.understandinghouston.org/blog/examining-houstons-reputation-as-a-car-city">notoriously sprawling, car-dependent city</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In this regard, Beryl was more like <a href="https://www.weather.gov/hgx/projects_ike08">Hurricane Ike</a> when it charged into Houston in 2008 as a Category 2 storm. That storm also <a href="https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Hurricane-Ike-hit-the-Houston-and-Galveston-areas-9219780.php">knocked out power to millions of people</a>, an early warning that the region’s energy infrastructure was highly vulnerable to extreme weather.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Together, these hurricanes illustrate that the intensity of the storm is only one factor in its destructive potential; the severity and the extent of the disaster also hinge on how many people are in harm’s way and what they do, or fail to do, to prepare. It’s what’s known as the <a href="https://chubasco.niu.edu/ebe.htm#:~:text=The%20%22Expanding%20Bull's%2DEye%20Effect%22&amp;text=A%20sample%20tornado%20scenario%20is,of%20potential%20impacts%20from%20hazards.">expanding bullseye effect</a> — as more people and development are put in the path of natural disasters, the damage of even weaker events can grow.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Houston’s energy problems reach beyond storms</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Texas’s famous independent streak extends to how it produces electricity. Unusually in the US, the Texas <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/ercot-texas-own-power-grid-interconnection-18693934.php">power grid is largely isolated</a> from neighboring states.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That helps Texas avoid scrutiny from federal regulators and run its own freewheeling electricity markets that prioritize low prices. But this system leaves its citizens vulnerable to power disruption. Its current energy grid creates little incentive for power companies to invest in backup power or costly infrastructure upgrades. So when <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/2/16/22284140/texas-blackout-outage-winter-storm-uri-ercot-power-grid-cold-snow-austin-houston-dallas">temperatures drop sharply</a> or <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/23893057/power-electricity-grid-heat-wave-record-blackout-outage-climate">when they spike</a>, causing surges in energy demand when generation capacity is strained, grid operators lean on customers to turn down their power use rather than import power from outside the state — or else the grid goes dark. Texas regulators are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-19/texas-to-revisit-power-reserve-policies-amid-spat-with-grid-watchdog?embedded-checkout=true">starting to change the rules</a> to encourage companies to invest more in grid resilience and are considering <a href="https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/local/plans-connect-ercot-power-grid-other-states-draw-new-attention/287-6d3f07fa-b991-46a6-a291-ca2ea528dda7">building more transmission lines</a> with other states.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Houston’s energy system has had its own unique issues within this milieu. “​​Texas in general — and CenterPoint in particular — had problems with reliability, even not during storms,” said Doug Lewin, an energy analyst who writes the <a href="https://www.douglewin.com/">Texas Energy and Power Newsletter</a>. In Texas, CenterPoint ranked among the <a href="https://www.saveonenergy.com/resources/texas-largest-utilities-reliability/">worst utilities for power outages</a> and one of the <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/ecnterpoint-energy-efficiency-ranking-18326186.php">worst in the country for energy efficiency</a>. The Texas grocery chain H-E-B <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/HEB-Centerpoint-electric-reduce-price-hike-15063001.php">even installed backup generators</a> at its Houston-area stores specifically because of CenterPoint’s unreliable service.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lewin noted that CenterPoint is a government-regulated public utility and so a big part of the blame falls on regulators who didn’t hold the company accountable for shortfalls or provide adequate resources to maintain its operations. “This is systemic neglect,” Lewin said. “It has taken decades and generations to get to this point and it’s probably going to take decades to fix.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there are fixes, and some of the work can begin right away.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One is to <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/12/15/16714146/greener-more-reliable-more-resilient-grid-microgrids">deploy microgrids</a> in vulnerable areas. This breaks the power grid down into smaller, independent blocks that can rely on more local power generation, particularly from sources like the wind and the sun. That means that if a major transmission line gets knocked down or roads become inaccessible, homes and businesses on a microgrid can keep their own lights on.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s also money available. The <a href="https://www.vox.com/22770447/infrastructure-bill-democrats-biden-water-broadband-roads-buses">2021 bipartisan infrastructure law</a> includes <a href="https://www.energy.gov/gdo/bipartisan-infrastructure-law">$5 billion in grants to harden the power grid</a> across the US against natural disasters and another $5 billion to make upgrades to improve reliability. Texas <a href="https://thehill.com/newsletters/sustainability/4300253-texas-to-design-deploy-thousands-of-microgrids-to-insulate-electric-system-from-disaster/">voters last year also approved</a> $1.8 billion to build <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/texas-proposition-7-ercot-grid-18411859.php?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&amp;emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&amp;emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=11.08.23%20Sustainability%20BH%20CMS">microgrids at critical facilities like hospitals</a>. In April, Harris County, which encompasses Houston, alongside five other Texas municipalities, received <a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/energy-environment/2024/04/22/484184/harris-county-wins-part-of-7-billion-federal-grant-to-expand-solar-power-access-for-low-income-households/">$250 million in federal funds</a> to deploy residential solar power for low-income residents.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This isn’t that hard. The technology is there,” Lewin said. “One year from now, we should have microgrids in Houston, Corpus Christi, Brownsville, all up and down the coast.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The bigger challenge may be changing Houston’s attitudes toward regulations and coordination around the power grid and disaster planning rather than the ad hoc, go-it-alone approach that’s dominated the region for years. “Some of those solutions require a bit more planning,” Pinto said. “Those things have been kind of a taboo in a place like Texas.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We don’t know much yet about the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360390/trump-shot-assassination-attempt-shooter-bullet-butler-pennsylvania-biden-secret-service-updates">shooter</a> who killed one man and wounded two others in an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump on Saturday.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We do know that he was 20 years old, and male.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those two facts — and his role in Saturday’s shocking crimes — put him in a small but frightening group: He’s now among a handful of young American men who, driven by psychological distress, hatred, or something else, commit highly public acts of violence with powerful guns.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He joins a list of young men that includes the two high school seniors who killed 13 people at Columbine High School in 1999; the 24-year-old who killed 12 people at a movie theater in Colorado in 2012; the 19-year-old who killed 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Florida, in 2018; the 18-year-old who killed 10 people at a Buffalo supermarket the same year; and, unfortunately, many more.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Across the board, young men are responsible for the vast majority of gun violence in this country,” said Jillian Peterson, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at Hamline University and executive director of the Violence Prevention Project Research Center. That’s especially true for public mass shooters, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/27/981803154/why-nearly-all-mass-shooters-are-men">98 percent of whom are male</a> and a growing number of whom are in their late teens or early 20s.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The reasons young men turn to public violence are many and complicated, but experts say that common factors include access to guns that has grown <a href="https://www.vox.com/23142734/kansas-city-superbowl-mass-shooting">even easier</a> in recent years and a sense of social isolation deepened by the pandemic. That isolation can lead young men to seek out community in dangerous places, including a growing number of online communities that glorify violence. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Troublingly, each new shooting reinforces a kind of cultural script, Peterson and others say: For young men in distress, murdering people in public has come to seem like an increasingly viable option. Before the Columbine murders, school shootings were unthinkable. Now, though they remain rare in absolute numbers, they can feel devastatingly commonplace, <a href="https://www.chalkbeat.org/2024/07/16/after-school-shootings-attempted-trump-assassination-teens-live-in-fear/">robbing children</a> and families of a sense of safety in their neighborhood schools. For a small group of troubled people, the dark examples of young men who have gone before have made public killings “a more realistic thing you can plan,” Peterson said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Much about the life and motives of the Trump rally shooter remains unknown, including the details of what led him to plan and carry out his crime on Saturday. But that crime was nonetheless part of a larger pattern in America, and understanding that pattern may be the first step to changing it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Young male shooters often have a history of trauma and isolation</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The public mass shooters Peterson has studied are “typically men who have been through a trauma background, who are isolated, who are disconnected,” she said. They often experience self-loathing or suicidal thoughts, and eventually come to find a grievance, someone or something they blame for their feelings.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One young man, for example, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/02/us/elliot-rodger-killings-in-california-followed-years-of-withdrawal.html">experienced bullying</a> and mental health issues for years and ultimately became consumed with rage at what he perceived as his rejection by women. In 2014, the 22-year-old killed six people and wounded 14 others in Isla Vista, California, before dying by suicide.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another young man, who at age 21 killed nine congregants at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/us/dylann-roof-charleston-killing-mental.html">described depression and friendlessness</a> leading up to the shooting and was diagnosed with multiple mental disorders, including social anxiety. He <a href="https://apnews.com/article/religion-shootings-race-and-ethnicity-racial-injustice-dylann-roof-9b83ed2ecca145ffa546746dd704a092">became a white supremacist</a>, ruthlessly targeting a predominantly Black congregation and filling a journal with racist rantings.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While no amount of loneliness can ever be an excuse for the kind of crimes these young men and others committed, understanding the histories and psychological profiles of killers can help clinicians and others spot problematic behaviors before they turn into violence. People of all genders can experience bullying and isolation, but boys in particular often begin to isolate themselves in adolescence, experts say. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before that time, “boys are very similar to girls in their social networks,” Adam Stanaland, a researcher at New York University who studies how young people think about gender, told Vox in an email. But as they approach puberty, “boys begin distancing and denying themselves intimate emotional connections as a way to prove their burgeoning manhood.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Young men also sometimes respond to loneliness in dangerous ways, experts say. In general, women are more likely to internalize negative feelings, with higher rates of anxiety, depression, and self-harm, Peterson said. Men are more likely to externalize these feelings with violence or substance abuse. And people under 25 overall are more impulsive and less able to consider consequences than their elders, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/06/03/why-so-many-mass-shooters-young-angry-men/">experts say</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most men will never commit violence, let alone a mass shooting, which is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/02/us/politics/mass-shootings-young-men-guns.html">typically defined</a> as the killing of four or more people (the assassination attempt on Saturday would not qualify, but in its highly public nature, shares many characteristics with these killings). But such crimes often represent an extreme example of a more common phenomenon.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lonely young men are especially “vulnerable to the appeals of some false community,” political scientist Robert Putnam, author of <em>Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community, </em>told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/13/magazine/robert-putnam-interview.html">New York Times</a> earlier this month<em>.</em> “Eager recruits to the Nazi Party in the 1930s were lonely young German men, and it’s not an accident that the people who are attracted today to white nationalist groups are lonely young white men.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Isla Vista shooter, for his part, spent time on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/02/us/elliot-rodger-killings-in-california-followed-years-of-withdrawal.html">pick-up-artist forums</a>, talking to other men who identified as <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/4/16/18287446/incel-definition-reddit">“incels”</a> — a moniker for those who describe themselves as involuntarily celibate — about retribution for the perceived slights of women. A 25-year-old who killed 10 people with a van in Toronto in 2018 also <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/4/16/18287446/incel-definition-reddit">described himself as an incel</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Isolation has been an especially prominent factor in public killings since the pandemic began, Peterson said. In recent years, a growing share of mass shooters has been young men who have graduated from high school but are not in college or working — “nobody really had eyes on them or noticed,” Peterson said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Online, said Peterson, these young men can find “communities where violence is really celebrated.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Easy access to guns gives young men a chilling opportunity</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For some young men, public gun violence has become a cultural trope they can all too easily emulate, Peterson said. It started with the Columbine killings and accelerated with the rise of social media. Public mass shooters often study the manifestos or videos left behind by previous shooters, she added.<strong> </strong>“They kind of want to be a part of this group.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Which brings us to another major factor leading some young men in America to commit public violence: the sheer ease of obtaining a powerful gun. Men are about <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/406238/stark-gender-gap-gun-ownership-views-gun-laws.aspx">twice as likely</a> as women to own a gun, and male high school students are much more likely than their female classmates to report <a href="https://ojjdp.ojp.gov/statistical-briefing-book/offending-by-youth/faqs/qa03504">carrying a weapon</a>.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-how-guns-are-advertised-in-america-2012-12#adam-lanza-brandished-a-bushmaster-ar-15-when-he-murdered-27-women-and-small-children-in-newtown-this-is-how-that-weapon-is-marketing-to-the-general-public-magazine-ads-equate-owning-the-gun-to-being-a-man-1">Gun ads</a> often make an explicit connection between firearms and masculinity, Stanaland said. “Carrying guns is viewed as a way to shore up masculinity among certain men,” he explained. “If they are feeling insecure and want to prove their masculinity, they may do so by carrying a gun (or, worse, shooting that gun in ways that harm others).”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gun policy, meanwhile, has done little or nothing to interrupt the devastating cycle of violence. The 2022 Supreme Court decision in <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/24151144/supreme-court-worst-decisions-donald-trump"><em>New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association v. Bruen</em></a>, for example, has made gun control legislation incredibly difficult for states to pass and maintain. The <a href="https://www.thetrace.org/2023/03/guns-america-data-atf-total/">increase in gun production</a> since 2020 and the <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/fact-sheet-weakening-requirements-to-carry-a-concealed-firearm-increases-violent-crime/">rise of concealed-carry</a> laws have made firearms an ever more ubiquitous and inescapable part of public life.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Keeping those firearms out of the hands of people who are unstable is frighteningly difficult. “There are shockingly few avenues to stop people who are spiraling before they commit acts of violence,” Jonathan Metzl, a professor of sociology and psychiatry at Vanderbilt University who has studied gun violence, told Vox in an email.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2018, for example, a 29-year-old man killed four people with an AR-15-style rifle in a Nashville Waffle House. He had come to the attention of the police at least five times before the shooting, said Metzl, whose forthcoming book, <em>What We’ve Become</em>, deals with the episode. “But because of permissive gun laws, there was literally nothing authorities could do to disarm him until after he had killed people.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many experts have floated the idea of age restrictions on the most powerful weapons. “We need to pay attention to the scientific evidence that suggests these young minds may not be capable of having the serious responsibility of owning an assault rifle,” Kami Chavis, director of the criminal justice program at Wake Forest University School of Law, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/06/03/why-so-many-mass-shooters-young-angry-men/">told the Washington Post</a> in 2022.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such restrictions have gained little traction in a political environment that remains highly deferential to gun rights. Months before the attempt on Trump’s life, Republicans in the Pennsylvania state legislature blocked a bill to ban the type of rifle used in the attack, <a href="https://www.levernews.com/pennsylvania-gop-fought-a-ban-on-the-gun-used-in-trump-shooting/">the Lever reported</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Experts say no plan to stop future mass shootings is complete without gun control legislation. The Violence Prevention Project Research Center, for example, calls for universal background checks and an assault weapons ban, as well as measures to limit access to guns for people who are in crisis.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, there are also ways that individuals and communities can help prevent young men from turning to violence. Limiting social isolation for young children, especially boys, is critical, Peterson said. So is training adults in crisis intervention and suicide prevention, since public mass shooting is often a form of suicidal behavior.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While young men turning to gun violence may seem inexplicable or, in our current environment, inevitable, there are often many opportunities to prevent such crimes, experts say. In interviews with men who have committed mass shootings, “I always ask them, is there anyone or anything that could’ve stopped you,” Peterson said. “They will always say yes.”</p>

They promise to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K31dg86OmuM">give you wings</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fj15o_SbXXKo%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&amp;tbnid=4d0dq_HrvY-xEM&amp;vet=12ahUKEwiTpdKP-4WHAxXTpIkEHQLaCuMQMygFegQIARBT..i&amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fm.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dj15o_SbXXKo&amp;docid=1tsP-2Wx_qBDMM&amp;w=1280&amp;h=720&amp;q=monster%20energy%20release%20the%20beast%20ad&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiTpdKP-4WHAxXTpIkEHQLaCuMQMygFegQIARBT">unleash the beast</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a40-yB3DgEY">make you the boss of time</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7Z6fAcp-Wu/?hl=en">enable the crushing of your enemies</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No wonder sales have boomed in recent years, growing by <a href="https://store.mintel.com/us/report/us-energy-drinks-market-report/">73 percent from 2018 to 2023</a>. Nearly half of consumers drink them multiple times a week. In addition to the offerings at retail and convenience stores, chains like Starbucks, Dunkin, and Caribou Coffee are <a href="https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/beverage/despite-paneras-charged-lemonade-failure-energy-drinks-are-coming-more-restaurants">adding energy drinks</a> to their menus. In the next five years, energy drink sales are on track to reach $30 billion in the US.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The vast majority of the people who drink energy drinks — mostly teens and <a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks">men aged 18 to 34</a> — don’t die as a result. Occasionally, though, some do. The Center for Science in the Public Interest counted <a href="https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2014/07/energy-drinks-increasingly-cause-health-problems/#:~:text=Data%20recently%20obtained%20by%20the,Monster%20and%20one%20to%20Rockstar.">34 deaths linked to these products</a> between 2004 and 2014. More recently, the families of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/24/us/panera-caffeine-charged-lemonade-death.html">female college student</a> and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/05/us/panera-charged-lemonade-death.html">46-year-old man</a> sued Panera over the deaths of their loved ones following consumption of its highly caffeinated Charged Lemonade drinks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A far larger chunk of people who consume energy drinks experience other unpleasant <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4682602/">side effects</a> as a result, ranging from sleeplessness to twitchiness to anxiety to gastrointestinal distress. Still, demand for these products is mounting, even outside of their sweaty core constituency.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s not an accident: As the current male market has neared energy drink saturation, manufacturers have set their sights on adults beyond college age — especially women, according to a recent report from market analysis firm Mintel. They’re reaching these new mouths by capitalizing on a growing and somewhat whimsical <a href="https://ific.org/media-information/press-releases/2024-food-beverage-trends/">demand</a> that the liquids we drink not only quench our thirst, but also reduce our stress, focus our minds, and improve our physical performance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s why, despite the persistent drip-drip of deaths that trails the industry, energy drink manufacturers are bullish (sorry) about their future.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Energy drinks contain a variety of stimulants, some of which we understand better than others</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Energy drinks’ wakefulness-boosting qualities come by virtue of their ability to get stimulants into your bloodstream with cold, sweet efficiency and only an occasional metallic aftertaste.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition to lots of added sugar, almost all energy drinks add caffeine to their formulations. Many also include <a href="https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/1541-4337.12862">guarana</a>, an Amazonian plant that contains high levels of naturally occurring caffeine and other stimulants. Another common ingredient is <a href="https://www.ccjm.org/content/83/12/895">taurine</a>, a building block of proteins that occurs naturally in the human body and actually has the effect of tamping down the activity of certain nerve cells.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In moderate amounts, caffeine makes people feel more <a href="https://accp1.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/j.1552-4604.1997.tb04356.x">alert, attentive, and energetic</a>. However, in larger amounts, its negative effects — including jitteriness, nausea, and tremor — may overwhelm the positive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Scientists know surprisingly little about taurine’s and guarana’s toxicities in humans — most of the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/files/food/published/GRAS-Notice-000586---Taurine.pdf">safety data</a> for these products comes from <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jce.15458">animal</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4399916/">studies</a> — but they know a lot more about <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8467199/">caffeine’s effects on various human organ systems</a>. Many of those effects depend on how often and how much of it you consume: Although a big cup of coffee won’t meaningfully affect blood pressure or heart rate in people who are daily coffee drinkers, it could <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8352830/">spike both in non-coffee drinkers</a>, and large quantities can lead to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6247400/">serious side effects</a>, including severe recurrent vomiting, seizures, and muscle breakdown.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s also enormous variation in the <a href="https://www.cspinet.org/caffeine-chart#coffee_shop">amount of caffeine energy drinks contain</a>. A typical 8-ounce cup of coffee has around 100 to 150 milligrams of caffeine. Filling the same cup with Monster Energy gives you only 80 milligrams, while filling it with 5-Hour Energy (four shot-sized bottles’ worth, something I implore you not to do) would give you 800 milligrams. (The Food and Drug Administration recommends a daily maximum of <a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much#:~:text=For%20healthy%20adults%2C%20the%20FDA,it%20(break%20it%20down).">400 milligrams</a> of caffeine for most adults, a guideline based on recommendations issued by Canadian public health authorities.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, a large cup of the now-discontinued Panera Charged Lemonade, without ice, could contain <a href="https://www.cspinet.org/cspi-news/panera-stop-selling-charged-lemonade-following-lawsuits">390</a> milligrams of caffeine. Because they were initially sold in self-serve dispensers, customers could easily free-refill their way to several days’ allowance of caffeine in one sitting. (The largest size of Starbucks’s Iced Energy tops out at 205 milligrams, and refills are not free.)&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>How energy drink ingredients can lead to medical emergencies&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although energy drinks have been linked with a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10535526/">range of worrisome health effects</a>, some of the biggest concerns are related to their effects on the cardiovascular system and the heart’s rhythm in particular. Several studies have shown energy drinks <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5714807/">raise heart rate and blood pressure</a>, which in extreme cases can lead to spasms, rips, or clotting in blood vessels. They have also been linked to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5524057/">disruptions</a> to the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8834195/">heart’s wiring</a> that in certain higher-risk people could lead to cardiac arrest — when the heart stops beating entirely.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One out of every 200 people have a genetic heart condition of some kind that puts them in that high-risk category, says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ackerman-michael-j-m-d-ph-d/bio-20053036">Michael Ackerman</a>, a cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. The most common circuitry problem in that group is called <a href="https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/romano-ward-syndrome/">long QT syndrome</a>, which affects one out of every 2,000 or so people.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ackerman counsels people with this syndrome to avoid medications, foods, and beverages (like energy drinks) that irritate the heart’s wiring, and occasionally prescribes medication to reduce their risk of having a rhythm problem. However, the condition is often asymptomatic and therefore may go undiagnosed until someone has symptoms.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not clear exactly which ingredients in energy drinks are responsible for throwing a wrench in the heart’s circuitry.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Caffeine seems as though it would be the most likely culprit — in pure and highly concentrated forms, the drug can be lethal — but in clinical studies of smaller amounts of caffeine on its own, it doesn’t seem to cause heart <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3038145/">wiring changes</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8290332/">rhythm problems</a>. (However, outside of closely monitored study settings, people are probably drinking larger quantities of energy drinks at a much faster clip; it may be that researchers have simply never studied the caffeine-related effects of real-world levels of energy drink consumption.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The effects of energy drinks’ other ingredients on heart rhythms are an even bigger question mark, although some <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jce.15458">studies</a> suggest <a href="https://www.heartrhythmjournal.com/article/S1547-5271(24)00265-0/pdf#:~:text=Cardiovascular%20risk%20of%20energy%20drinks,%3B33%3A1290%E2%80%931297.">interactions</a> between multiple ingredients may disrupt heart rhythms.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“Consumption is at all-time-high levels, and people aren’t dropping like flies left and right”</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ackerman has been asking his patients about energy drink consumption since 2000 and recently conducted a small <a href="https://www.heartrhythmjournal.com/article/S1547-5271(24)00189-9/abstract">study</a> looking back at the medical records of the 144 patients he evaluated after they survived a cardiac arrest. Seven of them — 5 percent — had consumed an energy drink shortly before their hearts stopped beating. Only one of those seven had a previous diagnosis of a heart condition known to make energy drink consumption more risky.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One detail of the study was particularly eye-catching to me: Six of the seven patients with post-energy-drink cardiac arrest were women. Ackerman said that’s likely related to <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/03/230315143818.htm">estrogen’s propensity to induce heart rhythm fritziness</a> in people with long QT syndrome. Still, the finding seems deeply ironic given that women have historically consumed far fewer energy drinks than men.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is a tiny study, and Ackerman cautions against overreacting to its findings. “Consumption is at all-time-high levels, and people aren’t dropping like flies left and right,” he says. “The absolute risk, if your heart is healthy, is super, super, super low.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, many energy drinks are marketed as supplements and can therefore claim to do all kinds of things without proof, says <a href="https://www.cspinet.org/biography/jensen-jose">Jensen Jose</a>, who works on regulation issues related to food additives, food chemicals, and dietary supplements at the Center for Science in the Public Interest.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They can do so without giving you the information you need to moderate your intake of caffeine or other proven or potential compounds that stimulate or irritate the cardiovascular system. Although a product label may list caffeine and guarana extract, says Jose, “You have no idea how much caffeine you’re getting from either one of those ingredients.” An <a href="https://www.crnusa.org/resources/facts-about-caffeine-dietary-supplements">FDA loophole</a> means there aren’t legal limits on the amount of caffeine in any of these products, nor does the agency require manufacturers to tell you how much caffeine is in them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How should consumers who like energy drinks keep themselves safe? “There’s no answer to your question,” says Jose, in large part because so little is known about what’s in a lot of these beverages and what intake levels make the most sense. Still, consuming only drinks that list their caffeine content — and consuming those in moderation, ensuring you’re staying under the FDA’s recommended daily limit — is, he says, better than mindlessly pounding one can after another.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although Ackerman doesn’t think the drinks’ sale should be restricted, the risk-benefit equation doesn’t at all tilt toward consuming them. “They don’t have much redeeming health value anyways,” he says. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends kids and teens <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/nutrition/energy.htm">avoid energy drinks entirely</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Energy drinks began as a product marketed toward men, but that’s changing&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The modern energy drinks’ <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/18/how-the-world-got-hopped-up-on-energy-drinks-prime-logan-paul-ksi">closest ancestor</a> is probably the Japanese <a href="https://www.taisho.co.jp/global/our_products/lipovitan_series.html">Lipovitan D</a>, which first rolled out in 1962. Powered by a combination of taurine, caffeine, and other ingredients, these drinks were marketed with an emphasis on a hegemonic fight/burn/roar sleep-is-for-the-weak <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;doi=eb188ed7eb1de9faa24e5000b68be85b72665665">type of masculinity</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the 1980s, an Austrian businessman’s encounter with a Thai beverage containing taurine and caffeine led to the creation of Red Bull, the first entry into the modern Western energy drink canon. The market has only grown since, spurred by partnerships with the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/how-energy-drink-companies-prey-on-male-insecurities">growing extreme sports and video gaming industries</a>, which already attracted hordes of teen boys extremely receptive to messaging aimed squarely at their desire to prove their masculinity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2015, psychologist <a href="https://drronaldlevant.com/">Ronald Levant</a> found that among white college-aged men, energy drink consumption was driven by an <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25730610/">embrace of traditional masculine ideology</a>, which defines “real men” as tough, dominant, horny, handy, homophobic, and unemotional (unless mad or triumphant). Much of this effect was about boys seeking ways to be more manly, he tells Vox: “They&#8217;re looking for ways to enhance their masculinity, and they saw energy drinks as a way to do that.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The aspiration to that kind of manliness is still alive and well on what commentator Max Read has called the <a href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/hawk-tuah-and-the-zynternet">Zynternet</a>, the “fratty, horndog, boorishly provocative” corners online. The people occupying those corners and the men in their social networks still comprise a big <a href="https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2024/05100/the_impact_of_social_media_on_adolescent_energy.67.aspx">part</a> of the target <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9518090/">audience</a> for many energy drink brands.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because energy drinks have leaned so hard into their associations with traditional masculine norms, you might imagine they’d have a hard time finding audiences among groups less interested in beating their chests and peeing on things.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“Hydration has been by far the trend for the last year and a half. It is off the charts.”</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Several years ago, however, manufacturers began a concerted effort to change that and started targeting tired, distracted women and post-college adults looking for&nbsp;solutions to their droopiness. Enter <a href="https://www.alaninu.com/collections/drinks-snacks">Alani’s</a> saturated tropical swirls, <a href="https://www.celsius.com/">Celsius’</a> fruit-forward flavors and packaging, Red Bull’s curuba elderflower “<a href="https://www.redbull.com/us-en/energydrink/red-bull-sea-blue-edition-juneberry?utm_source=paid_search&amp;utm_medium=google&amp;utm_campaign=10055_V3_P_2024_USHQ_BRAND_TOTSEM&amp;utm_keyword=refreshing%20energy%20drink&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwhb60BhClARIsABGGtw9Gmun1fPXdElhgLN-OKvgq_RRD0anQvQ7ufJgRCz47Qda7X7Yh514aAji4EALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">Summer Edition</a>,” and the no-longer-in-production <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/GOGIRL/Homepage/page/78961ADB-4A0E-4E63-B275-FD66B62A8B23">Go Girl</a>. <a href="https://wmich.edu/foodmarketing/directory/zwanka">Russell Zwanka</a>, who directs the food marketing program at Western Michigan University, says the pivot to young adults and women was unambiguous and long overdue.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The trend that’s enabling this more expansive view of the energy drink audience is the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0963996923005914">consumer itch</a> for beverages that do things, says Zwanka. “All marketing is now geared toward, ‘What is the function of the beverage?’” he says. In food marketing parlance, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/functional-beverage#:~:text=A%20functional%20beverage%20is%20a,et%20al.%2C%202014).">functional beverages</a> contain biologically active compounds that give them specific health benefits. Currently, the most highly sought-after benefit is one you’d think would be a slam-dunk for something you slurp from a can: “Hydration has been by far the trend for the last year and a half. It is off the charts,” says Zwanka.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To take energy drinks at their word, you’d have to forget they’re actually <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000291652206556X?via%3Dihub">unlikely to provide better hydration</a> than Gatorade or milk, especially because at higher doses, caffeine functions as a diuretic — that is, it actually drives water loss through increased urination. Energy drinks are promising it anyway, and so much more, because there’s simply not that much regulatory oversight on what’s in them or how they&#8217;re marketed. That’s doing a great disservice to Americans, says Jose.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We want transparency in our food system,” says, “and we think that’s a pretty obvious first step.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Former President Donald Trump used to be persona non grata in Silicon Valley.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/nearly-all-of-silicon-valleys-political-dollars-are-going-to-hillary-clinton/">Nearly all of the dollars</a> spent by Silicon Valley elites in 2016 went to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. In 2020, those elites <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/nearly-all-of-silicon-valleys-political-dollars-are-going-to-hillary-clinton/">spent even more</a> to defeat Trump. The few who supported Trump that year — such as venture capitalist Peter Thiel, the co-founder of Paypal and Palantir — <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/9/17/20869679/donald-trump-silicon-valley-fundraiser-2020">did so knowing they were standing on a third rail</a>, and many did not speak openly about it for fear of backlash that could hurt their businesses.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Something has changed since the last election cycle.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Elon Musk, who <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/elon-musk-says-he-fully-endorses-tough-trump-posts-photo-2024-07-13/">endorsed Trump Saturday</a> after the assassination attempt against him, planned to send <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/elon-musk-has-said-he-is-committing-around-45-million-a-month-to-a-new-pro-trump-super-pac-dda53823">$45 million a month</a> to a pro-Trump super PAC starting in July. (Musk appeared to push back on the reporting with a <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1813097084595163643">meme on X</a> reading: “FAKE GNUS.”) </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The prominent tech investor and entrepreneur David Sacks — who previously said that Trump should be <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-05/venture-capitalist-david-sacks-is-all-in-on-donald-trump">disqualified from office</a> for his actions surrounding the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol — has now endorsed the former president. Sacks <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/15/david-sacks-speech-rnc/74411040007/">gave a speech at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee</a> on Monday.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of Silicon Valley’s largest venture capital firms, Andreessen Horowitz, has also recently indicated that it will <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/marc-andreessen-ben-horowitz-say-they-plan-to-donate-to-trump-pac">donate large amounts</a> to PACs supporting Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The Blue Wall of tech is crumbling before our very eyes,” Ryan Selkis, the founder and CEO of the crypto research firm Messari, <a href="https://x.com/twobitidiot/status/1798055006618472629">wrote on X</a> last month.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Selkis’s assessment might not be entirely true. By most indications, Silicon Valley is still overwhelmingly Democratic. But tech elites who are supporting Trump seem to be more comfortable doing so openly and without fear of being ostracized for it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Why some Silicon Valley leaders are backing Trump</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Silicon Valley is not undergoing a seismic rightward shift.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As of 2022, <a href="https://siliconvalleyindicators.org/data/governance/civic-engagement/partisan-affiliation/percentage-of-registered-voters-by-political-party/">a little over half of voters</a> in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties (which encompass Silicon Valley) were registered Democrats. That share hasn’t changed much since the 1970s. The share of voters with no party preference has increased, while the share of Republican voters shrank to about 15 percent in 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Silicon Valley venture capitalists also seem to be supporting Democrats at a higher-than-average rate compared to the last 10 election cycles. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/silicon-valley-crypto-trump-biden-debate/">A recent Wired analysis</a> found that Democrats received $2 for every dollar that Republicans received from the 20 firms that, together with their employees, made the most political contributions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That suggests Silicon Valley’s political views are still largely consistent with a <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/working-papers/predispositions-political-behavior-american-economic-elites">2017 study</a> indicating that wealthy technologists supported many liberal policies: redistribution of wealth, abortion, gay rights, immigration, and more.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there was one issue on which, even in 2017, they chafed with Democrats: They <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/technology/silicon-valley-politics.html">didn’t want the government to interfere</a> in the operation of their businesses. And that might be driving at least some of the support for Trump among Silicon Valley elites this election cycle.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President Joe Biden has taken a hardline approach against Big Tech that might be perceived by some donors as overreach. The administration has filed sweeping antitrust lawsuits against four major tech companies: <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2024/3/21/24108155/apple-new-antitrust-lawsuit-iphone-monopoly">Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/technology/google-antitrust-trial-closing-arguments.html">Google</a> (now known as Alphabet), <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/19/technology/ftc-facebook-antitrust.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-big-tech&amp;variant=show&amp;region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&amp;block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc">Meta</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/technology/google-apple-amazon-meta-antitrust.html">Amazon</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the downfall of the crypto exchange FTX and its <a href="https://www.vox.com/business-and-finance/2024/3/28/24114058/sam-bankman-fried-sbf-ftx-conviction-sentence-date">founder Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, the Biden administration has also <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/31/state-of-crypto-regulation-in-2023-eu-laws-approved-but-us-is-top-cop.html">cracked down on crypto</a>, filing lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance and trying to advance more stringent regulation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s new running mate, J.D. Vance, seems to broadly share the Biden administration’s philosophy: he has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24199314/jd-vance-donald-trump-vp-antitrust-big-tech-ftc-lina-khan-elizabeth-warren-google">applauded Lina Khan</a>, the head of the Federal Trade Commission behind the antitrust suits against Big Tech. It’s not clear whether he will temper that position now that he’s running for vice president, but some tech titans seem to be supporting the Republican ticket anyway.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Andreessen Horowitz had previously suggested that government regulation would determine which party receives their dollars. “We are non-partisan, one-issue voters: If a candidate supports an optimistic technology-enabled future, we are for them. If they want to choke off important technologies, we are against them,” the <a href="https://a16z.com/politics-and-the-future/">firm announced</a> in December.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sNclEgQZQ">video posted on Tuesday</a>, founders Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz further explained why their firm would be supporting Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The future of our business, the future of &#8230; new technology, and the future of America is literally at stake,” Horowitz said, acknowledging that he would be angering friends and family. “We think Donald Trump is actually the right choice.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Crypto leaders, who have for years <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/05/25/crypto-lobbying-politics-washington/">poured money</a> into the fight against further regulation of the industry, have also contributed <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/silicon-valley-crypto-trump-biden-debate/">more heavily</a> to Republicans. The crypto PAC Stand With Crypto has not issued an endorsement in the presidential race but has identified Trump and Robert F. Kennedy as <a href="https://www.standwithcrypto.org/races">better options</a> than Biden.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyond regulation, it seems that some Silicon Valley billionaires are becoming more vocal in their support of Trump just because they can without suffering boycotts or lots of bad press. For instance, Musk has always been a bit of a contrarian but seems to have taken on a more politically active presence online since he bought Twitter and renamed it X. And while his stance may have <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-pitches-advertisers-on-a-return-to-x-months-after-telling-some-to-f-themselves-532d2745">cost him users and advertisers</a> early in his X tenure, his endorsement of Trump has yet to be met with a similar backlash.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Biden is on the back foot on fundraising</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The support Trump is receiving from a few wealthy patrons in Silicon Valley should nevertheless worry the Biden campaign.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As of the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/21/trump-overtakes-biden-campaign-fundraising-00164384">last campaign finance reports</a> through the end of May, Trump had surpassed Biden in cash on hand. Trump had $116.6 million in his campaign coffers compared to Biden’s $91.6 million.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That advantage has likely only grown in the months since. Biden has reportedly <a href="http://v">struggled with fundraising</a> since his disastrous debate performance last month. Some donors think he should drop out and have promised to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/12/us/politics/biden-donors-money.html">suspend donations to Democrats</a> until he does so; others have paused contributions while they wait for assurance that he will not be replaced with another Democratic candidate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump, meanwhile, has <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-fundraising-assassination-attempt-1925137">started fundraising off of the assassination attempt</a> against him. His campaign website <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/14/trump-campaign-website-bloody-fist-pump-photo/74404529007/">redirected</a> to a photo of him punching the air with blood on his face at the campaign rally where he was shot in the ear.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Musk is indeed planning to contribute tens of millions to Trump’s campaign monthly through the election, it’s hard to see how Biden can keep up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In April 1945, a young man named David Rubin was about to die.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A Jewish capmaker from a small town he called Pruzana, today known as Pruzhany in Belarus, Rubin had managed to survive the nightmare of Auschwitz for two years. Fearing the Allied advance, SS soldiers moved Rubin and 1,620 others to Buchenwald, a concentration camp in central Germany, and from there on a death march south into Bavaria.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After about two days of torture, they entered a small town outside Munich called Ergoldsbach. A group of regular German army soldiers were in the town, lounging in the street with their vehicles. Rubin yelled, “Look, look!” to create a distraction, and quickly slid under a tank. He stayed there until the SS guards had gone. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the next two weeks, Rubin lived on scraps scrounged up by a friendly Polish worker; at one point, he hid from German soldiers in a pile of dry dung on a local farm. When the American army liberated the town at the end of the month, a soldier from Chicago found him lying in a street, unable to move his legs. Seeing Rubin’s&nbsp;Auschwitz tattoo on his arm, the soldier carried him to a hospital and ordered the Germans to take care of him.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Once he recovered, Rubin became the leader of the small community of Jewish survivors stranded in Ergoldsbach. He met an American who worked for the US government’s refugee aid branch. The American tracked down a cousin of Rubin’s in the United States, a connection that eventually helped Rubin get permission to immigrate. About four years later, he and his new wife, Anita, also a Holocaust survivor, crossed the Atlantic. They settled near David’s family in Philadelphia, where their child was born — my mother, Ruth.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I learned the details of David’s extraordinary story in 2011, six years after his death, thanks to a German scholar named Gerhard Strasser. Strasser had been working with residents of Ergoldsbach to document the history of the town during the Holocaust and invited our family to attend a ceremony presenting some of the findings. What I remember from that trip, more than anything else, are the children.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Students at a local school had been assigned projects on Ergoldsbach’s Holocaust history, including researching and writing short presentations on Jewish survivors. This wasn’t just a normal school assignment; people from around the town came to watch their children recite stories of what had happened. In the audience, I waited anxiously to hear my grandfather’s name. Eventually, a German child stood up and told the class about David Rubin’s improbable survival and rise to leadership among the survivors.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This was not merely a commemoration; it was repentance. In Ergoldsbach, I felt the weight Germans had put on themselves — and felt moved, as a Jew, that they still cared.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While Americans have long clashed over our country’s cruel and bigoted past, Germans have undertaken one of the most thoroughgoing efforts of any nation on the planet to reckon with their history. Germany, perhaps more than any other country, has attempted to pull out by the roots its homegrown variant of the reactionary spirit — the tendency of opponents of social change to choose hierarchy over democracy, trying to constrain or even topple democracy to protect hierarchies of wealth and status.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&nbsp;The Nazis were born out of disgust with post-World War I Weimar democracy, led by men furious about both the new government’s weakness and acceptance of the Jewish minority into German society. After Nazism brought Germany to ruin, preventing a reactionary resurgence became one of the central goals of the country’s subsequent leaders.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So it’s all the more extraordinary that in the past few years, Germany’s far right has been on the rise.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2015, at the peak of the global refugee crisis, German chancellor Angela Merkel announced an open-door policy for those fleeing violence in Syria and elsewhere. In response, the Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) party, a Euroskeptic faction without a single seat in Parliament, morphed into a virulently xenophobic force calling for Germany to slam Merkel’s open door shut.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2017’s national elections, AfD won 94 seats in the Bundestag, turning it into Germany’s third-largest political party.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Opposing the country’s approach to the migration policy did not, in and of itself, make AfD a threat to German democracy. But over time the party’s behavior has become more and more troubling.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2020, AfD supporters participated in an attempted storming of the German capitol building, the Bundestag, in a protest over Covid-19 restrictions. In December 2022, German police busted an armed cell that was plotting to forcibly install a minor noble as Germany’s new kaiser. One of the coup plotters was a former AfD member of Parliament who was serving in a minor party leadership role at the time of her arrest.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In February 2023, the executive vice president of the International Auschwitz Committee — a Berlin-based anti-hate group founded by Holocaust survivors — compared the party to the Nazis.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet AfD’s rise has continued. Politico Europe’s average of German polls shows that, between July 2022 and 2023, the party’s nationwide support nearly doubled — going from 11 percent to 20 percent. By early 2024, AfD was solidly the second-most popular party in Germany; it won a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/10/world/europe/germany-afd-eu-election.html">new record vote share</a> in June’s European Parliament election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The threat AfD poses to German democracy is, at least to some extent, contained by the German multiparty system, in which every mainstream party has so far refused to consider forming a national governing coalition with the AfD.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But its rise illustrates something vitally important: That Germany, of all countries, could fail to prevent a surge in reactionary antidemocratic politics suggests there’s something eternal and enduring about the reactionary spirit. And there is something about our current time period that makes it especially likely to flourish — not just in Germany, but around the world.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

<p class="has-text-align-none">Political scientists often separate the rise of democracy into three broad waves.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first dates from the early 19th century to the years immediately following World War I. The second begins immediately after World War II, defined by the rebirth of democracy in western Europe and its emergence in a handful of postcolonial states.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This would soon be eclipsed by a massive third wave beginning in the 1970s and lasting for somewhere around 40 years. During this period, dictatorships of both the right and the left fell almost everywhere: Latin America, East Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Eurasian countries of the former Eastern Bloc. By the turn of the century, roughly half of all countries around the world were democracies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democracy seems so normal, from a contemporary perspective, that it’s easy to lose sight of just how stunning this transformation was. Some variant of authoritarianism has been the default setting of human government for thousands of years. But in a little more than half a century, democracy went from nearly extinct — just 12 democracies survived the Second World War — to globally dominant. No single political system had ever conquered the entire planet so rapidly or so thoroughly.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, it appeared that the 20th-century triumph of democracy was complete. Having defeated fascism, its rival on the right, and communism, its rival on the left, Western-style liberal democracy truly faced no challenger. Its spread around the globe seemed assured.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And for a few years, it was. The 1990s saw some of the most significant activity of democracy’s third wave, including across nearly all of Eastern Europe. Former communist states and Soviet republics — like Czechia, Hungary, and Estonia—democratized with remarkable speed. In some countries, the new democratic systems appeared to be fully stable in less than a decade.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In ideological terms, the world appeared mostly Americanized in the sense that democracy was the barely contested benchmark by which governments were measured. Culturally and locally specific antidemocratic ideologies remained influential in countries like China and Iran. But those governments did not present any kind of plausible or attractive alternative vision for most people around the world. On the whole, the language of democracy — human rights, elections, free speech, individual autonomy — became the assumed argot of global politics.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It was during this time that the phrase &#8220;end of history&#8221; entered the lexicon, thanks to a 1989 essay and subsequent book by political theorist Francis Fukuyama. Fukuyama argued that liberal democracy was the ultimate stage in the evolution of society. Fundamental forces in history, including deep human desires for recognition and equality, had buoyed it to global dominance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fukuyama did not claim that this state of affairs would necessarily last forever. Instead, he predicted, the very triumph of the system contained the seeds of a future crisis. “No regime — no ‘socioeconomic system’ — is able to satisfy all men in all places. This includes liberal democracy,” he wrote in the book. “Dissatisfaction arises precisely where democracy has triumphed most completely: it is a dissatisfaction <em>with</em> liberty and equality. Thus those who remain dissatisfied will always have the potential to restart history.”</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of this “dissatisfaction” was visible soon after the Cold War’s end.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the 1990s, the far right began making its presence felt in a handful of European elections: Austria’s Freedom Party even entered a governing coalition in 2000 after a strong showing in the 1999 election. The 2000s and early 2010s saw varying signs of antidemocratic activity in consolidated democracies, from both the religious right (Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s consolidation of power in Turkey) and the socialist left (Hugo Chavez’s attack on democracy in Venezuela).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But as the 2010s wore on, it became clear that something new was happening on the right across advanced democracies. The reactionary right had risen to power in the United States, Hungary, Israel, India, Brazil, and Poland. Extreme-right western European parties — some of which, like Germany’s AfD, had a tenuous relationship at best with democracy — enjoyed an unprecedented wave of electoral success, winning larger seat shares in Parliaments and joining governing coalitions in larger numbers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Every one of these new authoritarian movements presented itself as deeply and authentically democratic. While the parties openly attacked democracy-adjacent values — like liberalism, multiculturalism, or secularism — they all insisted that they supported the basic ideas of popular sovereignty and elections.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This strategy reflected the enduring global democratic consensus: A 2017 Pew survey of people in 38 countries found that huge majorities, a country median of 78 percent, believed that “a democratic system where representatives elected by citizens decide what becomes law” was a good way to run a country. Recognizing this reality, autocrats around the world began singing a more democratic tune.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In their 2022 book <em>Spin Dictators</em>, political scientists Sergei Guriev and Daniel Treisman quantitatively documented a transformation in global authoritarianism: a movement away from overt violent repression and toward manufacturing consent through ersatz elections and a managed press.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Guriev and Treisman noted that this trend had even touched countries like Russia and Singapore, where public support for democracy as a governing system is far weaker than it is in the United States or western Europe. This, they argued, has a lot to do with democracy’s post-20th-century ideological dominance: On an interconnected planet where large portions of the world’s governments and citizens take democratic ideals seriously, even the most hardened authoritarian can face tangible consequences for open crackdowns on rights and freedoms.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The result was that political movements everywhere, but especially ones in seemingly consolidated democracies, had powerful incentives to develop a democratic-sounding justification for their actions — to Americanize their politics. By identifying domestic “enemies” that stood in for unwanted social change, they learned to galvanize a chunk of the public against those enemies in the name of protecting the homogeneous majority — an ironically universal playbook for antidemocratic success.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While studying the rhetoric of these new authoritarian movements helps explain how they appealed to a mass audience, it doesn’t explain why people were especially attracted to their political vision today.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The theory of the reactionary spirit helps us understand this phenomenon.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As democracy’s reach expanded across the globe, so, too, did political contests over inequality. That competition, one way or another, brought tensions over status and identity to the fore of the political conversation — ideal circumstances for the reactionary spirit to threaten democracies old and new.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is the underlying structural reality that helped the authoritarian right break through in country after country. Under such conditions, all it would take to start a reactionary fire was some kind of spark: an external shock, a high-visibility left-wing push for social change, canny leadership on the reactionary side, or some combination of all three (as in the United States in the post-Obama era). The 2010s saw a series of such trigger events around the world: decades of democratic expansion and evolving reactionary responses leading to a simultaneous surge in support for reactionary factions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Europe, the 2015 refugee crisis played a central role in the story. That year, violent bloodshed in countries like Syria and Afghanistan produced the single greatest number of refugees since World War II, many of whom fled to Europe seeking a better life. The centrist European establishment, led by German chancellor Angela Merkel, chose to welcome them, creating an opportunity for far-right parties to increase their support among Europeans uncomfortable with a massive influx of people who looked different, prayed differently, and spoke different languages.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The effect was swift and striking: Data from The PopuList, which catalogs far-right electoral support in European elections since 1989, shows a spike in these factions’ support around the continent in the wake of the crisis.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Broadly speaking, the evidence suggests that European resentment toward immigration is rooted in concerns about changes to Europe’s traditional ethnic composition and hierarchy. A 2007 study that examined 20 European countries and over 38,000 individuals found that negative attitudes about multiculturalism were by far the best predictor of individual opposition to immigration. Many other factors, like a country’s unemployment level or a person’s individual income, had a negligible effect.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This underlying hostility toward cultural difference created fertile grounds for far-right parties to profit from a sudden spike in immigrant numbers, especially since many immigrants came from nonwhite Muslim countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A 2018 paper by two German political scientists, Matthias Mader and Harald Schoen, examined a survey that asked the same group of people their opinions on elections and immigration before and after the refugee crisis. They found that attitudes on immigration, on the whole, hadn’t changed much: The same people who disliked immigration before the crisis still did afterward. But their partisan allegiances had shifted dramatically; anti-immigrant voters who had supported Merkel’s CDU defected to the AfD in significant numbers.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is the reactionary spirit in action. The refugee crisis heightened the stakes for culturally conservative voters, forcing them to choose between centrist parties that were more welcoming to migrants and potentially antidemocratic extremists who opposed it. Many of them chose the latter, prioritizing preserving the traditional white-dominant society over protecting their democracy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Across Europe, far-right parties started to reap electoral dividends. In Hungary in particular, the surge in power of anti-immigrant politics allowed a government that had already moved in an authoritarian direction to push a new and potent propaganda line, harnessing the reactionary spirit to consolidate its hold on power.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similar events took place outside Europe. Post-Cold War Israel went through multidecade struggles over its ethnoreligious identity and occupation of Palestinian land, ultimately creating conditions for the reactionary spirit to spread from a small handful of extremists to a significant portion of the population. In India, the reactionary right’s rise began with a staged crisis designed to bring out the Hindu majority’s unease with India’s vision of equality.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fukuyama’s warning has proved prescient. Frustration with the dominant era of equality and liberal rights has kept history going, with the reactionary spirit threatening democracy even in its strongholds.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Horrific crimes. Murders. Gang attacks against our police. Child sex crimes. And the brutal killing of a nursing student on her college campus.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s the kind of rhetoric Republican convention-goers were exposed to in Milwaukee on Tuesday, after an ominous video — narrated with a deep voice that sounded like it came out of a 2000s action movie trailer — depicted a dystopian version of Joe Biden’s America.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The theme of the Republican National Convention’s second night was “Make America Safe Again,” and the roster of speakers repeatedly criticized Biden’s record on crime and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/361155/rnc-2024-republican-immigration-border-biden-policy-invasion-legal-gop">immigration</a>: Randy Sutton, a retired police officer, said there was a “war on cops.” Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird said that Biden treats “police like criminals, and criminals like victims.”  Texas Sen. Ted Cruz declared that “your family is less safe, your children are less safe, the country is less safe,” as a result of Biden’s presidency. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the Republican speakers’ rhetoric on crime spiraling out of control was out of touch with reality.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While there was indeed a rise in crime during the pandemic, recent data has shown that <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/24139552/crime-rates-falling-tough-laws-mass-incarceration">crime is declining nationwide</a>. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/new-fbi-stats-show-historic-declines-violent-crime-rate-murder-showing-rcna156573#">According to the FBI</a>, murder is down 26 percent and robberies have declined by 18 percent in the first three months of 2024 compared to the same time last year. That didn’t stop Republican speakers throughout the night from singling out incidents of heinous crimes and drug overdoses to conjure up an image of lawlessness and disorder. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So why are Republicans plowing ahead with their “Make America Safe Again” messaging despite data that shows America is already getting safer? The answer is simple: Most Americans believe that <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/356269/falling-crime-trends-public-perception-voter-concerns">crime is getting worse</a>, so it’s not a particularly tough message to sell.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The convention made clear that Republicans are running yet another <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/356269/falling-crime-trends-public-perception-voter-concerns">law-and-order campaign</a>, drumming up fear among voters by leaning on racist tropes and dog whistles. Their insistence that cities are crime-ridden, though, is not only a means to spark fear in voters; it’s also a window into how they will approach public safety legislation if Donald Trump wins in November. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What the Republican approach to crime looks like</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the pandemic, the conservative backlash to progressive criminal justice reforms, including lowering penalties, has grown. While some Democrats <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/24139552/crime-rates-falling-tough-laws-mass-incarceration">have joined Republicans</a> in passing tough-on-crime legislation in the past year, Republicans have been harsher and more extreme in their response to the 2020 crime spike.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Louisiana, for example, passed a <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/03/09/louisiana-georgia-kentucky-tough-on-crime">slew of punitive measures</a> that included harsher penalties for various offenses and reduced parole eligibility, and even allowed for 17-year-olds to be tried as adults instead of in the juvenile justice system.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Republican politicians have also been outspoken critics of progressive district attorneys who have taken a softer approach to enforcing petty crimes. <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce">Project 2025</a>, the Heritage Foundation’s blueprint for a second Trump administration, calls on the Department of Justice to <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/project-2025-compels-local-prosecutors-to-enforce-extreme-right-wing-laws/">compel local DAs to enforce</a> the laws that the federal government sees fit — including extreme right-wing policies — rather than leave that up to local prosecutors, as has long been customary. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A Trump win would embolden Republicans to continue undoing the criminal justice reform that, in recent decades, reduced the prison population and lowered penalties for petty crimes. The result could be a <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/24139552/crime-rates-falling-tough-laws-mass-incarceration">renewed and further entrenched</a> era of mass incarceration.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The GOP’s focus on crime might not work</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Surveys have shown that Americans always tend to think crime rates are getting worse, even when the opposite is true, but there’s a limit to how successful law-and-order campaigns can be. Recently, the Republican messaging hasn’t necessarily paid electoral dividends.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to the Vera Institute of Justice, for example, the 2022 midterms showed that Republicans’ fear-mongering rhetoric on crime <a href="https://www.vera.org/annual-report-2022/voters-reject-fearmongering-around-crime-and-public-safety-in-2022-midterms">didn’t seem to resonate with voters</a>. Republicans spent millions of dollars on campaign ads focusing on crime and public safety, but according to exit surveys commissioned by Vera Action, the lobbying group aligned with the Vera Institute of Justice, while voters were concerned about crime, they didn’t necessarily believe in more punitive policies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, there’s a reason Republicans are focusing their rhetoric on crime: Democrats have been on the defensive on the issue, despite the fact that the data is in their favor. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead of continuing to champion progressive changes to the criminal justice system, many Democrats have reversed course and pushed for harsher enforcement, fearing voter sentiment around crime. That was the case in New York, for example, where the Democratic governor <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-york-city-subway-national-guard-crime-f046ecaac79601f6113efa8a0c8f25c7">sent the National Guard</a> to patrol the subway, and in Oregon, where <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/oregon-governor-signs-a-bill-recriminalizing-drug-possession#:~:text=SALEM%2C%20Ore.,was%20hobbled%20by%20implementation%20issues.">lawmakers recriminalized drugs</a> after voters in 2020 decriminalized them. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the second night of the Republican convention was any indication, it’s that, despite falling crime rates, the GOP’s old law-and-order campaign playbook isn’t likely to go away anytime soon.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It wasn’t groundbreaking that the speakers who took to the Republican National Convention stage Tuesday spent much of the night railing against President Joe Biden’s border and immigration policies. Biden was enabling a “border bloodbath,” crowd signs read, as&nbsp;congressional leaders accused Biden of enabling a border “invasion.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nor was it new to see them use provocative, inflammatory, or extremist rhetoric to talk about immigrants and the Democratic incumbents. “Every day Americans are dying,” Texas Sen. Ted Cruz thundered, “murdered, assaulted, and raped by illegal immigrants that the Democrats have released.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What was<em> </em>clear is how the Republican Party of 2024 has fine-tuned its anti-immigration message for the American electorate of 2024: focusing on drugs, human trafficking, crime, and public disorder, and distinguishing between “illegal” immigrants who threaten the fabric of America and the right kind of migrant.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kari Lake, the election-denying GOP Senate candidate from Arizona, summed it up early in the night: The goal of the GOP must be to “stop the Bidenvasion and build the wall.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This all happened the night after Republican organizers tried to preach national unity in the aftermath of the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, and some speakers said they toned down their speeches.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the Republican Party&#8217;s position on immigration might be more unifying than it looks. The data shows that Americans are much more against all kinds of immigration and more likely to favor more stringent border controls and immigration policies than when Trump ran for office the first or second time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, the America of 2024 is more anti-immigrant than in the recent past, more skeptical of immigration, and more open to policies that would have seemed extreme if they had been enacted when Trump was in office. This is in part because there really was an influx of migrants and a spike in border-crossing after Biden took office and as the pandemic wound down.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This anti-immigrant shift has been quick but sustained. Since 2020, the share of Americans wanting the level of all immigration to decrease has shot up, from 28 percent in the middle of 2020 to 55 percent as of June 2024, according to <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/647123/sharply-americans-curb-immigration.aspx">Gallup polling data</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those analysts note that 2024 is the first time since 2005 that the majority of the American public has wanted less immigration and that this anti-immigration sentiment is at its highest point since 2001, when the country was going through another bout of anti-immigrant fervor after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those shifts are also happening across all sectors of the electorate. It’s not just white voters. <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/647123/sharply-americans-curb-immigration.aspx">Nonwhite</a> voters and especially <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/04/18/latino-immigrants-election-policy-deportation-discrimination">Latino</a> voters are <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/16/trump-latino-voter-enthusiasm-gap">more likely</a> than in the past to want less immigration, and anti-immigrant sentiment is rising across all partisan groups, including among Democrats. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During the Trump years, the overall mood of the country shifted to be more pro-immigrant as Democratic voters became much more positive about immigration. That trend has shifted, even over the past year. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The opinions don’t lack <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/647123/sharply-americans-curb-immigration.aspx">nuance</a>. Voters are much more positive on legal migration than illegal immigration. They are more supportive of building a wall along the southern border with Mexico than they were during the Trump years, but they are also still receptive to providing a pathway to citizenship for those immigrants brought illegally into the United States as children (though even support for these Dreamers has steadily dropped).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Overall, though, when thinking about the border and immigration, many Americans now seem to view the issue less as one about humanitarianism and human rights, and more through the lens of law and order, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/351535/3-theories-for-americas-anti-immigrant-shift">immigration researchers have observed</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of this was reflected in the position many Republican rising stars, candidates, and elected officials took on Tuesday night. Senate candidates, including Bernie Moreno of Ohio, Lake of Arizona, and Eric Hovde of Wisconsin, as well as former candidates Vivek Ramaswamy and Nikki Haley, all talked about the benefits of legal immigration and the American dream while playing up the threat of fentanyl trafficking and immigrant drains on the American economy. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They warned of the threat that an “invasion” at the southern border posed to the American dream. Moreno, himself a Colombian immigrant, emphasized that he and his parents immigrated to the US “legally” — then attacked Biden and Democrats for “encourag[ing] millions of illegals to invade America.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other Republican leaders, like House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Speaker Mike Johnson, played up the threat of non-citizen voting changing the fabric of the nation, “harm[ing] citizens, drain[ing] resources, and disrupt[ing] elections,” as Johnson said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The night’s closing message rounded out this critique of the status quo: “You can’t have a nation without borders.” It&#8217;s a simple pitch to those Americans who view migration as a question of order and process: upset at images of migrant caravans and river crossings, even if they don’t necessarily dislike the idea of extending the American dream.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2019, while Trump was in office, this strategic speech might not have resonated with most Americans. But in 2024, it’s ringing true to a growing share of the electorate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The recent <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360390/trump-shot-assassination-attempt-shooter-bullet-butler-pennsylvania-biden-secret-service-updates">shooting of former President Donald Trump</a> at a Pennsylvania rally has raised serious questions about the security failures that enabled the attack.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While there was significant Secret Service presence as well as local law enforcement on the scene, a gunman was able to get onto the roof of a building <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/14/politics/secret-service-faces-serious-questions-about-security-footprint-and-rooftop-access-at-trump-event/index.html">about 150 meters away from Trump</a> and fire at both him and members of the crowd. That development has prompted concerns about missteps made by the Secret Service and gaps in the coverage provided for the former president at the event.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We are speaking of a failure,” Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/15/politics/video/alejandro-mayorkas-security-failure-trump-rally-digvid">remarks about the attack.</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Scrutiny of what went wrong has spurred President Joe Biden to order an independent review of the issue. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/14/trump-rally-shooting-fbi-names-20-year-old-from-bethel-park-as-subject-involved">House Speaker Mike Johnson has called for one in the lower chamber</a> as well. “The Secret Service is working with all involved Federal, state and local agencies to understand what happened, how it happened, and how we can prevent an incident like this from ever taking place again,” <a href="https://www.secretservice.gov/newsroom/releases/2024/07/statement-us-secret-service-director-kimberly-cheatle">Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle said in a statement</a> regarding the shooting, noting that the agency would be fully cooperative with these investigations.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s still a lot we don’t know as these reviews get underway, but early reports reveal potential lapses in coordination among federal and regional law enforcement, and a limited security perimeter that could have played a role.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Why there’s scrutiny over security</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For events like this, the Secret Service typically <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/14/us/politics/secret-service-trump.html">designates a security perimeter</a>. It’s then responsible for protecting and screening the buildings and people within those confines.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The shooter scaled a building just outside that perimeter, about 148 meters away from Trump’s podium. Due to its location, the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-biden-election-2024-rnc/card/secret-service-didn-t-sweep-building-where-gunman-shot-trump-Kif4Lsd71nvhnceRf9zz">Secret Service did not sweep it</a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/14/politics/secret-service-faces-serious-questions-about-security-footprint-and-rooftop-access-at-trump-event/index.html">CNN reported</a>. Instead, local law enforcement was responsible for that area, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/secret-service-trump-rally-blame/index.html">the Secret Service has said.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That type of collaboration is standard and something the Secret Service often uses across different events due to the scope of resources required. “It is a fairly routine matter for all of our agencies to work jointly with the Secret Service,” Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Colonel George Bivens <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/secret-service-trump-rally-blame/index.html">said at a press briefing</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Local law enforcement has noted, however, that the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/secret-service-trump-rally-blame/index.html">Secret Service was “the lead” on security.</a> That’s left the two groups effectively trading blame about who was ultimately responsible and suggesting that there may have been gaps in communication.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Additionally, the building the gunman shot from, which belonged to a glass research company, had been identified as a possible threat by the Secret Service prior to the Trump rally, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-rally-shooting-secret-service-identified-rooftop-security-flaw-rcna161783">NBC News reports</a>. Given the building’s proximity to Trump, and these revelations, questions have emerged about why the Secret Service didn’t direct local <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-rally-shooting-secret-service-identified-rooftop-security-flaw-rcna161783">police to station officers on the roof</a>, due to how close the building was. The Secret Service <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd167v5lpq2o">has said there was a local law enforcement team</a> located inside the building, something experts have described as less effective for deterring a gunman than officers on the exterior.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A few people at the rally also told the press that they saw the shooter as he climbed the rooftop; they tried to tell the police. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2024/07/15/trump-rally-shooting-witness-warning/">A Washington Post analysis</a> found that officers were warned by members of the audience about a minute and a half before the shooting began. Why those warnings went unheeded will be a key question for investigators to understand.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Also notable: The shooter had been seen pacing on the outskirts of the event, and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/-police-warned-secret-service-suspicious-person-trump-rally-shooting-rcna161933">local officers had flagged him as a suspicious individual</a> to keep an eye on prior to the attack. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/14/politics/local-officer-tried-stop-gunman-trump/index.html">The Butler County Sheriff’s Office told CNN</a> that an officer approached the gunman on the roof, at which point the shooter pointed his weapon at the officer, forcing him to “take cover.” Law enforcement officers’ failure to apprehend the shooter before he fired multiple shots, hitting Trump in the ear, killing a member of the crowd and injuring two others, remains a major question.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The errors around the Trump shooting put a new spotlight on recent missteps by the Secret Service, which include an intruder inside <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/05/16/national-security-adviser-home-intrusion/">White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan’s home in 2023</a>, and another intruder <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/16/books/review/carol-leonnig-zero-fail.html">entering the White House</a> in 2014. They heighten the focus on past concerns agents have expressed about being <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/08/secret-service-overwork-morale-underfunded-report/">overworked and burnt out</a>, and they echo prior worries about how the Secret Service has been underfunded, something Congress sought to address with a big boost in appropriations this year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1jz027nrzo">The Secret Service has also rejected conspiracy theories</a> that some conservatives have floated about how the Trump campaign’s prior requests for more security have been denied, noting that his detail was bolstered earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There’s an untrue assertion that a member of the former President’s team requested additional security resources and that those were rebuffed,” Secret Service spokesman <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/14/politics/secret-service-faces-serious-questions-about-security-footprint-and-rooftop-access-at-trump-event/index.html">Anthony Guglielmi told CNN</a>. “This is absolutely false. In fact, we added protective resources &amp; technology &amp; capabilities as part of the increased campaign travel tempo.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A group of House Democrats who had supported a bill to strip Trump’s Secret Service detail if he was sentenced to prison <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/trump-assassination-attempt-bennie-thompson-secret-service-security-1924954">has faced criticism</a> as well. That measure, which has not passed the House, would have applied if <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-would-lose-perks-under-democratic-bills_n_66621c5fe4b0f9f6da8081a7">he received a sentence of at least one year in prison</a>, which has not happened and may not happen.   </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The assassination attempt also underscores the country’s massive gun <a href="https://www.vox.com/23142734/kansas-city-superbowl-mass-shooting">problem</a> and the limitations of armed security as the central mode of combating it. The US’s gun homicide rate far outpaces that of its counterparts, and is 26 times higher than other high-income countries, per <a href="https://www.everytown.org/debunking-gun-myths-at-the-dinner-table/">gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety</a>. Researchers have found that armed law enforcement has failed to prevent or stymie other shootings in part because police aren’t able to respond in time or only able to react once it’s already happening. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/06/22/us/shootings-police-response-uvalde-buffalo.html">Per a 2022 Texas State University study</a>, police subdued the shooter in less than a third of active attacks between 2000 and 2021.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The fight over whether President Joe Biden should remain Democrats’ presidential nominee has moved to a new phase, centering on whether the party should accelerate his official nomination through a virtual roll call as early as next week — or wait to do the honors in person at their August convention.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden supporters want to move forward quickly with the virtual roll call, saying the plan has been set and approved for weeks — long before the presidential debate in June — and is necessary because of Republican moves in Ohio that once threatened to keep the president off the state’s ballot.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Ohio lawmakers moved to close that loophole in late May. With Biden’s spot on the ballot now secured, Biden’s critics say, a virtual roll call process now amounts to an attempt to ram through his nomination.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Who’s right? That depends on how safe you think Biden&#8217;s Ohio ballot spot is — and whether you think the party needs more time to decide on who should challenge Donald Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ever since the jaw-dropping <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/357642/biden-trump-debate-presidential-cnn-poll-takeaways-live-coverage">presidential debate on June 27</a>, Democrats have had a heated internal fight over whether Biden should stay on the top of the ticket, given his alarming performance and seeming deteriorating health. Dozens of lawmakers and activists have called on the president to consider stepping aside ahead of the Democratic National Convention scheduled for August 19 in Chicago.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden thus far has hotly rejected any suggestion he back out, but has also been unable to quiet questions and concerns from fellow Democrats and the press.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The push to hold a virtual roll call ahead of the convention began in late May, when Ohio Senate Republicans tried to squeeze last-minute unrelated amendments to a bill ensuring Biden would appear on Ohio’s November ballot. Since then, though, Ohio lawmakers passed a “clean” bill to protect Biden’s ballot spot, rendering the need for a virtual roll call less necessary.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In light of the debate around Biden’s candidacy, some lawmakers and DNC delegates have urged the party to abandon its virtual roll call plan and wait until next month to select the presidential nominee in person.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">California Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman circulated a letter on Monday among his House Democratic colleagues calling on the party to hold off on a virtual roll call process and wait until the convention. “To try to squelch debate and jam this through is a power play of the highest order,” Huffman <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/16/us/politics/dnc-biden-nominee.html">told the New York Times</a>. The newly formed Pass the Torch group also released a statement on Monday blasting the virtual roll call as an “unjustified push” to ram through a Biden nomination.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The Democratic Party is having a conversation on the most important topic imaginable – what is the best path forward to defeat Donald Trump and win control of Congress. Stifling this debate and prematurely shutting down any possible change in the Democratic ticket through an unnecessary and unprecedented ‘virtual roll call’ in the days ahead is a terrible idea,” said Pass the Torch activist Aaron Regunberg.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The question at hand, now, is whether Democrats should trust that Ohio Republicans are truly done playing games, and whether the November ballot issue is really resolved. The new Ohio law takes effect August 31.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Biden campaign, DNC chair Jaime Harrison, and Ohio Democratic Party Chair Elizabeth Walters have all said Ohio Republicans should not be trusted, and they insist the stakes are too high to risk the GOP backtracking somehow later this summer. They say the fact that the law is not already in effect creates an opportunity for misbehavior.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Trusting the Ohio GOP to do the right thing for voters is like trusting an arsonist to put out a fire,” Walters said in a statement to Vox, pointing to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdoh/pr/former-ohio-house-speaker-sentenced-20-years-prison-leading-racketeering-conspiracy">a $60 million corruption scandal</a> involving the state’s House Republican speaker from 2023, and heavily gerrymandered maps the Ohio Supreme Court has ruled unconstitutional <a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/opinion/ohios-wobbly-and-ongoing-path-to-fair-maps/">seven times</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This election comes down to nothing less than saving our democracy from a man who has said he wants to be a dictator on ‘day one’ — so we certainly are not going to leave the fate of this election in the hands of MAGA Republicans in Ohio that have tried to keep President Biden off of the general election ballot,” Harrison of the DNC told Vox.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Republican leaders in Ohio, meanwhile, say the ballot nominating issue is now moot and blasted Democrats for trying to gin up more panic.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The issue is resolved in Ohio, and Democratic activists should stop trying to scapegoat Ohio for their party dysfunction,” said Ben Kindel, a spokesperson for Ohio’s Secretary of State Frank LaRose. Kindel shared with Vox a legal advisory LaRose sent to all Ohio County Board of Elections directors and board members on June 3 affirming that the deadline for political parties to certify their presidential and vice-presidential candidates is now September 1 — well after Democrats’ convention in Chicago.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A spokesperson for Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine also told Vox that the new Ohio law would ensure that any nominee selected at the DNC’s August convention would appear on the November ballot. “The new law is structured so that it will take effect in time for it to serve as legal instructions for the Ohio secretary of state to prepare the ballot,” the spokesperson, Dan Tierney, said. “Every single Democrat member of the General Assembly voted in favor of <a href="https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/files/special-session/hb2_04_EN.pdf">[the bill]</a>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden campaign allies reject the idea that the DNC is doing anything other than sticking to the plan party leaders decided on more than a month ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the party has failed to explain how Ohio Republicans could actually prevent a Democrat from appearing on the November ballot now that a law has been passed to ensure it. By pushing through a cautious early vote with no clear legal justification, Democrats risk fueling more distrust among voters they’ll need to win November. <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/16/biden-dnc-vote-nomination-states-2024-election">Axios reported on Tuesday</a> that a Democratic official briefed on the party’s plans said DNC leaders “rarely mention” Ohio internally as the reason to push forward with an earlier nominating date.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s disingenuous for the Biden-aligned forces to be making arguments that seem to reference the Ohio law, but whose actual purpose is pretty clearly to allow for the president’s renomination as early and with as little drama as possible,” said Daniel Schlozman, a Johns Hopkins University political scientist who<a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691248554/the-hollow-parties"> recently co-authored a book</a> on weakened political parties.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“That’s what, in other contexts, we would call misinformation,” he said. “Ever since 1968, reformers have argued that party processes should be open. For much longer than that, the convention has been the apex of party authority, with the national committee just the continuing body between conventions. The virtual roll call violates both of those core principles without a compelling justification.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>How the virtual roll call came to be</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ohio election law requires political parties to confirm their presidential candidates 90 days before the November election, but that date this year — August 7 — falls well before the DNC’s scheduled convention. This isn’t the first time Ohio lawmakers have had to pass special legislation to get around this problem; they did so also in 2020 for Donald Trump and 2012 for Barack Obama.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Alabama also has a similar 90-day-rule rule, and this past May Alabama lawmakers <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-ballot-access-alabama-ohio-2c802f24e4b88a359c84b180f0e363ec">unanimously approved a bill</a> to ensure Biden would appear on the ballot.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">LaRose flagged the nominating deadline issue in early April. And by mid-April Ohio Republicans, who control the state legislature, agreed to pass a bill ensuring Biden would appear on the ballot. On May 7, an Ohio House committee passed <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2024/05/28/dems-say-they-will-get-around-biden-ohio-ballot-issue-by-holding-virtual-roll-call-before-deadline/#:~:text=stripped%20and%20amended-,Senate%20Bill%2092,-making%20it%20a">a bipartisan bill out of committee</a> to fix the problem, extending the nomination deadline to August 23. Republican House Speaker Jason Stephens praised it at the time, noting it helps both parties.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Just four years ago, we had this issue,” Stephens <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2024/05/08/ohio-lawmakers-err-in-attempt-to-fix-biden-ballot-problem/">told Ohio Capital Journal on May 8</a>. “The party in power in the White House usually goes last for the convention, so hopefully this will take care of that issue.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The problems came after, when some Senate Republican lawmakers tried to squeeze in <a href="https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/135/sb215">controversial amendments to limit outside spending</a> to state and local ballot measures — a move many experts believe was in response to Ohio’s winning abortion rights ballot measure <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/11/8/23952090/ohio-election-results-issue-1-abortion-virginia-kentucky-roe-dobbs">last year</a>. (Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights <a href="https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/politics/ohio-politics/supporters-of-ohio-abortion-rights-amendment-far-outraising-opponents">raised three times</a> as much as anti-abortion opponents.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The proposed Senate amendments — which Democrats blasted as unrelated “poison pills” — would have prevented political spending from outside the US, required more campaign finance disclosures, and made it harder overall for groups to collect petition signatures. Even though Ohio voters <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/8/8/23817989/issue-1-ohio-special-election-2023-results-abortion-rights">overwhelmingly rejected another Republican proposal last August</a> that would have made it harder to place measures on the ballot, many GOP elected officials claimed outside spending was to blame for that result.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By May 23, the nominating deadline issue was still not resolved, and DeWine publicly urged the legislature to reach a compromise. “Ohio is running out of time to get Joe Biden, sitting president of the United States, on the ballot this fall,” DeWine <a href="https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/politics/ohio-politics/what-to-know-ahead-of-ohios-special-session-to-fix-biden-ballot-debacle">said during a press conference</a>. “Failing to do so is simply not acceptable. This is ridiculous; this is an absurd situation.” DeWine also then endorsed the idea to ban foreign spending from state ballot measure campaigns.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On May 28, amid all this chaos, the Democratic National Committee <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/28/biden-democratic-nomination-ohio/">made its decision</a> to hold a virtual roll call vote by August 7, so they could resolve Ohio’s nominating deadline problem without relying on Ohio Republicans to address it. By June 4, the DNC’s Rules and Bylaws Committee voted to move forward, and the full DNC membership finalized approval for the virtual roll call process on June 20.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The DNC has two more scheduled meetings to finalize this process —&nbsp;this coming Friday and this coming Sunday. Both meetings will be streamed on YouTube, and the virtual roll call could take place soon after that, as early as Sunday. The last possible date it could be held is August 7.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We look forward to nominating Joe Biden through a virtual roll call and celebrating with fanfare together in Chicago in August alongside the 99 percent of delegates who are supporting the Biden-Harris ticket,” DNC Chair Harrison told Vox.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to party rules, the Democratic Party <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/biden-team-suggests-can-no-alternative-dnc-rules-provide-path-rcna160092?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma&amp;taid=66856e93e82a0b0001bcaa1e&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter">could still replace Biden with someone else</a> should he choose to voluntarily step aside after the August convention, but it would be a contentious process so close to Election Day. The new nominee would be selected by the 435 members of the Democratic National Committee, rather than the nearly 4,000 pledged convention delegates.&nbsp;</p>

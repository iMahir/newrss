<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s common, whenever someone skyrockets into mainstream fame, for folks to dig deep through their internet histories. Less common is what happened to Vice President Kamala Harris’s newly announced running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz: Pretty much everything they found was extremely wholesome.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From clips of him riding roller coasters with his daughter at the Minnesota State Fair to giving tips on car maintenance, in the two weeks since his <a href="https://x.com/Tim_Walz/status/1815804696805925377">viral appearances</a> on MSNBC, Walz has not only secured the Democratic nomination for vice president, but has also taken on the role of the internet’s collective Midwestern dad, its favorite high school teacher, and the physical representation of everything the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/365416/tim-walz-kamala-harris-vp-vice-president-democrats-left">progressives have been longing for</a>: a candidate with genuinely good vibes. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A favorite from my Walz archive. <a href="https://t.co/IXOzUnRne1">pic.twitter.com/IXOzUnRne1</a></p>&mdash; Matt Wagenius (@mattwagenius) <a href="https://twitter.com/mattwagenius/status/1820507813669396846?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s been a fair amount of chatter about political “vibes” this summer, beginning with the bad ones viewers got from President Joe Biden’s debate performance in June, followed by the <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/363230/jd-vance-couch-sex-hillbilly-elegy-rumor-false">weird energy emanating</a> from former President Donald Trump’s VP pick, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, who managed to alienate a broad swath of voters when his fringe <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/363473/jd-vance-weird-voting-parents-demeny-postliberalism">social views</a> got a wider airing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then, with Biden out of the race and Harris’s campaign underway, it started to feel like the Democrats were having fun for the first time in recent memory: All over the internet, Harris was being memed into oblivion by people who, ironically or not, juxtaposed her <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/362300/kamala-harris-meme-brat-summer">“fun aunt” persona with Charli xcx’s breakout album of the summer</a>. Her campaign embraced the jokes, and overnight the right’s attacks on her — which largely centered around her laughing and dancing — seemed to backfire. Suddenly, the Republicans were the spoilsports who couldn’t take the joke, a position stereotypically held by politically correct liberals. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Harris went with Walz, it seemed as though the campaign was going full force on vibes. As with any discussion of politics and the internet, there’s the million-dollar question of whether energy online can translate into votes. Not being from a traditional battleground state, Walz <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/363899/kamala-harris-vp-pick-josh-shapiro-walz-kelly">isn’t likely to</a> deliver votes where it matters, and there’s also the fact that Walz <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/366201/tim-walz-record-governor-progressive-agenda">may not be quite as progressive as people</a> are projecting onto him, at least not by the standards of the online left. But for now, they have a new hero — and his digital history explains his appeal. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tim Walz, wholesome star of social media, explained</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the last few days, the political internet has overflowed with heartwarming clips and anecdotes about Walz. Consider, for instance, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvegSy5HfrI">cute PSA</a> he made with his daughter Hope about Minnesota’s hands-free driving law, and <a href="https://x.com/GovTimWalz/status/1698761196730540472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1698761196730540472%7Ctwgr%5E8ee3f3dd520be54118cb96a024c2ebe524afcc93%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fiframe.nbcnews.com%2F4qz4nCO%3F_showcaption%3Dtrueapp%3D1&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1698761196730540472%7Ctwgr%5E8ee3f3dd520be54118cb96a024c2ebe524afcc93%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fiframe.nbcnews.com%2F4qz4nCO%3F_showcaption%3Dtrueapp%3D1">the aforementioned one</a> from the Minnesota State Fair (the video then cuts to a jubilant Walz riding the Slingshot).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s the <a href="https://x.com/GovTimWalz/status/1717239000899985790">screenshot he posted</a> of a text conversation with his wife in which she informs him that their dog, Scout, has locked himself in their bedroom, <a href="https://x.com/KamalaHQ/status/1820895412804259886">many tweets about his cat</a>, including one in which he laments not being able to <a href="https://x.com/GovTimWalz/status/1593646029995483136">score Taylor Swift tickets</a>, and at least <a href="https://x.com/sambrodey/status/1819451430950064222">four tweets</a> in which he expresses his affection for Diet Mountain Dew. During the pandemic he also posted a series of photos installing an old-school stereo setup in Hope’s room — so that she can listen to Bob Seger on vinyl. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s not even including the images and information being shared about him: There’s a photo in which he cradles a <a href="https://x.com/AaronRegunberg/status/1820212815820677468">tiny sleeping piglet</a> and a <a href="https://x.com/ErickFernandez/status/1820693595076075719">video where</a> he’s being hugged by a bunch of children after signing a bill for free breakfast and lunch at schools. According to financial disclosures, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/08/07/tim-walz-vp-pick-investment-portfolio">Walz doesn’t own a single stock</a>, instead invested only in pensions, making him seem even more like your average Joe who doesn’t have robust retirement savings.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the last few days, those who know him personally have been sharing their stories, including how helpful he’s been with <a href="https://x.com/mattwagenius/status/1820507813669396846?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1820507813669396846%7Ctwgr%5E9d91d1da5137113c895f582d03e153cec1d3416b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Flife-style%2Ftim-walz-big-dad-energy-kamala-harris-b2592570.html&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1820507813669396846%7Ctwgr%5E9d91d1da5137113c895f582d03e153cec1d3416b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Flife-style%2Ftim-walz-big-dad-energy-kamala-harris-b2592570.html">fixing other people’s cars</a>, how much of a delight he was in a <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/08/06/2024/pragmatic-midwestern-governor-or-cornucopia-of-liberal-psychosis-the-race-to-define-tim-walz-begins">decade-long group chat called “Sports Buddies</a>,” and how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9mNPeyxQSc">inspiring he was as a teacher</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Walz_Wins/status/1821168649564266820">coach</a>. One former coworker told a story to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/power/2024/08/02/tim-walz-kamala-harris/">the Washington Post</a> in which they tried to prank him by giving Walz a fake gift certificate for a free turkey at the local grocery store, and that Walz managed to still leave with a free turkey. “That’s just Tim Walz,” she said.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">wow I can&#039;t believe we&#039;re getting a Fun Ticket. a good vibes ticket. like being at a wedding when the aunts start to dance <a href="https://t.co/Sux2S1GViR">https://t.co/Sux2S1GViR</a></p>&mdash; Kylie Brakeman (@deadeyebrakeman) <a href="https://twitter.com/deadeyebrakeman/status/1820808590547882166?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 6, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s the sort of wholesomeness that people online tend to embrace. But, as digital and political strategist Gina DiVittorio tells Vox, Walz’s good vibes only matter insofar as they’re backed up by his <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/365416/tim-walz-kamala-harris-vp-vice-president-democrats-left">record of managing to push through progressive policy</a> in Minnesota, like paid family leave, a 100 percent clean energy mandate by 2040, and labor protections. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The phenomenon of Walz as a social media youth engagement goldmine is a great example of a critical pill Democratic leadership has had a hard time swallowing, which is that sustainable youth mobilization can be aided by PR, but it starts with policy,” she explains.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because left-leaning people online equate Walz with progressive change, much of the discourse around him has been less about how he could help Harris win but the genuine emotion he rouses in them. Online, <a href="https://x.com/brainnotonyet/status/1820849073483583674">people are praising</a> how he provides an example of “positive and kind masculinity,” and how they tear up when they listen to the story about how he signed up to be his high school’s gay-straight alliance faculty adviser, knowing that having a football coach act in such a role would help shut down bullying. “It bothers me how much American politics has lowered my bar for the absolute bare minimum,” said <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dasiadoesit/video/7400188638212050222?q=walz&amp;t=1723046387293">TikToker Dasia Sade in a video</a>. “I was tearing up because I was witnessing adults speaking and exhibiting basic human empathy.”</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@dasiadoesit/video/7400188638212050222" data-video-id="7400188638212050222" data-embed-from="oembed"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@dasiadoesit" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dasiadoesit?refer=embed">@dasiadoesit</a> <p>Is Minnesota nice a real thing?

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In some instances, there’s a personal dimension to the adulation. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pamelawurstvetrini/video/7400014850178534686">One especially viral video</a> on TikTok posits that Walz “represents the father we lost to Fox News.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The cult of conservatism that has grown and grown and grown has driven a wedge between millennial woman and her father,” creator Pamela Wurst Vetrini said in the clip. “It makes me sad to see him because I think what kind of person my dad would have been if he didn’t fall victim to this nightmare.” Many others stitched the video with their own emotional experiences seeing a man who shares the appearance and folksiness of their fathers but without the politics associated with older white men.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Many of the left-leaning young people who serve as the lifeblood of the internet have rightfully become disillusioned with the Democratic Party. Ideologically speaking, Walz is only slightly more left of center than Biden,” DiVittorio adds. “But a Midwest governor who didn’t let frivolous charges of socialism stop him from enacting a couple of broadly popular policies feels like a knight in shining armor.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How much do good vibes matter?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vibes are, notoriously, transient. It’s very possible that once Walz takes the debate stage against Vance, in which he’ll have to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/07/tim-walz-views-israel-gaza/74685455007/">clarify his position on Israel’s war in Gaza</a> or echo <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/kamala-harris-talks-tough-border-security-take-donald-trump-2024-08-07/">Harris’s “tough on the border” stance</a>, the magic will fade for the large swath of the internet populated by the left. Republicans, meanwhile, are <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/366195/jd-vance-tim-vance-military-record-national-guard">stepping up misleading attacks on Walz’s military record</a>, which may eventually affect perceptions of him among the general public.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For now, however, just as they did with Kamala, the Harris campaign has fully leaned into Walz’s persona, <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/08/07/kamala-harris-introduces-coach-tim-walz-her-trusty-running-mate">introducing him</a> at their first appearance together as “Coach Walz” and posting tweets <a href="https://x.com/KamalaHQ/status/1820895412804259886">about his love of cats</a> as a veiled attack on Vance’s comment about lonely cat ladies. As a sign of how clued in he is to the chatter online, at the same appearance Walz even referenced the (untrue) but now infamous joke about <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/363230/jd-vance-couch-sex-hillbilly-elegy-rumor-false">Vance and the couch</a>. “Thank you for bringing back the joy,” <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dailymail/video/7400160277318176042?q=walz&amp;t=1723046387293">he said later,</a> to massive applause.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are solid signs that excitement within the party isn’t just limited to posting, either. Within the span of a few hours of announcing Walz as VP, the Harris campaign netted more than $20 million in donations, a number that <a href="https://qz.com/kamala-harris-minnesota-governor-tim-walz-fundraising-1851614688">doubled by the next day</a>. And when the Harris campaign released a RealTree camo Harris-Walz cap that references pop star Chappell Roan’s popular merch and Walz’s love of hunting, it <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/why-the-harris-walz-camo-hat-is-becoming-a-status-symbol-for-liberals">sold out in 30 minutes</a> with nearly a million dollars of hats sold.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Good feelings aren’t entirely reflected in polls (though <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/upshot/kamala-harris-polls-vibes.html">recent data</a> suggests Harris is polling ahead of Trump) and it’s anyone’s guess how long they’ll last. But the vibes of a candidate undoubtedly play a role in their ability to sway voters and gin up the energy required to win elections. Luckily for Walz, his vibes are about more than just being “your Midwestern dad.” Whether it’s enough for him to become your vice president remains to be seen. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Athletes at the 2024 Paris Olympics are competing against the toughest opponents in the world, the clock, the record books, and increasingly, extreme heat.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rain <a href="https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-opening-ceremony-rain-25476dbd026087d081d7483749139a7a">soaked the opening ceremony</a>, but it followed an extensive heat wave across France and much of Europe. According to the <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/deadly-mediterranean-heatwave-would-not-have-occurred-without-human-induced-climate-change/">World Weather Attribution</a> research group, such temperatures would not have been possible without human-induced climate change. The competitions <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/scorching-olympic-heat-impossible-without-climate-change-rising-temperature/">began with more heat</a> as temperatures <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/olympics/story/2024-08-01/paris-extreme-weather-record-rain-scorching-heat">reached 95 degrees</a> at outdoor venues. Athletes complained about the lack of adequate cooling in the Olympic Village where they stay and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAcPr5vQgE4">some teams</a> brought <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2024-paris-olympics-team-usa-bringing-air-conditioning/">their own air conditioning units</a>, undermining the host city’s goals to curb energy use with techniques like <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/06/24/nx-s1-5017544/paris-olympics-air-conditioning-usa">underfloor cooling</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For competitors chasing wins by seconds or <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/08/05/olympic-track-photo-finish-swimming-timekeepers/">even less</a>, the high temperatures have been a frustrating confounding variable. The host city is <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2024/02/08/france-recorded-over-5-000-deaths-due-to-summer-2023-heat_6505713_7.html">no stranger to deadly heat</a>. Fortunately none of the athletes have passed out at the Paris games so far. But as 2024 is shaping up to be the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/2024-track-become-earths-warmest-year-record-despite/story?id=112643940">hottest on record</a>, some current and former competitors are warning that the warming planet is posing more fundamental challenges to the Summer Olympics as we know them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a report published ahead of the Olympics by the nonprofit <a href="https://basis.org.uk/resource/rings-of-fire-2/">British Association for Sustainable Sport</a>, athletes and researchers laid out their concerns about how climate change is undermining performance, health, and the future feasibility of their events.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“For athletes, from smaller performance-impacting issues like sleep disruption and last-minute changes to event timings, to exacerbated health impacts and heat-related stress and injury, the consequences can be varied and wide-ranging,” Sebastian Coe, president of World Athletics, the international governing body for track and field sports, wrote in the report.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As “global temperatures continue to rise,” Coe said, “climate change should increasingly be viewed as an existential threat to sport.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The good news is that the organizers of the Paris Olympics seem to have learned important lessons in managing heat from past events. The 2020 Tokyo Olympics, held in 2021, were considered at the time to be the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/05/olympic-athletes-and-volunteers-in-tokyo-tortured-by-heat">hottest Olympics in history</a>, with temperatures averaging almost 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Many athletes saw diminished performances, and some tennis players and archers suffered <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/30/sport/tokyo-2020-heat-weather-spt-intl/index.html">heat exhaustion and heat stroke</a>. At least <a href="https://bmjopensem.bmj.com/content/9/2/e001467">110 athletes reported some kind of heat-related illness</a> at the Tokyo Olympic games.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Outside of the Olympics, there have been <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/40454071/brutal-heat-copa-america-2024-usmnt-uruguay-2026-world-cup-risk">numerous sporting tournaments</a> and <a href="https://www.wbrz.com/news/athlete-overheated-and-passed-out-at-football-practice-amid-heat-advisory/">practice sessions</a> where athletes have <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/tennis-player-arthur-cazaux-collapses-mid-match-at-miami-open-13097889">passed out</a> due to extreme heat. In <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article284385060.html">some cases</a>, these temperatures have <a href="https://www.kcur.org/podcast/up-to-date/2023-08-03/a-kansas-college-football-player-has-died-from-heat-related-injuries-it-isnt-the-first-time">led to deaths</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Extreme heat is clearly not something athletes <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/359742/extreme-heat-cultural-attitudes-endurance">can or should push through</a>, though it often can’t be easily avoided for outdoor sports. It’s forcing organizers of major events like the Olympics to take more precautions to protect athletes.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“Climate change should increasingly be viewed as an existential threat to sport.”</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As the games draw to a close and athletes set their sights on the next competitions, including the <a href="https://olympics.com/en/olympic-games/los-angeles-2028">2028 Olympics in Los Angeles</a>, organizers are grappling with the reality that some of the toughest outdoor endurance sports will require more drastic measures, ranging from scheduling events very early or late in the day to relocating certain competitions far away from the host city. For future Olympians, the ideal training windows are narrowing for much of the year, which could end up throttling the pipeline of new athletes entering the competition.&nbsp;<br>And if climate change continues unchecked, most major cities could end up <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)31335-6/abstract">too hot to host the Summer Olympics</a> before the end of the century.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Summer Olympics will have to adapt to a warmer world</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Why do we continue to have the Olympics during the summer?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One big reason is television and sponsorships. Though the games were conceived as a competition between amateurs, many Olympians now do this for a living. Their home sports leagues often have a lull in the summer, which clears schedules for athletes to participate in the games and clears the airwaves to show them. Changing the timing of the event to the spring or the fall means diluting viewers, and thus advertiser dollars, among soccer, baseball, and football.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That all creates financial pressure to keep these events during warm weather months — but it also makes the games more dangerous and expensive, increasing the costs for organizers to invest in cooling and preventing heat illnesses.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Summer Olympics are also a tradition, but as temperatures go up around the world, the future will look much less like the past. There will be fewer ideal sites for athletes to train for outdoor events. Olympic hopefuls will have to travel to better locations to practice or seek out expensive, specialized training facilities. It will further disadvantage those without means, and over the long term, make it harder for new athletes to pick up the sport, particularly from less-wealthy countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is already playing out with the <a href="https://www.vox.com/22905168/beijing-winter-olympics-2022-climate-change-snow">Winter Olympics</a> as fewer cities produce reliable snow and ice, making hosting a more expensive endeavor and making it harder for athletes to train.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With the amount of money and prestige at play, the Olympic phenomenon isn’t going anywhere. But for the competitors on the field and the young people hoping to be in their shoes one day, there will be fewer places where they can realize their dreams.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Heat is already changing the game</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are some steps that major sporting events planners are taking to cope with the heat. One is to relocate some of the major outdoor events to cooler areas. During the Tokyo Olympics, the marathon was actually held in Sapporo, Japan, more than 600 miles north of Tokyo. The cooler weather there helped, but it broke the tradition of having the marathon finish inside the Olympic stadium, and several runners still <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2024/07/29/paris-faces-35c-heatwave-are-olympic-organisers-prepared-for-high-temperatures">fainted and vomited as they crossed the finish line</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another option is to schedule competitions during cooler times of the year. There’s precedent for this. The <a href="https://olympics.com/en/olympic-games/tokyo-1964">1964 Tokyo Olympics</a> were actually held in October in part to avoid hot weather. During the 2019 World Athletics Championships in Qatar, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/28/sports/iaaf-world-championships-marathon.html">marathon started at midnight</a>. More recently, the <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/23450515/world-cup-fifa-qatar-2022-controversy-scandals-explained">2022 FIFA World Cup</a> soccer tournament, also in Qatar, ran in November and December rather than during the country’s unbearably hot summer months.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are also ways that athletes can protect themselves. “​​The best way to prepare for competition in the heat is to train in the heat,” according to a <a href="https://olympics.com/athlete365/articles/paris2024/how-to-beat-the-heat-at-paris-2024">planning document for the Paris Olympics</a>. That can take the form of acclimatization, where athletes practice in hot, natural environments, or acclimation, where competitors train in artificial warm environments or wear additional layers of clothing to get used to warmer temperatures. But it’s a slow process, requiring athletes to begin their heat exposures two weeks before competitions start.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/acclimation-techniques-for-athletes.webp?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,11.424226477697,100,77.151547044605" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="&lt;a href=&quot;https://olympics.com/athlete365/articles/paris2024/how-to-beat-the-heat-at-paris-2024&quot;&gt;Athlete365&lt;/a&gt;" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">During the event, organizers have to pay close attention to ambient weather conditions — in particular, <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/354977/heat-wave-wet-bulb-temperature-climate">wet bulb globe temperature</a>. This is a measurement that models how well the human body can cool off by sweating, and many sport regulators consider it to be a better measure of heat risk than temperature alone or the heat index.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://www.itftennis.com/en/news-and-media/articles/paris-2024-what-is-the-extreme-weather-policy/">International Tennis Federation</a>, for instance, has an extreme weather protocol for the Olympics that triggers when the wet bulb globe temperature reaches crests 30 degrees Celsius or about 86 degrees Fahrenheit. It allows for a 10-minute break between tennis sets where a player can leave the court to shower, change, eat, or drink. But if temperatures continue to rise, an advisory group will meet and determine whether to suspend play.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For athletes that do end up past their limits and suffer heat stroke, there’s a protocol to help them cool off, but timing is critical. “You have a 30-minute window to get someone’s temperature under 104 from the moment of the onset to assure survivability,” said <a href="https://kins.uconn.edu/person/douglas-casa/">Douglas Casa</a>, a professor of kinesiology at the University of Connecticut who helped draft the plan for the Tokyo Olympics to deal with <a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/55/24/1405">exertional heat stroke in athletes</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Prolonged heat exposure coupled with the intense exertion of a match or race can quickly turn dangerous. Athletes can experience <a href="https://health.mil/News/Articles/2022/06/27/Ask-the-Doc-Heat-Stroke-vs-Heat-Exhaustion">heat exhaustion</a>, causing extreme fatigue, dizziness, cramps, clammy skin, and nausea. That can then progress into <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/heatstress/heatrelillness.html">heat stroke</a>, where the core body temperature rises past 104 degrees Fahrenheit, causing organs to shut down.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To aid an athlete suffering from heat stroke, the first step is to diagnose the condition, usually with a rectal temperature measurement. The plan then is to “cool first, transport second.” The gold standard for cooling someone with heat stroke is an ice bath. Only after the body temperature starts to come down do you then take the athlete to a medical facility. “You can’t give up all those minutes waiting for an ambulance on site, and then waiting for a hospital to deliver care,” said Casa, who also leads the <a href="https://koreystringer.institute.uconn.edu/about-us/">Korey Stringer Institute</a>, named after the Minnesota Vikings player who died from exertional heat stroke in 2001.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That means the event venues need to have emergency cooling setups ready to go. But the optimal strategy remains preventing these types of complications in the first place.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Athletes need to stay cool to be competitive</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most athletes have a personal ideal temperature range where they know they will perform their best. But part of the challenge (and some say fun) of many sports is dealing with what nature throws at you.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of the most temperature-sensitive competitions are long-distance outdoor races, like marathon or cycling. “We know as it gets hotter, they get slower,” said <a href="https://geography.uga.edu/directory/people/andrew-j-grundstein">Andrew J. Grundstein</a>, a professor of geography at the University of Georgia who served on the adverse weather advisory committee for the Tokyo Olympics.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s because the impacts of heat scale with time and severity. Longer exposure to high temperatures can lead to dehydration and exhaustion. Muscles work less effectively. And as humidity rises, sweat doesn’t evaporate as readily, making it more difficult for the body to cool off.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/change-in-performance.webp?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,16.229873497599,100,67.540253004802" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Another concern is that high temperatures also lead to more <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-07-26/athletes-can-expect-high-ozone-pollen-counts-for-paris-olympics">air pollution</a>. Hot, dry weather can create the conditions for dust in the air, while high temperatures accelerate the formation of <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/23769186/bad-air-quality-index-wildfires-pollution">ozone</a>, a pollutant that can impair breathing and cause heart problems.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And at major competitions, athletes aren’t the only ones that have to bear the heat. Staffers and spectators may not be pushing themselves as hard as the people on the field, but they do face the same weather conditions. There are <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/olympic-hopefuls-fear-summer-heat-paris-rcna157028">free water refill stations</a> at the Paris Olympics for attendees, and at some events, volunteers sprayed fans with <a href="https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-paris-heat-wave-4ca791e7219d3efb5ba4e84c6d7f8999">hoses and misters</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The other vulnerable group to consider is the laborers who build stadiums and get cities ready to host major events. They’re far out of the spotlight but are working against tight deadlines, which can cause lapses in safety or push workers to stay out longer in dangerous conditions. In the months leading up to the 2022 FIFA World Cup soccer tournament in Qatar, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/football/qatar-world-cup-migrant-worker-deaths-spt-intl/index.html">hundreds of workers died</a> amid scorching weather. And after the closing ceremonies, workers will have to clean up and disassemble all the infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though the athletes at the Olympics are some of the most privileged people in the world with the best resources at their disposal, what we learn in trying to keep them safe as they pursue the limits of human performance could help protect many more people on a warming planet.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fellas, is it illegal for brands to refuse to advertise on my social media site? If you’re Elon Musk, the answer is yes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This week, Musk’s social media company X (formerly Twitter) filed an <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25033219/x-vs-advertisers.pdf">eyebrow-raising lawsuit</a> against an advertising industry group and several major brands, including Unilever (maker of Dove soap), Mars Inc. (maker of lots of candy), and CVS. It argues that the companies coordinated an advertising boycott against X that not only led to “massive economic harm,” but even violated antitrust law because they colluded to specifically target X, making it less competitive in selling digital ads.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/23423341/elon-musk-buy-twitter-deal-social-media">having to buy</a> the site for a painful $44 billion in 2022, Musk has tried to turn it into a haven of unmoderated speech. Critics have <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/elon-musk-ron-desantis-2024-twitter/674149/">argued</a> that the site, <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2023/08/elon-musk-blocks-x-twitter-explained.html">often</a> <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/twitter-is-already-a-hellscape">called a</a> <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/elon-musk-and-twitter-buy-b2214325.html">“hellsite”</a> for how toxic it could be even before the Musk era, became an unusable cesspit of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-64804007">vitriol</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/07/1235784919/twitter-x-bots-social-media-elon-musk">incoherent porn bots</a>. Advertisers fled, because businesses don’t want to risk their ads showing up next to objectionable or outright <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/musk-twitter-elon-child-abuse-material-rcna63621">illegal content</a>, like <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/twitter-ads-child-pornography-sexual-abuse-promote-b2177842.html">child sexual abuse material</a>. This is very bad for X, since, like other social media companies, it would go belly up without ad money. X contends this cessation of business is a “naked restraint of trade” because advertisers collectively forced the site to adhere to their content standards. It even had to lower its ad prices, the filing alleges.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The lawsuit places the bulk of the blame on the <a href="https://wfanet.org/leadership/garm/about-garm">Global Alliance for Responsible Media</a> (GARM), an initiative launched in 2019 to establish a standard for brand safety across ad platforms. GARM’s membership, which was listed on the site <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240806201617/https://wfanet.org/leadership/garm/members-governance">as of August 6</a>, includes consumer brands, ad agencies, and media companies where ads are served (such as Spotify and, up until recently, X), asking them to commit to a shared understanding of what counts as <a href="https://wfanet.org/knowledge/item/2022/06/17/GARM-Brand-Safety-Floor--Suitability-Framework-3">harmful or risky content</a> that shouldn’t be monetized by ads. Membership is voluntary, and GARM says that individual advertisers ultimately decide how and where they advertise. It did not reply to a request for comment. Just days after the lawsuit was filed, Stephan Loerke, CEO of the World Federation of Advertisers — the larger ad industry association that GARM is part of — told members that GARM would be shutting down, according to an email obtained by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ad-group-to-suspend-garm-initiative-following-elon-musk-lawsuit-2024-8">Business Insider</a>. The group denies any wrongdoing, but noted that it had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/technology/elon-musk-x-advertisers-boycott.html">limited financial resources</a> as a nonprofit. Loerke made clear, however, his confidence that GARM would be vindicated in court. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of this has stopped X from portraying its <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/12/12/elon-musks-x-is-seeing-ad-revenue-plunge-by-half-from-prior-years-and-is-expected-to-bring-in-just-2-5b-this-year/">plummeting ad revenue</a> as a matter of criminal injustice. X says in the lawsuit that at least 18 GARM members pulled all ads from X in late 2022, while many more reduced their spending significantly. In a <a href="https://x.com/lindayaX/status/1820838625245880634">video</a> posted on X, CEO Linda Yaccarino made a grave appeal to X users, arguing that advertisers, not X’s chaotic management, have threatened the financial future of an important platform. “That puts your global town square — the one place that you can express yourself freely and openly — at long-term risk,” she said, echoing the refrain that X is a champion of uncensored free expression despite the fact that it moderates content, even if some say its <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/02/06/inside-elon-musk-x-twitter-austin-content-moderation/">policies are unclear</a>.</p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">X’s lawsuit comes a month after a Republican-led <a href="https://dw-wp-production.imgix.net/2024/07/2024-07-10-GARMs-Harm-How-the-Worlds-Biggest-Brands-Seek-to-Control-Online-Speech.pdf">House Judiciary Committee report</a> and <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/collusion-global-alliance-responsible-media">hearing</a> on GARM made similar antitrust accusations, saying the group financially starved platforms hosting content it doesn’t approve of. It’s a continuation of a longer debate around free speech and its consequences. You have the right to speak, but do you have the right to get rich from monetizing your speech? If X goes bankrupt because it turns off too many advertisers, is anyone but X to blame?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On X, House Judiciary Committee Republicans celebrated news of GARM’s shutdown as a “<a href="https://x.com/JudiciaryGOP/status/1821587859700424933" data-type="link" data-id="https://x.com/JudiciaryGOP/status/1821587859700424933">win for the First Amendment</a>,” while Yaccarino <a href="https://x.com/lindayaX/status/1821594759187853395">called</a> the move an “important acknowledgement” showing that “no small group should be able to monopolize what gets monetized.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Loyola University antitrust law professor Spencer Weber Waller, who <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/Waller%20Testimony.pdf">testified</a> at the GARM hearing, tells Vox that he’s skeptical of the lawsuit’s merits. “Just because you’re mad about something doesn’t mean it’s illegal,” he says.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Elon’s beef with advertisers, explained</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Musk has had a volatile relationship with X advertisers for years. Here’s a quick recap: Musk took over in October 2022 and started laying off thousands of employees. Some of the heaviest cuts were made to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/04/technology/elon-musk-twitter-layoffs.html">safety team</a>, including <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-twitter-layoffs-outsourced-content-moderators/">content moderators</a>, which signaled to advertisers that brand safety wouldn’t be a priority under Musk’s reign. Twitter’s old identity verification system, which gave a blue check mark to verified public figures and official brand accounts, was removed — which predictably led to a wave of trolls <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/verified-twitter-accounts-impersonating-lebron-james-george-w-bush-aroldis-chapman/">impersonating famous people</a> and companies. (Notably, pharma giant Eli Lilly’s stock tumbled when an impersonator tweeted that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/14/twitter-fake-eli-lilly/">insulin would now be free</a>.) All of this scared advertisers, and many big brands announced they were pausing their X ads in late 2022. A <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/elon-musk/less-month-elon-musk-has-driven-away-half-twitters-top-100-advertisers">Media Matters for America report</a> found that half of Twitter’s 100 biggest advertisers had paused spending in the first month of Musk’s takeover (only some of which are GARM members). Other <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/16/tech/x-ads-pro-nazi-account-brand-safety/index.html">controversies since then</a>, including ads being placed next to pro-Nazi content, have led to more advertisers shutting their pocketbooks. Data from the media intelligence firm Guideline shows there was a 65 percent decline in national ad spending on X between spring 2023 and 2024, according to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/x-sues-ad-industry-group-some-top-advertisers?rc=eh9iin">The Information</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Musk seems to have taken this exodus as a personal affront. Last fall, at the annual business conference DealBook, he was outright hostile to the clients that make up the lifeblood of all social media companies. “If somebody is going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/29/23981928/elon-musk-ad-boycott-go-fuck-yourself-destroy-x">go fuck yourself</a>,” he said during an interview with host Andrew Ross Sorkin. He later hedged the declaration at the Cannes Lions advertising awards, saying he <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-pitches-advertisers-on-a-return-to-x-months-after-telling-some-to-f-themselves-532d2745">didn’t mean all of them</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not uncommon for brands to pause ads when they fear reputational harm. Meta was the target of a brief but much-publicized anti-hate speech campaign called #StopHateForProfit in 2020, when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/01/business/media/facebook-boycott.html">over 1,000 companies</a> temporarily pulled ads on Facebook. When the heat dies down and brands are reassured that they won’t be promoted next to a post that, say, praises Hitler, they often return. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/13/technology/x-elon-musk-linda-yaccarino.html">New York Times reported</a> in June that X was claiming over half of its errant advertisers had come back in 2024. In <a href="https://x.com/Safety/status/1807793931003768991">early July</a>, X announced it had “reinstated” its GARM membership. Now, the relationship appears to have soured again.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">When is a boycott illegal?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a consumer, if you want to <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/2023/4/12/23680135/bud-light-boycott-dylan-mulvaney-travis-tritt-trans">swear off Bud Lights</a> for the rest of your life — go wild. If it’s so successful (most consumer boycotts aren’t) that it leads to a company’s financial ruin, then too bad for them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It gets trickier when a bunch of companies boycott another company, which could be an illegal <a href="https://www.theantitrustattorney.com/antitrust-group-boycotts-competitors-conspiring/">group boycott</a>. Let’s say that you just opened a new lemon stall in town, but the neighborhood lemonade stand association tells you they made a pact not to buy your lemons unless you agree not to sell to one specific lemonade stand they hope will go out of business — you might want to complain to the Federal Trade Commission. For X to be the victim of an illegal boycott, first it has to establish there was an agreement between advertisers. X is arguing that GARM’s public statements amount to a coordinated boycott effort, mostly because of <a href="https://wfanet.org/knowledge/item/2022/10/31/GARM-calls-on-Twitter-to-uphold-existing-commitments-on-brand-safety-and-deepen-future-collaboration">an October 2022 letter</a> from GARM calling on the social media site to “uphold its previous commitments” to the alliance. It warned that it would watch the site’s content moderation efforts and that members would use GARM’s insights “as part of their own independent assessments.” X’s lawsuit claims the letter communicated “written plans for a conspiracy.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But GARM members deny that there was any agreement or conspiracy. During the House Judiciary Committee’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmUfdnECOpA">hearing</a> this summer, the president of Unilever USA testified that GARM had never required it to avoid advertising on any platform. A big hurdle of the lawsuit is that X has to prove not just that companies adopted GARM’s standards and definitions of harmful content to justify pulling ads, but that there was a binding agreement.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Antitrust law is concerned with actions that have major anticompetitive effects, often involving cartels. GARM doesn’t appear to be a cartel, a term that usually applies to competitors in a common industry making a commercially beneficial agreement with one another, like if egg producers banded together to limit the supply of eggs. The defendants will likely argue that they’re not competitors, nor is X a competitor — GARM is a vast coalition including ad groups, tech companies, car makers, consumer packaged goods brands, and more. At this point there’s no evidence that advertisers who left X were looking for a financial benefit by boycotting. Then there’s the First Amendment to consider: generally, political and social boycotts are protected even if the companies made an agreement that had an anticompetitive impact, says Waller.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Antitrust laws “generally don’t micromanage the decisions of corporations as they decide what’s best for them in the market,” Waller said during the hearing. Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) called the hearing a part of a “sham investigation,” saying that it served to “intimidate the exercise of free speech.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s unclear how far X’s lawsuit will get. Musk is certainly no stranger to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/elon-musk-revives-lawsuit-against-sam-altman-openai-nyt-reports-2024-08-05">both suing</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-07/elon-musk-s-pile-of-lawsuits-span-autopilot-toxic-speech-ai?embedded-checkout=true">being sued</a>. Sometimes the fight has <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/23585251/elon-musk-tesla-trial-verdict">unexpectedly gone his way</a>, while other times it hasn’t. Recently, a California court dismissed a lawsuit X filed last year against a <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/03/25/elon-musk-x-hate-speech-lawsuit">hate speech watchdog</a> that had documented the rise of hateful rhetoric on the site. With this latest legal volley, X is making the Hotel California argument: Advertisers can check out any time they like, but they can never leave.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Welcome to&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.vox.com/personal-finance/2019/8/20/20813748/money-debt-personal-finance"><em>Money Talks</em></a><em>, a series in which we interview people about their relationship with money, their relationship with each other, and how those relationships inform one another.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Cheryl Roorda is 51 years old; her husband, Zac Smith, is 52, and together they have two grown children. After a decades-long career as independent musicians, Cheryl and Zac opened </em><a href="https://sqzbx.com/"><em>SQZBX Brewery and Pizza Joint</em></a><em> in Hot Springs, Arkansas. The restaurant has been in business for nearly seven years.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>The following conversation has been lightly condensed and edited.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Zac:</strong> We’ve been running SQZBX for about six-and-a-half years, but we’ve been working on it for a lot longer than that. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Cheryl:</strong> Since 2007.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Zac: </strong>That’s when we purchased an extremely broken building on Ouachita Avenue in Hot Springs. It was an old piano shop, and the previous owner was getting out of the business and retiring.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Cheryl:</strong> It was<strong> </strong>full of musical instruments, so we were delighted because we were working musicians at the time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Zac:</strong> Cheryl played the accordion, and I played a tuba-like instrument called an E-flat helicon. We had a regular gig at a German restaurant. The name of our band was The Itinerant Locals, and every summer we’d throw the kids in the car and drive around America playing wherever we could set up gigs. We did specialty tours — we did a tour on Amtrak where we spent 45 days riding the trains around America and playing, we did a tour on a solar-powered boat down the Ouachita River, we joined a circus and traveled with them. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We had a lifestyle that was very much about being present with our children, playing music in ways that felt joyful to us — and we hope, to our audiences — and living in a way that was really great but was not highly remunerative.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We landed in Hot Springs National Park at a time where we could buy a house for $32,000. Even this building was only — what was it?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Cheryl:</strong> It was $65,000.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Zac: </strong>$65,000 on a main street downtown. It was broken, don’t get me wrong, but it was affordable. We were able to, with sloppy credit and fantasized business plans, get a commercial loan for this building. That was 2007.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We didn’t really have a great plan, but at some point we realized that there was no way to bootstrap our way out of all of this building’s needs. It needed a roof. It needed HVAC. It needed all-new plumbing. It needed all-new electrical. It needed all-new floors.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2012, the FCC announced that there was going to be a 2013 opening for <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/media/radio/lpfm">low-power FM licenses</a>. At this point it all clicked in my head. I had had a fantasy for years about having a radio station within a community hub. A station within a place that people met and talked—</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Cheryl: </strong>A place where they could eat.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Zac: </strong>Eat and converse and listen to music and stuff like that.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So we filed for the 2013 window with <a href="https://www.lowkeyarts.org/">Low Key Arts</a>, a local nonprofit that we were active in. We got the license, put the station on air with sweat equity, cash, and a little bit of credit cards — and from that point we were able to walk a banker into our finished, functional, very beautiful radio station, walk them into the other parts of this building that were still under construction, and describe the rest of our vision.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A brewery. A pizza joint. Restored tin ceilings, wood floors, Arkansas native pine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At that point we were able to get a traditional <a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans">SBA business loan</a> for the renovations. We built the restaurant, which was its own drama. Of course we ran out of money and had to get a patch loan.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Cheryl:</strong> We got scammed by a brewer. We bought some tanks that didn’t exist. It wasn’t anyone in our community though. It was someone online who had a hipster-trustworthy beard and ended up being a total turd.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Zac:</strong> But we got through it all, and we opened six-and-a-half years ago.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Cheryl:</strong> December 18, 2017.</p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Zac:</strong> Ten years after we purchased the building. For many of those years, we didn’t really know what we were doing. The stormwater backs up, so we fixed the stormwater drain. The roof was leaking, so we fixed the roof. Then we were, like, we have a space now, so we could record an album!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Cheryl:</strong> We could have a music studio in here! We could have artist lofts! The dreams were real.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Zac: </strong>But none of that was going to pay for HVAC. So it wasn’t until we put the whole idea together of the radio station with the pizza restaurant and the microbrewery that we were able to fix all the problems.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cheryl and I really did do the work. We took the tin ceiling panels down in the kitchen and re-hung them in the dining room. We sandblasted and painted. We laid the floors. We did the drywall. We put in the beams. We literally built it by hand.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Cheryl:</strong> In 2007, when we initially purchased the building, we put together — if I sent it to you, you would laugh so hard — the crassest business proposal about renovating the building. We were just trying to talk banker talk.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Zac:</strong> But this was before the collapse, when they were still going through cemeteries looking for bodies to loan money to. We were able to purchase our home as a tuba-accordion duo, and we were processing the loan, $32,000 on a foreclosure from Fannie Mae, and the strip-mall financier was all, “You know, this would be a lot easier if you took out a $100,000 loan,” and we were like, “What about <em>tuba-accordion duo</em> do you not understand?” We were beneficiaries of that sloppy credit environment. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cheryl and I have both worked in the service industry. We’ve also worked in bars or restaurants as musicians. For many years, I would stand up there with my tuba and a full liter of Spaten Pils — I was playing music, getting drunk, and bringing everyone along on the journey with me. We were the face of the restaurant. But we’d ask ourselves, “Who’s making money tonight?” and the answer was, “Not us.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Cheryl:</strong> Apparently it wasn’t a lot of the restaurateurs either!&nbsp; But when we started SQZBX, it took off immediately. It was like, “We’ve made a monster.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Zac:</strong> From our projections that they gave us a commercial loan on, our first-year projections, we essentially doubled it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Cheryl:</strong> The first day we were open I sold a thousand dollars of pizza. That’s when I knew it was going to work. Then that became standard, and then that wasn’t even enough. It’s still shocking to me that you can sell this much food in a day, because this isn’t even a big town.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Zac:</strong> Our place is beautiful. It’s hand-built. We’ve got all of these details that we pulled out of the music store. The back of the bar is made out of pianos. I could walk you through the building and waste hours talking about every little detail we put in. People really do sense it. It creates an environment that people feel is special.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We have a great group of locals, our regulars who keep coming back, and then tourists find us and try us when they’re in town. We get good reviews on the internet.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We also make everything. All the pizza dough is made from scratch every morning. All the beer I brew myself. All our vegetables are hand-cut every day. It’s just that. We just create a quality product in a beautiful environment, we provide great service, and because of that we have sales every day.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Cheryl:</strong> We have a staff of around 30. We’re open seven days a week, lunch and dinner.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&nbsp;At the beginning, our children helped out. They helped me program the point-of-sale system, for example. But I didn’t want to lean on them, and they both got less involved. Our son enjoyed working here, but our daughter is not going to be a restaurant person.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Zac:</strong> I’d also like to point out that they spent their youth either onstage or backstage with us, and both of them are seeking technical degrees in university.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Cheryl:</strong> I guess it’s going to skip a generation! We’ve also stopped performing. We’ve never played onstage at SQZBX.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Zac:</strong> We put in a stage, and then we performed a few shows before the business got started, but it’s way too difficult to go from being the boss to being a musical clown. We also found out that live music in the space just didn’t work at all. During the Covid shutdown, we ripped out the stage and put in booths. Butts in seats make money, and live music does not. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the radio station is still going! We’re <a href="https://kuhsradio.org/">KUHS-LP</a>. We’re programmed by volunteers, so anyone who shows up gets to play whatever they want. We try to avoid music that gets played on other radio stations around town, but otherwise, I invite people to share their musical experiences with our audience.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the things that we do is keep a very open and inclusive environment, and I think that people respond to that. We are relatively apolitical in our PR, but you walk in and you sense that this is a place that is not afraid of diversity. I believe that helps our business.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Cheryl:</strong> You have to be consistent and you have to be excellent. When we were in our business planning stages, people were like, “People don’t know the difference between good cheese and shitty cheese, why do you care?” We cared. I think, for that, we are rewarded every day.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s fair to observe that in the run-up to the Summer Olympics, Parisians were feeling a bit of, how do you say, ennui. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If they <a href="https://news.airbnb.com/bookings-in-the-paris-region-during-the-olympic-games-up-400/">hadn’t already</a> put their apartments on Airbnb in anticipation of fleeing the city, Parisians <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/style/paris-olympics-tiktok.html">took to social media</a> to complain about the Olympics and beg tourists not to come. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well guess what? They came, with an <a href="https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-paris-ticket-sales-6b877e17bc19524a0f580615cef05e63">Olympic record 9.7 million tickets</a> sold by the start of the Games.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And guess what else? The many Parisians who stayed embraced Olympic fervor, cheering on the sporting exploits of Team France, from swimmer Leon Marchand (who dominated the pool in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5680200/2024/08/04/leon-marchand-michael-phelps-olympics-swimming/">Michael Phelps-esque style</a>) to its pole vaulters (<a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/paris-2024-summer-olympics/french-pole-vaulter-breaks-silence-on-big-crossbar-fail-at-olympics/5672968/">somewhat less successful</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it wasn’t just Parisians who benefited from these Olympics, which come to a close this Sunday. It was all of us, coming to see through these fantastic Games just how exciting, awe-inspiring, and heart-breaking international sport can be when it takes place in the right city. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There was the GOAT Simone Biles and her teammate Jordan Chiles bowing to floor exercise gold-medal winner Rebeca Andrade, in the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/06/sport/us-gymnasts-sportsmanship-wins-hearts-podium-int-hnk/index.html">first all-Black winners podium</a> in gymnastics. There was American Cole Hocker channeling the spirit of Steve Prefontaine in a glorious come-from-behind win in the 1500-meter race. There was Arisa Trew, bringing home the gold in skateboarding at just 14 years old. There was Snoop Dogg here, there, and everywhere. And there were <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91167271/peacock-is-the-real-winner-at-the-paris-olympics">plenty of viewers</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Paris, with its peerless backdrops — beach volleyball beneath the Eiffel Tower! Equestrian events on the grounds of Versailles! — and undeniable savoir faire, may just have helped save the Olympics. At least for now.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/GettyImages-2165351146.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.75214828329,100,78.49570343342" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Covid Olympics</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s easy to forget amid the euphoria of the Paris Games, but it’s been a rough few years for major international sporting events.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The last Summer Olympics — the delayed 2021 Tokyo Games — were heavily disrupted by Covid. For one, they were held a year late. And among other restrictions, spectators were <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-57760883">largely banned</a>, leaving Olympians performing in empty stadiums and arenas. Those barred included athletes’ families and friends, robbing the Olympians of their support system and fans back home from the characteristic Olympic experience of <a href="https://time.com/5761306/olympics-parents-reactions/">watching parents lose their minds when their kid wins a medal</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The result, I guess, gave normie sports fans a glimpse of what a track and field meet or a ski race might be like when it’s not<em> </em>the Olympics, but the overall atmosphere suffered terribly. That was likely a major factor in a marked decline in viewership, with the Tokyo Olympics going down as the <a href="https://www.sportsmediawatch.com/2021/08/olympics-ratings-nbc-lowest-ever-viewership-summer-winter-tokyo/">least-watched Games ever</a> — at least until <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/winter-olympics-ratings-smallest-ever-1235097103/">the 2022 Winter Games</a> in Beijing. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The 2022 Winter Games in Beijing took place while China was still pursuing its draconian “zero Covid” policy, meaning the restrictions were <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/covid-rules-2022-beijing-winter-olympics/story?id=82310521">even more severe</a> than they were in Tokyo. But more representative of the growing problems with international sporting events was the fact the Winter Games were in Beijing at all.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of the six cities that initially submitted bids to host the 2022 Winter Games, <a href="https://time.com/3462070/olympics-winter-2022/">four eventually withdrew</a> their bids over cost concerns, including more obvious winter sports cities like Oslo and Stockholm. That left the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to choose between Beijing in China and Almaty in Kazakhstan — two autocratic countries with serious human rights concerns. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even though Beijing has averaged just 2.5 inches of snow a season and would need to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/05/sports/olympics/snow-winter-olympics.html">fill its venues</a> with artificial flakes at <a href="https://theconversation.com/beijing-2022-environmental-cost-of-worlds-first-winter-olympics-without-natural-snow-expert-q-a-176717">significant environmental cost</a>, the IOC went with the Chinese bid, largely because it was willing to spend big. According to an <a href="https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/beijing-2022-winter-olympics-china-cost/">investigation by Business Insider</a>, China may have spent <a href="https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/beijing-2022-winter-olympics-china-cost/">as much as $38.5 billion on the Games</a>.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/GettyImages-2165693211.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.098812771919,100,79.802374456161" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="France supporters are seen during the men’s quarterfinal handball match between Team Germany and Team France at the 2024 Olympics." data-portal-copyright="" />
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The future of international sport is autocratic</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That number isn’t an aberration. The costs of hosting the Olympics have been <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/economics-hosting-olympic-games">going through the stratosphere</a> in recent years, and the ultimate price tag is <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/381157992_The_Oxford_Olympics_Study_2024_Are_Cost_and_Cost_Overrun_at_the_Games_Coming_Down">on average almost triple</a> what the initial bid was. And it matters because if major international sporting events are going to cost this<em> </em>much, <a href="https://www.cato.org/commentary/should-only-democracies-host-international-sports-competitions">fewer democratic countries</a> that need to defend the costs to their citizens are going to be willing to host, tilting the table toward autocratic countries that worry less about public opinion. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That was the case in the 2022 World Cup, held with no little controversy in the autocratic emirate of Qatar. To accommodate the country’s brutally hot climate, the tournament (usually held in the summer) was moved to November and December, disrupting the season for international club soccer. The lead-up to the tournament was marred by <a href="https://www.wusf.org/2022-11-18/why-qatar-is-a-controversial-host-for-the-world-cup">allegations of bribery and corruption</a> by the host country, while <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-60867042">dozens of migrant construction workers</a> died in <a href="https://www.vox.com/videos/23488387/qatar-fifa-world-cup-kafala-system-migrant-forced-labor">harsh working conditions</a>. Captains of several European soccer squads were <a href="https://time.com/6235503/one-love-armband-qatar-world-cup/">set to wear rainbow armbands</a> during the tournament, protesting the fact that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/12/3/23477966/qatar-anti-lgbtq-fifa-world-cup">homosexuality is illegal in Qatar</a> — until the international soccer body FIFA threatened the national teams with sanctions. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Like the Beijing Winter Games, which featured a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-nations-holding-diplomatic-boycott-beijing-games/story?id=82461768">number of diplomatic boycotts</a> over the Chinese government’s human rights record, choosing Qatar to host the World Cup inevitably meant controversy. But the fact that Qatar was ultimately willing to spend <a href="https://dohanews.co/why-is-qatars-fifa-world-cup-the-most-expensive-in-history/">some $220 billion on it</a> — almost 15 times as much as the 2014 World Cup in Brazil cost — apparently more than outweighed those concerns. And given that the previous host in 2018 was Russia, which came with its own suite of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31644075">diplomatic and political problems</a>, international soccer had already made it clear that a little controversy wouldn’t stop it.<br><br>Oh, and while the host of the 2034 World Cup hasn’t officially been picked yet, we know it will be Saudi Arabia, with all its <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/08/global-saudi-arabia-bid-for-the-2034-fifa-world-cup-whitewashes-human-rights-record-while-joint-bid-for-2030-leaves-key-gaps/#:~:text=Saudi%20Arabia%20has%20failed%20to,in%20Morocco%2C%20Portugal%20and%20Spain.">attendant political issues</a>. That’s because the Middle Eastern kingdom — which among other plans has promised to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5672506/2024/07/31/saudi-arabia-2034-world-cup-plans/">build a 92,000-seat stadium from scratch</a> — is the only host to submit a bid. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So we should enjoy the Paris Olympics while we can, with its vibrant sporting culture, gorgeous architecture, and (mostly) absence of major political or diplomatic controversies. Given the growing dependence of international sport on deep-pocketed autocratic governments, it’s likely to be the exception in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">ST. ROSE, Louisiana — In the St. Charles Parish neighborhood, only a tall green chain-link fence stands between a block of homes and the future site of a facility that may, among other things, store carbon in efforts to limit planetary heating.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The $4.6 billion project is part of a new slate of federal efforts bolstering carbon capture and storage, or CCS, a controversial technology that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has identified as <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/12/CCS_guide.pdf">an important tool</a> in mitigating climate change. This Louisiana-based plant probably wouldn’t have been possible without the passage of the historic climate change legislation that President Joe Biden signed into law in the summer of 2022. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) dedicated <a href="https://www.iea.org/policies/16156-inflation-reduction-act-of-2022">$370 billion</a> toward addressing the climate crisis, by far the largest federal investment in the issue. The IRA further solidified Biden’s commitment for CCS: The law increased tax credits for storing carbon that range from $50 per ton of CO2 to $85 per ton — a whopping <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59832#:~:text=Chapter%C2%A02-,Federal%20Financial%20Support%20for%20Carbon%20Capture%20and%20Storage,-The%20federal%20government">70 percent</a> jump.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden’s IRA promises to be <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/9/4/20829431/climate-change-carbon-capture-utilization-sequestration-ccu-ccs">a bonanza for the CCS industry</a> — and the stakes are high. If humanity fails to rein in climate change by either swiftly transitioning away from the dirty energy sources emitting greenhouses gasses or figuring out a way to neutralize them, then many parts of the world <a href="https://www.un.org/en/un75/climate-crisis-race-we-can-win">could become inhospitable</a> by the end of this century.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But this major investment has a potential dark side.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such carbon storage projects come with local costs — the loss of valuable natural carbon sinks like wetlands, the possibility of dangerous CO2 pipeline ruptures, and an increase in other air pollutants — and it’s unclear how much such developments will even help curb the climate crisis. And compounding these costs is the reality that many CCS projects are <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d14dab43967cc000179f3d2/t/64f9df23792cce775bf32100/1694097188142/Map_Proposed+CCS+Projects+-+Two+Pager_CURRENT.pdf">planned in communities of color</a> already burdened by industrial pollution, poverty, low-quality housing, and other socioeconomic issues.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Louisiana, an industry-friendly state that produces a lot of crude oil and natural gas, there are now even more incentives for development: At the end of last year, the Biden administration <a href="https://apnews.com/article/louisiana-epa-biden-carbon-capture-fossil-fuels-39bd36693f5acfd8455e246ae81ff67a">shifted</a> the ability to approve CCS permits from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to the less-stringent state regulators. This has helped make Louisiana even more of a CCS hotspot.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That carbon-capture project — an ammonia plant proposed in the historically Black Louisiana community of St. Rose — underscores the social cost that comes with trying to phase out the extractive industries driving the climate crisis.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But to understand where and on whom the cost of carbon storage hits hardest, it’s important to grasp why such a project is being proposed here in the first place<em>.</em></p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/ALR7500.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A sign recalls the history of Elkinsville-Freetown." data-portal-copyright="" />
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Where plantations paved the way for industry</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">St. Rose lies just west of New Orleans, right along the east bank of the Mississippi River. On a quiet, single-lane road, grass covers a levee that defends the riverside communities when the water swells. When I visited this summer, barges and tankers dominated the waterway while western cattle egrets, with their salmon-kissed white feathers, swooped down onto the landscape.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Previously plantation land, St. Rose was founded in 1873 by Palmer Elkins, a free man of color who bought the town’s first three tracts of land for less than $950 (about $25,000 in today’s currency), and named the community for himself: Elkinsville-Freetown. It was one of the scores of “Freedom Towns” or “freedmen’s towns” established by or for a predominantly Black populace during and after the era of slavery in the United States.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to research gathered by Johns Hopkins University sociologist Michael Levien, Elkins was part of a <a href="https://scphistory.org/rost-home-colony/">colony of Black folks</a> recently liberated from slavery who managed their own fields under a US government agency established in 1865 called the <a href="https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/FreedmensBureau.htm">Freedmen’s Bureau</a>. Even though the government walked back on its promise and shut the colony down less than two years after its inception, Elkins eventually saved up enough money to establish Elkinsville-Freetown nearly 10 years later. He created the town’s first city streets and invited other freed people to live there, too. Today, many of St. Rose’s current residents are descendants of Elkins and 18 other founding families.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These days, the community of 7,500 is disproportionately harmed by pollution and industry — the sort of environmental racism that affects people across the US and the globe. The problem is especially ugly in Louisiana, where locals experience <a href="https://law.tulane.edu/news/tulane-study-louisianas-severe-air-pollution-linked-dozens-cancer-cases-each-year">higher rates of cancer</a> from air pollution exposure in what experts call Cancer Alley, an 85-mile sacrifice zone between Baton Rouge and New Orleans that includes St. Rose.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"><img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/ALR5795-1.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Darris Eugene at his hair salon styling Linda Williams’s new cut." data-portal-copyright="" />

<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/ALR7006.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Left to right: Kimbrelle Kyereh; her father, Alphonse Eugene Sr.; Rev. Arthur C. Blue; Graylin B. Smith; her cousin Ricardo Smith." data-portal-copyright="" /></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, many industrial plants within Cancer Alley — such as a Dow Chemical petrochemical facility and a Shell refining and chemicals plant, to name a few — stand in former plantation tracts where many residents’ ancestors used to toil in the field. In 1922, an oil export terminal replaced the nearby Cedar Grove Plantation. Now owned by North American company International Matex-Tank Terminals (IMTT), the terminal remains one of the town’s most prominent features and still exports crude oil, as well as other liquids like petrochemicals and vegetable oil. In 2022, industry polluters were responsible for releasing nearly 3 million pounds of air toxins like ammonia and the petrochemical n-Hexane within a 10-mile radius of the community, per EPA data.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Already, St. Rose residents experiences higher cancer risks and respiratory illness rates from their exposure to air pollution than the national average, according to federal data from the EPA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“As long as I could remember, I smelled the chemicals,”<strong> </strong>said Kimbrelle Eugene Kyereh, who founded her local nonprofit <a href="https://refinedcommunityempowerment.org/">Refined Community Empowerment</a> after she learned about the ammonia plant. “The tank farm on the fence-line of Elkinsville-Freetown St. Rose came [50] years after the free men and women of color settled the community. And when they came, they never left.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/ALR7171.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,32.547993019197,100,34.904013961606" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Kimbrelle Eugene Kyereh." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The community’s access to the river and the plantation land that eventually made way for the significant infrastructure of the IMTT export terminal makes it a convenient location for the ammonia carbon-capture project partially funded by the IRA’s tax credits.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The project’s developer, St. Charles Clean Fuels, hopes to produce 8,000 metric tons of ammonia a day — a staggering figure that’s far above what most plants produce — that it would then load onto shipping vessels for international export through IMTT’s existing terminal. The production of ammonia, a chemical that’s predominantly developed into fertilizers that enrich soils and help grow food and crops, is responsible for <a href="https://royalsociety.org/-/media/policy/projects/green-ammonia/green-ammonia-policy-briefing.pdf">1.8 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions</a>. There’s a need to decarbonize ammonia production — and fast: Production is projected to increase by <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/ammonia-technology-roadmap/executive-summary">nearly 40 percent by 2050</a>. The market is also expected to <a href="https://press.spglobal.com/2023-07-11-Ammonia-Market-to-Triple-by-2050-with-Nearly-All-Growth-Coming-from-Low-Carbon-Supply">triple by 2050</a> as low-carbon ammonia enters the <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/news/ammonia-fuel-offers-great-benefits-demands-careful">clean energy market as fuel</a> for ships and power generation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">St. Charles Clean Fuels plans to supply some of that low-carbon ammonia — so-called “blue ammonia” — with its proposed plant. “Blue ammonia” is an industry term, so we’ll use it sparingly throughout this article, but developers use the terminology to distinguish these projects as nearly carbon neutral because the CO2 by-product has been captured and stored. In the case of the St. Rose plant, the company claims the facility will capture and sequester over 99 percent of the carbon dioxide generated during the ammonia production process. A third party would then handle transporting the greenhouse gas in pipelines before finally storing it somewhere underground.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“In almost any conceivable scenario for a successful energy transition, chemical fuels will be needed in addition to electricity,” said Stephen Crolius, president and co-founder of <a href="https://carbonneutralconsulting.com/">Carbon Neutral Consulting</a>, which works with companies developing technologies and plants to decarbonize the economy. “Ammonia will likely be among the most prominent of these carbon-free hydrogen fuels because it lends itself to safe low-cost storage, transport, and distribution, very much along the lines of propane and liquified petroleum gas.” Crolius is also president emeritus of the Ammonia Energy Association, an industry group for which he sits on the board of directors.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/ALR7651.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Large trucks and industry infrastructure beneath a cloudy sky." title="Large trucks and industry infrastructure beneath a cloudy sky." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="An industrial vista in St. Rose. " data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The promise to capture nearly all of its emissions qualifies the development for an estimated $425 million in federal CCS subsidies. But since this is a new project, it’s not actually reducing the amount of carbon we’re already emitting into the atmosphere; it’s merely attempting to balance its own emissions. Retrofitting existing plants with this tech would actually reduce the ammonia sector’s overall carbon footprint. Creating entirely new plants with CCS added doesn’t decrease the sector’s overall emissions, at least not while the old facilities are still running. That 1 percent of CO2 not captured at the “blue” ammonia plant would still amount to an additional 154,000 tons that wouldn’t have otherwise existed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The community is wary. The facility won’t capture all the polluting byproducts of producing ammonia, either.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On a rainy evening at the end of spring, I met Eugene Kyereh, 54, who is also a descendant of the town’s founder, Elkins, at a local restaurant called Boudreaux’s River Road. She comes here often, but her brother Darris Eugene, 61, won’t step foot into Boudreaux’s, which served only white people when they were growing up. “It was off limits to us,” he told me the following morning from the hair salon he inherited from their mother.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The IMTT export terminal sits some 500 feet away from his business, next door to Eugene Kyereh’s home and just down the street from the restaurant. As we ate gumbo and fish, she recalled a troubling memory. “[The smell of the air] was so bad that one day in June,” she told me, “my son and I decided we had to evacuate.”</p>

<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"><img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/ALR6600.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="This decorated wall in St. Rose is the barrier between the proposed carbon capture site and homes." data-portal-copyright="" />

<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/ALR7678.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A plume rises from an industrial column in St. Rose." data-portal-copyright="" /></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She’s worried that industrial pollution will only get worse if developer St. Charles Clean Fuels builds its multibillion-dollar ammonia plant next door. After all, ammonia is a dangerous air pollutant.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“High levels of ammonia are deadly, and even lower levels from normal operations can cause breathing problems,” said Kimberly Terrell, director of community engagement and research scientist at the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic. She’s published several peer-reviewed studies related to Cancer Alley and the health impacts residents face from living so close to industry. In 2023, the IMTT chemical storage terminal emitted about 51 tons per year of <a href="https://edms.deq.louisiana.gov/app/doc/view?doc=14276634">VOCs, a mix of toxic chemicals</a>, adjacent to Elkinsville-St. Rose. “An ammonia plant would only worsen the pollution crisis in this community,” Terrell said.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Can the blue ammonia plant justify itself?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The ammonia plant is still a maybe — it needs a federal water permit, an air permit, and a coastal use permit from the state approved before construction can begin. So far, the developer hasn’t secured any. Agencies are likely to issue their decisions by the fall. The developer is optimistic about the plant’s future, but local experts are more skeptical because the facility would lie in a floodplain. But if the plant is approved, St. Charles Clean Fuels could break ground within six to eight months and have the ammonia plant running no later than 2028.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The development of St. Charles Clean Fuels represents a significant step toward reducing the carbon footprint of valuable and versatile liquid fuels, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from hard-to-abate energy uses,” said Chandra Stacie​​​​, director of community relations for St. Charles Clean Fuels, in an emailed statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But how would any of this work? Well, let’s start with a quick chemistry lesson: To produce ammonia, you need nitrogen and hydrogen.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since nitrogen makes up 78 percent of the air we breathe, developers can pull nitrogen directly out of the air using an air separation unit. Then, they need to combine it with hydrogen, which is trickier to procure. One source is methane, a potent greenhouse gas. In a process called autothermal reforming, reactors use oxygen and steam to separate hydrogen from both the steam and the methane with little combustion, concentrating carbon dioxide to ease its capture.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s where CCS comes in. Plants like these are designed to strip the carbon from the process gas with a bespoke adsorbent that’s perfectly shaped to capture CO2 molecules. It’s sort of like a sponge that can soak up the carbon. By altering the pressure, the gas can be released from the block and moved for transport and storage. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This creates blue ammonia, but the process isn’t perfect. Methane is still a fossil fuel. And the natural gas it’s pulled from is dirty and full of other substances, too, so the plant has to purify it during the process. In St. Rose, developer St. Charles Clean Fuels estimates the plant will still release <a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle#:~:text=typical%20passenger%20vehicle%3F-,A%20typical%20passenger%20vehicle%20emits%20about%204.6%20metric%20tons%20of,8%2C887%20grams%20of%20CO2.">the equivalent </a>of what some 780,000 cars would emit in a whole year even after capturing 99 percent of the approximately 5 million tons the facility would release otherwise.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/ALR7480.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="In St. Rose, residents can see the remains of a now-defunct Shell asphalt refinery from their yards." title="In St. Rose, residents can see the remains of a now-defunct Shell asphalt refinery from their yards." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="In St. Rose, residents can see the remains of a now-defunct Shell asphalt refinery from their yards." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Sometimes, emissions wind up higher than estimated. For instance, the Gorgon facility — a $3 billion CCS project in Australia from Chevron, ExxonMobil, and Shell that <a href="https://ieefa.org/articles/if-chevron-exxon-and-shell-cant-get-gorgons-carbon-capture-and-storage-work-who-can">began to store carbon dioxide in 2019</a>, three years after starting production — said it would store 80 percent of its carbon emissions from producing liquid natural gas. The Gorgon facility missed that target during its first five years of operation by 50 percent due to technical issues that need to be addressed, according to a 2022 report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Now, the facility is <a href="https://australiainstitute.org.au/post/new-federal-approval-for-giant-wa-gas-project-will-release-3-billion-tonnes-of-emissions/">planning to expand</a> despite lacking evidence that it’s properly capturing and storing carbon at all. Another 62 million metric tons of greenhouse gasses could be released annually as a result. Operators received <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/21/emissions-wa-gas-project-chevron-carbon-capture-system-pilbara-coast">at least $60 million</a> in support from the Australian government.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And that’s what worries many advocates. Taxpayers foot the bill for a technology that may perpetuate fossil fuel polluters — the ones that knowingly created climate change in the first place — and even build a new market for their products given the natural gas feedstock. How does that help wean the world off of fossil fuels?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It would be one thing if only existing polluters were upgrading their facilities with CCS to lower their emissions. We should see some emissions reduction then. Instead, new projects are popping up across the US, creating previously non-existent sources of emissions and pollution. There’s the blue ammonia plant in St. Rose — but it isn’t the only one.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to a <a href="https://oilandgaswatch.org/search">tracker</a> from watchdog nonprofit Environmental Integrity Project (EIP), 10 other blue ammonia plants have been proposed in Louisiana where most are expected to be completed by the end of the decade. However, CCS isn’t exclusive to ammonia; more than 40 other projects have been proposed across the state that mainly involve building hubs for storing carbon. These are the sorts of third-party partners St. Charles Clean Fuels will eventually need to move the carbon it captures from manufacturing ammonia. Across the US, over a hundred more have been announced, according to EIP.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/ALR7631.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="A large tanker can be seen in a shipping terminal in St. Rose, Louisiana." title="A large tanker can be seen in a shipping terminal in St. Rose, Louisiana." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="In Cancer Alley, local residents can’t escape the pollution, from the refineries along the Mississippi River to the ships that transport the chemicals they produce." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Our concerns with this trend are numerous,” said Courtney Bernhardt, research director at the EIP. “Not only will there be environmental and health impacts, largely in already overburdened areas, but also because government laws and regulations are barely catching up.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Two factors are driving this explosion in investment. There’s the market, which is finally hungry for low-emission energy sources. Customers now exist in European and Asian countries that are trying to replace dirty energy with cleaner alternatives. There’s also the shipping industry. Right now, nasty bunkers and tankers that transport chemicals and fuels contribute to <a href="https://www.imo.org/en/ourwork/Environment/Pages/Fourth-IMO-Greenhouse-Gas-Study-2020.aspx">about 3 percent</a> of global greenhouse gas emissions, but the UN’s International Maritime Organization wants to hit <a href="https://www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/HotTopics/Pages/Cutting-GHG-emissions.aspx">net zero by or around 2050</a>. Net zero involves eliminating emissions at the source where you can and capturing them where you can’t by sequestering carbon naturally in ecosystems or industrially through plants.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Federal subsidies and tax benefits have also bolstered the market. The Biden administration has been investing heavily in hydrogen and CCS. Over the last year alone, over $1 billion in direct funding has been announced.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Blue ammonia and CCS may offer a miniscule amount of decreased emissions. But what about the people who must live by these plants?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>“This injustice that’s never been corrected”</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the oil export terminal that eventually became IMTT came to the community in 1922, the industrial sector has expanded throughout St. Rose. Most residents can see rows of four-story-tall chemical storage tanks from their backyards. The facility is impossible to miss, and it has become intertwined with many of the lives of the people who live in St. Rose. <a href="https://www.heraldguide.com/news/2017-industry-guide-imtt-personnel-are-committed-to-active-involvement-in-the-community/">IMTT sponsors community events</a>, hosts dinners, and has contributed to local schools and charities, but those who live in St. Rose and depend on the company for support or work face an ongoing risk to their own health. The community’s proximity to polluters is a direct legacy of slavery and a symptom of the plantation-to-plant pipeline.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“That’s still a symptom of the plantation economy and also the disregard for Black health, for Black bodies,” said Joy Banner, co-founder and co-director of The Descendants Project, a nonprofit seeking intergenerational healing for Louisiana’s Black riverside communities overwhelmed by environmental harms. “Even the ways that the benefit to our community lies in the labor of it all. It doesn’t matter if the job is killing you in the long run. It doesn’t matter if we’re losing population as a result of these dirty industries.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Levien of Johns Hopkins University is currently in Louisiana to write a book on the social consequences of CCS. “Those free towns wind up becoming frontline communities,” he told me after we ran inside a New Orleans coffee shop to avoid a downpour.<strong> </strong>“It’s this injustice that’s never been corrected.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In St. Rose, locals have been complaining about odors to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) for at least 20 years. In 2023, DEQ received six formal odor complaints from residents attributed to IMTT. This year, there have been four. Recent numbers are likely underestimated, Terrell said; not everyone reports the smells to the state. IMTT has also directed residents to complain directly to the company, which won’t be reflected in the public record.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I don’t think it’s possible to live so close to a facility of the scale of IMTT, knowing how much emissions IMTT reports, and to not be impacted by that,” said Terrell when I met her in her New Orleans office.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During my visit, just about everyone had a story to tell about the ways they or their loved ones have suffered from what they believe is industry’s doing. Rosemary Green, a vivacious 69-year-old woman who wore a purple patterned scarf on her head, has woken up in the middle of the night choking from what she believes are the chemical smells. Her 68-year-old husband, Thoni Green, has lost his sense of smell altogether. They’re trying to grow roses in their yard, but many flowers die. Their home directly borders the proposed site of the ammonia plant.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Look at these leaves,” she said from her front yard, pointing to yellowing leaves. “This was a rose bush from my grandmother’s house. I flew this thing out to NOLA and kept this thing alive. When I first got it, it was beautiful, and then all of a sudden, it started dying.”&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/ALR6942.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Rosemary Green shows a dying leaf from a plant in her front yard." data-portal-copyright="" /><img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/ALR6762.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Thoni Green in his yard.

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Eugene Kyereh’s family, at least five people have been diagnosed with cancer. Two family members have passed away and two are in remission. One is actively fighting still.<strong> </strong>Four others have died from complications related to neurological diseases such as Parkinson’s, a brain disorder that scientists have <a href="https://www.barrowneuro.org/about/news-and-articles/press-releases/study-reveals-link-between-air-pollution-incidence-of-parkinsons/">begun to link</a> to exposure to particulate matter, a form of air pollution. That’s how Eugene Kyereh lost her mom 10 years ago. The activist herself has suffered two miscarriages over the years; research suggests that air pollution exposure in early pregnancy is <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/air-pollution-exposure-early-pregnancy-linked-miscarriage-nih-study-suggests">linked</a> to miscarriage. Exact causation is hard to determine, but the fear the residents harbor is real.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, the community must contend with what an ammonia plant may bring.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Terrell is alarmed over the health issues the facility may exacerbate. Exposure to ammonia has been linked to health issues ranging from coughing and nose irritation to respiratory issues and lung damage. Enough ammonia exposure can kill someone.<strong> </strong>Developers say they plan to build this plant cleaner than conventional ammonia facilities, but CCS tech can’t stop air pollution altogether.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/ALR7405.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Kimbrelle Eugene Kyereh and her father, Alphonse Eugene Sr., 89." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://edms.deq.louisiana.gov/app/doc/view?doc=14361302">According to the draft air permit</a>, St. Charles Clean Fuels anticipates the plant will release nearly 67 tons of nitrogen oxides that are hazardous to public health and 59 tons of ammonia every year.<strong> </strong>While that amount of ammonia is legal in Louisiana, it would exceed the air standards in Massachusetts, a state that has taken a harder stance against polluters to protect public health.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The health and well-being of our employees, the operations team at IMTT, and the residents of the surrounding communities are SCCF’s top priority,” said Stacie of St. Charles Clean Fuels. “Our facilities are designed with the utmost regard for safety such that none of our plant workers and no one in the community is ever exposed to concentrated ammonia.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The plant will be outfitted with emergency shutdown systems and safety valves in the case of an emergency, per Stacie.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What keeps Eugene Kyereh up at night, however, is the potential risks from leaky CCS infrastructure. Carbon dioxide isn’t just a pollutant. It’s an asphyxiant. That means people exposed to it essentially can’t breathe. To make matters worse, there are no clinics or hospitals in St. Rose.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">St. Charles Clean Fuels executives say they will develop plans to integrate monitoring systems and emergency response to prevent a crisis or keep people safe should one occur, Stacie said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2020, heavy rains — the same weather patterns common in Louisiana — caused a landslide that strained a CO2 pipeline and caused it to <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gassing-satartia-mississippi-co2-pipeline_n_60ddea9fe4b0ddef8b0ddc8f">rupture</a> near Satartia, Mississippi. After being exposed to the CO2 leaking from the pipeline, 45 people were hurt. Many victims collapsed, and emergency vehicles couldn’t get in.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A historical town facing multiple threats</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Three years ago, Hurricane Ida’s 110-mile-per-hour winds tore apart roofs and windows in St. Rose. Today, houses all over the neighborhood are still boarded up or covered in blue tarps. Roads remain bumpy with potholes. Some residents are still rebuilding.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This year, on June 1, the official start of hurricane season, Eugene Kyereh organized a health fair to inform her neighbors about the ammonia plant. Thunderstorms had been tormenting the town for days. That gray morning, rain clouds brooded over the Mississippi River, but many community members, activists —&nbsp;and even industry executives from St. Charles Clean Fuels — showed up.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/ALR6450-1.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Left to right: Scientist Wilma Subra, activist Sharon Lavigne, advocate Robert Taylor, and researcher Kimberly Terrell talk to the community about the proposed carbon capture site in St. Rose during a community health fair on June 1, 2024. | Akasha Rabut for Vox" data-portal-copyright="Akasha Rabut for Vox" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">After a prayer, some live sax, and a hefty meal of green beans and chicken, industry officials took the stage podium.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That day, Eugene Kyereh walked gracefully through the audience wearing a vibrant red blazer, her natural curls bouncing above her shoulders. She seemed to know everyone as she passed the mic from person to person, giving them space to air their grievances directly to the companies. And then she addressed them. The leak in Satartia, Mississippi was “one of the worst things that can happen,” she said to St. Charles Clean Fuels executives. “This is the thing that really alarmed me and one of the reasons why I started Refined Community Empowerment.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“How can we have a blue ammonia plant when we’re already overburdened with chemicals from IMTT?” she asked them. “How is this going to be a help to us?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hurricane season is back. It’s projected to be <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/05/23/hurricane-season-forecast-active-storms/">among the worst in decades</a> due to record-breaking ocean temperatures from climate change. The season’s first hurricane, Beryl, <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/category-5-hurricane-beryl-makes-explosive-start-2024-atlantic-season">broke records</a> as the strongest June storm ever recorded. It <a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/hurricane/2024/07/30/495226/houston-area-hurricane-beryl-death-toll-spikes-to-36-at-least-one-other-death-pending/#:~:text=The%20Hurricane%20Beryl%20death%20toll,Fort%20Bend%20County%2C%20officials%20said.">killed</a> at least 36 people in Houston alone.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">CCS may weaken the storms of future generations — maybe it’ll one day save the world if researchers can make it cost-effective and safe — but today, the technology still doesn’t work as intended. In the meantime, companies pursue incentives intended to address the climate crisis, giving them cover for sacrificing the health of Black communities in the name of global progress on CO2 emissions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sen. Joe Manchin (I-WV) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) have their fair share of disagreements about policy and politics.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But they both agree that Tim Walz is an excellent vice presidential nominee.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Gov. Walz is the real deal,” <a href="https://www.wvnews.com/news/wvnews/west-virginia-dems-manchin-praise-walz-as-vp-pick-for-harris/article_d7baa068-5410-11ef-a7ed-173b1cda827d.html">Manchin gushed</a>, saying he’d “bring balance back to the Democratic Party.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Walz is “a uniter for not just the Democratic Party but for the entire United States,” <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rep-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-said-vice-president-harris-is-picking-a-uniter-in-minnesota-gov-tim-walz/">Ocasio-Cortez claimed</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The fact that Walz appeals to two of the most ideologically disparate Democrats (or <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/sen-joe-manchin-leaves-democratic-party-registers-independent-rcna154885#:~:text=%E2%80%9CTo%20stay%20true%20to%20myself,Virginia%20radio%20host%20Hoppy%20Kercheval.">former Democrat</a>, in Manchin’s case) is encouraging to the party. But it also suggests the possibility that everyone is projecting their own agendas and expectations onto Walz — and that some people are going to be wrong.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&nbsp;And yet it also may raise questions about where he truly is, ideologically.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Is he a true-believing progressive with an everyman-coding personal style? Or is he a pragmatic politician willing to rein in the excesses of the left?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The answer is that, at different times and on different issues, he’s been both of those things — but always with an affable smile.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As governor of Minnesota, Walz enacted a sweeping progressive agenda geared toward <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/06/harris-running-mate-tim-walz-could-shape-the-child-tax-credit.html">helping</a> the <a href="https://www.eater.com/24214595/tim-walz-democratic-vp-free-school-lunch-food-policy#:~:text=He%20established%20universal%20free%20school,to%20hot%20meals%20at%20school.">disadvantaged</a> and <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/lgbtq/4808291-minnesota-governor-tim-walz-lgbtq-rights/">marginalized</a>. But he’s also been willing to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24214575/tim-walz-uber-lyft-driver-pay-veto-vp-minnesota">accommodate</a> business’s <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/08/06/harris-running-mate-tim-walz-progressive-health-policy-mayo-clinic-showdown/">concerns</a> and explore <a href="https://x.com/cafedujord/status/1820825017745383800">pro-market reforms</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Back when he was in Congress, Walz backed President Barack Obama’s biggest priorities. But he also questioned the <a href="https://www.mankatofreepress.com/news/local_news/walz-davis-oppose-bailout-plan/article_e86ae66b-d48d-525b-bdf9-86bef09b36bd.html">economic</a> and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/minn-dem-walz-declares-opposition-to-syria-strike/">foreign policy</a> establishments in ways that have aged well politically — without ever really becoming a controversial ideological firebrand or totally breaking from the mainstream.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, in some ways, Walz reminds me of Joe Biden, who himself had an <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/170562/joe-biden-ivy-league-upenn">anti-elite streak</a>, attempted to keep his coalition happy, questioned the <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/02/16/biden-afghanistan-withdrawal-war-book">foreign policy establishment’s wisdom</a>, and tried to go big with a <a href="https://www.vox.com/22577374/reconciliation-bill-biden-medicare-climate">sweeping progressive agenda</a> in office, while also at times <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/12/14/23981077/immigration-deal-biden-senate-asylum-ukraine">making concessions</a> to politics.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Walz signed a sweeping progressive agenda into law in Minnesota last year</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The case for Walz as an unusually bold progressive basically comes down to the Minnesota bills he signed into law in 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Walz’s first term as governor was legislatively uneventful because Republicans held the state Senate, but Democrats took over control of that chamber by a single seat in the 2022 midterms and held the state House as well. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Suddenly, Democrats had the power to pass their priorities into law, and oh, did they ever.

They <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2024/08/07/heres-what-tim-walz-has-done-as-governor-of-minnesota/#:~:text=of%20early%20voting.-,Taxes,-The%20Legislature%20passed">raised taxes</a> on the wealthy and corporations, as well as the sales tax. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How did all this happen? In part, Walz was fortunate that the state had a massive <a href="https://www.house.mn.gov/SessionDaily/Story/18109">budget surplus</a> (due to <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2022/12/06/5-things-to-know-about-minnesotas-historic-17-6-billion-projected-budget-surplus/">broad macroeconomic trends</a> plus a decade of divided government), which meant that more painful tax increases weren’t necessary to pay for all this new spending. But both he and Democrats in the legislature turned out to be like-minded in their desire to go big.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“You don’t win elections to bank political capital — you win elections to burn political capital and improve lives,” Walz <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/184618/secret-tim-walzs-progressive-success">said at the time</a>. This, of course, is exactly what progressives love to hear.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">As governor, Walz did occasionally oppose progressive priorities</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though Walz signed a slew of progressive bills, there are also a few examples where he resisted or rejected progressives’ demands, arguing they were going too far.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One such showdown occurred when the legislature seemed set to pass a bill championed by the state nurses union.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The bill would have given care workers a say in determining minimum nurse staffing levels in hospitals. But Mayo Clinic, the state’s largest private sector employer, furiously opposed the bill, and <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2023/05/05/mayo-clinic-threatens-to-pull-billions-in-investments-over-nurse-staffing-health-care-affordability-bills/">threatened</a> to pull out billions in state investments if it passed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Walz successfully “pressured legislators” to carve out Mayo Clinic in changes that essentially “gutted” the bill, the <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2023/05/22/nurse-staffing-bill-is-gutted-in-final-hours-of-minnesotas-legislative-session/">Minnesota Reformer’s Max Nesterak wrote</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Minnesota Nurses Association <a href="https://mnnurses.org/keeping-nurses-at-the-bedside-act-advances-to-final-legislative-vote/">said in a statement</a> then that they “denounce Governor Tim Walz for his abdication of good government and acquiescence to anti-democratic and anti-labor corporate bullies.” They added: “By allowing corporate executives to dictate our public policy behind closed doors, Governor Walz has made clear to Minnesotans that their democratic process does not work for them, but for the wealthy and powerful few.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another showdown occurred over a bill to regulate rideshare companies and create protections for drivers, which Uber and Lyft opposed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The legislature passed the bill anyway in 2023, but Walz then issued his first and so far only <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2023/05/25/walz-vetoes-bill-adding-protections-for-uber-lyft-drivers">veto</a>, saying the bill “could make Minnesota one of the most expensive states in the country for ride share.” (After a year of wrangling, Democrats made various concessions, dropping some of the provisions the companies most opposed, and Walz <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2024/05/21/heres-whats-in-the-bill-regulating-uber-and-lyft-driver-pay-and-labor-standards/">signed the revised bill</a> into law.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rideshare and nursing bill battles provide clues about Walz’s political instincts. The two major progressive policies he shied away from were the ones that could imperil jobs in the state, result in higher prices for the public, or put him at war with important business interests.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another mini-conflict with the legislature occurred when Walz initially <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2023/05/20/minnesota-to-allow-all-undocumented-residents-to-enroll-in-public-insurance/">resisted a proposal </a>to let unauthorized immigrants get state-subsidized health insurance. This spurred a state representative to <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2023/05/20/minnesota-to-allow-all-undocumented-residents-to-enroll-in-public-insurance/#:~:text=Asked%20about%20the%20governor's%20opposition,the%20opportunity%20to%20veto%20them.%E2%80%9D">tell the Minnesota Reformer</a>: “The governor needs to understand that the Legislature writes the bills. At the end of the day, we decide what goes in them, and he has the opportunity to veto them.” (Walz <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2023/06/05/minnesotacare-expands-eligibility-to-undocumented-minnesotans">signed it</a>.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, after Walz signed a law preventing law enforcement officers in schools from restraining students by holding them facedown on the floor, he <a href="https://kstp.com/kstp-news/top-news/walz-says-state-will-clarify-new-rules-for-school-resource-officers-after-receiving-concerns-from-police/">faced a backlash</a> from police, who said it risked officers’ safety. Eventually, the legislature <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/briefs/school-cops-bill-fix-heads-to-governor/">rolled back</a> the change, with his approval.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">In Congress, Walz was reasonably progressive in a Republican district&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also enlightening to look back at how Walz handled a very different political situation — his 12 years as a House of Representative member representing a Republican-leaning district. Then, he was not quite the enthusiastic “go big” progressive he became as governor. But he was a loyal Democrat on most issues rather than a true moderate maverick.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During the Obama presidency, Walz backed the president on the big votes that mattered, such as the Affordable Care Act and the cap-and-trade bill. When that latter bill became the subject of attacks, Walz said he wasn’t “<a href="https://www.startribune.com/walz-defends-cap-and-trade-vote-says-bill-was-likely-to-change/99954784">altogether comfortable</a>” with it and expected it to change in the Senate, but that he voted for it to move the process forward.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Walz’s congressional record suggests some skepticism toward the economic policy establishment — or some sensitivity toward his constituents’ suspicions of that establishment. Walz voted against <a href="https://www.startribune.com/tim-walz-why-i-voted-against-the-bailout-bill/30540069">the 2008 bank bailout</a> and even publicly opposed the <a href="https://www.austindailyherald.com/2009/06/walz-auto-bailout-failed-to-protect-the-taxpayers/">auto industry bailout </a>(arguing that it “failed to protect the taxpayers”).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2011, when 60 Minutes reported on suspicious stock trades by members of Congress, Walz <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/07/business/congress-considers-new-limits-on-insider-trading.html">became a leading champion</a> of a bill to rein in such trades: the <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/04/04/fact-sheet-stock-act-bans-members-congress-insider-trading">STOCK Act</a>, which passed the following year. (Walz reportedly <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/08/07/tim-walz-vp-pick-investment-portfolio">does not </a>own a single stock.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet Walz was never a firebrand populist in the vein of Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren. He emphasized the importance of <a href="https://www.austindailyherald.com/2011/08/minn-s-ellison-a-no-on-debt-deal-franken-yes/">deficit reduction</a>. He supported building the <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2014/11/14/three-minn-democrats-vote-to-approve-keystone-xl-pipeline">Keystone XL pipeline</a> (something many climate activists opposed).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On marriage for same-sex couples, he was strikingly progressive; he openly supported it as far back as his first congressional campaign in 2006 (<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2012/05/09/politics/obama-same-sex-marriage/index.html">six years before Obama did</a>). On guns, however, he <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2010/10/walz-confident-about-survival-043583">touted the endorsement</a> of the NRA in every cycle. (When he ran for governor in 2017 and had to win a Democratic primary, he <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/politics-policy/2017/10/tim-walz-s-record-guns-was-asset-his-run-governor-until-it-wasn-t/">changed his views on guns</a>, loudly supporting new restrictions.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Overall, on domestic policy, Walz’s record suggests that he’s a progressive who was trying to get elected in a swing district. Or, as <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kamala-harris-vp-tim-walz-philadelphia-rally/">he put it</a>, &#8220;I learned the art of compromise without compromising my values.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Walz has an antiwar streak, but he isn’t too far from the party’s foreign policy mainstream</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During his congressional career, Walz was a skeptic of US military intervention abroad — putting him clearly in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party on such topics, but not too far left of the party’s mainstream.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For instance, he first ran for Congress in 2006 on an anti-Iraq war platform. Once elected, he advocated for a speedy withdrawal from Iraq, but when the Bush Administration refused to do that, he <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna16057734">voted to keep</a> funding the war.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps his biggest test came in September 2013, when President Obama requested that Congress give him authority to intervene militarily against Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria, in retaliation for the regime’s use of chemical weapons during the country’s civil war.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Much of the American foreign policy establishment believed such an intervention was urgently necessary, to enforce a “<a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/07/obama-syria-foreign-policy-red-line-revisited-214059/">red line</a>” Obama had set the previous year. House GOP leaders <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/09/03/obama-syria-strike-chemical-weapons-congress-g-20-russia/2756991/">backed him</a>, and even House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), who had opposed the war in Iraq, <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/nancy-pelosi-syria-action-096211">urged Democrats</a> in her chamber to get on board. But much of the war-weary American public <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2013/09/03/public-opinion-runs-against-syrian-airstrikes/">opposed the idea</a>, and opposition <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2013/09/05/prospects-for-syria-resolution-dimming-in-house/">started bubbling up</a> among both parties’ congressional rank and file.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That opposition included Walz. “While I believe the use of chemical weapons is despicable and the world must take action to ensure that cruel dictators are not allowed to use such weapons without repercussions,” Walz <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/09/05/us/politics/syria-vote-tracker.html">said in a September 9 statement</a>, “at this time I cannot in good conscience support current proposals to take unilateral, military action.” At that point, Walz was one of just a few dozen House Democrats who had spoken out so publicly — the vast majority of the caucus <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/09/05/us/politics/syria-vote-tracker.html">remained uncommitted</a>. (Congress <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/congress-syria-vote-096806">never ended up holding</a> a vote on the measure.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Walz’s instincts were well in tune with public skepticism about striking Syria and tracked how both parties were shifting on military interventions abroad.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But don’t jump to the conclusion that he’s any sort of foreign policy leftist. For instance, on the Israel-Gaza war, however, Walz has sounded generally in agreement with the Biden administration’s policy.<br><br>Like Biden, he has expressed frustration with various Israeli decisions and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but he hasn’t called for a unilateral Israeli cease-fire or for the US to cut off funding for Israel.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Calling for a cease-fire “can’t just be virtue-signaling,” <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/episode/2024/03/07/gov-walz-says-minnesotas-45000-uncommitted-voters-are-civically-engaged">he said in March</a>, because in his view it must come with the return of all Hamas’s hostages and an elevation of the Palestinian Authority over Hamas.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He’s said the war in Gaza is “intolerable,” but <a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2024/08/minnesota-gov-tim-walz-veepstakes-bid-progressive-kamala-harris/">also added</a> that “what happened on October 7 was intolerable” too.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Walz’s politics have a lot of similarities to Joe Biden’s</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Overall, defining Walz in terms of the party’s ideological camps is surprisingly difficult, which makes him interestingly reminiscent of Joe Biden.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Often during his long career, Biden was a mainstream Democrat. But he’s also long harbored anti-elite inclinations, being skeptical of Wall Street and the economic policy establishment. He also rejected the foreign policy establishment’s consensus on Afghanistan, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-considered-resigning-vice-presidency-in-protest-obama-afghanistan-policy-hur-report">advocating against</a> a troop surge during the Obama administration and ordering full withdrawal once he was president himself.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And once in office with a narrow Democratic majority, like Walz, Biden wanted to <a href="https://www.vox.com/22577374/reconciliation-bill-biden-medicare-climate">go big</a> with an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/29/politics/biden-social-plan-fdr-lbj/index.html">FDR-sized agenda</a>. (Walz had no pesky Senate filibuster rule or recalcitrant Joe Manchin to spoil things.) In office, Biden has mostly tried to keep his coalition happy, but when the politics looked dire on immigration this year, he did try to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/06/04/biden-executive-order-immigration-mexico-border/73958960007/?gnt-cfr=1&amp;gca-cat=p">pivot to the center</a> with <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/353835/asylum-border-biden-policy-trump-shutdown">new asylum restrictions</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So while Walz may be a new face, his political style and instincts may represent a good deal of continuity with the current president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the last decade, it seemed possible for animal welfare advocates to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/03/business/plant-based-protein-revolution/index.html">dream</a> that the US might be on the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meat-substitutes-impossible-foods-beyond-meat-sales-skyrocket-2019-5">cusp</a> of a <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2019/9/18/the-beef-with-beef-fake-meat-market-growing-rapidly">meat-free</a> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-01-08/beyond-meat-founder-ethan-brown">revolution</a>. The plant-based meat maker Beyond Meat’s valuation <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/02/beyond-meat-ipo.html">soared</a> after it debuted on the stock market in 2019, a bet on future growth. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/the-journal/oatly-pioneered-oat-milk-now-its-struggling-to-keep-up/358babff-d335-4fb8-876f-9e65df8ac108">Oatly</a> couldn’t produce enough of its dairy-free milk to keep up with demand, and plant-based Impossible Burgers were being served at both <a href="https://observer.com/2017/02/we-tried-a-michelin-star-version-of-silicon-valleys-plant-burger-that-bleeds-like-beef/">high-end restaurants</a> and fast food chains like White Castle and Burger King.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2020, Impossible Foods founder Pat Brown even <a href="https://bigthink.com/the-present/plant-based-meat/">declared</a> that the world could replace the use of animals altogether for food by 2035.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But much of that optimism has since curdled into pessimism. <a href="https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2023-State-of-the-industry-report_Plant-based.pdf">Sales</a> in the alternative meat sector have slowed and a <a href="https://www.fooddive.com/news/slumping-demand-forces-california-plant-based-startups-close/694295/">number</a> of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-22/fake-meat-companies-are-failing-as-money-dries-up-and-demand-slows">startups</a> have perished, leading multiple news outlets to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chloesorvino/2022/06/18/lifeless-market-for-meatless-meat/">eulogize</a> the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-01-19/beyond-meat-bynd-impossible-foods-burgers-are-just-another-food-fad">nascent industry</a>. The industry’s problems can largely be chalked up to the cold hard fact that so far, it’s failed in its fundamental proposition: Consumers don’t think their products <a href="https://farmanimalwelfare.substack.com/p/what-happened-to-plant-based-meat">taste good enough</a> to forgo conventional meat. Premature <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meat-substitutes-impossible-foods-beyond-meat-sales-skyrocket-2019-5">media hype</a>, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90931204/beyond-impossible-disinformation-mystery-berman">meat industry-funded attack ads</a>, <a href="https://gfi.org/resource/analyzing-plant-based-meat-and-seafood-sales/">high price tags</a>, and a flurry of imitators flooding the market with <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23065941/vegan-vegetarian-plant-based-food-tech-bad-products">mediocre or downright bad products</a> don’t help, either.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">This story is part of <strong>How Factory Farming Ends</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Read more from this special package analyzing the long fight against factory farming <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/364288/how-factory-farming-ends-animal-rights-vegans-climate-ethics">here</a>.</strong> This series is supported by Animal Charity Evaluators, which received a grant from Builders Initiative.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The essential problem that plant-based meat was supposed to solve remains unchanged. Per capita, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/per-capita-meat-consumption-by-type-kilograms-per-year?country=~USA">US meat consumption</a> is only <a href="https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/USDA-Agricultural-Projections-to-2033.pdf">projected to increase</a> over the next decade, even as climate scientists <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/3/20/24105735/peak-meat-livestock-emissions-plant-based-climate-deadline">say</a> meat and dairy consumption in rich countries must decline rapidly to meet global climate targets.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The initial enthusiasm for plant-based meat was rooted in the idea that it was a more promising path to end the factory farming of animals than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/technology/bruce-friedrich-animal-activist.html">traditional activism</a>. Instead of changing people’s minds about what to eat, plant-based entrepreneurs and advocates sought to change meat itself. Based on the numbers, the payback on that bet is mixed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Grocery store plant-based meat sales in dollars soared from <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/4/17/23682232/impossible-beyond-plant-based-meat-sales">2017 to 2021</a>, but have since slightly declined. Even more troubling is the steep decline in the number of plant-based meat units sold at grocery stores, which fell <a href="https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2023-State-of-the-industry-report_Plant-based.pdf">26 percent</a> over the last two years (conventional meat sales dipped by just <a href="https://agfundernews.com/plant-based-by-numbers-usa-continued-declines-for-alt-meat-more-positive-news-for-alt-dairy-gfi#:~:text=For%20context%2C%20US%20retail%20sales,plant%2Dbased%20meat%20and%20seafood.">6 percent</a> over the same period). Plant-based meat <a href="https://gfi.org/resource/analyzing-plant-based-meat-and-seafood-sales/#foodservice-and-global-sales">sales</a> in restaurants and cafeterias — along with grocery stores outside the US — have remained flat or grown only slowly over the past few years.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/PQ4NZ-us-plant-based-meat-grocery-sales-spiked-then-flatlined-and-are-now-on-the-decline-nbsp-2.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,14.71659458229,100,70.56681083542" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">But progress doesn’t always move in a straight line, and this could be a mere lull — a market correction after years of unstable growth and investor hype. In an attempt to jumpstart the plant-based industry again, a number of nonprofits and companies have set their sights on state legislatures and Capitol Hill, intensifying their lobbying to advance their cause (and bottom lines).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some are focused on directing more R&amp;D funding to “alternative protein,” an umbrella term that encompasses plant-based products, like those from Oatly and Beyond Meat, along with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/24/green-technology-precision-fermentation-farming">high-tech fermentation</a> and lab-grown or <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23768224/eat-just-good-meat-upside-cell-cultivated-chicken-lab-grown">“cell-cultivated” meat</a> — real meat made by directly growing animal cells, without the slaughter of a cow, chicken, pig or fish. Just as the federal government’s early R&amp;D funding for <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/11/20/18104206/solar-panels-cost-cheap-mit-clean-energy-policy">solar</a> and <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/wind/history-of-wind-power.php">wind power</a> helped deliver cheap, abundant renewable energy, alternative protein advocates say R&amp;D funding could enable the sector to lower the prices and improve the taste and texture of its products.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some plant-based advocates are pushing in a more low-tech direction, working with schools and other federally-funded institutions to serve more beans, lentils, whole grains, and vegetables.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://gfi.org/team/jessica-almy-j-d/">Jessica Almy</a>, head of government relations for the Good Food Institute, an organization that advocates for alternative protein, said her organization seeks to create a “level playing field” between the conventional meat industry and the animal-free upstarts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The big idea here is that alternative proteins would compete in the free market,” she said, “and that consumers ultimately would decide the winners and the losers.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Currently, the meat market is not so free. The meat and dairy industries, which are <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22379909/big-meat-companies-spend-millions-lobbying-climate">powerful forces</a> in Washington, have long benefited from a sprawling web of subsidies, R&amp;D programs, and government grants, receiving about <a href="https://www.cell.com/one-earth/pdf/S2590-3322(23)00347-0.pdf">800 times</a> more public funding than the alternative protein sector from 2014 to 2020 despite the far greater costs they exert on <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22905381/meat-dairy-eggs-climate-change-emissions-rewilding">the environment</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Our national policies continue to favor and fund high-emissions industries who promote unsustainable food systems and diets,” as Pearson Croney-Clark, public affairs manager for Oatly, put it in an email to Vox.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Consumers’ choices are determined by a number of factors beyond taste and price, like our <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ade6561">upbringing</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZIjv-7fbiwRoU9O5jmJ0xAUK2KqLqZSA6UzNteECbqY/edit#:~:text=Social%20norms%20may%20affect%20food,sensory%2Fhedonic%20evaluation%20of%20foods.">social norms</a>. The very idea of meat’s necessity at every meal is stubbornly engrained in America’s DNA, too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">US factory farming has <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census">scaled</a> to fulfill that belief, though the treatment of animals represents nothing short of a moral atrocity future generations will look back on in horror. We’ve long had a bounty of plant-based foods ready to replace much of it — think beans, lentils, whole grains, vegetables, and tofu — that might find more purchase among the American public if served up in more creative ways. Better tasting and more affordable plant-based meat products would help, too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To give the plant-based food movement a fighting chance to bring our food system in line with planetary boundaries, we have to shift a policy landscape that for too long has benefitted the foods that do the most harm to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22905381/meat-dairy-eggs-climate-change-emissions-rewilding">the environment</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/9/12/23339898/global-meat-production-forecast-factory-farming-animal-welfare-human-progress">animals</a>, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/31/23852325/farming-myths-agricultural-exceptionalism-pollution-labor-animal-welfare-laws">public health</a>. The movement’s fledgling influence campaign has already shown that progress is possible, and its broader agenda — a number of incremental but promising reforms — holds potential to actually move the needle on American meat consumption.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Getting the next generation of meat alternatives from lab to table</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The cost of various clean energy technologies, such as <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/11/20/18104206/solar-panels-cost-cheap-mit-clean-energy-policy">solar panels</a> and <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/wind/history-of-wind-power.php">wind turbines</a>, have plummeted in recent decades. We can thank the federal government, which funded early stage R&amp;D, for much of that progress.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s just as true for America’s highly industrialized meat and dairy industry, which has benefited from <a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/oc/timeline/comp/">over a century</a> of <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/357195/land-grant-universities-greenwashing-climate-methane-factory-farming">government support</a> to build factory farming.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Alternative protein advocates say investing more of America’s agricultural R&amp;D budget in their sector could be crucial to improving products, and thereby increase their commercial viability.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Early stage R&amp;D is more of a focus for this sector in particular because the products are so early in their development, and we think they can be so much better than they are,” Almy said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Advocates like Almy are starting to get what they want. In 2022, Congress approved around <a href="https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/117th-congress/house-report/82/1?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22protein%22%2C%22%5C%22Appropriations%5C%22%22%2C%22protein%22%5D%7D&amp;s=7&amp;r=1">$5 million annually</a> for the USDA to conduct in-house alternative protein research, and it’s already been dispersed to agency labs around the country. Projects include investigating how different strains of lentils and chickpeas affect flavor, the<a href="https://www.ifst.org/lovefoodlovescience/resources/functional-properties-food"> functional properties</a> of soybeans, and food safety measures. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s still a paltry 0.1 percent of the USDA’s <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2022/june/investment-in-u-s-public-agricultural-research-and-development-has-fallen-by-a-third-over-past-two-decades-lags-major-trade-competitors/#:~:text=In%202019%20(the%20last%20year,(in%20constant%202019%20dollars).">$5 billion annual R&amp;D budget</a>. But it was a start.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The USDA also recently funded university research into breeding a higher protein strain of <a href="https://cris.nifa.usda.gov/cgi-bin/starfinder/0?path=fastlink1.txt&amp;id=anon&amp;pass=&amp;search=R=100615&amp;format=WEBFMT6NT">fava beans</a> and developing <a href="https://cris.nifa.usda.gov/cgi-bin/starfinder/0?path=fastlink1.txt&amp;id=anon&amp;pass=&amp;search=R=98884&amp;format=WEBLINK">plant-based seafood</a>, and the US Department of Defense has <a href="https://bioengineering.illinois.edu/news/cornucopia-project">taken</a> some <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/61d9c20c46d51b49b50f6229/t/665dfd4a27584a0fe2509d7d/1717435724676/SLAM+Project+Call.pdf">interest</a> in the sector, too. There’s also been movement at the state level: In 2022, <a href="https://gfi.org/blog/gfi-commends-californias-landmark-5-million-investment-in-the-future-of-protein/">California</a> invested $5 million into alternative protein research at public universities, while <a href="https://gov.illinois.gov/news/press-release.30189.html">Illinois</a> has helped launch a biotechnology hub that will in part work on alternative protein projects.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">R&amp;D is even more crucial to cell-cultivated meat, which promises to provide precisely the same animal-based product consumers eat today — provided the cost can come down from the rafters. While the US government has approved two cell-cultivated meat companies to sell their products, they aren’t yet for sale. Startups still need to overcome a range of technical and economic challenges to scale up and compete with conventionally grown meat on cost, and <a href="https://thecounter.org/lab-grown-cultivated-meat-cost-at-scale/">some scientists</a> believe they never will. Those challenges <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23378912/meat-animals-beef-cultivated-in-vitro-food-plant-based-animal-welfare-impossible-burger">include</a> making animal cells grow faster, preventing bacterial contamination, and building an affordable supply chain of feed for the cells. A <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/bay-area-lab-meat-company-shuts-down-19511362.php#">couple</a> cell-cultivated <a href="https://agfundernews.com/cultivated-meat-startup-new-age-eats-makes-painful-decision-to-shut-down">startups</a> have gone under and several have laid off employees.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Venture capitalists have poured around <a href="https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2022-Cultivated-Meat-State-of-the-Industry-Report-2-1.pdf">$3 billion</a> across more than 150 startups globally, which sounds like a lot, but it’s a pittance compared to how much has been invested into <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/investment-in-clean-energy-this-year-is-set-to-be-twice-the-amount-going-to-fossil-fuels">other sustainable technologies</a>. Considering the enormous difficulty in shifting consumers’ diets to be more climate friendly, cell-cultivated meat proponents say it’s more than worthy of government R&amp;D funding. That has finally begun to trickle in.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A few years ago, scientists at <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/food/news/uc-davis-establishes-research-training-cultivated-meat">the University of California-Davis</a> and <a href="https://now.tufts.edu/2021/10/15/tufts-receives-10-million-grant-help-develop-cultivated-meat">Tufts University</a> received millions of dollars from government agencies to study cell-cultivated meat. <a href="https://upsidefoods.com/bio/sean-edgett">Sean Edgett</a>, chief legal officer of Upside Foods — a large cell-cultivated meat startup — described these programs as doing important “table stakes” work, basic research that can help new companies get off the ground more easily and build a talent pipeline for companies like Upside.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The alternative protein industry is working to expand the pot of federal and state research dollars through the <a href="https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Farm-Bill_AFRI_fact-sheet.pdf">next Farm Bill</a> and other pieces of legislation. Rep. Julia Brownley (D-CA) introduced the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/5097?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22julia+brownley%22%7D&amp;s=5&amp;r=3">PROTEIN Act</a> last year, which would establish alternative protein research centers in at least three universities and a dedicated research program under the USDA. Meanwhile, Rep. Jim McGovern (D-MA) has introduced the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/5023/text">PLANT Act</a> to provide support for farmers who grow common ingredients in plant-based products and set up a program to help companies better market their products, similar to an existing USDA <a href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/services/grants/dbi">program</a> for conventional dairy businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Making school food climate-friendly</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=107561#:~:text=The%20USDA's%20National%20School%20Lunch,can%20get%20an%20NSLP%20lunch.">5 billion meals</a> served at school cafeterias each year through the National School Lunch Program, the lunch line has long been considered an opportunity to build a more healthy and sustainable food system.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But even in crunchy California, for example, meat and dairy dominates school food, with only <a href="https://civileats.com/2023/09/19/california-leads-the-way-in-low-carbon-school-meals/">8 percent</a> of entrees entirely plant-based. Evening out that ratio could help improve student health, as a more “flexitarian” diet — one lower in animal-based foods and higher in plant-based foods — can improve <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5216044/">metabolic health</a> and <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31788-4/abstract">reduce risk</a> of Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US federal dietary guidelines <a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf">report</a> that children and teenagers tend to under-consume plant-based foods. Changing that, at least in the school cafeteria, would also increase kids’ intake of fiber, a critical nutrient that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/3/20/18214505/fiber-diet-weight-loss">95 percent</a> of Americans don’t get enough of and is found only in plant foods.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To that end, a <a href="https://www.forkidsandtheplanet.com/">coalition</a> of environmental, public health, and animal welfare organizations recently secured a substantive win in the USDA’s <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/cn/school-nutrition-standards-updates">recent updates</a> to school nutrition standards. Those updates include giving schools more flexibility to serve beans, lentils, and tofu, allowing nuts and seeds to be served as a meat alternative, and allowing the option to serve hummus and other bean dips as a snack.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“That increased flexibility is a real opportunity,” said <a href="https://www.balanced.org/about">Audrey Lawson-Sanchez</a>, executive director of Balanced, a plant-based nutrition group in the coalition. “Now it really is going to be about making sure that [school] food service teams… actually have the skills and the resources” to act on the flexibility.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The demand is there, Lawson-Sanchez said, pointing to an <a href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/102/HB/PDF/10200HB4089lv.pdf">Illinois law</a> that went into effect last August which requires schools to serve plant-based meals to kids who request them. So far, she said, students at around 15 percent of the state’s 852 school districts have asked for them. Lawson-Sanchez’s group set up a pilot program at eight schools to help them meet those requests, and one was so successful that it now has one fully plant-based day per week and one 50 percent plant-based day per week.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/SLCUSD_-Showing-Burger.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,13.880890052356,100,72.238219895288" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A school lunch employee in the San Luis Obispo, California, area shows off a lentil burger. | San Luis Coastal Unified School District" data-portal-copyright="San Luis Coastal Unified School District" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">But schools need money to implement new programs, and plant-based advocates have drawn inspiration from the USDA’s <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/f2s/farm-school-grant-program">Farm to School grant program</a>, which helps schools set up gardens and bring local food into K-12 cafeterias by working with farmers. A specifically plant-based version could be used to train school chefs, develop new recipes, and market new dishes to students; last year, Rep. Nydia M. Velázquez (D-NY) and Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) <a href="https://velazquez.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/velazquez-bowman-introduce-legislation-provide-plant-based-entrees">introduced</a> a bill to fund such a program.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Advocates and policymakers also see breaking <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/352359/milk-dairy-schools">Big Dairy’s iron grip</a> on school food and making it easier to get dairy-free milk as a ripe opportunity for change. Currently, schools <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/352359/milk-dairy-schools">must at least offer cow’s milk</a> at every meal and few carry plant-based options. <a href="https://www.usda.gov/foodlossandwaste/schools#:~:text=Offer%2Dversus%2Dserve%20(OVS,schools%20used%20OVS%20at%20lunch).">One out of five</a> elementary and middle schools participating in the National School Lunch Program go so far as to require all students to take cow’s milk, even though kids throw away <a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/tag/food-loss-and-waste">nearly half</a> of it, and many students — especially those of color — are <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/lactose-intolerance#:~:text=Lactose%20intolerance%20is%20most%20common,be%20managed%20through%20diet%20changes.">lactose intolerant</a>. If a kid wants a dairy-free option, like soy milk, they have to provide a note from a doctor or parent, depending on their reason.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rep. Robert Scott (D-VA), ranking chair of the US House Committee on Education and the Workforce, which oversees school nutrition policy, wants to change that. A Democratic aide on that committee told Vox that Rep. Scott’s <a href="https://www.congress.gov/member/robert-scott/S000185">child nutrition reauthorization bill</a> would loosen restrictions preventing students from getting plant milk alternatives, and set up a $2 million fund for schools to cover some of the cost of plant-based milk purchases.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Advocates in the school food coalition also want to see the USDA encourage more plant-based options, allow high-protein grains like quinoa to count as a meat alternative, adopt minimum fiber standards, and make cow’s milk optional at all schools.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyond school lunches, the federal government directly buys billions of dollars of food each year for food banks, federal building cafeterias, and more. By one <a href="https://www.fedgoodfoodpurchasing.org/resources/impact-analysis-full-report">estimate</a>, nearly 90 percent of the protein-rich foods it purchases are animal products. In recent years, there’s been an internal push at the Department of Defense — which makes up about half of federal food purchases — to shift some of its food to plant-based. Some military bases are <a href="https://www.stripes.com/theaters/us/fort-sill-s-dining-facility-is-the-first-to-offer-troops-a-100-percent-plant-based-entre-e-at-every-meal-1.568203">serving more plant-based meals</a>, and recent DoD nutrition standards now <a href="https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodm/133810m.pdf">require legumes</a> to be served every day at military base cafeterias.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In April, for the first time in a decade, the USDA <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/food-packages/qas">updated</a> its standards for the Women, Infant, and Children’s program — another major government food purchaser. The updates include a reduction in the amount of cow’s milk participants can purchase and more flexibility to buy plant-based dairy products and fruits and vegetables. Oatly saw it as a win, while a major dairy industry group said it was “<a href="https://www.nmpf.org/nmpf-disturbed-at-usda-final-wic-rule-that-decreases-dairy-access/">disturbed</a>” by the new rule.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyond federal agencies, other institutions can enact policies to put plant-based foods at the center of our plates. For example, <a href="https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/pressrelease/nyc-health-hospitals-celebrates-1-2-million-plant-based-meals-served/">New York City’s</a> hospital system reduced its food carbon footprint by more than a third by making plant-based meals the default option, <a href="https://defaultveg.medium.com/hundreds-of-universities-are-moving-toward-a-plant-based-norm-7506609d0ab2#:~:text=In%20universities%2C%20they're%20more,and%20universities%20in%20North%20America!">universities</a> are increasing their meat-free offerings, and in some countries, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22883795/food-industry-plant-based-vegan-meat-dairy-climate-pledges">major food companies</a> have committed to making a larger share of their protein-rich products plant-based.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Following a playbook deployed by the <a href="https://senate.ucsd.edu/media/206150/lobby_spend_report__april.pdf">fossil fuel industry</a> against the renewable energy sector, the conventional <a href="https://www.ncba.org/ncba-news/news-releases/news/details/36527/ncba-backs-fair-labels-act-to-end-deceptive-fake-meat-labeling-practices">meat</a> and <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2023/08/deep-pocketed-dairy-industry-continues-war-on-plant-based-milk-as-fda-hears-comments-on-new-draft-guidance/">dairy</a> industry and its legislative allies are now striving to hamstring its competition.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over a dozen states have passed laws to restrict how plant-based meat, dairy, and egg companies can label their products, with some banning usage of words like “sausage” or “cheese,” even if accompanied by clarifying phrases like “vegetarian,” “plant-based,” or “animal-free.” Some of those laws have been <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/2/14/24069722/political-ban-cell-cultivated-lab-grown-meat-plant-based-labeling-laws">overturned or weakened</a>, but state lawmakers — and <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/549">members of Congress</a>, too — continue to introduce new bills.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Legislative attacks against the cell-cultivated startups are more existential. Earlier this year, Florida and Alabama’s state legislatures <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/2/14/24069722/political-ban-cell-cultivated-lab-grown-meat-plant-based-labeling-laws">banned</a> the sale and production of cell-cultivated meat, and several other states have introduced bans. (In late June, days before the Florida ban took effect, Upside Foods gave out free cell-cultivated meat in Miami.)&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/UPSIDE-Foods-2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="A man speaking to a crowd using a microphone." title="A man speaking to a crowd using a microphone." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Shortly before Florida’s cell-cultivated meat ban took effect, Upside Foods gave out its cell-cultivated chicken at an event in Miami. The company’s CEO, Uma Valeti, addresses the crowd. | Upside Foods" data-portal-copyright="Upside Foods" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">At this point, the bans are purely symbolic, as cell-cultivated meat is nowhere near commercial viability.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Alternative protein producers want to stop these discriminatory regulations, but they also want to benefit from some of the government assistance that the conventional meat industry enjoys. One of those is low-interest federal loans, an unglamorous but potentially powerful tool for launching novel, capital-intensive technologies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Take Tesla, for example. In 2010, the company got a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2017/03/16/this-government-loan-program-helped-tesla-at-a-critical-time-trump-wants-to-cut-it/">$465 million loan</a> from the US Department of Energy that it used to build a manufacturing plant that eventually brought the Model S to American roads. Cell-cultivated meat companies will likely need this level of government support to scale, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US Department of Energy <a href="https://gfi.org/event/accessing-financing-through-the-department-of-energy/">recently opened</a> its loan application program to alternative protein companies, which could be a lifeline as venture capital funding has <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90984752/venture-capital-vc-funding-2023-bloodbath-by-the-numbers">dried up</a> across the economy. (Upside and its competitor GOOD Meat have paused plans to build out large manufacturing facilities.) Edgett said other <a href="https://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services/business-programs/business-industry-loan-guarantees">federal loan programs</a> should be expanded and made accessible to alternative protein companies, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He also wants to see a smoother regulatory process with the USDA and the US Food and Drug Administration, which share oversight of the cell-cultivated meat industry and must both sign off on new products. Upside Foods’ cell-cultivated chicken has already been approved for sale but many other companies still have applications waiting for action.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Edgett said the two agencies “could just do more to make expectations clear” by publishing guidance for startups and establishing a uniform process for how these products will be labeled. Currently, he said, label approval is a one-off process for each company. The sector could receive some clarity later this year, as the USDA is <a href="https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2024/06/12/usda-pushes-forward-label-updates-for-cultured-meat-uncured-claims-nutrition-facts">expected</a> to publish a proposed rule on the matter.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I’m really thinking about a lot of these cultivated meat companies that have such short runways, and they’re running out of capital,” Edgett said. “And I think they’ve hit a wall on the regulatory side, just because it’s slower than they expected, or it’s fairly opaque.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For any chance of success, alternative protein companies will need every obstacle moved out of their way, including what some consider to be a needlessly slow regulatory process. This may be especially important for startups whose products could be market-ready if only they had federal approval. For example, companies including <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/02/plant-based-meat-lab-grown-animal-fat-flavor/673190/">Mission Barns</a>, <a href="https://agfundernews.com/crunch-time-for-cultivated-meat-probably-70-90-of-players-will-fail-in-the-next-year">Meatable, and Mosa Meat</a> aren’t seeking to produce 100 percent cell-cultivated meat or anything close to it, but rather, are making <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23378912/meat-animals-beef-cultivated-in-vitro-food-plant-based-animal-welfare-impossible-burger">“hybrid” alternative meat</a> — plant-based meat blended with a small percent of cell-based fat or protein to achieve a meatier flavor. These products in theory will be easier to scale and more affordable than their more purist competitors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The movement for a food system with fewer animal products has had a tumultuous decade, and ultimately, lower prices and tastier products won’t guarantee it experiences another major upswing. But meat’s outsized carbon and pollution footprint has, thus far, been a gaping hole in America’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/8/8/23296951/inflation-reduction-act-biden-democrats-climate-change#">ambitious</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/5/7/22423139/biden-30-by-30-conservation-initiative-historic">environmental plans</a>. To make progress on those goals, policymakers will need to show a willingness to move in a more plant-based direction. If done correctly, that could ease the increasing <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/11/18/23458234/jim-pillen-governor-nebraska-pigs-pork-plant-based-meat-water-pollution-nitrates">politicization of meat</a>. It could also determine whether the development of better plant-based meat becomes a viable path to changing the food system — or remains a niche category.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many people think of animal rights and veganism, at least in the West, as a relatively contemporary phenomenon — and a niche one at that. Despite all the buzz surrounding plant-based diets, the <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/510038/identify-vegetarian-vegan.aspx">share</a> of Americans who call themselves vegan or vegetarian is in the single digits and may have even decreased in recent decades.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there was once a time when the animal rights movement had gained such cultural significance that, as Irish playwright, Nobel laureate, and vegetarian George Bernard Shaw <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k-LdQ0cMa4AfC09lSxMkpJToDRQVdgYW/view?usp=drivesdk">remarked</a> in a 1906 address to the London Vegetarian Association, “I am beginning to be astonished at the difficulty I now have in finding anybody who eats meat.”&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">One surprising thing</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">You might associate vegetarianism with the hippies and environmentalists of the 1960s and ’70s. It’s true that the vegetarian movement had a renaissance in the last 50 years, as factory farming took over our food system, but its roots in Western countries go back a lot further. Throughout the 19th century, vegetarianism was all the rage and had adherents in other progressive movements, like the fight for women’s suffrage.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><br><strong>This piece is part of <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/364288/how-factory-farming-ends-animal-rights-vegans-climate-ethics">How Factory Farming Ends</a>, a collection of stories on the past and future of the long fight against factory farming.</strong> This series is supported by Animal Charity Evaluators, which received a grant from Builders Initiative.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, long before we had high-tech meat alternatives, the Western world saw a surge of interest in meatless diets and animal welfare. This early wave of vegetarianism — a movement I’ll call animal rights 1.0 — was connected to a range of other social justice issues of the day, including women’s rights and the abolition of slavery. Suffragist Maud Joachim, a member of the Women’s Social and Political Union who was jailed multiple times for her activism, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mZlI-ASxBqWxvnBLhk5ytUTaPHGeyLA5/view?usp=sharing">wrote in 1908,</a> “It is a strange fact that the ranks of the militant suffragettes are mostly recruited from the mild vegetarians … and the authorities [in prison] have allowed us a special vegetarian diet.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The vegetarian cause also attracted the attention of prominent abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, who regularly met with newspaper editor, politician, and vegetarian reformer Horace Greeley at <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yrgY35WKgF0FnjGTFrySuxIRh9hD7Bj5/view?usp=sharing">Grahamite boarding houses</a>. Named after anti-meat advocate and graham cracker creator Sylvester Graham, these houses were hot spots for abolitionists, temperance advocates, anti-tobacco activists, and vegetarians. The <a href="https://education.rspca.org.uk/documents/1494931/0/FS+The+story+of+the+RSPCA+(A).pdf/935a7bb3-7863-bc9d-827a-69b0341dfad6?t=1555163255316">founding</a> of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) in London in 1824 and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) in 1866 were part of the same broader humanitarian and reformist wave.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While today’s animal rights activists struggle to attain mainstream attention and credibility, these problems did not seem insurmountable to the 19th-century vegetarians. The British socialist, women’s rights activist, and advocate for self-rule in India Annie Besant declared in an 1897 <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k-LdQ0cMa4AfC09lSxMkpJToDRQVdgYW/view?usp=drivesdk">speech</a> that “the food reform movement has outlived the period of ridicule; it is entering on a period … of recognition amongst all thoughtful and intelligent people.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Besant and other vegetarian adherents believed it was simply wrong to exploit those who lack power, whoever they were, and connected violence against animals with violence against humans. A vegetarian diet “strikes at the root of all evil,” English poet Percy Bysshe Shelley declared. Advocacy against vivisection, or animal experimentation — on the basis not just of its cruelty to animals but also because it inures those who practice it to cruelty to humans — also enjoyed more legitimacy than it does today.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The imposing gothic-style cathedral of the 19th-century <a href="https://x.com/carlylheath/status/1605736405983891456?s=46&amp;t=MV1RDDxsWUD0EGcfg8aZEA">Vegetarian Society</a> headquarters in London symbolized just how well-positioned the movement appeared to combat the <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-victorians-caused-the-meat-eating-crisis-the-world-faces-today-but-they-might-help-us-solve-it-109310">emerging threat</a> of large-scale industrialized animal slaughter more than 150 years ago. Yet despite the successes of concurrent social reform movements like the abolition of slavery, women’s suffrage, and children’s rights, animal rights 1.0 now feels like a distant golden age.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/GettyImages-1442789427.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,9.9188356421754,100,80.162328715649" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A large dinner held in London’s Freemason’s Hall for the Vegetarian Society, in the middle of the 19th century." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Far from fulfilling animal rights advocates’ utopian dreams, the 20th century instead saw the rise of modern intensive animal agriculture, along with a vast public-private bureaucracy designed to ensure its profitability and protect it from public scrutiny. Over the last century, America’s per capita meat consumption has <a href="https://www.agweb.com/opinion/drivers-us-capita-meat-consumption-over-last-century">nearly doubled.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The industry worked to push its products onto consumers through a system of generous public subsidies, regulatory capture, and an agricultural policy focused on flooding the market with cheap meat and dairy — all while keeping up the sacred American illusion of a free market. It has thoroughly captured and absorbed the US Department of Agriculture, along with my profession, veterinarians — who have perhaps more influence than any other over the treatment of animals — into its slaughter-industrial complex.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After a period of dormancy, the animal rights movement <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13t0QgKufDjwAd9dGtIyBxhXg1n1KGjhx/view?usp=sharing">re-emerged</a> in recent decades with a consumer choice-focused message: “Go vegan!” But against animal agriculture’s economic and political power, urging individuals to restructure their lives around a meatless diet was no longer a strategic ask. The livestock industry recognized what animal rights activists had not: Demand for its products could not be left up to the whims of consumer choice.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, factory farming poses ever-greater threats to society, including the rise of <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24128700/bird-fludairy-meat-industry-h5n1-cows-milk-eggs-safety">viruses of pandemic potential</a>,<a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/3/20/24105735/peak-meat-livestock-emissions-plant-based-climate-deadline"> climate change</a>, and the moral abomination of large-scale animal slaughter. The time is ripe to take on the meat industry. The activists of animal rights 1.0 showed us that radical change is possible, but to realize their vision, today’s strategies will need to be fundamentally different. Animal advocates are increasingly recognizing a need to focus less on telling consumers to avoid meat and more on changing the systems that force all of us to prop up corporate animal exploitation, whether we buy its products or not.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The vegetarian movement couldn’t compete with </strong>the rise of factory farming</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KdOvnNoT4UdZ2I4_ZKBMZFzAkBCSjQ8H/view">extensive writing</a> of Russian author Leo Tolstoy on vegetarianism and animal slaughter is often summed up in the apocryphal <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/42064-as-long-as-there-are-slaughter-houses-there-will-always">quote</a>: “As long as there are slaughterhouses, there will always be battlefields.” The reverse may also be true. The world wars of the 20th century shattered the utopian aspirations that had once flourished.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As European farmers became soldiers, American farmers were called to pick up the slack and <a href="https://www.worldwar1centennial.org/index.php/food-will-win-the-war-articles/1450-food-will-win-the-war-article-3.html">feed</a> the Allied forces by producing grain and meat that could be easily shipped abroad. In 1917, a meat industry trade journal <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x1kp5-OMPoLhD5L9CRAa6ZFf1H3Vg49X/view?usp=drivesdk">foreshadowed</a> the coming intensification of US agriculture, writing that “the stern necessity of war has created an undreamed of efficiency that will last long after the war. We, as a nation, must compete with that efficiency if we are going to hold any share of trade in the world.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">War also annihilated the foundations of the vegetarian movement in parts of the world. At the dawn of World War I, the Russian Empire was home to a vibrant vegetarian community; a Kyiv Vegetarian Society canteen, one of about a dozen vegetarian canteens in the city, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oPDwx8604LuamyKvJjHbIHsGe8Cn1LPs/view?usp=sharing">served</a> more than 200,000 visitors in 1911. Jews made up the single largest group of diners at the canteens, according to a 1912 survey. By the end of World War II, the Holocaust had decimated Eastern Europe’s Jewish population.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the interwar and postwar periods in the <a href="https://www.thelugarcenter.org/printpilot-news-409.pdf?1715651599">US</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24146466/europe-farmer-protests-eu-climate-environmental-policy-subsidies-livestock">Europe</a>, governments poured money into agriculture to boost productivity and food security. Agricultural yields <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/42826/11496_eb10_1_.pdf?v=3571">improved</a> dramatically, allowing farms to produce more food with fewer inputs. Biomedical innovations like the advent of antibiotics, combined with novel methods of extreme confinement and selective breeding, fueled the rise of modern intensive animal agriculture, along with meat giants like <a href="https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2020/11/25/cargill-deforestation-agriculture-history-pollution/">Cargill</a> and Tyson, that could mass produce unfathomable numbers of animals for slaughter.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The livestock industry recognized what animal rights activists had not: Demand for its products could not be left up to the whims of consumer choice</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The animal rights movement couldn’t compete. By 2022, the US slaughtered <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census">more than 10 billion</a> land animals for food. Almost paradoxically, the imperative to squeeze as much profit from as few inputs as possible enabled the expansion of animal agriculture, the least-efficient, most resource-intensive form of food production. Producing billions of animals for slaughter <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/land-use-diets">requires growing</a> many times more crops to feed them than simply farming plant-based foods — so much that <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/3/034015/pdf">two-thirds</a> of crop calories grown in the US are fed not to humans, but to farmed animals.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Big Ag’s ascent after World War II, this inefficiency became a feature, not a bug. As historian Ariel Ron <a href="https://www.phenomenalworld.org/analysis/the-iron-farm-bill/">put it</a>, “the astonishing profusion of commodity crop production required finding new ways to upsell calories for an affluent consumer society. Meat was the economic solution to the historically unprecedented problem of large structural caloric surpluses.” In short, the agriculture industry could make more money feeding animals for human consumption than it could directly feeding crops to humans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The levels of meat and dairy consumption that Americans take for granted today are a product not of innate consumer demand but of a kind of welfare state for agribusiness that works to create a guaranteed market for the livestock industry’s products. The federal government has come to serve as animal agriculture’s benefactor, customer, and advertiser. American taxpayers pay animal agriculture tens of billions of dollars through a labyrinthine system of subsidy programs managed by the US Department of Agriculture that shield it from risk and competition. One of the <a href="https://farm.ewg.org/region.php?fips=00000&amp;progcode=total&amp;yr=2023">biggest beneficiaries</a> is the dairy industry, which derives about 73 percent of its revenue from some form of subsidy, according to one <a href="http://www.greyclark.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/US-Subsidies-Post-2014-Farm-Bill-FEB-2018.pdf">2015 estimate</a>.&nbsp;To name one example, milk is given to schoolchildren through the <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/nslp">National School Lunch Program</a>, which <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/352359/milk-dairy-schools">requires schools to serve milk</a> to millions of students every day at public expense.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To help stabilize prices and ensure farmers&#8217; economic stability, the government buys up <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/government-cheese">vast quantities</a> of surplus products. This has led to massive <a href="https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/pg15bd892/rf560z098/6m313c90v/cost0624.pdf">stockpiles</a>, including the federal government’s well-known “cheese caves.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ensuring a stable food supply in this way does not have to be bad policy — and the federal government does stockpile fruits and vegetables, too. But by propping up our ruinous system of animal agriculture, policymakers allow corporations to extract more than their fair share from taxpayers, while threatening <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9629715/">public health</a> and the climate and <a href="https://www.southernenvironment.org/news/the-sinister-hog-industry-of-eastern-north-carolina/">contaminating</a> our <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652620337896#:~:text=Costco%20sources%20beef%20from%20the,burdens%20along%20the%20supply%20chain.">air</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/06/animal-agriculture-nitrate-water">water</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The livestock industry is shielded from the costs of these externalities. Federal law even requires the USDA to oversee marketing programs for the meat and dairy industries and other agricultural products, known as <a href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/rules-regulations/research-promotion">checkoff programs</a>, which are funded by fees collected from producers on a portion of their sales.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More insidious than the subsidies and the government-funded advertising campaigns, though, are the livestock industry’s efforts to more directly engineer Americans’ consumption habits, making purchases of their products a reflex rather than a conscious decision. “If you build a habit, something they will do day in and day out, you’ve got a great business. Google is a toothbrush. Facebook is a toothbrush,” Mohan Sawhney, a marketing professor at Northwestern University, was <a href="https://www.porkbusiness.com/opinion/why-pork-industry-needs-build-toothbrush">reported</a> saying at a growth and innovation webinar for the National Pork Board. “We’ve got to make pork into a toothbrush — not something that’s exotic, that you do occasionally.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The dairy industry’s USDA-sponsored marketing boards have poured resources into getting more of its products into fast food restaurants, where <a href="https://www.driveresearch.com/market-research-company-blog/fast-food-consumption-statistics/">two-thirds of Americans</a> eat at least once a week. Dairy Management Inc., an arm of the Dairy Checkoff program, in 2009 placed <a href="https://hoards.com/print-article-19407-permanent.html">scientists</a> in positions at McDonald’s to stuff more dairy into its menu items — adding butter to Egg McMuffins, featuring milk in Happy Meals, and introducing the now-discontinued <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mcdonalds-menu-changes-over-years-history-2019-4#orange-hi-c-16">Mozzarella Sticks</a> and Buttermilk Crispy Chicken — which helped them sell an additional 500 million pounds of dairy products annually, a dairy industry publication reported in 2016. Similar <a href="https://grist.org/food/butter-board-viral-dairy-lobby/">strategies</a> at other fast food chains have reportedly increased the amount of cheese on menu items as much as <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/government-cheese">eightfold</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Where the modern movement against factory farming went wrong</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The animal rights movement reconstituted roughly 50 years ago with the publication of philosopher Peter Singer’s <em>Animal Liberation</em> in 1975. The now-classic book <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23737349/peter-singer-philosophy-animal-welfare-factory-farming-euthanasia-disabled-ethics#">brought</a> veganism and animal advocacy to a new generation of activists at a time when animal slaughter had been systematized and mechanized in ways the Victorian-era vegetarians could have never imagined. New groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), founded in 1980, and a crop of farm animal rights organizations in the ensuing decades aimed to expose conditions inside animal production facilities and slaughterhouses to persuade the public to stop eating animals.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>For a population that had gotten hooked on cheap meat and dairy, the animal movement’s message was polarizing, judgmental, and restrictive. To be vegan was to be morally superior.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The activists of animal rights 2.0 successfully drew public attention to the contemporary plight of slaughter-bound animals. Their call to action, though, was one that could only be adopted by those with the personality and mindset to resist social pressure and the meat industry’s glut of publicly subsidized products. It was fundamentally a movement built on individuals’ consumption choices, which made for committed activists but also an insular, fractious community that has struggled to convince a critical mass of the public to change its diet. For a population that had gotten hooked on cheap meat and dairy, the animal movement’s message was <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/11/2/18055532/vegans-vegetarian-research-uk">polarizing</a>, judgmental, and restrictive. To be vegan was to be morally superior.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By framing animal exploitation as a consumer issue, animal advocates unwittingly reified&nbsp;animal agriculture’s narrative: that eating their products was a matter of personal choice&nbsp; — a choice that vegan extremists sought to <a href="https://www.drovers.com/news/education/scorecards-and-incremental-changes-how-extremists-are-targeting-consumer-choice">take away</a>. In reality, the meat industry has fought to ensure that we’re all forced to pay them, whether we buy their products or not. Consumers have no ability to opt out of, for example, paying for the cruel <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23963820/bird-flu-surge-us-ventilation-shutdown-veterinarians">taxpayer-funded exterminations</a> of tens of millions of animals taking place now at poultry giants like Tyson and Jennie-O because of the poultry industry’s failure to adequately prepare for bird flu. Vegan or not, few people want to see these mega-corporations <a href="https://www.ourhonor.org/blognew/bailouts">bailed out</a> on the public’s dime.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent years, the animal movement has diversified&nbsp;its work beyond vegan advocacy to tactics from <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/353393/farm-bill-republicans-prop-12-gestation-crates-pork">welfare reforms</a> on animal confinements to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23647682/factory-farming-dxe-criminal-trial-rescue">taking direct action</a> to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23980010/cellular-agriculture-consortiums-collaboration-alternative-meat-lab-grown">investing</a> in the next generation of meat alternatives. But it still lacks a coherent strategy to change the foundational agricultural policies that give livestock production the upper hand.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One promising route to doing that may be through the veterinary profession, a key gatekeeper standing between animal agriculture and the public purse. The public expects vets to advocate for animals’ interests, but right now, organized veterinary medicine is captive to the livestock industry, often serving to “legitimize practices that cause extreme, prolonged pain and suffering on a massive scale” for animals raised for food, as veterinarian Gwendolen Reyes-Illg <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23516639/veterinarians-avma-factory-farming-ventilation-shutdown">told</a> Vox last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The animal agriculture and pharmaceutical industries (the latter profits from selling vaccines, antibiotics, and other medications to slaughter-bound animals) have become <a href="https://www.avma.org/events/avma-convention/sponsors">heavily entangled</a> with the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), the country’s leading veterinary organization, which helps shape federal and state policy on how animals are treated. Livestock companies give veterinary students <a href="https://aabp.org/about/Cargill_winners.asp">scholarships</a>, <a href="https://vetmed.tamu.edu/news/press-releases/alliance-with-cargillnutrena-inc/">forge partnerships</a> with <a href="https://olathe.k-state.edu/about/news/2020/august/haley-larson-joins-olathe-campus-as-animal-health-professor.html">veterinary schools</a> and production-optimizing <a href="https://www.cargill.com/2023/cargill-provides-support-to-university-of-idahos-center">animal science programs</a>, and even build their own veterinary schools <a href="https://www.eco-business.com/press-releases/cargill-builds-70th-school-in-vietnam/">abroad</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Earlier this year, the AVMA <a href="https://agriculture.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=7765">endorsed</a> federal legislation designed to invalidate one of the most important farm animal welfare laws ever passed in the US: California’s Proposition 12, which bans the pork industry’s confinement of pigs in gestation crates, cages barely larger than their bodies. In the bird flu outbreak of the last few years, the AVMA has played a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36611748/">central role</a> in enabling factory farms’ dependence on ventilation shutdown plus (VSD+), a method being used to mass cull chickens and turkeys on farms hit with bird flu by heating them to death in sealed sheds. It’s one of the most shockingly cruel meat industry developments in recent memory, and it’s being carried out at taxpayers’ expense.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">A vision for animal rights 3.0</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the meat industry, this alliance with the veterinary profession has paid off abundantly. The next wave of animal activism, animal rights 3.0, will need to take a page from their playbook and work to turn animal professionals — including veterinarians and state and federal agriculture officials — against the systems that have enlisted them into profit-driven animal cruelty.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many veterinarians go into the profession because they love animals. Yet in veterinary school, we’re often taught that animal rights is a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A5aJctU_7wCw7OH3dtyEYIdYbDhpV77A/view?usp=sharing">threat</a> to our profession, that <a href="https://news.wsu.edu/news/2002/10/04/veterinarians-strongly-disagree-with-animal-rights-activists/">limiting animal experimentation</a> would harm medical progress, and that factory farming is necessary to feed the world. Like the winged monkeys in <em>The Wizard of Oz </em>doing the bidding of the Wicked Witch of the West, veterinarians <a href="https://cdqap.org/animal-rights-activists-increasingly-aggressive-dangerous/">obediently recite</a> anti-animal rights narratives, serving the interests of multibillion-dollar conglomerates.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/reports-statistics/market-research-statistics-avma-membership">vast majority</a> of US veterinarians working today treat companion animals — like cats and dogs — not animals raised for food, and I’ve often observed that rather than rock the boat, they tend to <a href="https://www.avma.org/javma-news/2021-09-15/hod-recommends-depopulation-policy-sent-expert-panel-further-consideration">defer</a> to their livestock industry colleagues’ expertise about the appropriate treatment of farm animals. The small percentage of veterinarians who do work in animal agriculture and industry are <a href="https://www.avma.org/about/state-and-allied-groups">overrepresented</a> in the AVMA’s decision-making bodies, through greater access and opportunities for positions on the AVMA’s various committees and advisory panels, while veterinarians who vocally oppose industry practices, as I have, are <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/10/10/new-documents-reveal-how-the-animal-agriculture-industry-surveils-and-punishes-critics/">silenced</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Animal rights 2.0, with its focus on boycott and abstinence from systems that it finds reprehensible, has missed an opportunity to develop activists within the professional community that’s perhaps best positioned to challenge corporate animal abuse. Even veterinarians who already support animal rights and oppose factory farming, when I voice my concerns with the AVMA, have told me countless times, “That’s why I am no longer a member.” That’s exactly how the industry likes it: pro-animal voices lacking the ability to comment on policies and guidelines, join committees, and hold positions of influence.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Animal rights 3.0 will have to shed the fixation on personal purity that has prevented the movement from shaping policy and regulation. Animal advocates should have a seat at the table in rooms where decisions are made about how animals live and die. Veterinarians are deeply embedded in the USDA — the agency “hires the highest number of veterinarians of any other national organization in the world,” Pat Basu, former USDA chief public health veterinarian, told me in an email, making it a prime opportunity for vets who want to help farm animals.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Animal rights 3.0 will have to shed the fixation on personal purity that has prevented the movement from shaping policy and regulation</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those whose long-term career ambitions do not depend on the livestock industry have the unique opportunity to obtain positions of influence within the USDA, state agriculture departments, or the AVMA, work to rigorously enforce animal welfare laws that often go ignored, and publicly speak out if they’re prevented from doing their jobs. They can use their roles to question the ongoing denial of rights to animals and advocate for redirecting public funds away from animal agriculture.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We already have the building blocks for this: A nascent movement of veterinarians is fighting to change the profession’s priorities to align with the interests of animals instead of their corporate oppressors. More veterinarians, including myself, <a href="https://www.humaneslaughter.org/">are</a> <a href="https://avmajournals.avma.org/view/journals/javma/229/3/javma.229.3.350.xml">working</a> with animal rights activists to draw public attention to animal agriculture’s atrocities. We need more organizational capacity in animal rights to develop partnerships with professionals who work with animals, including not just the already converted, but also those who work in industries that exploit animals and are questioning the ethics of their roles.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The latter phenomenon, sometimes known as “moral injury,” is <a href="https://www.nomv.org/2023/08/19/moral-injury-and-how-it-affects-veterinary-professionals/">well-known</a> in veterinary medicine, yet too often, veterinarians are trained to quiet the inner voice that tells them they’re participating in an unjust system. We can empower these people to follow their conscience and protect the most vulnerable among us. Eventually, we can build <a href="https://www.institutionalcourage.org/the-call-to-courage">institutional courage</a> in organizations like the AVMA — a concept coined by psychologist Jennifer Freyd for when institutions that have committed grievous harm apologize for wrongdoing, correct the damage caused, and put systems in place to protect victims and whistleblowers in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There will be backlash, as we’re already seeing today, with meat industry-led <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/2/14/24069722/political-ban-cell-cultivated-lab-grown-meat-plant-based-labeling-laws">state bans</a> on cell-cultivated meat and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/353393/farm-bill-republicans-prop-12-gestation-crates-pork">legislation</a> challenging animal welfare laws. We have to prepare ourselves for a brutal fight.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We can draw inspiration from the animal activists of the 19th century, who achieved so much with far less wealth and resources than we have today, and understood the connection between all forms of social injustice. But they were unprepared for the arrival of a new economic order that would transform the American food environment and trade away the environment, public health, and animal welfare for abundant cheap meat.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A century later, animal rights 2.0 awakened the public to the horrors of factory farming, but it emerged at a time when it was not yet clear how unlevel the playing field was between vegan advocates and their meat industry opponents. The next wave of animal activism will need to integrate these lessons from the past, building a movement that bridges the divide between activists, veterinarians, and other professionals, and empowers them to confront the systems that lead humanity to inflict large-scale atrocities on the animals with whom we share this planet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s one of those facts of the world that most people know but don’t really want to <em>know</em>: Billions of animals on factory farms live their lives in gruesome and torturous conditions so that our eggs and meat are a bit cheaper. Virtually <a href="https://farmanimalwelfare.substack.com/p/we-love-animals-why-do-we-torture">no one really approves of it</a>, but almost everyone participates in it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you want to change that, what should you do about it?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When I was in college, activists for animals had some passionate disagreements about which approach to take. A lot of them favored leafleting — handing out flyers with grotesque pictures of the horrifying conditions on factory farms, with the idea of shocking people into change. Others favored protests in restaurants and grocery stores, or daring rescues of dying animals from confinement. Some people hoped we could obviate meat altogether with plant-based or lab-grown alternatives, while others wanted to work towards gradual legislative change.&nbsp;</p>

</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.worldanimalprotection.ca/blogs/what-is-the-difference-between-animal-rights-and-animal-welfare/#:~:text=Animal%20welfare%20is%20concerned%20about,humans%20in%20the%20first%20place.">One division </a>was between people who called themselves animal rights activists — working toward a world where we did not treat nonhuman animals as property, but acknowledged them as individuals — and people who called themselves animal welfare activists, and who tended to favor interventions to make the processes by which we raised and killed animals for food more humane.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">EAs versus activists</h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The growing <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/cause-profile-animal-welfare">effective-altruism-inspired giving to animal advocacy</a> tended to come down on the animal welfare side of the spectrum.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Consider lobbying to make a factory farm slightly more humane, even as it still subjects animals to awful conditions. Many animal rights activists feel like that amounts to complicity in the abuses that even supposedly more humane farms would go on to perpetuate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Effective altruists, by contrast, tended to jump at such opportunities — after all, 10 percent better conditions for animals, while hardly perfect, is still better. Many sanctuaries for rescued farm animals were <a href="https://www.upc-online.org/thinking/230801_are_farmed_animal_sanctuaries_at_risk.html">bitter about</a> effective animal advocates’ disinterest in funding them; effective animal advocates, in turn, would grimly observe that sanctuaries simply don’t have that many animals in them, compared to the number in factory farms. It was a matter of numbers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There was also a difference in ethos. Faced with an atrocity, some people are <a href="https://www.vox.com/e/364284">drawn to splash themselves</a> with blood and march down the street, trying to make passersby realize the magnitude of the horrors they’re complicit in. Other people are inclined to whip out some spreadsheets. These two groups often end up suspicious of each other, each exasperated to have allies who refuse to do what it takes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One could write an entire book about the culture clashes as effective altruism-oriented giving entered the animal advocacy space. Effective altruists were also making a splash in other areas, like global health and development or biosecurity or AI, but those were all areas where a lot of money was already being spent from many sources. Farmed animal advocacy, by contrast, was not.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Effective animal advocates rapidly became a <a href="https://johnsoncenter.org/blog/one-health-and-animal-protection-philanthropy-a-growing-sub-sector/">huge source of spending in the space</a>, and their philosophy of how to do good became prominent. That understandably led to frustration from people with other theories of how to do good, theories they’d often spent decades working on with very little funding.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But ultimately almost everyone involved should agree the effective animal advocacy movement should be evaluated not by how they made humans feel, but by how their work impacted animals.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Stronger together</h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A decade on, the philosophy of incremental and numbers-oriented welfare work has gotten a lot done.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One <a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/how-the-open-wing-alliance-has-helped-free-hundreds-of-millions-of-chickens-from-cages/">recent blog post</a> published by the Open Philanthropy Project, which has funded effective animal advocacy work, lays out how they did it. The <a href="https://openwingalliance.org/">Open Wing Alliance</a>, a coalition of animal advocacy organizations, zeroed in on corporations as a good target for pressure to improve conditions. Since these corporations tend to sell eggs to consumers, they care about their reputation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Open Wing Alliance would effectively offer them a deal: commit to going cage-free, <a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/how-the-open-wing-alliance-has-helped-free-hundreds-of-millions-of-chickens-from-cages/">or else</a>: “Protesters will mobilize online and on the ground; they’ll show up in chicken costumes at corporate headquarters and franchise locations. Public ads and social media shame campaigns will further drive negative press. The OWA … will do its best to make [the target’s] brand synonymous with animal cruelty if they refuse to make necessary welfare improvements.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In an important way, this represents a synthesis of the two threads of the animal advocacy movement that I encountered back when I was a college student: the suit-wearing lobbying types get the meetings with corporations, and make demands carefully chosen based on rigorous analysis of which asks do the most for animals. But the corporations’ reason to go along is that should they refuse, they will face protesters willing to put their bodies on the line for animals.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s proven to be a very powerful tactic. Hundreds of pledges have been made, and broadly, they’ve been kept. Hundreds of millions of chickens live lives that are still pretty horrifying, but still significantly better than they’d otherwise have been — <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1he5hQ_2VmLKUdsBqEPU5yeneOTCbGoAs/view">one estimate concluded</a> that compared to a hen raised in a cage, each hen raised cage-free will spend 275 fewer hours in “disabling pain,” and thousands of hours less time in lower levels of pain. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No one is declaring victory, but it seems like the negotiation-and-threat-of-protests strategy is a highly cost-effective way to improve conditions for animals.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The road ahead</h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, it’s impossible to imagine fully addressing the horrors of factory farming with this approach — or with any single approach. Corporations will change their policies if it’s relatively inexpensive to do so, but it’s hard to imagine them adopting the much more expensive changes that would be necessary to give animals intensively raised on factory farms good lives. And plenty of animal advocates wouldn’t be happy even if you did pull that off; they’d like us to stop raising billions of animals in captivity to kill and eat, not just to be nicer about doing so. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And the most unpleasant feature of factory farming is that, unlike nearly all of the world’s problems, so far it has gotten worse as the world has gotten richer. As more and more people enter the global middle class and can afford cheap meat, it creates incentives for more companies to horrendously mistreat animals. For all the progress I’ve discussed, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census">more animals in the US</a> are factory farmed now than when I was in college.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On a problem as big as this one, you can accomplish a ton and still have an unfathomable distance to go.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But when I look at the state of animal advocacy in 2024, I’m optimistic. Since a decade ago, there’s been a serious maturation of the field. It has integrated the many varying perspectives on what advocates are trying to achieve, and somewhat grown past the frictions of very different people trying to work together toward a common goal. And people have accomplished real and worthy things, and learned a lot about what works.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The stakes remain enormous and the situation remains stomach-churningly terrible, but many of the arguments I remember having in college are ones that the movement has now substantially moved past. Disruptive protests or polished advocacy? Why not one as a strategy to produce the other, like how labor unions do it? Is it worth advocating for incremental change? Looks like, yes, it definitely is. Do people from different subcultures and with different perspectives really care about animals, despite all the mutual distrust? Looks like, yes, they do!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, I’ve seen many other advocacy groups run aground on such differences. It’s worth occasionally taking a step back to be impressed with the achievements of animal advocates — and, if you work on any other high-stakes depressingly entrenched ill in our world, to learn from them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">America’s favorite animal to eat — the chicken — has also become its most expendable: In 2021, around 556 million chickens in the US died at hatcheries and on farms before reaching the slaughterhouse, their carcasses winding up in landfills, incinerators, compost heaps, or pet food.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">An additional 41 million never entered the food supply, either because they died during transport to the slaughterhouse or were slaughtered but deemed unsafe to eat due to a variety of reasons, including tumors, bruising, or infections.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s all according to a <a href="https://animalequality.org/news/chicken-mortality-report/">new analysis</a> released today by the international animal rights group Animal Equality.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To put Animal Equality’s findings into perspective, these 597 million chickens that are never consumed — 6 percent of the 9.8 billion raised for meat every year in the US — are far greater than the combined number of turkeys, pigs, and cattle slaughtered for meat annually.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So many chickens die prematurely on farms that one <a href="https://www.wattagnet.com/poultry-future/article/15534258/innova-invests-in-poultry-mortality-recovery-robot-startup">startup</a> even created a robot to scoop them up so farmworkers don’t have to — it’s built into the industry’s business model.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2021, the National Chicken Council, the industry’s main trade group, reported a <a href="https://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/about-the-industry/statistics/u-s-broiler-performance/">5.3 percent</a> mortality rate, or the share of birds that die prematurely, but that analysis only included chickens that died on farms. Animal Equality’s report provides a more comprehensive accounting, including for other deaths in the production chain, such as chickens that die after birth at the hatcheries where they’re incubated and born, in transport to farms, and those that are slaughtered but don’t enter the food supply.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-04-at-5.31.12%E2%80%AFPM.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,14.321353874756,100,71.357292250489" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A chick is caught in machinery at a Foster Farms hatchery. | Animal Equality" data-portal-copyright="Animal Equality" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">“The industry knows that a significant portion — [nearly] 600 million animals — are going to die, and that still allows them to make a profit,” said Sean Thomas, Animal Equality’s international director of investigations. Across the group’s undercover investigations of factory farms, Thomas said, “we don’t see veterinary care for a single chicken that is sick, because that single chicken does not matter to the industry.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All these dead chickens constitute a form of hidden food waste that adds up to an unfathomable amount of suffering, as the birds <a href="https://www.thepoultrysite.com/articles/mortality-patterns-associated-with-commercial-broiler-production">perish</a> from what have become features of American poultry farming: painful diseases, heart attacks, dehydration, starvation, and rough handling.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Additionally, around <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/43833/43680_eib121.pdf?v=1488.4">one-fifth</a> of poultry meat that does enter the US food supply is thrown away by grocers, restaurants, and consumers at home. When accounting for both waste in the production chain<em> </em>and waste at the consumer and retail levels, about one-quarter of chickens hatched — some 2.6 billion per year — are never consumed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The problem appears to only be getting worse. Since the mid-20th century, the poultry industry has steadily reduced its on-farm mortality rate. But in the last decade, it’s been on the rise, recently reaching levels not seen since the 1960s.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/u3cF7-over-half-a-billion-chickens-die-on-us-farms-each-year-representing-a-hidden-form-of-food-waste.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,21.068865432894,100,57.862269134212" alt="A chart shows the share of farmed chickens that die from disease and injuries has been rising since 2013, reaching levels similar to that of the 1960s." title="A chart shows the share of farmed chickens that die from disease and injuries has been rising since 2013, reaching levels similar to that of the 1960s." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s well understood what kills chickens on farms: infectious diseases and health problems that stem from how the birds are bred to grow too big and too fast. Over the last decade, producers have been breeding chickens to grow ever bigger, which could explain why more and more are dying on farms. Another likely cause of increasing mortality could be that chicken farms, under pressure from public health officials and advocates, have used fewer antibiotic drugs in recent years, because the poultry industry’s use of these lifesaving drugs is a major driver of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22922018/antibiotic-resistance-epidemic-drug-resistant-infections">antibiotics resistance crisis</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Both of these problems can be addressed in a way that alleviates the animals’ suffering and safeguards antibiotics used in human medicine. One of the country’s largest chicken companies is showing how it can be done, but the question is whether the rest of the industry will follow.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s causing the spike in dead chickens on farms?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Around 1950, US farmers began feeding their chickens and other farmed animals antibiotics to make them grow faster and prevent disease. Rather than reserve them for cases when an animal gets sick, the drugs have been widely used prophylactically as a crutch to keep farmed animals alive in the unsanitary, overcrowded warehouses in which the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census">vast majority</a> of them are raised, and where disease proliferates.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By the early 2000s, about <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1369527400002411">half of all antibiotics</a> ever produced globally had been fed to livestock.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over time, public health experts learned this practice had come back to bite us: Bacteria commonly found on farms, like Salmonella and E. coli, were mutating and becoming resistant to antibiotics, making the drugs less effective in treating humans.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Throughout the 20th century, numerous efforts aimed at the US Food and Drug Administration to restrict antibiotic use in food production failed in the face of pharmaceutical lobbying pressure and growing anti-regulatory sentiment. But after decades of pressure, US fast food restaurants and big chicken companies eventually took action, as <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/1/8/23542789/big-meat-antibiotics-resistance-fda">did the FDA</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2014, just 3 percent of chickens were raised without antibiotics; by 2018, <a href="https://civileats.com/2024/05/22/what-happened-to-antibiotic-free-chicken/">more than half were</a>, and 90 percent of chickens were raised without antibiotics relevant in human medicine. It was a major public health win, but as the livestock industry was quick to <a href="https://www.wattagnet.com/broilers-turkeys/diseases-health/article/15537515/less-antibiotic-use-in-us-broilers-but-more-mortality">point out</a>, it led to more chickens <a href="https://www.wattagnet.com/broilers-turkeys/diseases-health/article/15537515/less-antibiotic-use-in-us-broilers-but-more-mortality">dying</a> on farms.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a result, Tyson Foods — the nation’s largest poultry producer — and Chick-fil-A each <a href="https://civileats.com/2024/05/22/what-happened-to-antibiotic-free-chicken/">rolled back</a> their “no antibiotics ever” pledges and reintroduced a class of antibiotics called ionophores, which aren’t used in human medicine. Ionophores pose a lesser threat to human health, though <a href="https://civileats.com/2024/05/22/what-happened-to-antibiotic-free-chicken/">some experts worry</a> they could still contribute to the growth of bacteria resistant to antibiotics.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the data suggests the chicken industry’s move away from antibiotics isn’t the only cause of its rising mortality rate: Even as antibiotic use remained stable <a href="https://www.wattagnet.com/broilers-turkeys/diseases-health/article/15537515/less-antibiotic-use-in-us-broilers-but-more-mortality">from 2018 to 2023</a>, on-farm mortality rates continued to climb. Some of that could be attributed to disease outbreaks that impacted the industry during this period, like <a href="https://www.wattagnet.com/broilers-turkeys/ippe-news/article/15532799/controlling-challenging-forms-of-infectious-bronchitis">infectious bronchitis</a>, <a href="https://www.wattagnet.com/broilers-turkeys/diseases-health/news/15682877/how-to-prevent-metapneumovirus-in-commercial-poultry">Avian metapneumovirus</a>, and <a href="https://www.feednavigator.com/Article/2024/02/16/Navigating-antibiotic-trends-in-US-broiler-sector/">necrotic enteritis</a>. But part of the problem could be what the meat industry has done to the chickens themselves.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Chickens are getting too big to survive&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the 1950s, poultry companies began breeding chickens to grow bigger and faster. Back then, it would take chickens 70 days to reach their “<a href="https://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/about-the-industry/statistics/u-s-broiler-performance/">market weight</a>” of 3 pounds. Now, chickens reach 6.5 pounds in just 47 days; almost half the time for more than double the weight.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Among other traits, poultry companies selectively bred chickens to have bigger breasts, the <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/the-cost-of-chicken-a-ranking-of-chicken-cuts-from-least-to-most-expensive-243382">most valuable part</a> of the bird. As a result, today’s chickens are extremely top-heavy compared to chickens of the past.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/Kenny_Vox_ChickenSize_.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="A USDA chart shows chickens raised for meat getting larger over the past 70 years, starting at 3 pounds in 1950 and growing to 6.5 pounds in 2023." title="A USDA chart shows chickens raised for meat getting larger over the past 70 years, starting at 3 pounds in 1950 and growing to 6.5 pounds in 2023." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Paige Vickers/Vox" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Animal advocates say this transformation has turned the birds into “<a href="https://frankenchickens.com/">Frankenchickens</a>” that are “<a href="https://www.noemamag.com/the-unending-quest-to-build-a-better-chicken#:~:text=Due%20to%20underdeveloped%20immune%20systems,prisoners%20in%20their%20own%20bodies.%E2%80%9D">prisoners in their own bodies</a>,” which cause a number of health problems that lead to premature death. Many chickens’ tiny legs can’t support the weight of their giant breasts, leading to injuries that can be so severe that they struggle to walk to reach food and water, resulting in death by <a href="https://extension.umd.edu/resource/leg-health-chickens-fs-1179/">dehydration or starvation</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Between 2013 and 2023, when antibiotics use fell, chickens were bred to grow <a href="https://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/about-the-industry/statistics/u-s-broiler-performance/">10.5 percent bigger</a>, which could’ve contributed to rising mortality rates. Fast-growing chickens “have relatively high mortality rates as compared to slower growing strains (and systems with higher welfare requirements),” <a href="https://www.wur.nl/en/persons/ingrid-de-jong-1.htm">Ingrid de Jong</a>, a senior researcher of poultry welfare at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, told me over email.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s unclear how much of a role this played in rising mortality over the last decade, however, because for many decades before, poultry companies had been making chickens grow bigger while reducing mortality rates. It could be that in recent years, these companies have hit a biological limit of sorts — a point at which making the birds grow bigger and bigger has made more of them die on the farm.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Animal advocates want to see the poultry industry switch to <a href="https://civileats.com/2019/05/28/the-race-to-produce-a-slower-growing-chicken/">slower-growing chicken breeds</a>, which they argue would do more to reduce animal suffering than just about any other single change to the factory farm system.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Chicken companies don’t need to decide between more dead birds and protecting antibiotics</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Big chicken producers might now be thinking that they need to choose between phasing out antibiotics to protect human health and keeping chicken mortality rates down. But the experience of Perdue Farms, America’s fifth largest chicken producer, shows that would be a mistake.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The company isn’t exactly a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05h2hNi1S1g">shining beacon</a> of <a href="https://vimeo.com/245790342">animal</a> <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/06/13/perdue-chicken-slaughterhouse-animal-cruelty-dxe/">welfare</a> — in most ways, its operations look much like any other factory farm — but it’s taken steps to alleviate animal suffering that other major producers haven’t, and remains committed to never using antibiotics even as its competitors have resumed using them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perdue began to remove antibiotics from its production in 2002 and became antibiotic-free by 2016. Early in the process, its mortality rate was slightly above the industry average, but now the company’s mortality rate tends to run “about half a percent to a percent better” than the industry, <a href="https://www.aaap.info/bruce-stewart-brown">Bruce Stewart-Brown</a>, Perdue Farms’ chief science officer, told me.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The company got there in part by cleaning up its breeding operations and hatcheries: “We&#8217;re not relying on this kind of antibiotic to clean up something that we could do ourselves.” For instance, it works to get its breeding hens to lay their eggs in nests, rather than on the floor where there might be disease.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The company also refined its vaccine regimen, and adjusted its chicken feed by adding probiotics and removing animal byproducts, which can irritate the birds’ guts, among other changes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Across the chicken industry, a lot of birds die in their final week of life — which is under seven weeks — as the health problems that stem from fast growth catch up with them. To help mitigate this problem, Perdue sends its birds to the slaughterhouse when they’re at a slightly lower weight than the industry average. “The last week gets harder when you have heavier birds,” Stewart-Brown said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The company is also conducting experiments with numerous slower-growing breeds. It’s not going as far or fast as animal advocates want to see the company go, but it’s more than what Perdue’s competitors have done.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many chicks also die in the beginning of their lives at hatcheries, where they can be roughly handled, culled due to injuries or deformities, or injured on the mechanical processing line. Many also die in transport from the hatchery to the farm, in which their fragile bodies are packed tightly into crates and don’t receive food or water for 24 to 72 hours.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-04-at-5.36.18%E2%80%AFPM.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.182903187519,100,93.634193624962" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Chicks packed into crates. | Animal Equality" data-portal-copyright="Animal Equality" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s a growing push in Europe for <a href="https://www.innovateanimalag.org/on-farm-hatching-overview">on-farm hatching</a>, which has shown to reduce mortality and the need for early-stage antibiotics.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Poultry production is the least regulated part of the meat industry, which isn’t saying much, considering beef and pork production have also been <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/31/23852325/farming-myths-agricultural-exceptionalism-pollution-labor-animal-welfare-laws">thoroughly deregulated</a>. But chickens have no federal laws protecting them at the hatchery, the farm, or the slaughterhouse. Setting meaningful regulations for animal welfare, farm hygiene, and antibiotics would go a long way toward reducing animal suffering and mortality on poultry farms.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Absent that, the industry is left to engage in a never-ending game of optimization whack-a-mole, in which public health and animal welfare are almost always sacrificed on the altar of endless chicken wings and cheap meat.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The planet is about <a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/climate-indicators/temperature">1.3 degrees Celsius</a> warmer today than it was in the late 1800s. That seemingly small increase has impacted the natural world in some pretty profound ways. <a href="https://www.vox.com/22558979/animals-birds-shrinking-size-heat-climate-change#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20when%20scientists%20examined,also%20got%20smaller%2C%20on%20average.">Birds have become smaller</a>. Lizards, insects, and <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-change-is-altering-animals-colors/#:~:text=As%20our%20planet%20warms%20up,to%20blue%20individuals%20is%20increasing">snails have changed color</a>. Some <a href="https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/2024/1/17/24039907/climate-change-nocturnal-animals-ibex">goats have become more nocturnal</a>. These are adaptations that help animals survive climate change.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many species, though, haven’t been able to adapt fast enough. Rising temperatures have not only eroded animal populations, such as by stoking wildlife-killing wildfires in Australia and the Amazon, but they have also driven entire species to extinction. Several years ago, an <a href="https://australian.museum/learn/australia-over-time/extinct-animals/melomys-rubicola/">Australian rodent called Bramble Cay melomys</a> went extinct, largely due to sea level rise. Warming temperatures <a href="https://kauaiforestbirds.org/four-kaua%CA%BBi-forest-birds-slated-for-extinction/">spread disease-ridden mosquitos into higher elevations in Hawaii</a>, killing every last individual of certain bird species.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s the situation today. It’s already bleak. So what happens to wildlife populations if — or more like when — Earth gets even hotter?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That urgent question is at the center of a new <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp4461">study</a>, published in the journal <em>Science.</em> The research analyzes how different degrees of warming, relative to the pre-industrial-era average, affect the portion of species globally that are at risk of going extinct. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The numbers reported in the study are alarming, but they also underscore an important message: If countries can rein in their greenhouse gas emissions, they stand to save thousands of species from meeting their permanent end.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Current climate policies put half a million species at risk of extinction</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This new study is a meta-analysis, meaning it synthesized the results of other existing studies — 485 of them, to be precise. It estimates the percentage of known plant and animal species globally that are projected to become extinct under different climate scenarios in the future. Those scenarios include the current level of warming and targets under the Paris Agreement, a global UN agreement to curb climate change, as well as more extreme emissions scenarios.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>1.3 degrees</strong> (current warming):<strong> 1.6 percent</strong> of species</li>



<li><strong>1.5 degrees</strong> (aspirational Paris Agreement target):<strong> 1.8 percent </strong>of species</li>



<li><strong>2 degrees</strong> (official Paris agreement target):<strong> 2.7 percent</strong> of species</li>



<li><strong>2.7 degrees</strong> (where current policies and pledges get us): <strong>5 percent </strong>of species</li>



<li><strong>4.3 degrees</strong> (higher emissions scenario):<strong> 14.9 percent</strong> of species</li>



<li><strong>5.4 degrees</strong> (a worst-case warming scenario): <strong>29.7 percent</strong> of species</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Scientists still don’t have a firm grasp of how many species there are on Earth, so it’s hard to translate these percentages into actual numbers of extinct animals. Scientists now think there are <a href="https://naturalhistory.si.edu/education/teaching-resources/life-science/what-biodiversity">10 million species</a> or more, according to ecologist Mark Urban, the study’s sole author. That would put projected losses under current warming at around 160,000 species, rising to half a million should the world fail to enact additional policies to curb carbon emissions. That is a lot. We are talking about potentially losing half a million species to extinction from climate change.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There&#8217;s this acceleration of extinction risk with each increment of temperature rise,” said Urban, director of the Center of Biological Risk at the University of Connecticut, told Vox.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To be clear, Urban is reporting extinction risk. This is different from extinction certainty. He compares a species at risk of extinction to a jug of water with a crack in it: “We know the water is pouring out,” he said. “What we don&#8217;t know, however, is how big the crack is. So we don&#8217;t know how long it&#8217;ll take [for the water to run out].” Meaning, for the species to go extinct.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The study also has some important limitations. Models like this are only as good as the data that feeds into them, said Chrystal Mantyka-Pringle, a researcher at Wildlife Conservation Society Canada who was not a part of the study. And research tends to be biased toward certain types of animals and areas that are easier (and cheaper) to study, such as forests in the US or Europe and not, say, the Arctic. Yet the study is sound, according to Mantyka-Pringle and Ilya Maclean, a conservation ecologist at the University of Exeter, who was also unaffiliated with this research. “It’s a pulse check on where we are,” Mantyka-Pringle told Vox.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Frogs and animals on mountains and islands are most at risk</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The paper also explored which animals and habitats are most and least at risk from warming. Birds, for example, face a lower risk of extinction, Urban found, likely because they can easily move around. As the ideal habitat for avian species shifts toward the poles or up mountains, birds will try to shift with it. That said, warming still poses a serious problem to many avian species, and <a href="https://www.audubon.org/news/new-audubon-science-two-thirds-north-american-birds-risk-extinction-due-climate">other research</a> suggests birds face a high extinction risk in North America.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the flip side, organisms that can’t easily move, such as plants or those that are highly dependent on water, will be more at risk, Urban says. Indeed, Urban’s analysis found that amphibians, including frogs, are most sensitive to a warming climate. Climate change can intensify droughts, and frogs need water. Hotter temperatures may also contribute to the toll of chytrid fungus, a deadly pathogen that has wiped out dozens of frog species. What’s more is that amphibians don’t typically travel very far, so it’s harder for them to simply shift their habitat.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As for different habitats, mountains, islands, and freshwater ecosystems appear most sensitive to climate change, according to the analysis. Again, this isn’t shocking. Animals that live on mountains can move to higher elevations as temperatures warm, but they’ll eventually reach the top and literally just run out of room. That’s led <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1804224115?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed">some scientists</a> to describe climate change as an “escalator to extinction” for mountain species.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Islands face similar space issues, and they tend to be home to species with smaller populations to begin with. Plus, they already contend with other threats such as invasive species, which warming can make worse. This point is key: Climate change is just one threat, but it often intensifies other ones, such as droughts tied to deforestation or the spread of wildlife disease.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Are these numbers really that bad? </h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Barring the worst-case scenarios for greenhouse emissions, the study projects that a relatively small portion of species will go extinct from climate change — a single-digit percentage. Is that really a problem?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That is the widely held answer from ecologists, at least. Even a small percentage translates to tens of thousands of species, each of which has value for human society, whether or not we have figured it out. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A single animal species may be crucial to a community’s culture, such as the <a href="https://www.hcn.org/issues/56-12/after-the-klamath-river-dams-came-down-salmon-came-back/">Chinook salmon</a>, which is considered sacred by some Indigenous tribes in the American West. And we already know that the natural world holds the cure for many life-threatening diseases. Researchers estimate that an astonishing <a href="https://pharmaceutical-journal.com/article/research/pharmaceuticals-from-marine-sources-past-present-and-future">70 percent</a> of antibiotics and cancer treatments in use today are rooted in natural organisms.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Most humans love nature, and that&#8217;s one aspect of it, but biodiversity is also the foundation of our health and our wealth and our cultures,” Urban said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Allowing even one species to go extinct is like playing Russian roulette, he said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We don’t know what we’re losing,” Urban said. “But when you really lose a species, that is truly irreversible. That&#8217;s the end.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This year’s Spotify Wrapped came with an odd surprise. The app’s annual roundup featured more than just the usual candy-colored data about which artists, songs, and podcasts users streamed the most. It included a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/spotify-wrapped-ai-artificial-intelligence-b2658667.html">“Wrapped AI podcast”</a> feature, using Google’s NotebookLM technology to verbally recap users’ listening habits. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This bizarre addition is more than just an audio companion for the information presented in Wrapped. Two NPR-inflected, artificial-intelligence voices go through your listening highlights in a conversational (albeit still robotic) manner while elaborating on your “moods,” “vibes,” and interests throughout the year. It feels both like listening to a doctor go through your bloodwork results and a psychic vaguely supposing facts about your life. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For example, my “hosts” suggested that I was embracing a “bolder” vibe during the month of September based on the movie soundtracks I was consuming. “The <em>Challengers</em> soundtrack and Ludwig Göransson’s work on <em>Oppenheimer</em> makes me wonder if you were watching some intense movies during this time,” one of my “hosts” speculated. This wasn’t totally untrue. But I also wasn’t sure why I needed to be told this information about myself. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The purpose of this new feature isn’t exactly clear. The podcast element feels even less inspired than some of the other strange personalization features the music streamer has launched in the past, from an AI DJ who greets users by their name, to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/spotify-wrapped-sound-towns-reactions-burlington-vermont-rcna127257">“sound towns”</a> the listener supposedly lives in, to this year’s incoherent labels representing different moods (like whatever “Pink Pilates Princess Vogue Pop” is). These features are presented as attempts to connect with users on an intimate level, but they’ve largely proven to be <a href="https://www.marketingbrew.com/stories/2024/03/19/after-the-success-of-wrapped-spotify-is-personalizing-music-with-daylists">great marketing strategies</a> in all their absurdity.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The goal of Wrapped, in particular, is brand virality,” says Glenn McDonald, former data alchemist at Spotify. “There’s not much in the way this year of data storytelling.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Overall, the Spotify listening experience has never felt more alien.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Spotify’s personalization features are getting weird&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The app, which launched in 2008, has long been appreciated — and bemoaned — for its user-specific, algorithmically generated playlists and myriad compilations designed for any mood, task, and time of the day. However, its newer personalization features, with an emphasis on AI technology, have gotten a little out of hand. While its technology is designed to understand users’ tastes, it is exactly that understanding that keeps users in a repetitive comfort zone of songs, artists, and genres forever.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2023, the app rolled out an AI-powered DJ service called <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24290914/spotify-ai-dj-radio-kexp">“DJ X,”</a> currently available as “DJ: Wrapped.” Using an assortment of users’ most played songs and forgotten favorites, the feature imitates the FM radio experience — only without the crucial element of discovery and a human guide. The AI DJ — who uses the replicated voice of Spotify’s Head of Cultural Partnerships, Xavier “X” Jernigan — offers a vague preamble in between songs: either basic facts about the artists or what mood they think the next song will evoke. It feels more like an attempt at a guided relaxation ritual than an adventurous listening experience. (Of course, users also have the option to skip songs.)</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/GettyImages-2188238430.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="A crowd of people in a large, high-ceilinged room look up at a giant projected screen of Spotify Wrapped images." title="A crowd of people in a large, high-ceilinged room look up at a giant projected screen of Spotify Wrapped images." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Spotify’s 2024 Wrapped takeover at London’s Outernet on December 4, 2024." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Another AI-powered tool Spotify introduced earlier this year is called “AI Playlist.” Users can either enter a description of the type of playlist they want to listen to or select a prompt, and generative AI will whip it right up. While you can request any kind of mix you want, the prompts seems to encourage listening to music the user is already familiar with. For example, the page currently suggests users try asking the tool to “put [their] top Wrapped songs in order of release date” or “give [them] a playlist of the genre [they] listened to the most.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of these features have gotten a lot more gimmicky. As a result, they’ve become <a href="https://www.marketingbrew.com/stories/2024/03/19/after-the-success-of-wrapped-spotify-is-personalizing-music-with-daylists">effective marketing tools</a>. Back in February, the app launched the trippy, cosmic-themed tool <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-02-29/spotifys-song-psychic-is-ready-to-answer-your-burning-questions/">“Song Psychic,”</a> which mimics a Magic 8 ball. Users select pre-written questions about their future and are given a (familiar) song in return. More widely known is the feature <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-09-12/ever-changing-playlist-daylist-music-for-all-day/">“Daylist,”</a> which quickly spread across social media when it arrived earlier this year. The “hyper-personalized” playlist changes throughout the day to supposedly reflect the user’s mood, based on their listening habits during certain times of the day. It’s largely garnered attention for its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/style/ai-spotify-music-playlist-algorithm.html">AI-generated playlist titles</a> that look like word salad (“rage people pleaser wednesday evening,” for example). </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s unclear whether the “AI podcast” will be a mainstay of Spotify Wrapped or if Google NotebookLM will be integrated further into the app. The &#8220;research assistant” allows users to receive summaries and additional information of documents using Google’s Gemini chatbot. However, its function, as far as the podcast goes, seems a bit redundant for the user. It’s mainly proof of how well Google NotebookLM can perform rather than something that enhances user experience in a substantial way.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Are all these AI tools just making us self-absorbed?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These features don’t just demonstrate how well Spotify knows you, but how predictable your behavior on the app is. These inventions can be fun to play around with. Sometimes, they’re exactly what users need at the moment. But to what end do streaming services need to keep reinforcing and catering to our own moods and preferences?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">McDonald, who now runs the music directory <a href="https://everynoise.com/">Every Noise At Once</a>, says it’s a normal inclination for users to want to listen to music they already like. “There certainly are retention metrics that say that, unsurprisingly, people like listening to the things that they like,” he says. “But unless you really try actual adventurous experiments on what people might react to, you really don&#8217;t know.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During his decade of working at Spotify, McDonald says the streaming service has never focused on what “it takes to get people curious.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/Screen-Shot-2024-12-05-at-12.18.57-PM.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.891591024092,100,92.216817951816" alt="Billboard of Spotify’s AI-powered “Daylist” feature in New York City." title="Billboard of Spotify’s AI-powered “Daylist” feature in New York City." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Billboard of Spotify’s “Daylist” feature in New York City. | Spotify" data-portal-copyright="Spotify" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">While Spotify has a popular Discover Weekly playlist that features new songs and artists based around users’ tastes, there are less easily discoverable features designed for exploration on the app’s interface. Compare that to playlists the app offers prominently, like Your Time Capsule, On Repeat, and Repeat Rewind, all bringing users back to their listening comfort zone.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of these efforts to know listeners ignore music as an interactive art form. These Spotify features suggest that music is entirely about your own pleasure and ease and not something that’s meant to be engaged with, sought out, and even criticized. The user-focused promotion of AI doubles down on these habits. Listeners are supposed to be delighted that a robot knows every little thing about them, while never challenging them to expand or change. All in all, these AI-powered features promote a narcissistic and, frankly, dull approach to art. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The argument for streaming services is that all the world&#8217;s music is now accessible to you,” says McDonald. “But if all you do is listen to what you already know, it&#8217;s like giving someone a teleporter and they only use it to teleport back home.” </p>

	<figcaption>Anti-government fighters brandish their guns as they ride a vehicle in Syria’s northern city of Aleppo on November 30, 2024.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The war in Syria was supposed to be over.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Over</em>, of course, didn’t mean <em>peace</em>: During the past few months, the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and its Russian backers have <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/7/relentless-bombing-and-constant-death-a-bleak-start-to-2024-for-syria">launched periodic airstrikes</a> on rebel-held areas in the country’s northeast; the US and its Kurdish allies have <a href="https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/PRESS-RELEASES/Press-Release-View/Article/3951025/us-central-command-conducts-airstrikes-against-several-isis-camps-in-syria/">continued to wage an ongoing campaign</a> of airstrikes and special forces operations targeting the remnants of the militant group ISIS; while Israel has continually — particularly since the October 7, 2023, attacks — <a href="https://www.vox.com/israel/378404/gaza-israel-hamas-hezbollah-sinwar-netanyahu-united-nations">struck Hezbollah and targets linked to Iran</a>, both of which are Assad allies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But with <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/388407/ceasefire-lebanon-israel-hezbollah-biden-netanyahu-us" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/388407/ceasefire-lebanon-israel-hezbollah-biden-netanyahu-us">unprecedented conflicts erupting elsewhere in the Middle East,</a> the war in Syria, which has been fought since 2011 and may have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/syrian-observatory-says-war-has-killed-more-than-half-a-million-idUSKCN1GO13M/">resulted in the deaths</a> of more than half a million people and displaced millions more, had become an afterthought.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The front lines were fixed: Sunni militant groups controlled the country’s northeast, US-backed Syrian Kurds dominated the Northwest, and Assad held the rest, including his capital, Damascus. Regional governments like the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia that had spent years backing a revolution to overthrow Assad, <a href="https://authory.com/app/content/aac980a0a94fd4cb088ac55c457c93166">had begun to welcome</a> him — with tacit US support — back to regional summits and gatherings. To the degree Syria was still considered a security threat outside its borders, it was at the nexus of a <a href="https://authory.com/app/content/abc4b4a76d1a04d86adadffe5f34fb04e">flourishing regional drug trade</a> — promoted and facilitated by the regime. The active phase of the war, in which territory regularly changed hands and Assad’s regime faced a serious threat from foreign-backed rebels, seemed to be over.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All that changed last week when a coalition of rebel groups swept into the city of Aleppo, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/12/01/syria-rebels-assad-aleppo-hama/">rapidly pushing back government forces</a> and taking control of most of the city. Aleppo, which had been Syria’s largest city before the war, fell to the rebels in the early days of the uprising, and Assad spent roughly four years fighting to take it back, annihilating much of it in the process. Now, he has lost it again in the span of about four days.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While international governments called on all sides to “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/12/01/syria-rebels-assad-aleppo-hama/">deescalate</a>,” the rebel coalition took control of much of the city, as well as <a href="https://x.com/Charles_Lister/status/1863985683519406132">more than 200 surrounding towns</a>. On Thursday, they took over the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/world/middleeast/syria-rebel-offensive-hama.html">strategically located city of Hama</a>, continuing the push south toward Damascus. Rebels <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/1262217175052190">have freed inmates</a> from the regime’s jails, where many political prisoners had been held, some for years. In response, Syrian and Russian jets <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/syrias-president-vows-to-defeat-terrorists-as-us-calls-for-de-escalation-13264340">have launched airstrikes</a> on the city, including some that hit hospitals.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vox spoke by phone on Monday with Abdulkafi Alhamdo, an English teacher and opposition activist from Aleppo who gained an <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-38299172">international following</a> for his video reports, posted on social media, in the early days of the Syrian civil war. Alhamdo had been living in rebel-held Idlib for the past eight years, after fleeing Aleppo when it was taken by the Assad regime. He returned to his hometown for the first time over the weekend, reuniting with family members, some of whom he hadn’t seen since the war began 13 years ago.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Eight years I waited, dreaming every day to go back,” Alhamdo told Vox by phone from Syria. “The whole whole world said that we were over, that the season of revolution is over, that we had no chance. But we made it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though the rebels had reportedly been planning their operations for months, it took Washington and other Western capitals by surprise. “It goes to show that sometimes there&#8217;s a tendency in Washington for people to sit there and say, ‘Oh, well, you know, the conflict is frozen. We don&#8217;t worry about it anymore,’” said Brian Carter, an analyst who tracks militant groups in the Middle East for the American Enterprise Institute’s Critical Threats project. “This offensive shows how flawed that sort of thinking is. It’s going to have big impacts for the region and for US policy.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The second fall of Aleppo is also a warning that the conflicts proliferating around the world should not be considered in isolation. Syria had become overlooked because of the much more active wars in Ukraine, the Palestinian territories, and Lebanon, all of which heavily engaged international attention and energy, from high-level arms shipments to global street protests. But the effects of those wars likely provided an opening for the rebels’ stunning advance, and constrained Assad’s ability to respond to it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And in turn, the latest revival of the Syrian civil war is likely to have reverberations that will be felt far beyond the country’s borders. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Will the Syrian regime hold on?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The conflict began in 2011 as an outgrowth of the regional Arab Spring movement, with protests against the Assad regime that quickly mutated into an insurgency after the regime’s brutal crackdown.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Randa Slim, a fellow at Johns Hopkins University’s Foreign Policy Institute who has participated in backchannel negotiations on Syria, told Vox the rapid pace of the offensive reminds her of the momentum the rebels had in the early days of the war in 2012 and 2013. “The opposition was winning, winning, winning, winning, and we were saying, ‘Oh my God, they&#8217;re going to get to Damascus soon,’” Slim said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The tide started to turn in 2013 when the rebels were defeated in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_of_al-Qusayr">battle at the town of al-Qusayr</a> by Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese militia, which had entered the war the previous year on Assad’s side.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/gettyimages-2186933614.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="A billboard bearing a picture of Syria&#039;s President Bashar al-Assad" title="A billboard bearing a picture of Syria&#039;s President Bashar al-Assad" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A billboard bearing a picture of Syria&#039;s President Bashar al-Assad and a national flag are torn by anti-government fighters in Aleppo on November 30, 2024." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, however, Hezbollah is reeling after more than a year of war with Israel that has resulted in the targeted deaths of much of its <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/372772/hezbollah-israel-pagers-radios-lebanon">senior leadership</a>, including <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/10/28/23935157/hezbollah-lebanon-israel-hamas-palestine-gaza-iran-militia-group">longtime head Hassan Nasrallah</a>. “Hezbollah has been dealt a devastating blow in Lebanon, and they have seen many of their fighters leave Syria,” Slim said. Hezbollah has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/12/04/iran-syria-hezbollah-iraq-militias-assad/">vowed to join</a> the fight to help Assad’s forces retake the lost territory, but it’s unclear how much of an impact they will be able to make. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Assad’s other most vital ally has been Russia. It was Russian airpower that <a href="https://authory.com/JoshuaKeating/What-the-horrors-of-Syria-and-Chechnya-can-tell-us-about-Russias-tactics-in-Ukraine-adaf94e4b9c6948b6a8efbec463c67047">reduced Aleppo to rubble</a> and allowed the regime to retake the city in 2016, another crucial turning point in the war. But Russia has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/19/world/middleeast/russia-syria-israel-ukraine.html">moved much of its military hardware and personnel</a> out of Syria since the start of the war in Ukraine in 2022. As this week’s bombardment shows, the Russians aren’t gone entirely, but President Vladimir Putin may be less willing, this time around, to devote significant resources to bailing out Assad at a time when the Ukraine conflict is at a critical juncture.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mouaz Moustafa, executive director for the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a US-based lobbying group backing and coordinating with the Syrian opposition, told reporters in Washington this week, “I believe that the war in Ukraine and the war in Syria is the same war for the same aims against the same authoritarians, and so I know that I many Syrians are grateful for the brave Ukrainians that have been fighting against the Russians, which gave us the breathing space of not having a full Russian air force in Syria.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The international context is vital to understanding how the Syrian military’s defenses collapsed so quickly, Robert Ford, former US ambassador to Syria, told Vox. “The key thing to know is that the Syrian government has long depended on the Russians and the Iranians to provide hard fighting power because the Syrian army itself is really hollowed out after so many years of fighting and defections and corruption,” Ford said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Assad may not be totally helpless, however. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iraqi-militias-enter-syria-reinforce-government-forces-military-sources-say-2024-12-02/">Hundreds of fighters</a> from Iran-backed militias in Iraq have reportedly crossed the border to fight the rebels in recent days.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Syria is a large country in a strategic location on the sea, between Turkey and Israel, and Iran views it as vital for its regional ambitions. “Do not underestimate the will of the Iranians to throw the kitchen sink at this going forward in order to keep Assad in power,” Slim said.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who are the rebels?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You might think that a major strategic defeat for Iranian and Russian proxies would be enthusiastically cheered by Washington. Instead, the administration has been treating the rebel offensive cautiously, mainly because of who makes up the rebels. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The United States has nothing to do with this offensive, which is led by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a designated terrorist organization,” National Security Council spokesperson <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/11/30/statement-by-nsc-spokesperson-sean-savett-on-syria/">Sean Savett said in a statement</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">HTS, which is indeed the main rebel group involved in the offensive, was, under its former name, Jabhat al-Nusra, an affiliate of al-Qaeda. The group’s leader, Muhammad al-Jolani, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/who-is-syrian-rebel-leader-hts-jawlani-9b157eff">spent five years in an American prison</a> in Iraq for taking part in that country’s anti-US insurgency and has a <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/washingtondc/news/press-releases/up-to-10-million-reward-offered-for-information-on-the-leader-of-the-al-nusrah-front">$10 million price on his head from the FBI</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But supporters of the Syrian opposition say the situation is more complicated than that. The group formally broke with al-Qaeda in 2016, when it changed its name to HTS. It is opposed to both ISIS and <a href="https://www.dni.gov/nctc/ftos/hurras_fto.html">al-Qaeda’s remaining Syrian affiliate</a>. HTS still adheres to and promotes an austere and strict Islamist ideology, but observers say religious minorities, including Christians, have been permitted to exercise their religion in the areas of Idlib they control.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/gettyimages-2187028037.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.687031085813,100,78.625937828374" alt="Armed groups in Aleppo&#039;s city center in Syria" title="Armed groups in Aleppo&#039;s city center in Syria" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Armed groups opposing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad&#039;s regime seized control of much of Aleppo&#039;s city center in Syria on November 30, 2024." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Since taking Aleppo, HTS has “said all the right things,” said Ford, noting that Christian services were held on Sunday. The group has published a statement proclaiming “<a href="https://x.com/azelin/status/1863565507481264597">diversity is our strength</a>” and calling for solidarity with Aleppo’s Kurdish population.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Alhamdo, the activist from Aleppo, told Vox he was not a supporter of HTS’s ideology, but gave them credit for their tactical leadership on the battlefield and felt that “they are developing their mentality.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ford, who spearheaded the move to designate the group — under its former name — as a terrorist organization when he served in the Obama administration, told Vox he “would be hard-pressed now, in 2024, to legally justify a listing” for the group in its current incarnation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, not everyone is likely to buy the group’s rebranding effort. That includes the Biden administration as well as regional governments, like the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, which used to staunchly back the Syrian opposition, but are fearful of the overtly Islamist turn some opposition groups have taken. These are the governments that have also been reaching out to try to normalize relations with Assad.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“For the UAE especially, HTS is Islamist. It is the Muslim Brotherhood. It is evil incarnate, no matter how many permutations it has undertaken,” Slim said. “This group was al-Qaeda, and it’s going to take a lot of change to convince the US, or the Saudis, or the Egyptians that it really has changed.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How do the Kurds fit in?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another group involved in the rebel coalition is the Syrian National Army (SNA), which despite its name is a Turkish-backed proxy militia. Turkey has a more wary relationship with HTS, but reportedly gave the green light to the SNA’s involvement in the operation due to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b62e834d-e8fe-45a7-be18-3221b3d05515">Assad’s unwillingness to engage in talks</a> earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Turkey’s bigger concern, though, is the Kurdish-dominated statelet that has emerged in Syria’s northeast. The Syrian Kurdish forces, known as the SDF, have been America’s primary allies in the ongoing campaign against ISIS, but Turkey views them as a branch of the PKK, the Turkey-based Kurdish militant group that has fought a decades-long insurgency against the Turkish government. The Turkish military and its proxy forces have launched several incursions over the border into Syria to push the Kurdish forces back.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The SDF also controlled some pockets of territory in and around Aleppo but has withdrawn from these as the rebels have advanced. Sinam Mohamad, the representative in Washington for the Syrian Democratic Council — as the predominantly Kurdish government in northeast Syria is known — said she believes Turkey is “planning to occupy some Syrian lands in order to destroy the autonomous administration of northeast Syria.” Despite the HTS’s assurances that Kurds have nothing to fear from Aleppo’s new rulers, she told Vox the group is a “terrorist organization” and that “we are really afraid about the minorities, especially the Kurdish people, in Aleppo city.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Will this be Trump’s first foreign crisis?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mustafa, the Syrian American activist, argues that the US ought to see the events of the past week as a victory for its interests. “What&#8217;s actually happening on the ground is that Syrians are finding our enemies,” he said. He expressed frustration with the Biden administration’s calls on all sides to deescalate the situation. “It makes no sense for me,” he said. “They should ‘deescalate,’ what, the liberation of towns from the Iranians, the Russians and the Assad regime?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Syria has not been a major priority for the Biden administration, as it was for the Obama and Trump teams, and despite national security adviser Jake Sullivan’s pledge on Sunday that the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-december-1-2024-n1311152">US would “stay deeply engaged”</a> in the crisis, it’s unlikely this White House will make any major moves on the issue in its remaining month and a half in office. (The <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/us-strike-hits-weapons-in-eastern-syria-pentagon-83972902">US did launch a strike against Iran-backed militia groups in Syria</a> on Tuesday, though such attacks have taken place repeatedly this year.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What about the next administration? During his first term, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/13/us/politics/mark-esper-syria-kurds-turkey.html">Trump attempted</a> — but was eventually dissuaded by his advisers — to withdraw the remaining US troops from Syria. (About 900 American military personnel are still in the country as part of the ongoing counter-ISIS mission, operating from Kurdish-held territory in the northeast and from a base near the Jordanian border in the south.) Trump’s selection of former US Rep. Tulsi Gabbard as his director of national intelligence — she’s known for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/26/tulsi-gabbard-bashar-al-assad-syria-democrats">meeting with Assad in 2017</a> and has <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/tulsi-gabbard-claims-met-syrian-president-bashar-al/story?id=45050615">described</a> the entire Syrian opposition as “terrorists” — does not indicate much sympathy for the rebels.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the other hand, Trump and his team are also known for their extremely hawkish views on Iran, a close ally of Assad. Mustafa said he had met with Richard Grenell, a former acting director of national intelligence and an influential Trump adviser, to discuss the situation, and <a href="https://x.com/RichardGrenell/status/1863676856832020978">Grenell’s recent posts on X</a> indicate at least some sympathy to their position.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But as always with Trump and foreign policy, the actual policies he pursues in office are <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/386680/trump-foreign-policy-rubio-hegseth-waltz-gabbard">difficult to predict</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What happens next?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite the Syrian regime’s recent setbacks, Ford told Vox, “I strongly doubt that Damascus, 2024, is going to be Kabul, 2021,” referring to the Afghan capital’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/8/15/22626082/kabul-capital-fall-afghanistan-government-taliban-forces-explained">rapid fall to the Taliban</a> after the withdrawal of US troops. “I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re going to see the HTS militants rampaging through the president&#8217;s office,” Ford said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For one thing, the rebel forces may simply not be large enough. For another, Iran and Russia — even in their diminished capacity — are unlikely to completely abandon a regime they see as strategically vital.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But even if the rebel offensive does not get much farther than the area it currently controls, its rapid success demonstrates a couple of important lessons. One, the war in Syria is not over. Many of the fighters who entered Aleppo this week were young children when the uprising against Assad began more than a decade ago, and there could well be years more fighting to come.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Second, it’s a mistake to consider conflicts like Syria in isolation. The Syrian conflict is often called a “civil war,” which generally means a war fought by factions existing within one country. But at the conflict’s height, it drew in countries from around the region, as well as the United States and Russia, presaging similar lines of conflict in Ukraine. Through the <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2014/01/the-rise-of-isis.html">rise of ISIS</a>, the <a href="https://www.unrefugees.org/news/syria-refugee-crisis-explained/">massive global refugee crisis</a>, and the <a href="https://authory.com/app/content/abc4b4a76d1a04d86adadffe5f34fb04e">spread of illegal drugs</a>, it has had truly global ripple effects. Like a feedback loop, events abroad — particularly in Lebanon and Ukraine — are now helping drive events on the ground in Syria.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The latest offensive will have its own ripple effects. Optimistically, it could allow for refugees from Aleppo living abroad and elsewhere in Syria to return home, and weaken or even topple a truly odious regime, one that has <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/emerging-trends-chemical-weapons-usage-middle-east">used chemical weapons on its own people</a> and is believed to have <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-35806229">killed tens of thousands of civilians</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pessimistically, it could lead to more chaos and displacement. HTS may yet go back to its former jihadist ways, the <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/syria-war-death-toll-over-507-000-13-years-on-32a62fe9">horrific levels of violence</a> we saw years ago could return, more regional actors could be drawn in, and jihadist groups like ISIS could take advantage of the chaos to reconstitute themselves.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The world may have thought it was done with Syria. But Syrians themselves are not done, and the world has no choice but to pay attention again.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s late, and someone in your house has a headache, a stuffy nose, or — oh no, was that the sound of retching? You rifle through your home’s jumble of medications, quietly pumping your fist in the air when that bottle of Tylenol or Pepto-Bismol finds your hand.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s only then that you notice the expiration date: It was last month, last year, last decade. You realize you don’t know what that actually means — whether the drug you’re holding is dangerous or merely ineffective, and whether you’d cause more harm by using it or withholding it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What now?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For many, medicine expiration dates are a source of fear and doubt. Whether it’s an over-the-counter fever reducer or a critical prescription heart medication, knowing how to evaluate the risk of taking it — or not taking it — can save you a lot of worry. Here’s what you need to know about how medications age.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Expiration dates are somewhat arbitrary</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US Food and Drug Administration only began requiring drug manufacturers to put an expiration date on medications in <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/special-features/dont-be-tempted-use-expired-medicines">1979</a>. However, they didn’t tell companies how to come up with those dates. Most companies didn’t opt to do the expensive work of methodically testing each drug during development to determine the exact age at which it began degrading. Instead, most simply chose dates a few years out, tested the drug’s potency at that time, and if it was still as good as new, called that the expiration date.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That is to say, drug expiration dates aren’t “bad after” dates as much as they are “good before” dates.&nbsp;For most drugs, these dates are set to about three years after the day they’re produced, says <a href="https://emergencymed.ucsd.edu/divisions/medical-toxicology/index.html">Lee Cantrell</a>, a pharmacist and toxicologist who also directs operations at the San Diego division of the California Poison Control System.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, many drugs retain much of their potency for a lot longer than three years. In 2012, Cantrell and several of his colleagues tested a range of drugs (including acetaminophen, the sedative phenobarbital, and the opioid hydrocodone) that were decades past their expiration dates, and found that <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1377417">86 percent of them still had the intended concentrations</a> of their active ingredients. A few years later, a group of German researchers conducted a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30912309/">similar study</a> with similar results.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the German researchers, <a href="https://www.pharmazie.uni-wuerzburg.de/das-institut/prof-holzgrabe/">Ulrike Holzgrabe</a>, a pharmaceutical chemist at the University of Würzburg, told me these findings suggest drug companies should be determining expiration dates more rigorously. “After the licensing of a drug, the companies should store the drugs for another 10 years” and analyze them annually for stability, she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s an obvious disincentive for manufacturers here, Cantrell says: Proving that certain products have much longer shelf lives than we assume would mean less frequent re-upping, which would decrease sales. Some manufacturers may actually have done studies proving their products last well beyond their expiration dates — but “there’s no way they’d ever release that data — it’s just not in their interest,” Cantrell says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Replacing drugs that are still effective is wasteful and expensive. In an effort to make better use of their drug supplies, federal agencies that stockpile drugs — like the military or the Department of Veterans Affairs — <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-myth-of-drug-expiration-dates">asked the FDA</a> to extend the official shelf life of several drugs in the 1980s. The agency developed the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/EmergencyPreparedness/Counterterrorism/MedicalCountermeasures/MCMLegalRegulatoryandPolicyFramework/ucm411446.htm">Shelf-Life Extension Program</a> to do exactly that by batch-testing key medications on the brink of expiring.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, these extensions happen only on a <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-myth-of-drug-expiration-dates">case-by-case basis</a> — and only for pharmacies run by government institutions. Although expiration dates don’t accurately represent the true lifetime of a drug, the system we have right now doesn’t account for that.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Drugs change with age, but not in the way you might fear</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Part of the problem with medication expiration dates is that it’s hard to tell with the naked eye whether most drugs are past their prime. “A drug is not a yogurt or a piece of meat or a strawberry,” Holzgrabe says. Experts nevertheless have a sense of the kinds of invisible changes drugs are likely and unlikely to undergo after a certain period. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For starters, pharmaceuticals don’t typically turn into poison as they age. “I&#8217;m not aware of any medications that become toxic once they pass their expiration date,” Cantrell says. That means you typically don’t have to worry that an expired drug will make you sick. However, because some drugs do lose potency over time, expired drugs may do some harm by not working the way you expect them to.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>It’s hard to tell with the naked eye whether most drugs are past their prime. “A drug is not a yogurt or a piece of meat or a strawberry.”</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With time, there may also be changes to the integrity of some drugs’ inactive ingredients. These are the medication additives that get drugs’ active ingredients where they need to go or make them palatable for the consumer. For example, a skin cream used for eczema might separate or change in texture over time, or a suppository containing fever medicine might melt. Conversely, liquid formulations can slowly condense as the water and alcohols in them evaporate. This means a shot from that older bottle of NyQuil could theoretically be stronger than it’s supposed to be.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sometimes, time can render a drug’s delivery system ineffective, making it impossible for you to access the actual medication inside it. This is the same concept that results in an old can of hairspray being unusable even if there’s still plenty of product left inside: Medications that rely on propellants — like itch-control sprays or the albuterol rescue inhalers people use to control asthma symptoms — often become useless when their containers are too old.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not just the years that change our medications’ potency: The way they’re stored can also have an impact. Exposure to sunlight, heat, and moisture all degrade drugs more quickly. These exposures can also facilitate microbial overgrowth, even in unexpired medications. Although this risk is more related to unsafe drug storage than it is to a drug’s age, it’s one worth being aware of. That’s especially true for medications that are intended to be sterile, like <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/buying-using-medicine-safely/what-you-should-know-about-eye-drops#:~:text=Any%20drug%20used%20in%20the,products%20in%20multi%2Ddose%20containers.">eyedrops</a>, as contamination can lead to permanent eye damage in people who use these products.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>How to manage household medications to minimize worry</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To keep drugs from losing potency before their time and reduce the likelihood they’ll be overrun with germs, Holzgrabe recommends storing them in the bedroom — not in the bathroom or in the kitchen, where they’re more likely to encounter heat and humidity.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The safest approach is to keep only unexpired drugs in your household — especially when it comes to critical, life-saving medications like antibiotics, blood thinners, EpiPens, asthma rescue inhalers, insulin, and the like. The FDA recommends consumers regularly take stock of what they have on hand and <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/special-features/dont-be-tempted-use-expired-medicines">toss expired medications</a>. The agency also provides recommendations for <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/safe-disposal-medicines/disposal-unused-medicines-what-you-should-know">how to safely dispose</a> of different types of drugs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, if you find yourself in an emergency situation where you only have an expired version of a life-saving medication and you can’t immediately get a fresh supply, use the medication you have — so long as it doesn’t delay getting the sick person emergency care. “If someone called me and asked me and said, ‘This is all I got and I&#8217;m having trouble breathing and all,’ I&#8217;d say, ‘Use it,’” Cantrell says. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The truth is, experts say they do often use expired over-the-counter medications in nonemergency situations at home — if they have a kid with a cold, for instance. However, it’s not something they can recommend to others; there simply needs to be more rigorous testing of medications before they can give that kind of broadly applicable advice. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although drugs may have longer shelf lives than their packaging says, it shouldn’t be on consumers to guess which ones might still be effective. Instead, manufacturers should be studying each newly licensed drug to determine its actual expiration date by storing quantities of it and testing its stability on an annual basis, says Holzgrabe. Tighter regulation of the pharmaceutical industry would help, she says: “The law has to be changed so that we do not throw away so many drugs which are still okay.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>This story originally appeared in&nbsp;</em><strong><em><a href="https://www.vox.com/family/369020/kids-children-generation-alpha-gen-school" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kids Today</a></em></strong><em>, Vox’s newsletter about kids, for everyone.&nbsp;</em><strong><em><a href="https://www.vox.com/pages/kids-today-newsletter-policy-childhood-policy-culture" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sign up here for future editions</a></em></strong><em>.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The day after the presidential election, LaToya Bufford’s 16-year-old daughter got a text saying she had been “selected to pick cotton at the nearest plantation.” The text came from a number Bufford’s daughter didn’t recognize, but it addressed her by her full name. The teenager told her mom that some of her friends had gotten the message, too, but only those who, like her, are Black.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bufford said her daughter didn’t have much visible reaction to the text. But Bufford herself was left frightened and on high alert.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I was just shocked and so angry,” Bufford, who lives in Sacramento, California, told me. “If this could happen to my 16-year-old child,” she said, “I’m just scared about what could also happen.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bufford’s daughter was one of the middle school, high school, and college students in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/07/us/racist-text-messages-post-election/index.html">more than 20 states</a> who received similar racist texts in the days following the election. The attacks have continued and broadened in the weeks since, with Latino and LGBTQ+ recipients getting messages threatening them with deportation or being sent to “reeducation camps,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/11/18/election-texts-fbi-investigation/">according to the FBI</a>. Some messages purported to be from “the Trump administration,” though the Trump campaign <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/11/18/election-texts-fbi-investigation/">has said</a> it had nothing to do with the messages. The FBI is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/11/18/election-texts-fbi-investigation/">still investigating</a> the wave of harassment, leaving kids and families wondering who got their names and phone numbers and sent them terrifying, personalized messages.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, other children across the country encountered hate speech and harassment at school immediately following the election, from a racist note left in a <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/school-leaders-confront-racist-texts-harmful-rhetoric-after-divisive-election/2024/11">Wyoming high school bathroom</a> to a spate of anti-immigrant and other discriminatory incidents in a <a href="https://www.wcax.com/2024/11/12/vt-school-district-reports-uptick-post-election-harassment-complaints/">Vermont district</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s not much comprehensive data yet on how many kids have been harassed in the wake of last month’s election, but experts and school officials say the incidents documented so far, like the texts Bufford’s daughter and others received, reflect a continuation of a disturbing pattern.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After the 2016 election, Donald Trump’s xenophobic rhetoric about immigrants and other groups <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/albertsamaha/kids-are-quoting-trump-to-bully-their-classmates">made its way to high school</a>, middle school, and even elementary school campuses, and children began shouting <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/13/17107034/trump-border-wall-mexico">“build the wall”</a> and threatening their classmates with deportation. News reports between 2016 and 2020 document more than 300 incidents of students or school staff using Trump’s words or name to harass children, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/local/school-bullying-trump-words/">according to a 2020 Washington Post analysis</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/this-week-in-hate">reported on hate crimes and harassment</a> in 2016 and 2017. Schools, unfortunately, were a big part of the story, with swastikas and racist slogans defacing the places where children, one parent reminded me, are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/opinion/a-high-school-defaced-with-trump-and-swastikas.html">supposed to be safe</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kids, especially teenagers, don’t always open up to adults about how harassment makes them feel. But hate speech can cut deep, particularly when the target is a child whose brain and sense of self are <a href="https://developingchild.harvard.edu/resources/racism-and-ecd/">still developing</a>. Kids can <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/local/school-bullying-trump-words/">experience physical symptoms</a> like stomach pain and headaches; others can have <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/albertsamaha/school-is-starting-soon-will-the-trump-inspired-bullying">panic attacks</a> or insomnia.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harassment can also deprive young people of their legal right to an education, making them too afraid to stay in class or even to come to school at all, said Erin Maguire, director of equity and inclusion for Vermont’s Essex Westford School District, which experienced a steep increase in harassment reports the week of the election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While complaints there have leveled off, some experts remain concerned about the impact a second Trump administration could have on kids across the country. Kids continued lobbing Trump-inspired insults at their peers throughout his first term, according to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/local/school-bullying-trump-words/">Washington Post analysis</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Schools can make a big difference in supporting students who have been targeted and creating environments free from discrimination, experts say. But they may face an uphill battle in an administration that’s already broadcast its <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/11/15/trump-dei-cabinet-nominees">opposition to equity and inclusion initiatives</a>, as well as its intent to <a href="https://www.vox.com/education/384779/department-of-education-trump-musk-betsy-devos">dismantle government education agencies</a> that enforce civil rights.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now some parents are left preparing their children on their own for what they see as a new reality.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There’s always been hate and racism in this country, but now people are feeling like they can come out from behind closed doors and show that hate,” Bufford said.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hate speech at schools spiked after the election</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the 1990s, hate crimes have tended to increase during election cycles because public dialogue becomes increasingly heated and divisive, said Nadia Aziz, senior program director of the fighting hate and bias program at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a 75-year-old coalition of rights organizations. But the first Trump candidacy “empowered white nationalists” in a new way, she said. Since 2015, reported hate crimes have nearly doubled, <a href="https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/2024-the-state-of-hate-updated/">according to a report</a> released by the Leadership Conference Education Fund earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kids and schools have not been insulated from these larger trends. In Essex Westford, a majority-white district of about 3,800 students near Burlington, Vermont, reports of harassment <a href="https://www.wcax.com/2024/11/12/vt-school-district-reports-uptick-post-election-harassment-complaints/">jumped from the usual two or three</a> a week to 12 the week of the election. Some of the incidents, which spanned age groups from elementary to high school, specifically referenced Trump’s proposed policies around <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies">immigration</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/transgender-people-prepare-donald-trump-second-term-rcna180906">gender identity</a>, Maguire said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At Arapaho Charter High, a small Wyoming school whose students are almost all Native American, a note written on a paper towel and hung on a bathroom mirror read “I hate” followed by a racial slur and a swastika, said Katie Law, the school’s principal. A few days later, a student used the same slur in class. “It was disheartening to see that it continued,” Law said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The texts aimed at Latino Americans were also mostly sent to young people, Juan Proaño, CEO of the League of United Latin American Citizens, a civil rights group, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/11/18/election-texts-fbi-investigation/">told the Washington Post</a>. “Our expectation is that we’re going to see more of this as we get closer to Jan. 20,” he said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bufford, meanwhile, has had a conversation with all her children about “looking out for their backs,” she said. “We live in a very diverse neighborhood,” she said. “But you can never be too careful, especially now.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to help kids who have been harassed</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Families shouldn’t be on their own to protect kids from hate speech; political leaders have an important role to play, experts say. “Any message that public officials send can trickle down to children,” Aziz said. “The more public officials that denounce hateful things,” she said, “the more examples our children have to look up to.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Educators, too, “are looked to across communities to really offer a way forward,” said Liz King, senior program director for education equity at the Leadership Conference. “It is meaningfully important when they get up and say, ‘This is awful.’”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">School leaders can also counter hate speech and discrimination by using curricula that are inclusive of all students, King said. The <a href="https://www.ed.gov/about/ed-offices/ocr">Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights</a> also offers resources for preventing and responding to discrimination in schools.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has pledged to <a href="https://www.vox.com/education/384779/department-of-education-trump-musk-betsy-devos">eliminate that department</a>, but the laws that protect kids’ right to an education aren’t changing, King said. “These laws are not going anywhere, and so each of us has a responsibility to ensure that this administration meaningfully protects all of us from discrimination and enforces our civil rights laws.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Schools need to find ways to hold all students in a way that helps them feel safe and supported,” Maguire said. “It&#8217;s our job to figure that out.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What I’m reading</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Schools and districts are <a href="https://apnews.com/article/immigration-school-deportation-9747be35d2eb109693930f114f148b94">preparing for what might happen</a> if Trump is able to follow through on his promise to enact <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies">mass deportations</a>. Leaders are worried that even the threat of such a policy could make kids too afraid to come to school.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/life/369953/skibidi-tweens-gen-alpha-brainrot-ipad-kids">“Brain rot”</a> is the Oxford University Press <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/arts/brain-rot-oxford-word.html">word of the year</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The 2021 <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/21/23882353/child-poverty-expanded-child-tax-credit-census-welfare-inflation-economy-data">expanded child tax credit</a> lifted families out of poverty — and then it ended. Now, a <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/12/02/nx-s1-5193032/federal-expanded-child-tax-credit-pandemic-child-poverty-kids-rx-basic-income-flint-michigan">program in Michigan</a> is experimenting with its own version, giving parents $1,500 during pregnancy and $500 a month for a baby’s first year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">My older kid and I are revisiting the <a href="https://www.scholastic.com/site/branches/the-notebook-of-doom.html">Notebook of Doom series</a>, an old favorite in which three resourceful kids face off against unusual monsters like “balloon goons,” which are basically evil versions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tube_man">these guys</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">From my inbox</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A couple of weeks ago, I wrote about why <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/386286/kids-reading-literacy-crisis-books">kids aren’t reading for fun</a> as much as they used to, and why that has experts worried. Several of you wrote in with tips for getting kids excited about books. “I advise parents that when they go to the library, don’t get one book, get a basket of books,” wrote one reader. “Keep the receipt on the refrigerator, because it can get expensive if returned late.” (I can confirm this from experience.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Do not nag your children to read,” she continued. “Put the basket near the breakfast table, or near the couch, with the only rule being ‘no phones, no screens.’ If the child doesn’t pick up a book, say nothing. Just get a new basket of books the next week.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">France’s government collapsed Wednesday following a vote of no confidence in the country’s prime minister, pushing the country’s political future into chaos and exacerbating its budgetary and looming economic crises.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The successful vote means center-right Prime Minister Michel Barnier will be out of a job, and that French President Emmanuel Macron will need to find someone to replace him. That’s not expected to be an easy task: While the president nominates prime ministers in France, his picks can be ousted at any time by no confidence votes, like Barnier was. And the National Assembly, the lower house of France&#8217;s parliament, is almost evenly divided between the far right, a loosely united and contentious left wing, and centrists including Macron’s allies. Few candidates will please all three factions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Disagreement about who should be prime minister following surprise elections this past summer led to Barnier’s rise. He was seen as a capable, if not popular, choice for the job, and won enough approval to win the prime minister’s post. But he faced a significant challenge of trying to govern without a majority. His recent attempt to push through a 2025 national budget without a vote in the lower house of parliament infuriated lawmakers on both the right and left. As a result, France’s far-right party and its left-wing alliance each put forward no-confidence motions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, France is stuck. Without a prime minister,&nbsp; the government’s ability to pass laws is hampered. In the long term, Barnier’s removal could deepen France’s ongoing budget crisis and is a reflection of an unprecedented polarization in French politics, for which a solution seems far out of reach.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Who are the players involved?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are three key figures in the no confidence drama: Barnier, the prime minister; Macron, France’s president; and Marine Le Pen, the ideological architect and former leader of the far-right National Rally party, who was instrumental in toppling Barnier.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Barnier, a fairly traditional French conservative, has a long career that includes stints in the French government and the European Commission, most notable as the chief Brexit negotiator on the European side. He lost Wednesday’s no-confidence vote and must resign his post. Macron could reappoint him, but he has indicated that he would not accept the job. His tenure is the shortest in modern French history.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Macron is a beleaguered, highly unpopular president. He will need to appoint another prime minister quickly to pass the government’s budget and, hopefully, prevent an economic crisis from engulfing France. (More on that below.) However, his options are limited given the dysfunction in the National Assembly.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Le Pen is Macron’s chief rival. She has long coveted the French presidency but has failed to secure it three times thus far. She could try again during the next presidential election in 2027, but may be blocked from running, depending on the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/12/04/france-no-confidence-vote-government-collapse/">outcome of a corruption trial next spring</a>. If Macron were to resign and an early election were to happen this year, there would be nothing to bar her from entering the race — and that has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-12-04/france-no-confidence-vote-what-next-for-macron-barnier-le-pen">led to some speculation</a> that deposing Barnier was part of a larger plan to force Macron to quit. (He’s said he’s not going anywhere, however.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Regardless of what Macron decides, Le Pen was able to maneuver her party’s power in the National Assembly and exercise her own influence to bring down Barnier and cause chaos in the French government. She marshaled her party to vote with the left wing coalition’s no confidence motion —&nbsp;even after she <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-02/france-s-barnier-offers-final-hour-budget-concession-to-le-pen?embedded-checkout=true&amp;sref=qYiz2hd0">pushed Barnier to align with her party on key issues</a> in exchange for her party’s approval for his budget.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“She’s annoyed with the political elites and … wants to exercise her vengeance,” <a href="https://fsi.stanford.edu/people/patrick-chamorel">Patrick Chamorel</a>, senior resident scholar at the Stanford Center in Washington, told Vox.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why is the government in trouble now?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">France’s political turmoil didn’t exactly start with Barnier; to understand what’s happening now, we need to go back to July.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That was when France held snap parliamentary elections, following the disastrous defeat of Macron’s party in June’s European Parliament elections. Macron’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/explainers/359421/france-elections-new-popular-front-macron-le-pen-melenchon">decision to hold the election was a surprise</a>, and he hoped voters would reject the far right at home. Instead, those elections saw Le Pen’s National Rally party (or RN) gain ground, as did far-right parties across Europe. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/explainers/359421/france-elections-new-popular-front-macron-le-pen-melenchon">Going into election day</a>, it seemed all but certain that RN would trounce the various left-wing parties and Macron’s centrists. But a last-ditch effort to keep the right wing out of power <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/08/nfp-new-popular-front-france-election-winner-melenchon">formed the New Popular Front</a>, an uneasy alliance of four left-wing parties. Now, <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/france/20240707-france-s-leftist-new-popular-front-wins-a-shock-victory-%E2%80%93-but-now-the-hard-part-begins">they have the largest bloc in the National Assembly</a>, but not enough power and support to get their <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/05/nx-s1-5101536/france-prime-minister-michel-barnier">chosen prime minister candidate approved</a> by the National Assembly. Those left-wing parties<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1l51y6p171o"> </a>have threatened <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1l51y6p171o">a no-confidence vote against Barnier</a> since he took office.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The fractious parliament has a major problem it needs to deal with: An enormous budget deficit, which is tied into the political crisis.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As of now, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/business/france-budget-debt-deficit-macron.html">country’s budget deficit is 6.1 percent of its output and rising, and debt is at 3.2 trillion Euro.</a> Multiple <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/business/france-economy-government-collapse.html">serious crises</a>, including the Covid-19 pandemic and energy crisis caused by Russia’s war in Ukraine —&nbsp;combined with slow economic growth and low tax revenues —&nbsp;have put the country in this position. French <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/business/france-economy-government-collapse.html">companies have begun layoffs</a>, and workers are growing increasingly agitated.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Simply put, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/business/france-economy-government-collapse.html">France’s economic outlook isn’t good</a>, and if the country wants to change that, it needs a real budget that will both start bringing money into government coffers, not to mention a government that can enact policies to strengthen the overall economy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Barnier was tasked with finding a way out; his proposed budget was supposed to save around 60 billion euros by levying large taxes on corporations and the wealthy, as well as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/business/france-budget-debt-deficit-macron.html">cutting public spending including on pensions and healthcare reimbursements</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given the French tradition of a strong social welfare state, an austerity budget was sure to be unpopular. It was. Unable to garner the RN’s support, he used his <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20241202-french-pm-barnier-to-force-budget-bill-through-parliament-49-3-risking-no-confidence-vote">constitutional powers</a> to pass the budget without the National Assembly’s vote —&nbsp;triggering no-confidence motions from the left- and the right-wing blocs.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What happens now that the government has fallen apart?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the short term, Barnier will have to resign as prime minister, and his Cabinet will be dissolved. He’ll <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/world/europe/france-no-confidence-barnier.html">likely stay on</a> until Macron can name his replacement. In France, the prime minister governs much of domestic policy while the president tends to handle international affairs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The government will still continue its day-to-day functioning —&nbsp;unlike a government shutdown in the US, government services will continue. But no new laws can be passed until Macron appoints a new prime minister.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That will not be an easy task; because the National Assembly is so polarized, it will be difficult to find a candidate who will have majority support there. (The prime minister does not have to be approved by the parliament, but since blocs can trigger no confidence votes at any time, the president must appoint someone who could survive one.) France cannot hold another parliamentary election until next summer.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Both RN and the far-left party France Unbowed (also known as LFI, part of the New Popular Front coalition) have called on Macron to resign, which he says he will not do. The next French presidential election is scheduled for 2027, but both RN and LFI hope to force Macron out and run their own polarizing candidates.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the longer term, France’s budget crisis isn’t going anywhere until there is a government in place to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/whats-next-frances-political-budget-crises-2024-12-02/https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/whats-next-frances-political-budget-crises-2024-12-02/">pass a 2025 budget</a>, and successfully passing a new budget likely means acquiescing to Le Pen and the RN.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For now, Le Pen and her party have exercised their power in toppling the government, but Chamorel said there are downsides for her, too. “She will keep her hardline voters,” he told Vox. “But she is going to be held responsible.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Support independent journalism that matters — </em><a href="https://www.vox.com/support-now?itm_campaign=article-header-Q42024&amp;itm_medium=site&amp;itm_source=in-article"><em>become a Vox Member today</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The twists and turns in the ongoing story of Hannah Kobayashi, who went missing in Los Angeles last month after failing to get on her connecting flight to New York, have kept the public riveted for nearly a month. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But now, amid a family tragedy that includes the death of Kobayashi’s father by apparent suicide, police have determined Kobayashi might have walked away from her life voluntarily.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Los Angeles police <a href="https://apnews.com/article/missing-woman-hawaii-hannah-kobayashi-237f5a7131079d4666aa5b0e77dd783e">announced Monday</a> that they’d reviewed surveillance video showing a woman they believed to be Kobayashi on November 12, the day her family reported her missing. Kobayashi, who is from Hawaii, had failed to complete a flight from her home state to New York City. <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/04/us-news/hannah-kobayashi-spotted-buying-bus-ticket-in-la-day-before-police-said-she-crossed-border-into-mexico/">The footage shows</a> a woman who appears to be Kobayashi at a Los Angeles bus station, buying a ticket to the border. Police say she used her passport to make the purchase, then crossed over into Mexico from San Ysidro.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The investigation is the second high-profile missing persons case in recent weeks to take an unexpected turn after the person turned up seemingly unharmed. On November 11, the day before Kobayashi’s family reported her missing, a Wisconsin man resurfaced after being missing for months to admit that he had <a href="https://apnews.com/article/missing-kayaker-ryan-borgwardt-wisconsin-240e49d59e3e69ad95f14baea9fda1d9">faked his own death</a> in a dramatic kayaking incident in order to escape his life and start over in Eastern Europe. Los Angeles investigators felt that Kobayashi had likewise walked away from her own life and that, until she decided to resurface, there was little they could do.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“To date, the investigation has not uncovered any evidence that Kobayashi is being trafficked or is the victim of foul play. She is also not a suspect in any criminal activity,” Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/02/us/hannah-kobayashi-missing/index.html">stated</a> during a news conference. “She has a right to her privacy, and we respect her choices but we also understand the concern her loved ones feel for her.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are several alarming differences between the two cases, beginning with the sharp and sudden turn in Kobayashi’s trajectory. The 30-year-old Maui resident was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/28/us/missing-hawaii-woman-hannah-kobayashi-profile/index.html">a free spirit</a> with a love of art, photography, and the outdoors before she boarded a flight to visit a relative on November 8. It was supposed to be her first trip to the New York City — something she’d had on her “bucket list” of places to see — and she had plans to see a Broadway show with a friend before traveling upstate. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She was sharing the flight with an ex-boyfriend, though they <a href="https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2024/11/16/father-flies-la-search-missing-daughter-who-took-flight-maui-vanished/">reportedly</a> sat in different parts of the plane, and he doesn’t appear to have had anything to do with her disappearance. Kobayashi didn’t join him on their connecting flight out of LAX. Instead, she left the airport. Security footage caught her getting on the Metro headed toward downtown Los Angeles. After her family reported her missing, multiple people reported having seen her at The Grove shopping mall on November 9 and 10. Eagle-eyed web sleuths spotted her appearing on camera 31 seconds into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_bthVI5rMM">a video</a> shot at a LeBron James Nike event held there. Hannah even uploaded a photo from the event <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DCOCme2x2nW/">to her own Instagram</a> — the last post she’s made there to date.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During her days spent in the city, she sent a series of alarming texts to family and friends. One text spoke of “Deep Hackers” who “wiped my identity, stole all of my funds, &amp; have had me on a mind fuck since Friday,” while another claimed she’d been “tricked pretty much into giving away all my funds. From someone I thought I loved.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She also told family she’d missed her flight to New York but reportedly <a href="https://abc7.com/post/hannah-kobayashi-family-missing-hawaii-woman-holding-rally-downtown-los-angeles-call-search-volunteers/15568549/">used language</a> that family members thought didn’t sound like her. One such suspect text, containing odd endearments she didn’t typically use, <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/29/us-news/hannah-kobayashis-friends-think-final-texts-before-disappearance-were-faked-because-they-dont-include-emojis/">said</a>, “I’m just really scared love &amp; the redwoods if calling me &amp; I know I’m meant to be there, I’m being guided there, like you have before … I risk my freedom if this goes wrong for me hun.” Another spoke of her having “just finished a very intense spiritual awakening.” In one text, Kobayashi <a href="https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2024/11/15/really-weird-text-messages-prompt-concern-maui-woman-reported-missing-los-angeles/">reportedly claimed</a> that she was scared and afraid to go home.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Even though she was in contact with us, she wasn&#8217;t in contact with us in her right mind,” her aunt, Larie Pidgeon, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/11/20/hannah-kobayashi-search-los-angeles-timeline/76437467007/">told</a> USA Today.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I just need to rest &amp; I’ll think better,” one text to her mother, sent on November 11, <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/29/us-news/hannah-kobayashis-friends-think-final-texts-before-disappearance-were-faked-because-they-dont-include-emojis/">reportedly read</a>. “But it’s very complicated Matrix underworld shit.” It was one of her final communications to her family. Her final texts indicated she was returning to the airport and promised to keep her family posted. Although she did return to the airport, she ultimately only picked up her luggage, which she’d requested to have flown back from New York to LA. That evening, <a href="https://abc7ny.com/post/family-worries-hannah-kobayashi-missing-woman-missed-flight-connection-lax-maui-hawaii-may-have-been-abducted/15560173/">according to</a> a Facebook post made by her family, she was spotted getting off the Metro near Crypto.com Arena (formerly Staples Center). Her family claimed in the post that they’d seen footage of the sighting which indicated that Hannah “does not appear to be in good condition” and she is not alone.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After November 11, her phone was turned off, and by the following week, Kobayashi had fallen off the grid — she’d stopped sending text updates, and family and friends fanned out across the city to search for her. We now know that she had already crossed the border into Mexico, but her family <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/22/us-news/missing-hawaii-woman-hannah-kobayashi-family-not-heard-from-detectives-for-ten-days/">claimed</a> they had only radio silence from LAPD about what, if anything, they had learned, leaving them to search for answers alone. After the family held a public rally on November 21, police finally got in touch with them, though it would still be another week before any answers arrived.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the middle of the family’s fear that she’d been abducted or trafficked, and amid enormous and growing public speculation about what happened to her, her father Ryan Kobayashi was searching for her.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On November 15, he <a href="https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2024/11/16/father-flies-la-search-missing-daughter-who-took-flight-maui-vanished/">told KHNL Hawaii News Now</a> that he’d experienced&nbsp;a “lot of worrying, a lot of confusion. Everything is just a blur it seems, because I haven&#8217;t slept well since I&#8217;ve heard the news.” He went on to ask Hannah to get in touch with the police or with her family.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There’s a lot of people out there that care and love you, Hannah,” he said. “If you can just get to somebody, whatever you can do … just let us know that you’re okay.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At some time around 4 am on November 24, Ryan Kobayashi died by suicide in Los Angeles.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I’m going to continue to stay strong for you,” Hannah Kobayashi’s sister Sydni <a href="https://www.wsaz.com/2024/11/25/father-missing-hawaii-woman-found-dead-los-angeles/">wrote</a> on social media. “We’re going to find Hannah.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite indications that Kobayashi may have been suffering from a mental break or another form of mental illness, Pidgeon pushed back on this possibility. “She has no record on that,” she <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hawaii-maui-woman-alarming-text-missing-los-angeles-rcna180724">told NBC</a> on November 15. “She is not on medication. Hannah&#8217;s someone that we can call and she&#8217;s going to call us back within an hour.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pidgeon further criticized the public speculation about Hannah’s disappearance for pushing her father to a breaking point. Conspiracy theories online abounded about what happened to her, everything from run-ins with <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23959800/escaping-twin-flames-netflix-jeff-ayan-twin-flames-universe-cult-soulmates">the Twin Flames new-age cult</a> to bad drug trips gone haywire. “If Ryan is looking at all this shit, imagine that weighing on him?” she <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/25/us-news/conspiracy-theories-may-have-sparked-tragic-twist-in-hannah-kobayashis-case/">told</a> the New York Post, which had previously reported sensationalized details like Kobayashi having <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/27/us-news/missing-hawaii-woman-hannah-kobayashis-family-says-venmo-payments-to-mystery-duo-being-investigated/">paid for a tarot reading</a> while she was out and about in LA.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In their announcement that they would be changing Kobayashi’s status to that of a “voluntary missing person,” the LAPD <a href="https://www.wnep.com/article/news/nation-world/police-say-a-hawaii-woman-disappeared-voluntarily/507-7930e85e-7f85-47fa-b264-1d0faf4501fc">claimed</a> that Kobayashi had evinced a desire to “step away from modern connectivity.” This included old social media posts she’d made where she seemed to want to “disconnect from her phone,” according to Missing Persons investigator Lt. Douglas Oldfield.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, the family continued to press for answers, vowing that the search for Hannah would continue. It won’t, however, be continuing as publicly as before. The burgeoning Facebook group “Help Us Find Hannah,” which grew to over 25,000 members, went private after the announcement on Monday, with family members <a href="https://www.wnep.com/article/news/nation-world/police-say-a-hawaii-woman-disappeared-voluntarily/507-7930e85e-7f85-47fa-b264-1d0faf4501fc">reportedly claiming</a> to have received “threats against their lives and the lives of their small children.” It’s unclear what if anything provoked the threats, but it is clear that public speculation and scrutiny surrounding Kobayashi’s disappearance had spiraled in the weeks since she first left LAX. On Tuesday, moderators of Reddit’s r/Hawaii subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hawaii/comments/1h5av1i/hannah_kobayashi_is_believed_to_be_in_mexico/">locked their post</a> about the disappearance because it was “starting to see a lot of baseless conspiracy theories.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However complicated Kobayashi’s story is, it seems abundantly clear that her family is right to be alarmed for her safety. It’s also increasingly evident that while the era of social media and heightened public scrutiny over police investigations can be <a href="https://www.vox.com/22684204/gabby-petito-missing-updates-internet-web-sleuthing">uniquely beneficial</a>, it can also be extremely overwhelming, obfuscatory, and frustrating to family, friends, and officials trying to find loved ones. While the huge number of eyes on Hannah as she went on her journey was undoubtedly helpful in locating her, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hannahkobayashi/comments/1h4ob9z/spotted_on_venice_beach/">false sightings</a> and far-fetched rumors may have made it harder on the family. Hannah Kobayashi’s situation, however alarming, was and is potentially resolvable. It’s impossible to know whether the tragedy of her father’s suicide could have been avoided if her disappearance hadn’t become headline-grabbing news, but it almost certainly didn’t help.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, while it’s tempting to blame Ryan Kobayashi’s death on the media and public frenzy, the real stressors might have been much closer to home. He had <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/25/us/hannah-kobayashi-father-found-dead-hnk/index.html">told CNN</a> that he and Hannah had not been close when she was growing up and that they “hadn’t had contact for a while.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I’m just trying to make up,” he said. “I’m trying to get her back. That’s my main focus.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The grim but less complicated takeaway from this series of tragic events might be just this: The mighty apparatus of true crime theorizing and crowdsourced web sleuthing can often make family tragedies into labyrinthine mysteries when they aren’t. Sometimes, the answers may be undramatic and unsatisfying — but perhaps the simpler they are, the less they lead us astray.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Support independent journalism that matters — </em><a href="https://www.vox.com/support-now?itm_campaign=article-header-Q42024&amp;itm_medium=site&amp;itm_source=in-article"><em>become a Vox Member today</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Supreme Court heard oral arguments Wednesday in <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/united-states-v-skrmetti/"><em>United States v. Skrmetti</em></a>, arguably the <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/385198/supreme-court-transgender-united-states-skrmetti">most important transgender rights case the Court has ever heard</a>. The case asks whether discrimination against transgender people can violate the Constitution — and it appears most of the justices feel it does not. The likely result is that the Court will allow states to ban health procedures that enable gender-affirming care, both for minors and, potentially, adults.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The argument went terribly for transgender Americans, as many of the justices suggested creating a carveout from the ordinary constitutional rule restricting sex-based discrimination of all kinds. Chief Justice John Roberts, for example, suggested giving the government broad authority to engage in such discrimination in the medical context — a ruling that could also have severe implications for women generally, including cisgender women.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said at one point in the argument, “I’m getting kind of nervous” that the Court is going to chip away at one of the “bedrock” principles in US anti-discrimination laws.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Skrmetti</em> involves a 2023 Tennessee law that prohibits trans youth from receiving medical treatments, such as puberty blockers and hormone therapy, if those treatments are prescribed to help them transition. Notably, the law is quite explicit that its purpose is to “<a href="https://casetext.com/statute/tennessee-code/title-68-health-safety-and-environmental-protection/health/chapter-33-health-and-welfare-of-minors/section-68-33-101-findings">encourag[e] minors to appreciate their sex</a>” and to prevent young people from becoming “disdainful of their sex.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although this particular law involves a ban on gender-affirming care for minors, Tennessee&#8217;s arguments in favor of the law could also permit the government to prohibit adults from receiving the same treatments.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At least four justices — Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Brett Kavanaugh — appeared all but certain to vote to uphold Tennessee’s law. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, meanwhile, was a bit less direct in her questioning, but she largely seemed sympathetic to Tennessee’s position. Most notably, Barrett signaled midway through the argument that she was open to Roberts’s call for a medical carveout from the Constitution’s restrictions on sex discrimination.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Justice Neil Gorsuch, a Republican who authored a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/6/15/21291515/supreme-court-bostock-clayton-county-lgbtq-neil-gorsuch">landmark opinion protecting trans rights in 2020</a>, was silent throughout the argument. That left only the Court’s three Democrats to defend the orthodox approach to laws that discriminate on the basis of sex, which casts a skeptical eye on any law that treats people differently because of their sex assigned at birth.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The biggest question in <em>Skrmetti</em>, in other words, is likely to be <em>how</em> the Court finds a way to uphold Tennessee&#8217;s law, rather than <em>whether</em> the Court does so. And it seems fairly likely that the Court’s opinion could fundamentally alter the rules governing sex discrimination by the government.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How the Court’s current precedents approach laws that draw lines based on sex</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The most important thing to understand about Tennessee’s law is that it explicitly draws lines based on a patient’s sex assigned at birth. If a child who is assigned male at birth<strong> </strong>is prescribed testosterone by their doctor, Tennessee permits that child to receive that treatment. But a child who is assigned female at birth may not.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, while Matthew Rice, the Tennessee solicitor general defending his state’s law, tried many times to deny that this law classifies based on sex, he eventually admitted that it did after being pressed by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Jackson.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jackson, for example, asked Rice whether this law would permit a boy who seeks testosterone because he wants to deepen his voice and otherwise enhance his masculinity to receive that treatment, and Rice eventually conceded that, under the specific law at issue in this case, the boy could. Rice then eventually admitted that, if a girl sought the same treatment for the same purpose — to deepen her voice and to make her body appear more masculine — Tennessee’s law would prohibit her from receiving the treatment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This matters because, in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1428365285620704265&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr"><em>United States v. Virginia</em></a> (1996), the Supreme Court held that “all gender-based classifications” are subject to “heightened scrutiny,” meaning that the law is treated as presumptively unconstitutional and the state has to prove that its law was not enacted for impermissibly sexist reasons. Some laws survive this heightened scrutiny, if those laws are grounded in real differences between the sexes and not in prejudice or stereotypes. But, under <em>Virginia</em>, any law that draws lines based on sex in any way whatsoever receives this higher level of review from the federal courts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Significantly, neither the Biden administration, which argued against Tennessee&#8217;s law in the Supreme Court, nor the ACLU, which represents families that want their transgender children to have access to care, asked the Supreme Court to definitively strike down Tennessee&#8217;s law right now. Rather, the sole issue before the Court is whether to send the case back down to a federal appeals court that previously refused to apply the heightened scrutiny required by <em>Virginia</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But many of the justices appeared determined not to apply <em>Virginia</em> to this case. Roberts, for example, warned that there are “medical nuances” in this case that weren’t present in <em>Virginia</em> or some of the Court’s other previous gender discrimination cases. And he suggested that the courts should take a more deferential approach to state lawmakers in cases involving medicine because judges are not good at making medical judgments.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kavanaugh echoed Roberts’s thinking, suggesting at one point that the Constitution does not take sides on a “medical and policy debate.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Barrett also appeared sympathetic to Roberts’s approach, asking Chase Strangio, the ACLU lawyer, whether the courts have ever applied heightened scrutiny in a case involving medical judgments.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Strangio had an excellent answer to this question: During the pandemic, several churches and other religious institutions claimed that they had a constitutional right to defy state rules prohibiting too many people from gathering in one place in order to prevent the spread of Covid. The Court <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/12/2/21726876/supreme-court-religious-liberty-revolutionary-roman-catholic-diocese-cuomo-amy-coney-barrett">eventually split 5-4 in these cases</a>, with five of the Republican justices concluding that the right to freely practice religion overcomes a state’s medical determination that large public gatherings are too dangerous.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Barrett, however, did not appear persuaded, claiming that the Covid cases, in which she ruled with the majority, did not involve “diving deep into the medical evidence.” (Roberts dissented in the Covid cases, so his position in the Covid cases is consistent with the position he seemed to lay out in <em>Skrmetti</em>.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thomas and Alito’s questions, meanwhile, were consistently hostile to the two lawyers arguing in favor of trans rights. When you add their votes to Roberts, Kavanaugh, and Barrett, that’s a majority likely in favor of Tennessee’s law.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the Court adopts Roberts’s approach, which seems likely, that’s not just a devastating blow to transgender youth and their families. It’s also a sea change in the Court’s approach to sex discrimination of all kinds. Again, <em>Virginia</em> held that “all” laws that draw lines based on sex must survive heightened scrutiny, even though some laws ultimately clear this hurdle. “All” means all. But now many of the justices seem eager to hold that only some laws that classify people based on sex are presumptively unconstitutional.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">This case arrives at the Court at the worst possible moment</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s hard to divorce this case from its political context. During his recently victorious presidential campaign, President-elect Donald Trump went <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/380861/trump-transphobic-anti-trans-ads-scapegoating">all in on anti-trans rhetoric</a> — spending literally hundreds of millions of dollars on ads that, in the Washington Post’s words, “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/11/05/election-trans-sports-trump-campaign/">paint trans people as a menace to society</a>.” Republicans control six of the nine seats on the Supreme Court, so it’s not surprising that a majority of the Republican justices seemed to align with their party’s position on trans rights (the Court’s three Democrats, for that matter, also appear aligned with their own party).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But, in their apparent eagerness to uphold this Tennessee law, the Court’s Republican majority appears likely not just to strike a blow against trans rights. They also appear poised to do considerable damage to the legal standard governing sex discrimination generally. Perhaps Tennessee could, if this case were sent back down to the lower court, offer a justification for its law that survives heightened scrutiny. But most of the justices appear ready to overrule <em>Virginia</em>’s statement that all sex-based classifications must undergo such scrutiny.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is why, near the end of Strangio’s time at the podium, Jackson said she is “suddenly quite worried” about the implications of the Court’s questions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the Court can create a medical carveout to the general rule that all sex discrimination is presumptively unconstitutional, what other carveouts might they create in the future? For that matter, will the Court also create similar carveouts for other forms of discrimination, such as race discrimination? Jackson even went so far as to compare Tennessee’s arguments to Virginia’s unsuccessful defense of its ban on interracial marriage in <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/388/1/"><em>Loving v. Virginia</em></a> (1967).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of that said, the Court most likely will not hand down an opinion in <em>Skrmetti</em> until June 2025, when the Court normally decides the biggest cases of its term. There may be time for voices like Jackson’s to convince some of her colleagues to compromise. But based on Wednesday’s argument, <em>Skrmetti</em> appears likely to not just be a historic blow to transgender Americans, but potentially a similar blow against all people who might experience unconstitutional discrimination.</p>

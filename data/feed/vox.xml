<p class="has-text-align-none">There is not one contradiction at the heart of the incoming Trump administration’s political project. There are two.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first centers on economic policy&nbsp;— or, more fundamentally, the role of government itself.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One camp, exemplified by <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/383859/musk-trump-vance-silicon-valley">Elon Musk</a> and traditional big business, sees Trumpism as a celebration of individual greatness and unfettered capitalism. The second camp, including economic nationalists and RFK Jr.’s crunchy hippy types, believes Trumpism has a mandate to try to transform American society, including by attacking the practices of large corporations that do not fit their nationalist vision.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The second centers on foreign policy —&nbsp;or, more fundamentally, the purpose of America in the world.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One camp, exemplified by Secretary of State pick Marco Rubio, sees the United States as the world’s rightful leader,&nbsp;one that has not only a right but an obligation to assert its will across the globe. Another camp, exemplified by Secretary of Defense pick Pete Hegseth, sees the United States as a more ordinary country whose interests are served by being less involved in other countries’ issues like the Ukraine war, but being more violently involved when core American interests are at stake.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, there are areas of overlap between these groups. Both sides of the role-of-government divide believe that America will be well-served by a mass deportation campaign; both sides of the foreign policy divide support aggressively confronting China and waging a global war on jihadist groups like ISIS.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet these overlaps are limited and partial points of convergence between deeply divided ideological currents. The real connective tissue between the various Trump 2.0 factions is disdain for the cultural left and the “deep state” in Washington. The anti-left culture war has become, more or less, the central ideological principle of the modern Republican Party.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the campaign trail, it’s easy for Trump’s diverse set of allies to join together based on this shared animosity. But when governing, the administration will be forced to make choices in areas where its leaders disagree at a fundamental level, leading not only to internal conflict but potentially even policy chaos.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Trump coalition’s contradictions, explained</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Every administration has its internal disagreements. Typically, however, those disputes take place within a relatively narrow band: The political party they hail from is mostly clear on what it stands for and why. The Biden administration, for example, has generally agreed on a more redistributionist economic policy, even if certain policy issues, like how large the post-Covid stimulus should be, were subjects of major internal debate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Trump-dominated GOP, by contrast, is ideologically adrift. Its nominal ideology is Trumpism, but Trumpism has little in the way of a defined ideological core. Its core tenets, total personal fealty to Trump and a generalized illiberal nationalism, are flexible, admitting of a wide band of different policy visions on a host of different issues.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the first Trump administration, the main fight was over just how much deference Trumpist impulses deserved. You had Trump in the Oval Office, but he was surrounded by establishment figures like Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and chief of staff John Kelly, who saw their job as curbing his worst impulses.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the second Trump administration, the situation will be very different. The Mattis and Kelly types have either been purged from the party or forced to bend the knee. The question now is not whether Trumpism is leading the party, but what Trumpism actually stands for.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One way to think about the divides on this question is which part of the classic “make America great again” slogan the various camps emphasize: America or greatness.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When it comes to domestic policy, the “greatness” side includes folks like Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, and traditional Republican business elites. They see the attack on “the deep state” as, in part, a war on government red tape that stands in the way of progress, innovation, and the entrepreneurial spirit. Trump, for them, is proof that one man can change the world if left to his own devices. They aim to unleash similar spirits across the country and, non-coincidentally, advance their own business interests in the process.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The “America” camp, by contrast, is more inclined to emphasize collective solutions to America’s collective problems.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The chief advocates of mass deportations and across-the-board tariffs, like Steven Miller and Peter Navarro, are almost by definition not free marketeers. JD Vance aims to rebuild America along more conservative Christian lines, including by curbing the power of secular big business when he believes it threatens the organic unity of American society properly conceived. RFK Jr. and the “make American healthy again” movement see the war on government not as a campaign to shrink government per se, but rather to redirect its energies toward the problems they think really matter (vaccines, fluoridated water, and other such crank health concerns).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The foreign policy divide falls along similar lines.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">People like Rubio and national security adviser pick Michael Waltz fall on the “greatness” side. They believe that the United States is destined to lead the world and ought to work to ensure that it remains safely atop the global power hierarchy. Challengers to the existing American-led order like Russia and especially China must be aggressively confronted, and hostile dictatorships like Iran must be brought in line by force if necessary. The American continents must be dominated, Monroe-doctrine style, advocating a far more aggressive policy toward Latin American leftist dictatorships like Venezuela and Cuba (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/world/americas/marco-rubio-venezuela.html">as Rubio did in Trump’s first term</a>).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The other camp, including Hegseth and director of national intelligence pick Tulsi Gabbard, espouses a kind of narrower nationalism. Though they believe in American military strength, they care far less about aggressively protecting the existing political order. If Russia wishes to seize part of Ukraine, they suggest, that’s not really an American concern. The United States should instead be preoccupied with killing its enemies, advancing its narrowly construed interests, and protecting its border — up to and including <a href="https://www.lonestarlive.com/news/2024/11/defense-secretary-nominee-us-military-strikes-on-mexican-cartels-might-be-needed.html">launching a war in Mexico to battle drug cartels and human traffickers</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I don’t mean to say that these camps are fundamentally opposed. They are part of the same administration and share many of their boss’s core insights and enemies. They all agree to “make America great again” as a slogan but disagree on which parts of it to emphasize.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In practice, this might lead to a whole host of predictable and significant conflicts inside the administration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When RFK Jr. moves to put new <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/rfk-jr-vow-purge-fda-sets-up-collision-with-big-pharma-2024-11-15/">regulatory barriers in the way of pharmaceutical research</a>, will Big Pharma and biotech executive Vivek Ramaswamy try to stop him?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When billionaires suggest financing the extension of Trump tax cuts <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/11/18/gop-targets-medicaid-food-stamps/">by cutting the social safety net</a>, will Christian populist JD Vance stand up for the meek?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Marco Rubio pushes for <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/marco-rubio-secretary-of-state-nicolas-maduro-venezuela/">regime change in Venezuela</a>, will alleged anti-imperialist Tulsi Gabbard try to make him back off?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of these conflicts are hypothetical. Each is eminently predictable based on what the personalities involved have done in the past and promise to do in the future. If left unresolved, they threaten to create a kind of policy incoherence, with different aspects of the US government working at direct odds with each other, depending on who they answer to.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If and when Trump steps in to resolve them, will he do so consistently? Will he say one thing publicly and do another privately, as so often happened in his first term? Or will the resolution so consistently favor one group over another that we can finally start saying Trumpism has a little more meat on its ideological bones?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is only one honest answer: We don’t know. But we can be sure the stakes are high for the Republican Party, the country, and most likely the entire world.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Long before he officially pursued the presidency, Donald Trump railed against US trade deals. In <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/01/20/510680463/donald-trumps-been-saying-the-same-thing-for-30-years">interviews dating back to the 1980s</a>, he told journalists that deals that benefited Asian and Middle Eastern trading partners consistently “ripped off” the US.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over decades, that charge may have turned into <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/07/trump-inroads-union-workers-pennsylvania/75962349007/">a winning election strategy</a>. As a first-term president and in his  2024 campaign, <a href="https://www.cfr.org/election2024/candidate-tracker/donald-trump">Trump argued that a lopsided global trading system</a> is not only responsible for a deficit between the US and China, but also behind a decline in American manufacturing and jobs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, Trump has made a second-term promise to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-12/trump-tariff-plan-explained-expect-high-drama-and-a-slow-rollout">raise tariffs</a> — the taxes on imported goods that must be paid when they enter the US — even higher on China and other countries, while resurrecting those jobs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/30/companies-tariffs-trump-prices/">footwear, apparel, and auto-part companies</a> say they expect to pass the cost of such tariffs on to American consumers. <a href="https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/fiscal-macroeconomic-and-price-estimates-tariffs-under-both-non-retaliation-and-retaliation">Yale University’s Budget Lab</a> projects that Trump’s proposed tariffs would cost the average American household up to $7,600 a year with initial price hikes as high as 5 percent. Those higher costs could potentially backfire on the president-elect’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/30/companies-tariffs-trump-prices/">campaign promise to make inflation “vanish completely.”</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s trade strategy is one that Greg Ip, chief economics commentator at the Wall Street Journal, says is a major departure from almost 80 years of US policy. In a conversation with Noel King, co-host of the <em>Today, Explained </em>podcast, Ip described how it might play out and have massive implications for the global economy.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trade is a reality of economic life these days. What is Trump’s theory on it and how does it differ from his predecessors?&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Greg Ip</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the United States, since the 1940s at least, there&#8217;s been a bipartisan consensus that more trade is good. And this came from a bipartisan view that this made our workers more productive, because they had bigger markets to sell into. It benefited our consumers because they got cheaper goods and a greater variety of goods. And it was also good for the US geopolitically because it helped us increase our economic bonds to countries that thought the same way we did, politically.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump comes along and he argues: This entire regime has been much more to the advantage of other countries than it has been to the United States. Countries like Japan and then Germany and now China have taken advantage of the United States’s fixation on free trade to increase their trade surplus with the US, sell us lots of manufactured goods, and not buy very much from the United States. So his entire mission, from his first term, and now into this one, is to reverse that relationship and, he hopes, force those countries to buy more from the US, and Americans to buy more from each other instead of from importers. That&#8217;s the theory, anyway.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"> Donald Trump had a chance to do all of this from 2016 to 2020 when he was in office. What did he do?&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Greg Ip </h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He did raise tariffs, for example, in a series of rounds of tariff increases. He imposed tariffs on a wide range of products from China. And this was pursuant to a long-running case that complained that China was just systematically unfair to the United States, stealing our technology and putting up barriers to US exports to China. Then he imposed a variety of more bespoke tariffs on particular products.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So at the end of that first term … had Donald Trump gotten what he wanted? Had his plan worked?&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Greg Ip </h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the test of Donald Trump&#8217;s trade policy was a smaller trade deficit, then no, he didn&#8217;t really achieve what he wanted. The trade deficit when he left office was larger in dollar terms than when he entered office.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Did some manufacturing jobs come back? Possibly. But there also appear to have been some costs. There were industries that had to pay more for their inputs because of tariffs, and they lost sales and possibly jobs. And some of our trading partners retaliated.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Our trade deficit with China did begin to shrink. At the same time, though, you saw our trade deficit with Mexico and Vietnam grow. And what that told us is that some businesses responded to Trump&#8217;s tariffs not necessarily by bringing production back to the United States, but by moving it to another country — out of China, into Vietnam, into Mexico — that were not quite as affected by the tariffs.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What are Donald Trump&#8217;s plans for a second term?&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Greg Ip </h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He wants to, number one, come down even harder on China. Instead of just putting tariffs on about half of China&#8217;s imports, he&#8217;s talked about a tariff on all Chinese imports of as much as 60 percent. And instead of sparing traditional US allies, he wants to impose an across-the-board tariff on everybody, of say, 10 to 20 percent.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there&#8217;s a very big caveat to this, which is that we don&#8217;t really know if Trump will end up doing exactly what he&#8217;s talked about.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We know that Trump likes tariffs, but we also know that Trump likes to make deals. So, as in his first term, we might see that the threat of tariffs is primarily a leverage instrument —&nbsp;you know, a negotiating chip — in which he goes to countries that he thinks treat the United States unfairly and says, “Here are some things we want you to do differently. And if you do as we ask, then we won&#8217;t hit you with the tariffs that I&#8217;ve talked about.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How close can Donald Trump come to really and truly changing the way the world does trade?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Greg Ip </h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s possible that Trump presses ahead with exactly what he said, raises tariffs on everybody, and then all those countries retaliate. They export less to us, we export less to them, trade shrinks, and everybody is worse off.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There&#8217;s another possibility here, which is that a lot of folks in the United States and in other countries say, “You know, he&#8217;s right. The trading system was fundamentally good, but it went off the rails at some point. We need to get together. We need to remake that thing.” So I think another possibility is that we end up a few years from now with a different trading system, and perhaps a more realistic view of how China, above all — but some other countries, [too] — have not been playing by the rules.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But I think, as we learned from his first term, one thing with Donald Trump — you can be sure of this — is that you should expect the unexpected.<br><br></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/6/24/23181720/supreme-court-dobbs-jackson-womens-health-samuel-alito-roe-wade-abortion-marriage-contraception">the fall of <em>Roe v. Wade</em></a>, Democratic lawmakers and reproductive rights advocates have maintained a clear strategy: Win a more progressive Democratic trifecta in 2024, eliminate the Senate filibuster, and pass comprehensive federal protections. When reporters asked about contingency plans — particularly given polls suggesting full Democratic control was unlikely — such questions were dismissed, cast as premature or defeatist.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, with Donald Trump&#8217;s return to power and Republicans set to control Congress, that strategy is drawing fresh questions. The GOP has signaled some openness to compromise: While campaigning, Trump said <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/19/politics/trump-abortion-ban-rape-incest/index.html">he supported abortion exceptions</a> in cases of “rape, incest, and protecting the life of the mother,”<strong> </strong>and he promised to mandate insurance coverage for in vitro fertilization (IVF). Several Republican lawmakers have <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/02/27/congress/maces-ivf-alternative-00143590">backed</a> <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/opinion/2024/03/11/congressman-mike-carey-says-hes-working-to-make-ivf-affordable/72886283007/">their own</a> <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/dave-mccormick-pa-senate-race-family-policies-20240626.html">fertility treatment</a> bills. Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY) <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7056/cosponsors">backed a Democratic-led IVF measure</a> and speaks openly about <a href="https://midhudsonnews.com/2024/08/04/rep-lawler-wants-to-help-families-conceive-children/">his family&#8217;s consideration</a> of the procedure. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) has <a href="https://www.ernst.senate.gov/news/press-releases/ernst-works-to-promote-access-to-safe-effective-birth-control">pushed legislation</a> to expand over-the-counter contraception.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But reproductive rights organizations are doubtful. &#8220;We are not willing to compromise when it comes to our ability to make decisions about our bodies, lives and future,&#8221; Gretchen Borchelt, of the National Women&#8217;s Law Center (NWLC), said on a press call the day after the election. “What is the compromise that would provide relief for Amber Nicole Thurman&#8217;s family who&#8217;s grieving her every single day?&#8221; added NWLC’s president Fatima<strong> </strong>Goss Graves, referring <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/georgia-abortion-ban-amber-thurman-death">to a patient who died from sepsis</a> after being denied care.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vox asked six major advocacy groups if they would consider pushing for new federal protections under a Republican-led Congress, be it for IVF, birth control or abortion. Most avoided giving a direct answer, instead directing the conversation to Republican accountability and the harm caused by abortion bans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The stance reflects a deeper calculation: that accepting anything less than people deserve —&nbsp;meaning access to the full spectrum of reproductive health care for any reason —&nbsp;would legitimize restrictions and undermine the broader fight for bodily autonomy. When asked about pursuing partial protections versus holding out for more Democrats, groups choose waiting.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We are really looking at this from a defensive position,” said Ryan Stitzlein, the vice president of political and government relations at Reproductive Freedom for All, the group formerly known as NARAL. “We <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/373485/project-2025-abortion-ban-trump-comstock-mifepristone">read Project 2025</a>, we are very familiar with the folks in leadership on the Republican side … and are preparing for them to levy attacks on reproductive freedom at all levels of government on the administrative side.” </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Polling suggests there may be political opportunities</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite the Biden era&#8217;s surprising bipartisan deals on thorny issues from <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/6/23/23180893/senate-gun-control-bipartisan-bill-2022-pass">gun control</a> to <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/7/28/23281757/whats-in-climate-bill-inflation-reduction-act">climate change</a>, there were never similar attempts to forge bipartisan compromise on reproductive rights. When a small group of Republican and Democratic senators introduced legislation in 2022 to codify elements of <em>Roe</em>, abortion rights groups <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/8/22/23306142/kaine-collins-codify-roe-abortion-congress">quickly rejected the idea</a>, arguing in part that it did not go far enough. Even on issues like IVF and birth control, where Republican support seemed possible and anti-abortion groups held less sway, there were no serious efforts to find common ground. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To be sure, while many Republicans have sought to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/01/anti-abortion-movement-ivf-war-00149766">reassure voters that they support IVF</a>, their voting record thus far tells a different story. Many of those same lawmakers co-sponsored the Life at Conception Act, which could severely restrict fertility treatments by granting <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/24090347/alabama-ivf-ruling-fetal-personhood-abortion-embryos">legal personhood</a> from the moment of conception. Republicans have largely <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/17/republicans-block-ivf-bill-00179626">voted against Democratic IVF legislation</a>, while claiming they&#8217;d support narrower fertility treatment bills and criticizing Democrats for not being open to working on amendments.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, polling suggests potential political opportunities. About <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/26/us/politics/republicans-birth-control-ivf.html">80 percent</a> of voters say protecting contraception access is &#8220;deeply important&#8221; to them, and 72 percent of Republican voters had a favorable view of birth control. IVF is even more popular: <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/4507514-overwhelming-majority-americans-support-keeping-ivf-legal-for-women-poll/">86 percent of Americans</a> think it should be legal, <a href="https://www.iwv.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/executive-summary-KAConsulting-poll-contraception.pdf">including 78 percent</a> of self-identified &#8220;pro-life advocates&#8221; and 83 percent of evangelical Christians. Americans&#8217; support for abortion rights <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/support-for-abortion-access-has-risen-since-supreme-court-overturned-roe-v-wade-poll-finds">has intensified</a> since the fall of <em>Roe</em>, and this reality shaped some Republicans’ rhetoric on the campaign trail. Newly elected Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Dave McCormick <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/dave-mccormick-pa-senate-race-family-policies-20240626.html">ran on a platform</a> of fighting restrictions on fertility treatments and proposing a $15,000 tax credit for IVF.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some policy strategists have suggested that, regardless of Republican sincerity, Democrats and abortion rights groups might benefit from pushing votes on new IVF and birth control bills, even if they offer limited protections or codify certain provisions that advocates oppose.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such moves could either win new concrete protections or expose Republican resistance. But Democratic leadership and abortion rights groups for now seem uninterested in this approach, preferring to maintain pressure for comprehensively restoring rights.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We haven&#8217;t seen a genuine effort from Republicans that they engage in this conversation,” Stitzlein said. “We’ve seen them propose bills to try to save face in response to <em>Dobbs</em> and the <a href="https://www.vox.com/24080428/alabama-ivf-embryo-abortion-women-fertility">Alabama IVF ruling</a>.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Should Democrats keep their red line on abortion exceptions?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The political math around abortion exceptions would seem straightforward. Trump ostensibly supports them. Most Americans, including many Republicans, believe abortion should be legal in cases of <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-poised-reverse-roe-americans-support-abortion/story?id=84468131&amp;cid=social_twitter_abcn">rape, incest, and threats to the</a><strong><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-poised-reverse-roe-americans-support-abortion/story?id=84468131&amp;cid=social_twitter_abcn"> </a></strong><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-poised-reverse-roe-americans-support-abortion/story?id=84468131&amp;cid=social_twitter_abcn">parent’s life</a>. And women are being demonstrably harmed by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/01/21/us/abortion-ban-exceptions.html">lack of workable exceptions in state bans</a> today. One recent study estimated that more than 3 million women in the US will experience a pregnancy from rape in their lifetime.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet when asked whether they would consider seeking federal protections for abortion exceptions during Republican control as a harm reduction measure, established advocacy groups showed no interest, pointing to <a href="https://www.vox.com/23997727/kate-cox-texas-abortion-ban">patients like Kate Cox</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/3/12/23631278/supreme-court-abortion-texas-medically-necessary-sepsis-zurawski">Amanda Zurawski</a> who almost<strong> </strong>lost their lives or fertility<strong> </strong>despite state bans with exceptions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&#8220;As we are seeing across the country, exceptions often don&#8217;t work in practice, so people should not take comfort in those or rely on them,&#8221; Rachana Desai Martin, chief government and external relations officer at the Center for Reproductive Rights, told Vox.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This position stems from a core belief: that any engagement with exceptions would validate the broader framework of restrictions. Some doctors on the ground in states with restrictive bans have bemoaned the lack of support they’ve received for carving out exceptions. “I worry that reproductive rights advocates may be digging into untenable positions and failing to listen to those affected most by the current reality,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/16/opinion/medical-exceptions-abortion-tennessee.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">wrote one</a> maternal-fetal medicine physician in Tennessee.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the question of codifying emergency medical protections, Planned Parenthood Action Fund stressed in an email that, &#8220;narrow health exceptions or those that focus only on emergencies are a disservice to patients and their health care providers because every pregnancy is unique.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The position is particularly notable given these <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/supreme-court-refuses-to-say-whether-emtala-requires-hospitals-to-provide-stabilizing-abortions/">same groups&#8217;</a> <a href="https://reproductivefreedomforall.org/news/reproductive-freedom-for-all-statement-on-supreme-court-decision-on-emergency-abortion-care-case/">strong</a> <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/planned-parenthood-statement-on-leaked-supreme-court-decision-in-emtala-case">defense</a> of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) at the Supreme Court this year. The groups argued that EMTALA — which requires hospitals to provide “stabilizing treatment,” including emergency abortion care — represents a crucial federal protection for women in medical crises. Yet when asked about codifying the Biden administration’s interpretation of EMTALA or similar protections through legislation, the groups demurred.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Internationally, exceptions have served as imperfect stepping stones to broader rights. Colombia&#8217;s journey from total ban to full decriminalization began with three abortion exceptions in 2006 — for health risks, fatal fetal conditions, and rape. Over 16 years, advocates used these flawed measures to help build public support and legal precedent for expanding access, ultimately leading to <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2022/05/10/1097570784/colombia-legalized-abortions-for-the-first-24-weeks-of-pregnancy-a-backlash-ensu">decriminalizing the procedure up to 24 weeks</a> in 2022.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">India and Spain followed similar trajectories. India&#8217;s 1971 Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act initially permitted abortion only for specific circumstances like health risks and rape. Advocates used this limited framework to gradually build broader rights — first emphasizing public health arguments around unsafe abortions, then expanding to gender equality concerns. This incremental approach led to significant expansions <a href="https://prsindia.org/files/bills_acts/acts_parliament/2021/Medical%20Termination%20of%20Pregnancy%20Amendment%20Act%202021.pdf">in 2021</a> and <a href="https://www.scobserver.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/X-v-Principal-Secretary-Health-and-Family-Welfare-Department-Govt.-of-NCT-of-Delhi-Anr.pdf">2022</a>, including extended gestational limits and broader access for unmarried women. Spain&#8217;s path from its restrictive 1985 law to <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2010/03/spain-expands-legal-access-abortion">its 2010 legalization</a> up to 14 weeks followed a similar pattern, with advocates particularly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/11/world/europe/11spain.html">leveraging Spain’s mental health exception</a> to create de facto broad access.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These tensions — between principle and pragmatism, between long-term strategy and immediate needs — have taken on new urgency as patients in the US encounter the limitations of state-level abortion exceptions. In Louisiana, which has exceptions for protecting life, health, and fatal fetal conditions, almost no legal abortions <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/new-orleans/2023/06/26/abortion-rate-louisiana-post-roe">have been reported</a> since its ban took effect. Doctors say <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/3/12/23631278/supreme-court-abortion-texas-medically-necessary-sepsis-zurawski">ambiguous laws and criminal penalties</a> make them unwilling to test the rules. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But rather than pursue clearer federal standards around exceptions, advocacy groups are betting on abortion rights becoming more prominent as restrictions continue.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Americans will continue waking up to stories of women who died preventable deaths because they were denied access to essential health care and voters will continue to see these bans wreak havoc on their families and communities,” declared a post-election strategy memo from Emily’s List, National Women’s Law Center Action Fund, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, and Reproductive Freedom for All. “With anti-abortion politicians in power, abortion rights will only grow in salience for voters in elections to come.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Working with Republicans on even limited protections could also undercut the narrative of GOP extremism — a message advocacy groups see as crucial for winning in 2026 and 2028.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A high-stakes political bet</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite abortion rights proving less galvanizing in the most recent election than Democrats had hoped, reproductive rights groups are betting that voter attitudes will shift as restrictions continue. Currently, 28 million women, plus more trans and nonbinary people of reproductive age, live in states with abortion bans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&#8220;We have no interest in shrinking our vision,&#8221; Kimberly Inez McGuire, executive director of Unite for Reproductive &amp; Gender Equity, said, &#8220;but the politicians who will soon govern a majority pro-abortion country would do well to expand theirs.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In an interview with Vox, Democratic Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota said she will work with anyone in Congress who wants to collaborate in good-faith to protect abortion rights, but stressed that as Democrats move into the minority, “the onus will be on Republicans” to come to the table and negotiate with them in a serious way. Asked about potential deal-breakers, Smith declined to discuss specific provisions in the abstract, saying she would wait to see complete proposals.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Smith&#8217;s view captured the movement&#8217;s current predicament: “We have been saying for several years after <em>Dobbs</em> that the way to protect people&#8217;s access to abortion is to win elections for people who are willing to protect those rights. And that didn&#8217;t happen, so there is no magic solution here.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the popular song is to be believed, there’s no place like home for the holidays.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But getting there is going to cost you. Americans plan to <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/shopping/holiday-tips-news/2024-holiday-spending-report#holiday-travel">spend an average of $2,330 on holiday travel</a> this year, according to NerdWallet’s 2024 Holiday Spending Report. Factor in another $900 on gifts, per the report, and hundreds more on all the usual living expenses and you’ve got a hefty credit card bill come January 1.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You would think that it’d be easy to opt out of unnecessary and pricey holiday travel, but sometimes external pressures and expectations can make it hard to say no. Parents may look forward to spending uninterrupted time with their adult children and grandchildren during this time of year. If you’re coupled, that doubles the coordination: Pairs might weigh whose hometown to visit.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We, as a culture, put so much emphasis on the holidays being the most important time — even though I don&#8217;t believe that&#8217;s true — that families get together,” says licensed marriage and family therapist <a href="https://lincolnparktherapygroup.com/nicolle-osequeda/">Nicolle Osequeda</a>. “[People] feel really obligated to meet the needs of their family … and moreover, not to disappoint them.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As much as you’d like to make the grandparents happy and get out of town for the holidays, sometimes your budget just won’t allow it. If you’re nervous about how to approach negotiations with your partner or break the news to your family, therapists offer some guidance on what to say and how to compromise.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Set your holiday priorities</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyond just setting a budget, Osequeda suggests first getting clarity on what an ideal holiday looks like for you. During a time of year when people are often making decisions out of obligation, ask yourself what’s actually important to you this holiday season. Maybe it’s paying down debt or saving for a major purchase. Everyone’s reasons will be a little different.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By focusing on what’s important to you, you can determine what you can afford. It’s not worth going into debt because you want to do it all this holiday season. “If there&#8217;s a reality that there&#8217;s three things you want to do and you can only afford to do two … just closing your eyes and putting things on credit cards is going to create bigger problems down the line,” says <a href="https://tribecatherapy.com/our-therapists/about/">Matt Lundquist</a>, founder and clinical director of Tribeca Therapy.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“Those conversations go better when everybody is willing to put their cards on the table and say, ‘This is what I want, this is why it’s important to me.’”</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Getting clear on what you want helps you advocate for yourself when making plans with your partner, too. You may choose to prioritize some form of travel, but aren’t able to accommodate visiting both you and your partner’s families. Again, discuss your holiday goals and let your significant other know how your proposed plans align with that goal. If it’s been years since your partner’s been home, you might decide to visit them for Thanksgiving and then invite your family over for a New Year’s Eve party.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Those conversations go better when everybody is willing to put their cards on the table and say, ‘This is what I want, this is why it&#8217;s important to me,’” Lundquist says, “rather than the situation where we&#8217;re guessing what the other person wants and having to navigate reading between the lines.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Break the news as soon as possible — and be direct</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many people have a tendency to delay sharing news that might be potentially upsetting, Lundquist says. But don’t string your family along. As soon as you’ve determined you can’t make it, let your loved ones know so they can deal with their disappointment or offer a compromise, Lundquist says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then, tell your family in a “kind but clear way,” Osequeda says, why you can’t make it — but avoid over-explaining. You owe your loved ones an explanation, but you don’t need to justify your choices, she says. The more justification you proffer, the more “people start to poke holes in your argument,” Osequeda says, and may try to convince you to spend beyond your budget. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re unsure of how to tell your family, Osequeda suggests: “This is hard for me, but I’ve decided not to come home for the holidays this year because of the expenses involved. I understand if you&#8217;re disappointed. However, right now I really need to focus on [staying on top of my bills/not being stressed out over finances/not putting more money on my credit card/getting gifts for the kids]. Are there ways that we can still connect during the holidays that don&#8217;t include me traveling?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You might get some blowback from family members offering unsolicited criticism on what you<em> </em>choose to spend money on. (Which is none of their business anyway.) Remember that you’re making this choice based on your budget and financial needs, Lundquist says, and sometimes you’re going to make decisions that upset others. “I can&#8217;t get myself into debt to avoid you being upset,” he says, “And I also don&#8217;t want to organize our relationship in a way where those are the terms.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">But be open to compromise</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, your family might be entirely understanding and want to find a way to see you. It’s worth trying to find a happy medium, Osequeda says. If you have young kids and schlepping the whole family across the country is out of the question, you could ask your parents to travel to you if they’re able. Some families may offer to split the cost of travel with you.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Get as creative as you want: Meeting somewhere in the middle, making a plan to visit during a cheaper time of year, promising to save up so you can come next year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Maybe these bigger asks are out of the question. You could make a smaller compromise and suggest FaceTiming the family during dinner or when the kids open presents.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’ve determined that your holiday wouldn’t be complete if you weren’t at home, there are also other ways to make it work. For the cheapest flights, you might consider <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/guide/save-cash-holiday-travel/">departing on the holiday itself</a> and <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/travel/flying-for-the-holidays-heres-when-its-cheapest-and-most-expensive">returning home</a> during the week after the holidays. Try to carry on your luggage instead of checking a bag to save on fees. <a href="https://cluballiance.aaa.com/the-extra-mile/advice/travel/cheaper-to-fly-or-drive-for-your-vacation">Driving will generally be cheaper</a> than flying for shorter trips, but be sure to factor in extra travel time for holiday traffic. But if you’re traveling across the country, your time and money is better spent on flying. Other <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/travel/how-to-save-money-holiday-travel">ways to lower the cost of holiday travel</a>, according to NerdWallet, are to use miles or points for flights and hotels and to book rideshares to and from the airport in advance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Regardless of where you spend the holidays, you should still find time to get together with people you care about, whether it’s a local Friendsgiving or neighborhood potluck.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If you are unable to make it to your family because of financial reasons,” Osequeda says, “it doesn&#8217;t mean that you have to sit home alone miserably.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Vox reader Jen Hawse asks: Why do hotels pump in very strongly smelling perfume into their lobbies and sometimes their guest rooms?</em></p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

<p class="has-text-align-none">What we think of as a “nice” hotel often comes down to a certain je ne sais quoi. Sure, it has all the amenities — a luxe restaurant and bar on the premises, hotel room beds with soft Egyptian cotton sheets, perhaps a decadent spa — but beyond all that, it should have an ineffable ambience that’s both welcoming and sensual, cozy and yet exotic.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Scent can be what helps clinch this vibe. You might have noticed an alluring aroma wafting through the air as you enter a hotel lobby, or even a hotel room; this is likely a custom fragrance that hotels diffuse into the air. While some use mass-market scents available to consumers, many use their own signature scent developed by a master perfumer.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Scent marketing, as the practice is called, isn’t just limited to the hospitality scene, but pervades the retail sector. Just think of the <a href="https://www.seventeen.com/beauty/a10307436/abercrombie-and-fitch-discontinuing-fierce-fragrance/">thick miasma of cologne</a> that used to radiate from every Abercrombie &amp; Fitch store. It’s (usually) a more subtle marketing tool than a giant light-up billboard, calling back to happy memories and altering your mood so you feel more satisfied in a space — which, in turn, can nudge you to stay there longer, spend more money, book a room again, and recommend the experience to someone else. Some companies are even <a href="https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/workplace/workers-return-office-mood-fragrance-1751be44">spritzing smells in the office</a> to make the return-to-office more pleasant. In so many of the places we spend time in, an appeal is being made to your nose.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What’s the psychology behind scent marketing?</h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Scent marketing has been around for decades, with Las Vegas casinos being some of the earliest pioneers to use it. In the 1990s and early 2000s, though, its purpose wasn’t just to invite a pleasant aroma to an otherwise neutral space — it was to counteract a lingering, distasteful odor. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There was a while there where most resorts were drawn to environmental scenting because they wanted to do something about the cigarette smoke,” Jim Reding, CEO of the environmental scenting company <a href="https://aromaretail.com/">Aroma Retail</a>, says.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A growing number of companies outside hospitality are developing ambient scents for their retail spaces, says Caroline Fabrigas, CEO of Scent Marketing Inc. Recently, Fabrigas’s firm helped create a custom scent for <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/real-estate/2024/05/23/wayfair-online-retailer-wilmette-store-porch-cafe-edens-plaza">Wayfair’s new Chicago store</a> that smells like linen and fresh-cut grass.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In food and drink establishments, focusing on smell makes immediate sense: You smell pizza, you think of pizza, you crave pizza. Starbucks works hard to keep its coffee aroma from being sullied by food and other smells in its stores — <a href="https://www.mashed.com/142329/the-untold-truth-of-starbucks/">employees aren’t even allowed to wear fragrances</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For other spaces, the basic theory is that a distinctive smell becomes something customers immediately associate with a brand — our sense of smell is connected to the <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-smells-trigger-memories1/">part of the brain related to memory</a>, like a certain laundry detergent taking you straight back to being wrapped up in blankets when you were home sick from school. Using an ambient scent can cement brand recognition, and improve <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.40.1.10.19128">how well customers remember</a> aspects of a product or service.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A nice smell also puts you in a good mood. A 2021 study by researchers from the Barcelona School of Tourism, Hospitality, and Gastronomy <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8927/cf8dc2e40da63532bb1a9f17f629a800772c.pdf">conducted a trial in a four-star hotel</a> by comparing guest experiences in rooms scented with lavender and rooms without any scent; guests who stayed in scented rooms appeared to show higher happiness levels when in the room than those in the neutral room. Studies have also shown that a scented environment can <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228435964_Odors_and_consumer_behavior_in_a_restaurant">make customers stay longer</a> in a restaurant (while underestimating the length of their visit), thus spending more money — time flies when you’re enjoying yourself. An <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/25/style/the-smell-of-money.html">experiment an automaker conducted in the early ’90s</a> even tried to determine if spraying certain scents on salespeople would make them more likely to be perceived as trustworthy, though it’s unclear what the outcome of this trial was.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How do hotels decide on a “signature scent”?</h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hotels and resorts spend a lot of time matching up their brand image to a signature scent, especially today. (Although it might be very similar to a <a href="https://fashionista.com/2019/01/le-labo-santal-33-perfume-trend-over">popular fragrance</a>.) One of the trends in hotel design right now is to play up how distinct a space feels.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Everything has become hyper-local now,” says Lori Mukoyama, a global leader of hospitality practice at the architecture and design firm Gensler. “Gone are the days where we’re stamping out the same brand, exactly the same, in 50 different cities across the world.” Having a tailor-made scent is key to building the feel of a personalized hotel lobby, according to Mukoyama.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I totally feel like it’s a logo in the air,” says Fabrigas, whose company develops ambient scents for businesses. “It’s a backdrop against which all else plays.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For some brands, having one signature scent isn’t enough. The now-closed <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Travel/mirage-las-vegas-closing-after-34-years/story?id=110303490">Mirage hotel</a> in Las Vegas, for example, used two separate fragrances for two separate spaces. In the lobby, it used a buttery coconut vanilla scent, Reding says, to evoke a tropical theme that matched the <a href="https://reefbuilders.com/2024/07/11/mirage-hotels-famous-20000-gallon-aquarium-is-no-more/">giant aquarium</a> behind the front desk. “It gives us a feeling of warmth and safety,” he says. But then the casino used something more energizing — a “tropical cocoa mango” — to give it a party-feel that might encourage exciting risk-taking rather than relaxation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One reason why environmental scenting is so commonplace in hotels is that it’s a place where the perception of cleanliness is sacrosanct. Reding says hotels often tell him they want something that smells fresh and clean, but tend to eschew anything that might remind people of cleaning products. It goes back to how we associate smells with certain contexts — a whiff of lemony Pine Sol is going to make you think of a bathroom, or a mop, rather than the luxurious, crisp cleanliness that hotels strive for.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For some, hotel fragrances are an olfactory delight they want to recreate in their own homes. Several online retailers sell hotel and resort scents for consumers — or at least, an approximation of their bespoke scent — and Reding says this is the bulk of his business today. But not everyone is a fan of scent marketing. What’s a good or bad smell is highly subjective, and people with sensitive noses in particular might bemoan not being able to escape a headache-inducing fragrance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“That&#8217;s what really makes it tricky&nbsp;— that you&#8217;re diffusing in public spaces without the public&#8217;s consent,” Reding says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Did you donate to charity in the past, but no longer do so?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the answer is yes, you’re not alone. For the <a href="https://philanthropy.indianapolis.iu.edu/news-events/news/_news/2023/giving-usa-total-us-charitable-giving-declined-in-2022-to-49933-billion-following-two-years-of-record-generosity.html">second year in a row</a>, the philanthropy research foundation <a href="https://apnews.com/article/giving-usa-report-philanthropy-indiana-university-lilly-school-9a6f1dedf4f88b5809debf75cbda02a2">Giving USA reported</a> that fewer Americans are donating to nonprofits than they used to, and the total amount of giving is declining once inflation is taken into account.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some in the philanthropy world are calling it a “<a href="https://www.philanthropy.com/package/fundraising-and-the-generosity-crisis">generosity crisis</a>” — fewer than half of American households now give cash to charity. <a href="https://nonprofitquarterly.org/speculations-on-the-roots-of-the-loss-of-small-u-s-donors-what-nonprofits-can-do/">Twenty million fewer households donated</a> in 2016 than in 2000. And the money that is being given is increasingly coming from <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2022/9/27/23373134/philanthropy-giving-decline-billionaires">a small number of super-wealthy people</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The only surprising thing about these findings, to me, though, is that anyone would be surprised.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why aren’t people donating to nonprofits?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One big, and rather intuitive, reason why fewer people are donating money to registered nonprofits these days is the general state of the economy. The number of donors started sharply declining <a href="https://nonprofitquarterly.org/speculations-on-the-roots-of-the-loss-of-small-u-s-donors-what-nonprofits-can-do/">right around the tail end of the Great Recession</a> in 2010. Of households that stopped donating money to nonprofits between 2000 and 2016, most earned less than $50,000 per year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.philanthropy.com/article/demographic-trends-push-giving-down-among-young-people/">Young people are also less likely to donate</a> to registered charities than older people. The relationship between age and willingness to give away money makes sense — the younger you are, the fewer years you’ve had to earn money.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Vox guide to giving</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">The holiday season is giving season. This year, Vox is exploring every element of charitable giving — from making the case for donating 10 percent of your income, to recommending specific charities for specific causes, to explaining what you can do to make a difference beyond donations. <a href="https://www.vox.com/charitable-giving">You can find all of our giving guide stories here</a>.</p>
</div>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading"></h1>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the age gap has grown over the past few years. In part, this can be explained by high costs of living, student loan debt, and inflation. “Younger donors simply don’t have money right now,” said <a href="https://www.philanthropy.com/author/rasheeda-childress">Rasheeda Childress</a>, a senior editor at The Chronicle of Philanthropy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But we can’t blame the economy for everything. The <a href="https://www.philanthropy.com/article/what-philanthropy-and-nonprofits-lose-as-religion-fades">decline in organized religion</a> might be the biggest factor in the decline in charitable giving.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Religious institutions are major hubs of philanthropy — highly religious adults <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2016/04/12/how-highly-religious-americans-lives-are-different-from-others/">volunteer nearly twice as much as other adults</a> in the US, and roughly half of them volunteer through a religious organization. A report by the <a href="https://dogood.umd.edu/research-impact/publications">Do Good Institute</a>, which conducts philanthropy research at the University of Maryland, found that people who belong to community groups, religious or otherwise, are more likely than others to volunteer and donate money.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not that religion necessarily makes people more charitable. <a href="https://dogood.umd.edu/research-impact/publications/social-connectedness-and-generosity-look-how-associational-life-and">Community does</a> — specifically, community where charitable giving is centered and expected.&nbsp;But as <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/642548/church-attendance-declined-religious-groups.aspx#:~:text=A%20decade%20ago%2C%20the%20figure,do%20not%20attend%20services%20regularly.">participation in organized religion declines</a>, so does giving.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyond religion, people seem to be <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/gallup-confidence-in-us-institutions-continues-to-decline/7573289.html">losing faith in institutions</a> — the government, the media, and <a href="https://www.edelman.com/sites/g/files/aatuss191/files/2022-01/2022%20Edelman%20Trust%20Barometer%20FINAL_Jan25.pdf#page=40">nongovernmental organizations like nonprofits</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nonprofits are one of the most trusted institutions in the US, but only <a href="https://independentsector.org/blog/fourth-annual-report-on-trust-in-civil-society-reveals-decline-in-nonprofit-trust/">about half of Americans have faith in them</a>. Political polarization may be partially to blame — organizations that are colored by partisan values, like religious organizations and civil rights groups, <a href="https://independentsector.org/resource/trust-in-civil-society/">are less trusted</a> than nonprofits focused on more bipartisan issues like wildlife conservation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For <a href="https://nonprofitquarterly.org/speculations-on-the-roots-of-the-loss-of-small-u-s-donors-what-nonprofits-can-do/">Nonprofit Quarterly</a>, Ruth McCambridge speculated that, as the gap between rich and poor gets wider, people are more likely to view nonprofits as “compliant handmaidens to an unjust system.” It’s not that people are less generous, it’s because they don’t trust organizations that cater to the rich donors they depend on, McCambridge added.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, a survey of over 2,100 adults in the US found that, of those who stopped giving to charity over the past five years, 47 percent said that <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/07/06/why-is-charitable-giving-down-ultrawealthy-not-paying-fair-share-survey/">they chose to stop donating</a> because they believed wealthier households should be pulling more weight.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Historically, reaching out to small-dollar donors has not been an effective use of time for nonprofits, even though many nonprofits — particularly those in less affluent communities — <a href="https://www.philanthropy.com/article/the-decline-in-small-dollar-giving-hurts-bottom-lines-and-democracy">depend on recurring small donations to stay afloat</a>. Why pour energy into persuading 10,000 people to donate $10 each, when you could get all $100,000 from one wealthy donor?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s almost becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy,” Childress said. By catering to the wealthy, nonprofits are “going after where the money is right now, but they’re not growing where the money is going to be.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The charitable tax deduction system was literally <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-history-review/article/abs/founders-fortunes-and-philanthropy-a-history-of-the-us-charitablecontribution-deduction/F6328324C2B48D598786CC66BDC5B0BF">designed to benefit the rich</a>. If you don’t earn a lot of money, claiming charitable donations <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/9/3/20840955/charitable-deduction-tax-rich-billionaire-philanthropy">doesn’t make much sense</a>, especially after former <a href="https://time.com/5609173/americans-giving-to-charity-trump-tax-law/">President Trump’s tax cuts in 2017</a> reduced the need to itemize deductions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A totally reasonable reaction might be, “Who cares? Rich people have money to spare. Let them pay for everything!”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But if we let rich people dominate philanthropy, we give them the power to shape how nonprofits operate. “You don’t want to be beholden to anyone,” said <a href="https://cep.org/people/phil-buchanan/">Phil Buchanan</a>, president of the Center for Effective Philanthropy and author of <a href="https://cep.org/giving-done-right/"><em>Giving Done Right</em></a>. If an organization that ought to be grounded in generosity and community is visibly propped up by a handful of billionaires and corporations, it’s not a great look.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If donors are not immersed in the community an organization is trying to serve, they’re less likely to understand what that community really needs. And centering the wealthy certainly doesn’t convince already-suspicious young middle-class adults to get involved.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How can we measure generosity if the IRS doesn’t know about it?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.thegenerositycommission.org/">The Generosity Commission</a>, a nonpartisan team led by The Giving Institute and Giving USA Foundation, has spent years <a href="https://www.thegenerositycommission.org/our-work/">trying to figure out</a> where all the non-wealthy donors have gone. “There’s certainly a monetary giving crisis,” Childress said. But “if you look at the data, people are being generous” — just not in ways that we’re familiar with.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In other words, the apparent “generosity crisis” may not be a crisis of generosity at all.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Measuring generosity is a bit like measuring “happiness” or “loneliness” — weird. Trying to nail down a feeling with statistics requires quantifying something that can’t really be quantified. Inevitably, the final score will be an imperfect reflection of the feeling, heavily skewed by what’s possible to measure.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, measuring cash donations to registered charities is relatively simple. These gifts are reported to the IRS, leaving behind a paper trail that can be tracked by organizations like Giving USA. A <a href="https://pacscenter.stanford.edu/publication/how-we-give-now-conversations-across-the-united-states/">2020 study</a> conducted by the <a href="https://pacscenter.stanford.edu/">Stanford Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society</a> found that people in the US give in ways that extend far beyond tax-exempt donations to nonprofits.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These forms of giving are harder to trace, though. When I gift a guitar to my neighbor who wants to teach his kid to play, for example, there’s no official record of that transaction — just a couple Facebook comments and a face-to-face conversation. The IRS can’t trace it, so in the eyes of Giving USA, it never happened.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.globalgiving.org/learn/what-is-mutual-aid">Mutual aid</a> — or the reciprocal exchange of resources within a community — has existed worldwide for thousands of years. But it entered the spotlight in the US <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21754625/covid-19-pandemic-generosity-charity-cash-transfers">during the pandemic</a> through community fridges, child care collectives, and healthcare funds.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For a population that increasingly <a href="https://ourpublicservice.org/publications/state-of-trust-in-government-2024/">distrusts political institutions</a> and <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/hunger-social-cravings-neuroscience-1123">craves human connection</a>, mutual aid can <a href="https://independentsector.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Trust-Report-Independent-Sector-May-19-2022-1.pdf">feel more impactful</a> than donating to a nonprofit — whether it really is or not. A survey conducted by <a href="https://www.givingtuesday.org/blog/a-closer-look-at-informal-giving-mutual-aid-and-community-care-in-a-global-context/">GivingTuesday</a>, the organization behind the post-Thanksgiving global day of giving, found that 76 percent of respondents between 18 and 34 prefer to give directly to individuals in need, and not nonprofits — only 46 percent of those over 50 agreed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Donations <a href="https://www.fundera.com/resources/crowdfunding-statistics">raised through crowdfunding</a> also grew 33.7 percent in 2022, with 6,455,080 crowdfunding campaigns launched across the world that year. The crowdfunding market is projected to grow to <a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/409841468327411701/pdf/840000WP0Box380crowdfunding0study00.pdf">as much as $300 billion by 2030</a>. But while a GoFundMe donation counts as “generous” in my book, Giving USA can’t track it — so, we have a “generosity crisis.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But we know that humans, for the most part, are generous. In 2022, <a href="https://www.cafonline.org/docs/default-source/about-us-research/wgi_report_2023_final.pdf">the Charities Aid Foundation found</a> that 4.2 billion people — 72 percent of the world’s adult population — gave money, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23969939/volunteering-charity-nonprofit-busy-time-remote-work-schedule-skills">time</a>, or service to someone they didn’t know that year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the past several years, the <a href="https://www.thegenerositycommission.org/our-work/">Generosity Commission</a> has been <a href="https://www.thegenerositycommission.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/TGC-Launch-Press-Release-FINAL_for-website.pdf">working to “tell the full story” of generosity</a>, so nonprofits can better understand how people want to make their communities better. In a <a href="https://www.thegenerositycommission.org/report/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.thegenerositycommission.org/report/">report published in September</a>, the Generosity Commission identified <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/371996/volunteering-charity-giving-philanthropy-generosity" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/371996/volunteering-charity-giving-philanthropy-generosity">several possible explanations</a> for declines in volunteering and donations, including the Great Recession, declining religiosity, and delays in traditional adult milestones like marriage, home ownership, and parenthood — but they note that further research is necessary.<br></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>So, what should we do?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To be clear: nonprofits do a lot of good, both in the US and abroad. Especially in smaller, less affluent communities, they <a href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/about-us/press-room/forbes-largest-charity-2023#:~:text=Food%20banks%20in%20the%20Feeding,people%20are%20experiencing%20food%20insecurity.">absolutely depend</a> on normal, not-super-rich donors like me — and we’re not pulling our weight.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One could argue that, because I am, temporarily, a member of <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/15/23874111/charity-philanthropy-americans-global-rich">the richest 1 percent of the world’s population</a>, I am morally obligated to donate a portion of my income to charity. At least in theory, if I schedule recurring donations to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23976937/charity-giving-tuesday-givewell-ten-percent">highly effective charities</a>, I could save a number of lives in nations where my money will stretch much farther than it can in the US.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But such effective philanthropy has always been the exception — in fact, giving to international causes <a href="https://theangelettigroup.com/insights-from-the-2024-giving-usa-report-key-trends-for-fundraisers/">actually declined</a> by 1.6 percent after inflation in 2023. The vast majority of charitable giving in the US is domestic. Most donors aren’t paying for malaria-preventing bed nets overseas — they’re mainly <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/6/3/8723189/john-paulson-harvard-donation">donating to Ivy League schools</a> and <a href="https://smartasset.com/data-studies/where-do-americans-give-the-most-to-charity-2021">religious organizations</a>. Just this week, Michael Bloomberg <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/08/us/bloomberg-donation-johns-hopkins-medical.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">donated $1 billion dollars to Johns Hopkins University</a> to pay for med students’ tuition.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If I were in med school, I’d be thrilled — student debt sucks. But med students, especially from prestigious schools like the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-medical-schools/research-rankings">No. 2 ranked Hopkins</a>, generally go on to make loads of money. Helping them out is less effective than, say, sending $1 billion dollars to <a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwv7O0BhDwARIsAC0sjWNsP9J1XQ3sfuXZ_fsGu6I7UTXbDQ_m9v83r8q5rNlxpa7CPm4HhLUaAuyCEALw_wcB">directly help flood survivors in Kenya</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Personally, I don’t currently donate a portion of my income to registered nonprofits, highly effective or otherwise. I’m still earning back the savings I drained as a freelance journalist (after spending six years on a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03472-3">grad student stipend</a>). Michael Bloomberg didn’t pay for my Ivy League education, and with tens of thousands of dollars in undergraduate student loan debt hanging over my head, I laugh every time I receive, and promptly delete, a fundraising text from my alma mater.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But I do give. I regularly support Kickstarter campaigns, gift household items to my neighbors, and donate to a mutual aid fund supporting sex workers in my community. That makes me like other “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zillennials">zillennials</a>” in my cohort, who tend to direct their money <a href="https://www.philanthropy.com/article/generosity-report-shows-younger-donors-less-trusting-of-charities-than-older-people">toward more informal charities than traditional nonprofits</a>. That may not necessarily count in the IRS’s statistics, but I don’t think it’s fair to call us ungenerous.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/359160/biden-abc-news-interview-drop-out">current state of democracy writ large</a>, it makes perfect sense to me that so many of us value direct, tangible impact over indirect measurements of “effectiveness.” Informal community-centered giving can <em>feel</em> more impactful, even if it doesn’t score as high on a utilitarian scale. And what giving within your community can do — whether in the form of cash, time, or stuff — is build connection at a moment when <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/5/3/23707936/surgeon-general-loneliness-epidemic-report">we need it more than ever</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Middle-class people aren’t unwilling to give. They just seem to be giving differently, and philanthropic organizations are still figuring out how to measure charitable giving beyond tax-deductible donations to 501(c)(3) nonprofits.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether channeled through money or not, people perform acts of kindness all the time. Hopefully, the philanthropy sector will start to see them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nearly three years into Russia’s full-scale invasion into Ukraine, the Biden administration gave Ukraine the green light to strike deeper into Russia using US-supplied longer-range missiles.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Ukrainian military quickly put that permission to use: On Tuesday, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/11/19/ukraine-russia-atacms-bryansk/">it attacked a weapons depot</a> about 70 miles from Ukraine’s border. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US and NATO allies have hesitated to provide sophisticated weapons like the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) that Ukraine used in that attack, fearing Russian retaliation against NATO sites — or even nuclear escalation.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Raising that specter on Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-nuclear-doctrine-putin-ukraine-war-b5ee115aa2099fa247f630e16da861d8">new version of the country’s nuclear doctrine</a>, which would theoretically make it easier for Russia to use nuclear weapons in this conflict. The new doctrine specifically allows for a nuclear strike in response to a strike with conventional weapons — like the longer-range missiles Ukraine now has permission to use — if those attacks involved the “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-nuclear-doctrine-putin-91f20e0c9b0f9e5eaa3ed97c35789898">participation or support of a nuclear power,</a>” likely referring to the US and other NATO countries.<strong> </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/353796/us-weapons-ukraine-russia-putin-escalation-nuclear">Throughout the war</a>, Russian leaders have threatened to <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/369035/kursk-nuclear-escalation-zelenskyy-putin">use the country’s nuclear weapons</a> in the conflict if they believed they were necessary. That has led Ukraine’s allies to be cautious about the amount of aid they’ve offered, and has led to limits on what Ukrainian troops can do with those weapons.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ukraine’s new ability to use longer range missiles to strike Russian territory — and Putin’s confirmation of new nuclear rules — have <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/353796/us-weapons-ukraine-russia-putin-escalation-nuclear">again raised the question</a>: Could Russia’s war in Ukraine escalate into a nuclear conflict?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Throughout the war, experts have downplayed Russia’s appetite for nuclear conflict. But the rapid escalation of the conflict in recent weeks, and particularly Russia’s new nuclear doctrine, could mean that possibility is closer than before. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the chances that Ukraine’s new missile capabilities lead to nuclear escalation?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the beginning of Russia’s invasion into Ukraine, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putins-nuclear-warnings-since-russia-invaded-ukraine-2024-03-13/">Putin and other officials have made statements</a>, both explicit and oblique, that Russia might be pressed to use nuclear weapons. Most experts agree that the risk of<a href="https://thebulletin.org/2024/02/putin-threatens-again-an-updated-timeline-of-commentary-on-potential-nuclear-escalation-of-the-russia-ukraine-war/"> Russia using such weapons is low</a>, but it’s not negligible.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A previous version of the doctrine Russia updated on Tuesday said the country would tap into its nuclear arsenal <a href="https://nuclearnetwork.csis.org/why-russia-is-changing-its-nuclear-doctrine-now/">only under four circumstances</a>: receiving credible data of a ballistic missile attack; nuclear or other WMD attack against Russia or its allies; attacks on Russian nuclear infrastructure; or conventional weapons attacks that threaten “the very existence” of the Russian state. Under the new doctrine,<strong> </strong>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov  indicated attacks like Ukraine’s on Tuesday <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-nuclear-doctrine-putin-ukraine-war-b5ee115aa2099fa247f630e16da861d8">could trigger a nuclear response</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That change shouldn’t be taken as a response to Ukraine’s strike, however, Samuel Charap, distinguished chair in Russia and Eurasia policy and senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation, told Vox.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The new doctrine “has <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-vladimir-putin-ramps-up-nuclear-threats-signal-us-ukraine-nato-missiles-joe-biden/">been in the works for a long time</a>,” Charap said. “The timing may be tied to the attack of decision, but the substance has been brewing for a while.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Putin and other officials have not, it seems, made major preparations to actually use nuclear weapons. However as the war continues, Putin and his officials’ threats have become clearer and have involved actually demonstrating nuclear capacity. As recently as July, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/what-are-tactical-nuclear-weapons-why-is-russia-holding-drills-2024-06-11/">Russia and Belarus held joint military exercises</a> that demonstrated Russia’s tactical nuclear capabilities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Initially, the US and NATO <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/bidens-green-light-highlights-the-diminishing-power-of-putins-red-lines/">responded to Russia’s threats with caution</a>, denying Ukraine weapons or placing restrictions on their use. But over the past three years, as little has come of Putin’s threats of nuclear war and of war with NATO, Western countries have given Ukraine access to increasingly sophisticated weapons systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Besides the risk of nuclear war, Ukraine’s allies have had to balance concerns that they might be more directly drawn into the conflict. Though Ukraine is not a member of the NATO military alliance, Putin has previously warned that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/europe/putin-warns-nato-missiles-hnk-latam-intl/index.html">permission to use longer-range missiles</a> (like those used Tuesday) inside Russia would be considered a NATO attack on Russia.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-nuclear-doctrine-putin-91f20e0c9b0f9e5eaa3ed97c35789898">US officials speaking to the Associated Press</a> said they had anticipated a response from Russia, but that Russian officials’ warnings were viewed as inflammatory rhetoric, and would not provoke any change in US action. That suggests the US does not believe there’s much danger in Russia using its nuclear capabilities in the near term.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Russia “never explicitly, on the official level, warned that they would use nuclear weapons in response to X, Y, or Z,” Charap said. “The only explicit red line that they&#8217;ve ever drawn was on the use of long range, US [or] Western weapons to strike into Russia that has now been crossed. So I can imagine people will expect their response, and it will not just be with words.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After 1,000 days of the war, the conflict appears to be approaching an impasse. There’s no clear path to decisive victory for either side. Each side is deploying new tactics to try to gain an advantage: Ukraine with longer range missiles; Russia with <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2796pdm1lo">recruits from North Korea</a>. And now, Russia and the US seem to be simply responding to each others’ escalations: Russia put North Korean troops on the battlefield, the US responded by authorizing the use of longer range missiles, and Russia released its new nuclear posture. That sort of behavior is both reckless and dangerous, Charap said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“You are in a spiral that is the definition of a tit-for-tat dynamic, where your actions are driven not by your goals, but by countering what the other guy is doing,” Charap said. “That only goes in one direction — continuing to up the ante. The spiral dynamic just continues until somebody gets out of control or somebody decides to stop it.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of my colleagues has a theory: If you know the Rizzler, you might not have been&nbsp;surprised that Kamala Harris lost the presidential election. If the name Big Justice doesn’t sound familiar, the results from the election may have been a total shock.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Back in March, a Florida-based father-and-son duo named A.J. and Big Justice posted a TikTok expressing their enthusiasm for Costco Wholesale and its food court items. The pair — as well as their extended universe of relatives and non-relatives, like the Rizzler — have since become viral sensations, cementing their internet celebrity status with an appearance on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pl6Dg0YB3w"><em>The</em> <em>Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</em></a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The Costco Guys, the Rizzler, and this whole kind of straight-bro-coded mediaverse is a stand-in for how siloed media consumption on the left has gotten,” says Vox’s senior politics reporter Christian Paz. As a result, Paz suggests, some progressives may have “missed a bit of the political evolution the country was going through.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It asks the question: Does the rise of the Costco Guys — who are in no way explicitly political — help explain a <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/385292/pop-culture-maga-trump-election-morgan-wallen-post-malone-twisters-zach-bryan">cultural landscape</a> shaped by <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/383364/gen-z-podcasts-trump-win-joe-rogan-bros">straight bros</a> that presaged a Donald Trump win? Or is their presence on the internet something more innocuous, a throwback to the early days of YouTube when regular people would go viral and get airtime on <em>Ellen</em>? The answers are a little complicated.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>A history of the Costco Guys cinematic universe&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While they officially became viral sensations back in March, the Costco Guys’ celebrity has been years in the making. Originally from New Jersey, the family’s patriarch, Andrew Befumo (a.k.a. A.J.), was a professional wrestler who went by “the American Powerchild Eric Justice” before he retired and went into mortgage lending. About a decade ago, he started a family YouTube channel, featuring his wife Erika, his daughter Ashley, and his son Eric (a.k.a. Big Justice), called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@allbefumodup9624">All Befumo’d Up</a>. The channel featured the sort of mundane if heartwarming content you might see on a slice-of-life reality show, like cooking meals, attending an <em>Avengers</em> screening, and singing Christmas songs. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since 2022, Befumo has mostly been making videos on TikTok (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@a.j.befumo?lang=en">@a.j.befumo</a>) with Eric — who he nicknamed Big Justice after his wrestling persona — with occasional appearances from Ashley and Erika, “The Mother of Big Justice.” Early videos show the father and son attending baseball games and reviewing local restaurants using their food review scale known as the “boom meter.” Delicious foods get a “boom!” Underwhelming or flat-out gross foods get a “doom!” — which is rare.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They also recorded themselves running regular errands, like going to retail chains, with an unusual amount of enthusiasm. However, it’s that level of excitement in depicting the suburban, middle-class experience that’s part of their draw. While many famous vloggers are filming tropical vacations and helicopter rides, the Costco Guys treat a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@a.j.befumo/video/7190051902590340398">trip to Party City</a> like a special occasion.&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These videos raked up hundreds of thousands of views and earned them some sponsorship deals. However, it wasn’t until this past spring that their affinity for Costco would give them a ticket to internet stardom. On March 1, they posted their own version of the viral <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/were-x-of-course-we-y">“We’re X, of course we Y” trend</a> about their love for the wholesale chain. “We’re Costco guys,” says Big Justice at the beginning of the video. “Of course we go shopping while eating a chicken bake.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By July, they released a Beastie Boys-esque theme <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@a.j.befumo/video/7390004338837523754?lang=en">song</a>, featuring Erika and Ashley, called “We Bring the Boom” that now has 14.4 million views. Since then, they’ve incorporated Costco and their extremely limited food court menu into much of their content, having guests rate the store’s “double chunk chocolate cookie” and come with them on shopping trips. They’ve released several remixes of “We Bring the Boom,” including a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@a.j.befumo/video/7437627643073137966">Christmas edition</a> most recently. Ashley and Erika also emerged from the background of A.J. and Big Justice’s videos, creating their own page in October, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ashleyandmamajustice?lang=en">@ashleyandmamajustice</a>, where they mostly rank and review desserts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite how normal these guys seem, viewers still feel like they’re watching something off-kilter and idiosyncratic. They have a wide-eyed, unflinching gaze — almost like they’re being held hostage and forced to read off a teleprompter — when staring into the camera. While you could argue that their zeal is earnest, their mannerisms are unnatural and stilted. The rap songs are inarguably cringe.&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the months since their initial virality, the “Costco boys” label has extended beyond the Befumo family to include some of their most frequent collaborators. Most notable among them is <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@itztherizzler?lang=en">the Rizzler</a> (a.k.a Christian Joseph), a kid influencer whose father began posting videos of him on TikTok in 2020. His father dubbed him the Rizzler, based on the slang term “rizz” that’s short for charisma. He’s since popularized the “rizz face,” a half-serious-half-smirking look similar to the alt-right meme/pose known as the <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/chad-facing-gen-z-lip-sync-face">“Chad face”</a> or more broadly the “Gen Z Lip Sync Face.” A.J. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@costcoguysfootage/video/7437699620232449326">said in an interview</a> that a TikTok of the Rizzler joking around while wearing an ill-fitting Black Panther costume led him to contact the Rizzler’s father about collaborating. Other frequent guest stars include <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@yourcousinangelo?lang=en">cousin Angelo</a>, who may or may not actually be related to the Befumo family, and a TikTok dancer named <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jerseyyjoe?lang=en">Jersey Joe</a> who posts videos dancing to Jersey Club music.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Do the Costco Guys really belong to the “bro internet”?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since their rise to prominence, the Costco Guys have earned a questionable reputation on social media as <a href="https://x.com/akingofburbank/status/1858202143334752604">alleged</a> <a href="https://x.com/dominicknero/status/1854680391707230226">Trump</a> <a href="https://x.com/abracaddavid/status/1855478745185784141">supporters</a> if not avatars for an increasingly MAGA-fied internet. The evidence is mostly superficial. They live in Florida. They spend much of their time in the big-box stores closely identified with the suburban American experience. Their logos and merch prominently feature the American flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There&#8217;s a lot of stuff about their content that is seemingly Republican-coded,” says EJ Dickson, senior culture writer at The Cut. “The main one is that they&#8217;re part of a demographic of white men in a state that overwhelmingly voted for Trump. The other aspect is the American flag imagery — very early on in their career. Actually, when A.J. was working in the mortgage industry, he was making content in front of an American flag.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other examples are more eyebrow-raising.&nbsp; Their fanbase —&nbsp;at least based on their account’s commenters — leans heavily white and male; comments on <a href="https://x.com/scubaryan_/status/1846675777271611523">one Costco Guys’ livestream</a> featured rows upon rows of the N-word in all-caps. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@impaulsive/video/7435041741549374762">Logan Paul</a> knows about them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unlike Paul, though, the Befumo family has largely — and intentionally — avoided politics in their journey to fame. In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jxB2p7yLaw">interview with internet reporter Taylor Lorenz</a>, A.J. said that they’ve been approached by presidential candidates to collaborate but that political content was “not in their wheelhouse.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Possible political affiliations aside, Dickson, who profiled A.J. and Big Justice for<em> </em><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/aj-and-big-justice-costco-guys-tiktok-song-1235063207/">Rolling Stone</a> in July, doesn&#8217;t think this accounts for all of their popularity.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I do think people genuinely enjoy seeing this guy and his kid just being goofy and making this incredibly silly content together,” says Dickson. “A lot of people think their content is charming in its way.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She also argues that their videos may be more subversive than progressives online give them credit for: a father and son spending an immense amount of time together, showing each other affection and bonding over food. She compares them to bona fide right-wing personality Andrew Tate, who “built his brand in the thrall of his domineering and withholding father.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The fact that A.J. is monetizing time with his family has not gone without criticism. A <a href="https://x.com/CensoredMen/status/1828472916520190250">behind-the-scenes video</a> of A.J. sternly directing Big Justice in a video made the rounds in August and <a href="https://x.com/EPM106/status/1828869132449730707">reinforced the assumption</a> by some that he’s a stage dad. Still, the image of fatherhood he promotes is adoring and hands-on.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Even though [A.J.] performs masculinity with the way he looks and the workouts, he&#8217;s kind of doing the opposite by virtue of just clowning around on camera and spending a lot of time with his kid,” says Dickson.&nbsp;<br>Regardless, the Costco Guys do ultimately exist in a <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/383364/gen-z-podcasts-trump-win-joe-rogan-bros">lineage of influencers</a> and celebrities that draw straight, white, right-leaning male fans. Several moments this year have shown, from the conservative appropriation of <a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2024/03/sydney-sweeney-snl-hooters-glen-powell.html">Sydney Sweeney</a> to the overnight success of <a href="https://www.vox.com/internet-culture/357813/hawk-tuah-girl-meme-tiktok-explained">Hawk Tuah Girl</a>, that it’s not totally up to public figures to decide who they appeal to.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly distanced himself from <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce">Project 2025</a>, a <a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf">900-page opus </a>of conservative policy recommendations published by the Heritage Foundation, a right-wing think tank. But he has nominated two of the document’s co-authors to Cabinet-level positions, and many others served in his first administration, which suggests the document may be a window into what the next four years could bring.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Monday, Trump nominated Brendan Carr, who wrote Project 2025’s chapter on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), to head the agency. He has also appointed Tom Homan, a Heritage Foundation fellow named as a contributor to Project 2025, as his so-called “border czar.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/22/us/politics/project-2025-trump-heritage-foundation.html">Eighteen of the 40 co-authors and editors</a><strong> </strong>of the report served in the first Trump administration. Among them are Ken Cuccinelli, former acting deputy secretary of Homeland Security; Christopher Miller, former acting Defense secretary; and Russell T. Vought, former director of the Office of Management and Budget. Vought is reportedly being considered for<a href="https://x.com/KFaulders/status/1858834604355989917"> another top post in the coming administration</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During the 2024 campaign, Democrats sought to tie Trump to Project 2025 — a policy agenda they decried as “<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/04/house-democrats-project-2025-00182601">dangerous</a>” and “<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/04/house-democrats-project-2025-00182601">shockingly radical</a>” — framing it as a blueprint for his second term that is much more detailed than the <a href="https://prod-static.gop.com/media/RNC2024-Platform.pdf?_gl=1*llhkp8*_gcl_au*MTgwODMxODIyOC4xNzMxNjg2NDM2&amp;_ga=2.200856430.1597472303.1731861841-1459843538.1731686436">GOP’s 28-page platform</a>. The document focuses on proposals to expand presidential power, gut the federal bureaucracy, enact the priorities of the religious right, deregulate, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump at one point <a href="https://x.com/TrumpDailyPosts/status/1809249601595318585">claimed</a> to have “no idea who is behind it” and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/09/11/highlights-debate-memorable-lines-trump-harris/">denied any connection with it</a> when asked about it at the September presidential debate: “I have nothing to do with Project 2025. I haven’t read it. I don’t want to read it purposely. I’m not going to read it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, since Trump’s reelection, some of his allies have suggested that the document was <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/188097/steve-bannon-donald-trump-project-2025">always intended to be the playbook for his second term</a>. Trump’s nominations of Carr and Homan seem to support that idea. Neither will <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/17/brendan-carr-fcc-trump-pick-00190075">require additional Senate confirmation</a> to take on their roles; through them, they will be in a position to advocate for Project 2025’s ideas on communications and immigration, respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s what we know about Carr and Homan and the ideas relevant to their posts outlined in Project 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Brendan Carr</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Carr, a pick <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/11/18/how-elon-musk-could-benefit-from-trumps-fcc-nominee-brendan-carr/">approved by Trump’s billionaire backer Elon Musk,</a> currently serves as the senior Republican on the FCC and was previously its general counsel. Now, he is set to take the helm, steering the commission toward a hardline stance against Big Tech and what he describes in Project 2025 as its “attempts to drive diverse political viewpoints from the digital town square.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Among his key proposals in Project 2025 is ending legal immunities for internet platforms hosting user-generated content under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. That would require stricter content moderation on the part of these platforms or cutbacks to the degree to which users can contribute content, fundamentally changing the way people interact online.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, he wrote in Project 2025 that he wants to ensure that “Internet companies no longer have carte blanche to censor protected speech.” That echoes some of Trump’s other Cabinet picks who are seeking to crack down on “<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-wants-end-wokeness-education-051819573.html">wokeness</a>” in their respective agencies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Carr also supports <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24094839/tiktok-ban-bill-congress-pass-biden">efforts to block</a> TikTok in the US, identifying it, along with the Chinese smartphone producer Huawei, as a national security threat. He claims in Project 2025 that TikTok is part of a Chinese “foreign influence campaign by determining the news and information that the app feeds to millions of Americans.” However, there are reasons to believe that a TikTok ban would, as <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/24100104/banning-tiktok-us-senate-ineffective-and-harmful-bill">Vox previously reported</a>, have “serious consequences for online expression,” which include shutting down what has proved a hub for activism.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Carr may have some difficulty enacting his agenda initially, however. The commission will have a 3-2 Democratic majority until next June when Trump will be able to nominate a new member.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Tom Homan</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Homan isn’t named as an author of a particular chapter of Project 2025 but as an overall contributor —&nbsp;and some of his <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383845/trump-mass-deportations-immigration-family-separation">stated hardline views on immigration and the border</a> are reflected in the report.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He started out as a Border Patrol agent in the 1980s and worked his way up through the immigration agencies, becoming the head of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s removal operations arm under former President Barack Obama. There, he presided over the most immigrants ever deported in a single year, exceeding 400,000. Under Trump, Homan served as acting director of ICE but was never confirmed to the position permanently by the Senate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Homan’s new role as “border czar” appears to involve far-reaching responsibilities. Those include overseeing the implementation of Trump’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies">mass deportations policy</a> — the centerpiece of the former president’s immigration agenda.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That means Homan’s responsibilities will likely intersect with many of the numerous immigration priorities outlined in Project 2025. Here is a non-exhaustive list of what’s included:</p>

<ul>
<li>Expanding the use of a legal authority known as “expedited removal” to quickly deport immigrants who crossed the border without authorization.</li>



<li>Deporting immigrants even in currently protected, sensitive zones like churches.</li>



<li>Ending large-scale parole programs that the Biden administration has relied upon as a deportation shield for individuals from certain countries, including Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Ending programs like the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which has protected hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children from deportation.</li>



<li>Creating a new legal authority akin to the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/23719941/title-42-ending-border-biden-trump">Title 42 policy</a>, which was implemented by Trump and maintained by Biden to rapidly expel immigrants arriving on the US southern border on the <a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/research/programs/program-forced-migration-health/voices/epidemiologists-public-health-experts-reiterate-urgent-call-end-title-42">dubious public health grounds</a> of stopping the spread of Covid-19.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Homan has yet to indicate whether he or Trump fully endorses these policies. But unlike Trump, who claims to have never read Project 2025, Homan put his name to the document, and could draw from it in his new role.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Measles, mumps, and polio are supposed to be diseases of the past. In the early to mid-20th century, scientists developed <a href="https://www.vox.com/vaccines">vaccines</a> that effectively eliminated the risk of anyone getting sick or dying from illnesses that had killed millions over millennia of human history.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vaccines, alongside sanitized water and antibiotics, have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38798-z#:~:text=Vaccines%20have%20revolutionized%20modern%20medicine,their%20impact%20on%20disease%20prevention.">marked the epoch of modern medicine</a>. The US was at <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27375/w27375.pdf">the cutting edge of eliminating these diseases</a>, which helped propel life expectancy and economic growth in the postwar era. Montana native <a href="https://hillemanfilm.com/dr-hilleman">Maurice Hilleman</a>, the so-called father of modern vaccines, developed flu shots, hepatitis shots, and the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine in the 1950s and ’60s, which became virtually universally adopted among Americans.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Smallpox, the most common form of which has <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK221063/#:~:text=There%20are%20five%20known%20classifications,97%20percent%20case%20fatality%20rate.">a 30 percent fatality rate</a>, has been <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/index.html">eradicated</a>. Mitch McConnell, Republican titan of the Senate, may be the last major public figure <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-29908203">still afflicted by a childhood case of polio</a>, less than a century after <a href="https://www.fdrlibrary.org/polio">it paralyzed</a> a sitting American president. Measles likely infected millions of people annually in the US in the 1800s, although precise estimates from the era are hard to come by. In the early 1990s, thousands of people <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6878996/#:~:text=In%20the%20early%20decades%20of,reported%20in%20the%20United%20States.">died</a> from the disease every year. It was still infecting <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/209448">more than half a million and killing hundreds per year on average</a> in the 1950s and ’60s, before the vaccine debuted. Diphtheria, a deadly respiratory infection, killed more than 1,800 people annually between 1936 and 1945 as the vaccine against it was still being rolled out. It has not killed anybody in the United States in decades.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The vaccines that made this possible are among the most important achievements in human history. And yet many Americans appear to be losing faith in them, a worrying trend that could accelerate if President-elect Donald Trump succeeds in handing control of the top US health agency <a href="https://www.vox.com/health/385541/rfk-jr-trump-hhs-vaccines-fluoride">into the hands of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a>, the country’s foremost vaccine denier.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kennedy has spent much of his public career pushing the thoroughly <a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccines-and-other-conditions/autism">debunked</a> theory of a link between autism and childhood vaccines. He has <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/07/how-rfk-jr-falsely-denied-his-connection-to-a-deadly-measles-outbreak-in-samoa/">supported</a> an anti-vaccine group in Samoa, where measles vaccination rates have since fallen off; a 2019 outbreak <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/11/15/rfk-jr-global-health-samoa-kennedy/">killed</a> 83 people just a few months after Kennedy visited the island and met with anti-vaccine advocates. He has likewise <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/15/politics/robert-kennedy-covid-vaccine-antisemitism/index.html">cast doubt</a> on the safety and efficacy of the Covid vaccines, a position that helped nudge the lifelong Democrat toward Trump. After Kennedy dropped his own presidential campaign this year, he became Trump’s most influential health adviser and last week was nominated by the president-elect to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The day after Trump’s election, Kennedy <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-win-rfk-jr-says-wont-take-away-anybodys-vaccines-rcna178955">insisted</a> he would not “take away anybody’s vaccines.” Instead, he said, he planned to compile vaccine safety information so that people could make their own decisions. But vaccine safety has been extensively studied — and the negative effects Kennedy claims <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/autism/faq/index.html">remain undetected</a>. (Others in Trump’s orbit have <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-10-31/rfk-jr-wants-federal-health-data-so-he-can-show-vaccines-are-unsafe-trump-transition-co-chair-says">stated</a> that Kennedy will nevertheless use whatever information he finds to try to pull vaccines from the market.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Experts fear that his appointment will validate his anti-vaccine attitudes —&nbsp;and exacerbate the public’s growing ambivalence toward these vital public health measures.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As long-accepted, lifesaving public health measures increasingly become politically polarized, routine vaccination rates are <a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline-as-trump-heads-for-a-second-term/?utm_campaign=KFF-Covid&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_3P_iz266TOhPvf-NtGUHduQ39FGNRP47RiDP28gQOeYEbGXlMjpVZMTzhgEu_YcqZbEGDvcQz7M1-R2LmpLWUdPHOMQ&amp;_hsmi=334423251&amp;utm_content=334423251&amp;utm_source=hs_email">rapidly declining in much of the US</a>. In the 2019–2020 school year, three states had less than 90 percent of K–12 students vaccinated against measles, mumps, and rubella. By the 2023–2024 school year, 14 states had fallen below that threshold. The number of states with more than 95 percent of schoolchildren vaccinated — the preferred level of coverage to prevent outbreaks — dropped from 20 to 11 during that same period.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is no surprise then that the number of US measles cases <a href="https://abc7.com/post/global-measles-cases-rise-health-officials-tell-us-what-la-county-is-doing-right-vaccine/15546618/#:~:text=The%20World%20Health%20Organization%20reports,compared%20to%20four%20in%202023.">more than quadrupled</a> from 2023 to 2024. Nobody has died of measles in the US <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-cases-states-2024-more-than-2023/">since 2015</a>, but if vaccination rates continue to decline, this highly contagious disease (one person can infect <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28757186/#:~:text=For%20measles%2C%20R0%20is,in%20a%20totally%20susceptible%20population.">more than a dozen other people</a>) will spread with increasing ease, which raises the risk that American kids could die.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We know how to prevent that. We’ve had remarkably safe, effective shots for decades. We just need to keep using them.</p>

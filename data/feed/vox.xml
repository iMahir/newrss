<p class="has-text-align-none">Since Harris became the likely Democratic nominee at the end of July, celebrities have poured in to support and endorse her. Some have coordinated with the campaign, and others — like Charli XCX — expressed their backing on their own. Other notable names who’ve chimed in include billionaire Mark Cuban, rapper Cardi B, and actress Jane Fonda. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These endorsements have brought a new wave of star power to the presidential election, and could drive more attention, dollars and enthusiasm to the campaign. Whether they’ll persuade people who weren’t already open to Harris to consider her, however, <a href="https://wset.com/news/nation-world/fact-check-team-what-is-the-impact-of-celebrity-endorsements-on-political-campaigns" data-type="link" data-id="https://wset.com/news/nation-world/fact-check-team-what-is-the-impact-of-celebrity-endorsements-on-political-campaigns">is uncertain</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to political scientists, celebrity endorsements tend to have “modest effects” in winning over voters, says Bowling Green State University professor <a href="https://www.bgsu.edu/arts-and-sciences/political-science/faculty-and-staff-directory/David-Jackson.html">David J. Jackson</a>, who notes that they’re more likely to boost excitement for a candidate a voter may already be leaning toward, rather than sway someone to cross party lines. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>How celebrities have gotten involved so far</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Politicians often use celebrities in an attempt to energize key voting groups — and people who may be less engaged. Harris’s appearance alongside Megan Thee Stallion and Quavo in Atlanta, for instance, appeared dedicated to reaching younger voters as well as Black voters, both important groups that are expected to account for a notable proportion of the electorate this fall. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Political candidates are heavily leaning on celebrities as a mechanism to attract the attention of this cycle’s youngest voting demographic: Generation Z,” says <a href="https://www.pace.edu/profile/melvin-williams">Melvin Williams</a>, a professor of communications and media studies at Pace University. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/09/23/gen-z-eligible-voters-reflect-the-growing-racial-and-ethnic-diversity-of-u-s-electorate/">According to a 2020 Pew study</a>, Gen Z comprised roughly 10 percent of eligible voters that year, and about 45 percent of those voters were nonwhite. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/18/the-2020-election-shows-gen-zs-voting-power-for-years-to-come.html">A major uptick in Gen Z turnout in 2020</a> was also critical to helping President Joe Biden secure the presidency, even though younger voters have historically turned out at lower rates than other age groups. And Black voters have historically been a significant proportion of Democrats’ base as well, with <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/">92 percent</a> of Black voters supporting Biden in 2020.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyond high-profile rallies, celebrities like actor <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/23/politics/george-clooney-kamala-harris-2024/index.html">George Clooney</a> have given interviews and written social media posts announcing their backing for Harris. And others, like comedians Tiffany Haddish, Whoopi Goldberg, and Nick Offerman, have hosted <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/comics-elders-kamala-harris-fundraiser-nick-offerman-jane-fonda-1236096484/">virtual fundraising gatherings</a>, like one dubbed Comics for Kamala, that took place this week. Such events highlight how celebrities can be key contributors to campaigns by driving donations and broader awareness. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Former President Donald Trump has seen some celebrities speak out on his behalf, too, including country singer Kid Rock and wrestler Hulk Hogan, both of whom appeared at the Republican National Convention. They respectively described him as a “badass,” “hero,” and “gladiator,” all seemingly in a bid to hype up his masculine credentials and energize the crowd ahead of Trump’s appearance at the event.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And model Amber Rose, who also spoke at the RNC, was among the participants booked with the apparent goal of expanding Trump’s appeal to Black voters, after he made marginal gains with the group in 2020. Trump doesn’t care if “you&#8217;re Black, white, gay, or straight, it’s all love,” she claimed. Like Harris, Trump has sought to cultivate ties with younger voters as well, appearing on podcasts with Gen Z influencers like Logan Paul and streamer Adin Ross — both of whom have young, male audiences. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The impact celebrity endorsements can have on presidential elections</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re one of the most famous, influential women in the world, you may be able to sway a presidential election a little. If not, the effect might be a bit more limited.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/garthwaite/htm/celebrityendorsements_garthwaitemoore.pdf">Oprah Winfrey’s support of former President Barack Obama</a> in the 2008 Democratic primary is the rare example of a specific endorsement having a tangible, scientifically studied impact on candidate choice. <a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/garthwaite/htm/celebrityendorsements_garthwaitemoore.pdf">According to a 2013 Northwestern University study</a>, her endorsement — one of just a few political statements of support she’s made — translated to an uptick in turnout, donations, and approximately a million votes in favor of Obama. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A key caveat of that study is that it centered on a Democratic primary, when voters were choosing from candidates with the same party affiliation, rather than a general election, when candidates tend to have major partisan differences. Additionally, experts note that endorsements could provide voters with more useful information in a primary when there may be a broader mix of new and familiar options. In a general election, if the candidates are more well-established, endorsements could be less likely to offer novel insights.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“That was a different environment because that was a primary election between Democrats where Oprah weighed in to that contest,” University of Wisconsin political scientist <a href="https://polisci.wisc.edu/staff/barry-burden-2/">Barry Burden</a> previously told CBS 58, <a href="https://www.cbs58.com/news/do-celebrity-endorsements-matter#:~:text=Overall%20the%20research%20and%20history,all%20solution%2C%E2%80%9D%20Paleologes%20said.">a regional affiliate in Wisconsin</a>. “So everyone participating is essentially a Democrat or sympathetic to a Democrat and that’s where an endorsement could really matter.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That case study, though, shows how a prominent celebrity could wield their cachet. Less powerful celebrities, meanwhile, still have the potential to have a narrower impact. They might strengthen a candidate’s connection with a specific age group or demographic, they could help drive people to turn out, and they could get more people to contribute their money.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If you suddenly see it in your social media feed or on TikTok or wherever, and see your favorite celebrity has done an interview or had a conversation with a politician, that politician is much more likely to get traction just by having that entry into people’s attention spans,” <a href="https://www.nulondon.ac.uk/faculty/josephine-harmon/">Josephine Harmon</a>, an assistant professor of political science at Northeastern University in London, previously told <a href="https://news.northeastern.edu/2024/07/10/celebrity-election-endorsements/">Northeastern Global News</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A Megan Thee Stallion endorsement could bolster Harris’s credibility among her listeners and add to her appeal given the singer’s popularity and clout. A fan who was already leaning Democrat could also be motivated to register to vote, or attend a rally, because of her endorsement.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That was likely the case with endorsements like those made by Taylor Swift in 2018 and 2020. In 2018, Swift <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/01/taylor-swift-endorsement-00139033">endorsed</a> Tennessee Democratic Senate candidate Phil Bredesen, and emphasized why she opposed then-Republican Senate candidate Marsha Blackburn due to her votes on the Violence Against Women Act and her stance against marriage equality. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/09/voter-registrations-skyrocket-after-taylor-swift-instagram-post.html">Following Swift’s 2018 post</a>, 65,000 people between the ages of 18 to 29 registered to vote, according to Vote.org, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/09/voter-registrations-skyrocket-after-taylor-swift-instagram-post.html">an uptick the nonprofit attributed to her post,</a> noting that it may have galvanized people to get involved who wouldn’t have otherwise.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Overall, celebrities would like to think they could influence voter behavior, but they are more valuable as fundraising tools and door-opening opportunities to their followers,” <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/academics/faculty/d/a/david-paleologos">David Paleologos</a>, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center, <a href="https://www.cbs58.com/news/do-celebrity-endorsements-matter#:~:text=Overall%20the%20research%20and%20history,all%20solution%2C%E2%80%9D%20Paleologes%20said.">told CBS 58</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a close election like this one — <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/">538’s polling average</a> puts Harris less than 2 percentage points ahead of Trump nationally, as of Wednesday — celebrities, and such marginal gains, could nonetheless be important. “Even though the effects are generally thought of as modest, in elections that turn on a small number of votes in a handful of swing states, any effect could be significant,” Jackson told Vox.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s never a bad time to think about budgeting your money, but one could argue that the week of <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/365271/stocks-dow-nasdaq-recession-us-economy-fed">a stock market meltdown</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/business/economy/recession-markets-stocks.html">renewed anxiety of a recession</a> is the best time. That’s where we are this week. So let’s talk about budgeting.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A few months ago, I stumbled across an app called YNAB. The name stands for You Need a Budget, and <a href="https://qz.com/1710081/ynab-has-the-most-devoted-following-of-any-budgeting-app">it’s fiercely popular</a> with a certain set of personal finance enthusiasts on Reddit.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With over 190,000 members, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab">the YNAB subreddit</a> is in the top 1 percent of popular subreddits — it’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/best/communities/11/#t5_2vqaa/">about as popular, for example, as the surfing subreddit</a>. It’s not just Reddit, either. YNAB has 581,000 followers <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ynabofficial?lang=en">on TikTok</a>, 208,000 followers <a href="https://www.instagram.com/youneedabudget/?hl=en">on Instagram</a>, and 141,000 subscribers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@YNABofficial">on YouTube</a>. This is all for a budgeting <em>app</em>, mind you.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So I downloaded YNAB with high hopes. It took quite a while to get through the complicated setup, which involved linking my bank accounts to it, and start allocating sums of money for absolutely every expense in my life, from rent to diapers. Then I realized that, after a 34-day free trial, the app costs money.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Starting August 1, YNAB even raised its prices from $99 a year to $109 a year. Many of those hundreds of thousands of personal finance enthusiasts <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab/comments/1dtnhgg/megathread_discuss_the_price_increase_here/">are not happy about this change</a>, by the way. Some said they were going back to Excel, which is what I have been doing for years. Still, that’s a lot of people who are excited about personal finance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“What a great place to be,” Scott Ward, senior vice president and wealth advisor for Compound Planning, told me. “We’ve gone from an environment where people were reticent to really even think about budgeting, to using spreadsheets, and now wanting to have an active interest in seeing their money work for them on a daily basis.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The concept of connecting your bank account to an app that will tell you how much you should spend and save has actually been around for a couple of decades. It went mainstream in the late aughts with the rise in popularity of Mint, a free budgeting website and app that was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/2/23943254/mint-intuit-shutting-down-credit-karma">shut down earlier this year</a> by its new owner Credit Karma. And when Mint shut down in March, millions of users scrambled to find a good replacement.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even though YNAB isn’t free, it’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/11/your-money/mint-budgeting-app-alternatives.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">one of several apps</a> that are filling that void. All of them can track your spending, automate your savings, and generally make you feel better about your financial health. Most of them cost money, while you can make a spreadsheet in Google Drive for free.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Budgeting is inevitably a very personal thing. If you don’t have one at all, however, the best budget for you is any budget at all. Inflation has slowed but is not gone. The economy is feeling <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-recession-worries-surge-again-what-is-data-2024-08-06/">a little shaky</a> right now, although it <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/06/us-economy-excellent/678630/">technically remains quite strong</a>. And like I said before, there’s never a bad time to pay attention to your money.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>So, you need a budget</strong>.</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Behind many of these apps is usually a budgeting philosophy that’s been around for over 50 years. It’s <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/zero-based-budgeting-explained">called zero-based budgeting</a>. Developed <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/meet-the-father-of-zero-based-budgeting-1427415074">by Peter Pyhrr</a> when he was a young accountant at Texas Instruments in the early 1970s, this method directs you to start your budget from scratch, or “zero base,” every month and assign a purpose to every dollar you <em>must </em>spend in your budget. That means accounting for recurring costs like rent and bills as well as essentials like housing and groceries. It also leaves room to budget for longer-term goals like savings and paying off debt.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The system is also designed to be dynamic since not every month of the year is the same. If you’ve heard of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/envelope-budgeting-system-5208026">the “envelope system,”</a> when you set aside cash for each expense at the start of the month, this is the same idea. Other systems include <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022916/what-502030-budget-rule.asp">the 50/30/20 rule</a>, which was popularized by the progressive Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/payyourselffirst.asp">the “pay yourself first” method</a>, which focuses on building a retirement or emergency fund. My own budgeting spreadsheet ended up being based on the zero-base budgeting strategy, although I didn’t even know what that strategy was when I built it for myself a few years ago. The method is just that intuitive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">YNAB started out as a spreadsheet, too. In 2004, an accounting grad student named Jesse Mecham <a href="https://www.ynab.com/blog/the-ynab-origin-story">built the first version of the spreadsheet</a> to track his family’s finances and, with the help of a developer, built a desktop app a couple years later, before launching the first YNAB mobile app in 2015.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mecham pushed these four rules from the start: give every dollar a job, embrace true expenses, roll with the punches, and age your money. The first three are fairly self-explanatory. The last one about aging your money, however, is designed to help you break out of the pay-check-to-pay-check lifestyle and delay the time when you receive your money to when you actually spend it. In other words, the longer you hold onto your money and avoid spending like it’s an emergency, the more likely you are to make smarter decisions. Keeping more money around will also give you a bit of a cushion.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I want people to take the fear out of the money conversation,” YNAB CEO Todd Curtis said in an interview. “We all spend, and imagine if you could do it confidently. Imagine if you could do it without second-guessing. Imagine if you could talk about it with your partner without real dread about walking into that conversation.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the years, people <a href="https://qz.com/1710081/ynab-has-the-most-devoted-following-of-any-budgeting-app">have become obsessed with this system</a>. But YNAB <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/11/your-money/mint-budgeting-app-alternatives.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">isn’t the only app</a> pushing the zero-based budgeting approach. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/buyside/personal-finance/banking/monarch-money-review">Monarch Money is a popular option</a> that automatically categorizes your spending, tracks your investments, and gives family members access to the budget. (YNAB <a href="https://www.ynab.com/blog/introducing-ynab-together-for-your-shared-financial-journey">has its own version of family access</a>.) Monarch Money also costs $100 a year. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/pocketguard-budgeting-app-review/">PocketGuard is a beginner-friendly app</a> that offers some zero-based budgeting features. There’s a free tier with limited functionality or a premium version for $75 a year. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/copilot-budget-app-review/">Copilot uses artificial intelligence</a> to categorize expenses and creates adaptive budgets for you. So it’s kind of like a robotic zero-based budgeting system and costs $95 a year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re not convinced the zero-based budgeting method is for you, there are a variety of different approaches represented in these recommendations for more budget apps <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/11/your-money/mint-budgeting-app-alternatives.html">here</a>, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/buyside/personal-finance/financial-tips/best-budgeting-methods">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/best-budgeting-apps/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">But you don’t want to pay for a budget. Now what?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It costs money to manage your money with the help of a good app. That comes with some benefits. You’re paying for something that’s easier to use than a free Google Drive spreadsheet, and you’re paying for the convenience of having your bank accounts, including all of your transactions, synced with the app instead of needing to manually add every expense yourself. You’re also paying for security, so that hackers don’t get their hands on your financial info.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By the way, if you use a free budgeting tool, there’s a chance the company making it <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/29/21111848/free-software-privacy-alternative-data">is selling your data to data brokers</a>. (Here’s <a href="https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/how-safe-are-budget-tracking-apps">a great rundown</a> of how privacy and security work in these apps, and what to look out for.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But sometimes the most compelling free option out there is the trusty spreadsheet. After all, if one of the leading budgeting apps started out as a spreadsheet, why not get back to basics?</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">One surprising thing:</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">The internet is awash with budgeting apps of all kinds. If paying for a budgeting app isn’t for you, and you don’t want to give your personal financial data to a free app, you can always import a free budgeting spreadsheet. Jon Wittwer, founder of the Excel template library Vertex42, offers up this roadmap for starting from scratch. It’s surprisingly easy:</p>



<ol>
<li>Start by tracking your expenses with <a href="https://www.vertex42.com/ExcelTemplates/income-and-expense-worksheet.html">this simple spreadsheet</a>.</li>



<li>Use <a href="https://www.vertex42.com/ExcelTemplates/excel-checkbook.html">a check register</a> or <a href="https://www.vertex42.com/ExcelTemplates/account-register.html#google_vignette">an account register</a> to keep track of transactions.</li>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you DIY your budget, the bonus is a system that’s better tailored to your needs than even the best and priciest apps could ever be. The drawback is that it can become a huge time suck. Trust me. I’ve resorted to tracking everything on a Google Drive spreadsheet of my own making, and it’s practically turned into a hobby. My spreadsheet isn’t particularly complicated, but it’s highly customized to my particular situation. When my wife and I got married and combined finances, it got a big overhaul, and that happened once again when we had a baby.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But along the way, I’m paying close attention on a weekly if not daily basis. It’s almost like a problem that I can never solve, but the process of simply trying — adding transactions here, reallocating funds there — calms me down. The time I spend in my clunky spreadsheet relieves some of my anxiety about family finances. It’s still time I’m not doing other things.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The main downside to most budgeting and money management spreadsheets is that they do not automatically import transactions from bank accounts,” Jon Wittwer, founder of <a href="https://www.vertex42.com/ExcelTemplates/budgets.html">Vertex42</a>, which offers a wide range of free spreadsheet templates. “Importing transactions is the number one reason why I still use an app for my own finances.” Wittwer added that he still uses a combination of apps and spreadsheets to manage his business.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You’re also not entirely alone if you do decide to create your own system. Much like its budgeting app counterpart, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/boza0g/i_made_a_spreadsheet_for_people_who_dont_know_how/">the budgeting spreadsheet community is active</a> and always coming up <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/z378v4/updated_2023_simple_budget_spreadsheet/">with innovations</a> on this tried and tested way of tracking your expenses.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Completely free options do exist, and they’re so ubiquitous, that the only real challenge is finding one that fits your needs. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YlGTsomx1Y47jdc9HMdV4iVLP9vtZEcNJZQWHLTc1jk/edit?gid=0#gid=0">Google</a> and <a href="https://create.microsoft.com/en-us/templates/budgets">Microsoft</a> have their own libraries of free budget spreadsheets that are very simple but customizable. I’ve also used <a href="https://www.vertex42.com/ExcelTemplates/budgets.html">free Excel templates from Vertex42</a> and would recommend them for their sophistication and price of $0.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Like I said before, though, budgeting is such a highly personal endeavor. Spreadsheets can be a solitary affair, where you might not know who to ask if you’re looking for a better way to do something. Apps are great, as long as you’re willing to pay a fee, and they can offer some community.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Curtis, the YNAB CEO, told me, “With YNAB, you can turn around to that community and say, ‘Hey, this just happened to me. I’m at this moment. What can I do?’ And you’ve got millions of people there who can help you with that question, because they’ve been there before you.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent weeks, national Democrats and surrogates for Vice President Kamala Harris have settled on a pretty simple strategy: calling former President Donald Trump, his running mate Sen. J.D. Vance, and MAGA-aligned Republicans “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-trump-vance-weird-c54d506d1f533ee7aa455f7b500322c5">weird</a>.” One of its original purveyors, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, used it again Tuesday evening, during his first appearance with Harris as her running mate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“You know it. You feel it. These guys are creepy and, yes, just weird as hell!” Walz said, after telling a joke that played into a meme about <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/363230/jd-vance-couch-sex-hillbilly-elegy-rumor-false">Vance and couches</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democrats have found plenty of fodder for the tactic, which they’ve used to describe Republican positions on abortion rights and IVF, on the role of parents and biological children, and on an array of other right-wing beliefs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The attacks may be <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/04/politics/video/jd-vance-weird-polls-impact-enten-digvid">sticking</a> — hardening the preexisting views many Americans have toward Trump, Vance, and the national Republican brand.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But they’re no substitute for a forward-looking, positive case in favor of Harris and Walz, according to <a href="https://blueprint2024.com/polling/harris-poll-positive-message-8-8/">new polling</a> conducted by the Democratic firm Blueprint and shared with Vox. What must come next is an effort to define Harris by reintroducing the electorate to her track record before becoming vice president and leaving behind the politics and acrimony of the Trump-Biden era.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://blueprint2024.com/polling/harris-poll-positive-message-8-8/">new report</a> reveals an interesting and slightly counterintuitive sentiment among American voters at this point in the race. Voters are relieved that there is a new option available for them to pick and feel a “breath of fresh air” — but they don’t really know Harris.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Specifically, beyond hearing attacks on Trump and Vance, they want to hear a positive, uplifting platform from Harris. They are ready for optimism, to hear why she wants to be president, and — even more fundamentally — just learn who she is. Plenty of voters have heard of the vice president, but many don’t know much about her past, her accomplishments, and her life experience, Blueprint’s chief pollster Evan Roth Smith told me.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“People really want to know who Kamala Harris is, and people are interested in finding out more about her. That is part of the atmospheric shift that’s taken place in this race,” Smith said. “There’s a lot more interest in hearing Kamala Harris and her campaign talk about Kamala Harris — more so than there is in hearing her talk about Donald Trump, or even Joe Biden.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Blueprint, a center-left firm, has been conducting these kinds of polling experiments for the last year, questioning conventional wisdom and digging deeper on the subgroups of voters and kinds of questions that other big national polls don’t frequently ask. They’ve zeroed in on young voters, on what Americans know about Cabinet members, and how voters view specific policies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Smith and his team have some messaging recommendations for the Harris campaign, and a handful of specific life facts and career highlights from her biography that they found resonate particularly well with voters, but they all underscore one central theme: voter perceptions of Harris are a lot more fluid and changeable than they are of Trump, suggesting there’s not that much of an upside to dedicating time, energy, and messaging to attacking Trump, and especially not when compared to spending those resources talking herself up.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That dynamic suggests that there are limits to criticizing Trump and making fun of Vance. Most voters, including persuadable swing voters and independents, want to know about Harris’s background and are interested in a substantive, forward-looking pitch. And specifically when talking about immigration, independents are curious about how Harris would address their joint desires for border security and immigration reform.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Harris and Walz begin to barnstorm battleground states ahead of the Democratic National Convention later this month, she has a limited window to define herself and make a positive case to voters. And while her campaign has been riding high since its late-July launch, the Harris honeymoon likely won’t last forever.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Harris has the advantage of being unburdened by what has been</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are two sets of numbers in Blueprint’s poll that explain the opportunity Harris has right now: the share of voters who say that their minds are absolutely made up on the candidates, and the share who say they could be persuaded to change their opinions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Trump, 71 percent of registered voters say “there is absolutely nothing” that could change their opinions of him. Just 57 percent say the same about Harris. And when asked if they would be open to changing their mind or would want to learn more about a candidate, just 12 percent of respondents felt that way about Trump, compared to the 20 percent who said that about Harris.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though neither is particularly popular, Harris is still viewed more favorably than Trump: 46 percent have a favorable view of her compared to 43 percent for Trump. A larger share of respondents say they have an “extremely” favorable or unfavorable view of the former president (64 percent) than the share who have “extreme” opinions about Harris (53 percent).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Smith, that suggests there is more room for voters to change or form an opinion about Harris than Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This difference in strong opinions about Harris may help explain another of the poll’s counterintuitive results: Many voters don’t blame Harris for the unpopular parts of the Biden presidency and trust her more than President Joe Biden on specific issues, like protecting abortion and reproductive rights.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Don’t tell people about the last four years. People have complicated, often unfavorable, views of Democratic governance over the last four years, and they do not yet tie her to some of the perceived failures of the Biden administration,” Smith said. There’s also a downside to talking about Trump and defending Biden: Doing so could remind people Harris was around during that time as well.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To investigate where Harris <em>should</em> be talking about the last four years, Smith and his team asked voters to identify whether Biden, Harris, or both of them were responsible for an array of specific policy issues. Those include increasing access to abortion, reducing crime, addressing past surges on the southern border, and providing aid to Israel and Ukraine. Biden, specifically, is seen as more responsible for politically damaging issues like the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and inflation, though he also receives credit for attempts at widespread student loan cancellation. Harris, meanwhile, was most credited for her work on abortion access, reducing border crossings, and helping to pass the codification of marriage equality.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“On these big, salient issues — the economy, inflation, and immigration — she should define herself outside of the last four years and very, very, very carefully cherry-pick items from the Biden years to be associated with,” Smith told me. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead, Harris and her campaign would be smart to “lead with her personal background, who she is, where she’s from, and her role as prosecutor, as California’s attorney general, as someone who enforced the law, and put criminals, particularly criminals related to transnational crime, behind bars.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Harris has some weak spots on immigration and the economy</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Blueprint survey also tested a variety of Republican attacks on Harris and hypothetical Democratic defenses. It found that a combination of facts about Harris’s background and work on the issues were more convincing to voters than the default Democratic response of calling something a “Republican lie” or attacking Trump as an existential threat.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This dynamic was particularly notable when looking at how to respond to the Republican attacks that resonate the most with voters, including Harris’s role in addressing immigration (think of the attacks calling her a failed “<a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361635/kamala-harris-border-czar-immigration-mexico-guatemala-rnc">border czar</a>”) and the rise in inflation during the first few years of the Biden presidency. As tested in the poll, both GOP arguments were compelling to voters. More than half of voters said they found the “border czar” argument very or somewhat convincing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the best Democratic rebuttal Blueprint tested turned out to not be based on debunking the false claims, such as by pointing out that Harris was not a border czar or responsible for the border. Instead, saying that she could be both tough on the border — because of her background prosecuting transnational gangs and drug smugglers — and compassionate to migrants — because her parents’ immigration stories gave her hope for humane and sensible reforms to the immigration system — proved the most effective.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similarly, criticisms about inflation, the price of goods, and the economy in general — that Biden and Harris “let government spending get out of control and let companies rip us off on everything from gas to groceries,” as the poll puts it —  were convincing to half of respondents, with 33 percent finding that “very convincing” and 17 percent finding it “somewhat” convincing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those attacks were best rebutted not by pointing out facts about the growing GDP, the laws passed in the last few years, or the low rate of unemployment, as had been Biden’s approach. Instead, talking up a populist economic message, of going after price gouging, capping drug prices, cutting junk fees, and taxing the rich was more convincing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those two lines of attack are significantly more effective than the path that Trump, Vance, and other Republicans seem to have taken in the last few weeks: calling Harris a DEI hire, criticizing her lack of biological children, or attacking her racial identity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Those test way at the bottom for Republicans. They are barking up the wrong tree,” Smith said. But the responses that work best to those attacks are the more traditional anti-Trump response: getting a bit personal, comparing Trump’s past affairs and divorces against Harris’s family, and calling Trump and Vance “weird” for caring so much about how she runs her family.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similarly, responding to the DEI and identity politics attacks with lines about how “Trump and the Republicans are desperate to distract voters from their extreme Project 2025 agenda” does better, but not <em>that</em> much better than essentially just calling Trump and Republicans racists.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What the voters want to hear instead</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Candidates only get so much time to get their message across in an election. That’s particularly true for the Harris campaign, with the vice president getting a historically late start to a presidential bid. And as the summer passes by, the fall stretch of the election will be especially valuable, as that’s when a lot of casual voters tune in for the first time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because of that time constraint, there’s an opportunity cost to any line of messaging: The investments Harris makes in promoting her own record come at the expense of making the case that Trump is unfit for office.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, the polling suggests that the trade-off is worth it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyond talking about Trump and Biden, registered voters seem to want to hear most about Harris’s career in California. In some experiments Blueprint ran, biographical facts about her time as a prosecutor, as attorney general of California, and as a US senator resonated with voters, as well as her experience growing up in a middle-class neighborhood.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So did telling voters about her work prosecuting sex traffickers and jailing abusers, securing a billion-dollar settlement for people scammed by for-profit colleges, and suing BP for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. And they liked hearing a tangible platform: protecting Social Security and Medicare, lowering costs, protecting those with preexisting health conditions, and protecting abortion rights. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That tangible platform has yet to be fully articulated. Harris is just two weeks into a campaign that she had to assemble from the wreckage of Biden’s own reelection effort. And she has hinted at some priorities during her stump speeches, including protecting entitlement programs and reproductive rights, investing in the care economy, and fighting inflation. She still has time to define a more unified governing agenda — but her newest rallying cry is a good start: “We’re not going back.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This is what people are the most excited about when they hear about [her]: a mix of ‘I was attorney general, and that allowed me to a) go after bad guys and b) go after bad guys who are coming over the border, and c) go after the big companies who are ripping you off’,” Smith said. “It avoids reminding people too much about the past four years, it avoids having to say the name Joe Biden too much, and now she can introduce herself to voters without strengthening that association.”All together, Blueprint’s findings offer a logical next step for the campaign as the thrill of the honeymoon period ends and as disengaged voters begin to tune into the election. Up until now, the 2024 election has seemed to be mostly about the vibes. But the vibes <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/365148/kamala-harris-trump-polls-election-2024">won’t stay positive forever</a>. It might be smart to make the most of them now.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite decades of advocacy, vegans and veganism remain deeply unpopular, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/11/2/18055532/vegans-vegetarian-research-uk">even detested</a>. Many influential animal activists are now debating a question that would have once seemed absurd: Is it worth the movement’s precious time and resources to keep advocating for meatless diets, an apparently lost cause?</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">One surprising thing</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">The share of Americans who are vegetarian or vegan is incredibly hard to measure accurately. But one thing is clear: It hasn’t changed much in recent decades, and <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/510038/identify-vegetarian-vegan.aspx">may have even decreased</a>.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>This piece is part of </strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/364288/how-factory-farming-ends-animal-rights-vegans-climate-ethics"><strong>How Factory Farming Ends</strong></a><strong>, a collection of stories on the past and future of the long fight against factory farming.</strong> This series is supported by Animal Charity Evaluators, which received a grant from Builders Initiative.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although people define veganism in <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41055-020-00081-6">different ways</a>, it fundamentally entails avoiding all animal products to the greatest extent possible, including meat, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/352359/milk-dairy-schools">dairy</a>, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23588340/egg-prices-expensive-bird-flu-shortage-price-gouging">eggs</a>, but also non-dietary products like <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24008053/wool-marketing-environment-sustainable-claims-sheep-animal-cruelty-fast-fashion">wool</a> and <a href="https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-clothing/leather-industry/">leather</a>. Whereas the more commonly practiced vegetarianism only rejects meat consumption, the vegan movement generally rejects the property status of animals and aims to fully divest from animal cruelty and exploitation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vegans are often considered <a href="https://www.ivu.org/history/vegan-from-1909.pdf">too extreme</a>, especially in a meat-obsessed country like the US — a perception that persists despite the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/company/press/plant-based-foods-market-to-hit-162-billion-in-next-decade-projects-bloomberg-intelligence/">growing popularity</a> of vegan products. The famed late chef Anthony Bourdain once <a href="https://openlibrary.org/books/OL19290065M/Kitchen_confidential">compared</a> vegans to Hezbollah, declaring them “the enemy of everything good and decent in the human spirit.” His aversion seems representative of the public’s feelings. One 2015 <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1368430215618253">study</a> found that, in the United States, negative attitudes toward vegans rivaled those toward atheists.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These social headwinds are making veganism unpopular even among influential voices in the animal movement. Matt Ball, who co-founded the advocacy group <a href="https://veganoutreach.org/">Vegan Outreach</a> in the 1990s but has since changed his tune on the strategic necessity of promoting animal-free diets, has <a href="https://www.mattball.org/2017/05/how-vegans-hurt-animals.html">argued</a> that the “‘vegan’ brand is damaged beyond repair.” Bruce Friedrich — founder of the Good Food Institute, a nonprofit that seeks to develop alternative proteins that do not require animal slaughter — has made a moderated version of a similar claim. In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/technology/bruce-friedrich-animal-activist.html">2019 interview</a>, he lamented that “we’ve tried to convince the world to go vegan, and it has not worked.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The percentage of Americans who are vegan or vegetarian remains small, though it is a notoriously difficult figure to pin down. This minute figure, juxtaposed with the <a href="https://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/about-the-industry/statistics/per-capita-consumption-of-poultry-and-livestock-1965-to-estimated-2012-in-pounds/">clearly documented increase</a> in US per-capita meat consumption, suggests veganism seems to be failing. For Friedrich and others, this failure to affect dietary habits signals a need to shift animal advocacy’s emphasis toward larger-scale policy and technological innovations, like <a href="https://gfi.org/cultivated/">cell-cultivated (sometimes known as lab-grown) meat</a>, that can reduce the number of animals slaughtered for food in the absence of dietary change. It also requires that pro-animal advocates tone down their dogmatism, abandon the quest for purity, and compromise more with large corporations.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I suspect that at least some aspects of this weariness resonate with large swathes of people who advocate for animal rights or are sympathetic to their plight: the warning against dogmatism and a call for nuance, a healthy skepticism toward individualism and consumerism, and the sense that <em>something </em>is better than nothing, even if that something is less radical than we’d like. Indeed, on its own, even the strictest veganism can feel like a minuscule choice against the onslaught of the factory farming death machine, which tortures and kills more than <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census">10 billion land animals</a> annually in the US alone. Why spend so much energy convincing people to undertake such a massive life change if it seems akin to using a bucket to bail water out of a sinking cruise liner?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While I sympathize with these sentiments, I worry that they miss the promise and radical force of veganism: It can be an act of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10455752.2020.1837895">solidarity</a> with <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/josp.12460">nonhuman animals</a>. Veganism takes the recognition that animals are sentient beings with lives of their own and infuses it into one’s body and everyday practice. In a world that relies on extracting the literal lifeblood of nonhuman animals, that depends on externalizing the costs of “progress” onto them and distributing the benefits to privileged humans, veganism refuses to pass the buck. It is a way of “saying” to nonhumans, non-verbally and without the promise that the message will be received: <em>The world has turned against you, depends on your flesh and bone. But we will not. We refuse.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This exhortation has profound implications for the animal movement’s future direction. Animal advocates have often been <a href="https://faunalytics.org/abolitionism-and-welfarism-two-animal-advocacy-perspectives/">mired in debate</a> over which tactics are the best use of our time, and which ones meaningfully help animals instead of creating a “<a href="https://www.vox.com/22838160/animal-welfare-labels-meat-dairy-eggs-humane-humanewashing">humanewashing</a>” smokescreen. Promoting veganism need not be the movement’s only or primary strategy, but it should remain its heartbeat. After all, if we’re not committed to fighting for a world free from animal exploitation, then what exactly is the movement fighting for? Veganism as solidarity provides a core commitment and standard that can help set movement priorities.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Society enlists us into war against animals</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The strategic case against veganism largely depends on the claim that the percentage of Americans who have gone vegetarian or vegan remains minute — perhaps <a href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/is-the-percentage-of-vegetarians-and-vegans-in-the-u-s-increasing/">as low as 2 percent</a> — and has not appreciably increased in decades. But there are more optimistic ways to read the data. Communications scholar Vasile Stanescu <a href="https://www.criticalanimal.com/2019/07/guest-post-response-to-claim-that-only.html">argued</a> in 2019 that rates of vegetarianism and veganism in the US <em>have</em> increased, to somewhere between 8 and 13 percent. Even if his figure proves an overestimate — no peer-reviewed work, to my knowledge, exists to settle the question — it seems unwise to throw away a pillar of animal rights when we aren’t even sure of the numbers. One must also consider the counterfactual: How high might meat consumption be if consumers faced a firehose of industry-sponsored, pro-meat messaging without a pro-vegan counterbalance?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, one might argue, it makes little sense to invest scarce resources on promoting veganism without evidence of a clear and measurable impact. This objection makes a lot of sense if we understand veganism as primarily a consequentialist, consumer-oriented approach, of “voting with your dollar.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But reframing veganism as solidarity encourages advocates to think beyond quantifiable market consequences (though these effects are still <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/7/31/9067651/eggs-chicken-effective-altruism">relevant</a>). Put differently, veganism matters not only because of its economic divestment from animal exploitation, but also because of its less quantifiable <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/josp.12460">political</a> effects. Going vegan builds political energy and connections with other humans invested in animal liberation and with the animals that vegans recognize as sentient and social creatures. It builds glimpses of a desired future in the present.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps most importantly, solidaristic veganism acknowledges that in today’s world, after centuries of humans’ intense exploitation of animals, it’s nearly impossible to have an ethical relationship with animals without addressing the most direct ways that most people benefit from the destruction of animal life. Animals are not simply mistreated beings. Rather, society is organized around slaughtering, torturing, and dominating animals, as a class, on a massive scale.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A brief look at the statistics evinces this claim: Globally, an additional <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/how-many-animals-are-factory-farmed#note-1">70 billion</a> land animals are killed for food on top of the US’s 10 billion. Factory-farmed fish, which are harder to count, may add more than 100 billion. Habitat destruction, primarily driven by <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22287498/meat-wildlife-biodiversity-species-plantbased">industrial animal farming</a>, is snowballing out of control. Tens of millions, maybe hundreds of millions, of animals are <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/12/11/23500157/neuralink-animal-testing-elon-musk-usda-probe">held captive and experimented on</a> in scientific labs. Even dogs and cats, perceived as the most pampered animals in America, are still <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/4/11/23673393/pets-dogs-cats-animal-welfare-boredom">legal property</a>, living largely at the whims of whoever happens to own them (not to mention the <a href="https://www.aspca.org/helping-people-pets/shelter-intake-and-surrender/pet-statistics">6 million in shelters</a>, nearly 1 million of whom are killed annually, partly due to the pet breeding industry).</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>To become politically vegan is to become a conscientious objector </p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another way of framing this dire state of affairs, as the social theorist Dinesh Wadiwel <a href="https://brill.com/display/title/32110?language=en">does</a>, is that the world acts as if it is at war with animals. Not all humans are equally to blame for the atrocities of this war, but living in and benefitting from a society that, as a rule, marks animals for torture and death, changes the nature of one’s responsibility. For Wadiwel, veganism offers a “truce” to animals.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We can extend this war framework a step further: To become politically vegan is to become a conscientious objector.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Think about those who became conscientious objectors in the face of being drafted for the Vietnam War. Those who refused conscription could claim conscientious objector status only if participating in the war conflicted with their deeply held beliefs, and not merely because they had a self-interest in not being killed. Depriving the military of one soldier was not going to change the course of the war, but conscientious objection had other effects: It made private opposition public, it broke the facade of a uniform pro-war consensus, and it <a href="https://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4078&amp;context=clevstlrev">provided a rallying point</a> for further political action. Objectors in the 1960s and ’70s became part of <a href="https://www.history.com/news/anti-war-movements-throughout-american-history">the largest anti-war movement</a> in US history.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/CoeMyMotherIWatchPigEscapeFromSlaughterhouse_159118.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,32.493455497382,100,35.013089005236" alt="Painting of a slaughterhouse filled with stressed-looking farm animals of various species and workers preparing to slaughter them.

" title="Painting of a slaughterhouse filled with stressed-looking farm animals of various species and workers preparing to slaughter them.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, imagine that you were talking to a conscientious objector and said: “The data is against you. Very few people want to become conscientious objectors. You are only alienating people, and your refusal to serve is just a drop in the bucket compared to the military’s power. Perhaps you should try more moderate steps first.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To say this would be to misunderstand the goal of conscientious objection. Anti-vegan critics have a similar misapprehension. The world “conscripts” us in its war against animals in the way it structures our choices when we buy clothes, food, and other necessities whose production depends on violence against animals. To become vegan is not only to try to prevent some animal death and exploitation, but to build political opposition to our forced participation in this war.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The false binary of purity vs. pragmatism</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Veganism is sometimes strawmanned as a kind of purity politics that only benefits sanctimonious activists. It’s true that being purely cruelty-free is impossible: <a href="https://extension.oregonstate.edu/news/heres-scoop-chemical-organic-fertilizers">organic fertilizers</a> use animal products, <a href="https://extension.arizona.edu/sites/extension.arizona.edu/files/pubs/az1481i.pdf">pesticides harm many animals</a>, and large-scale plant farming generally kills and displaces animals (<a href="https://sentientmedia.org/does-veganism-kill-more-animals/">though not anywhere near as many as animal agriculture</a>). Similarly, by analogy, becoming an anti-war conscientious objector does not wash one’s hands of all complicity; even paying taxes abets the war effort.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But framing veganism as an act of solidarity can shatter the false binary between purity and pragmatism. There are uses for the public rigor that solidarity demands that go beyond purity. It punctures the smooth surface of everyday life, putting its everyday violence in view.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Consider a scenario Friedrich presents in an older piece of writing, where a vegan dines with omnivorous companions at a restaurant with limited vegan options. <a href="https://mercyforanimals.org/essays-effective-advocacy/">For Friedrich</a>, if “you give the server the third degree about the ingredients or about how it was cooked, you are forgetting the essence of being vegan” because you make veganism seem more difficult to others at the table.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I certainly agree that one shouldn’t give underpaid servers a hard time, but not with the scenario’s underlying respectability politics. Yes, veganism may seem more difficult, but demonstrating this difficulty <a href="https://www.academia.edu/9132254/Vegan_Killjoys_at_the_Table_Contesting_Happiness_and_Negotiating_Relationships_with_Food_Practices">highlights the gap</a> between what the world is willing to provide and what justice demands. Perhaps your tablemates will be put off by this demonstration, but perhaps the situation provides the opportunity for a conversation that would not have occurred if you simply smoothed over the issue. Perhaps they will admire your willingness to stick to your principles even when it’s inconvenient. Perhaps they are more likely to pay attention when vegan options are available.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The fundamental point is that politics is not only about calm, rational persuasion and consensus-building. It can also be purposefully oppositional, concerned with <a href="https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=33817&amp;bottom_ref=subject">dissensus and agonistic conflict</a>. The great non-violence movements of the 20th century were not primarily focused on easing their opponents to their side but on raising the costs of the status quo via boycotts, sit-ins, and disruptive<em> </em>marches.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From this perspective, if the numbers of vegans truly are small, that is not in itself a cause for worry. Popularity is not the only goal of a movement that seeks to disrupt the public’s “common sense.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">How solidarity with animals can inform movement tactics (and it’s not just advocating for veganism) </h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This perspective on veganism’s politics affects the movement’s strategy in two ways. First, veganism should remain a core principle. That is not to say that it should be the only strategy: I agree with the need to experiment with different tactics and to focus beyond shifting individual people’s beliefs toward changing social and industrial infrastructures with innovations like “clean meat” and policies that limit animal mistreatment.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But solidaristic acts like veganism serve as the “political fuel” necessary for broader changes to policy and cultural norms, philosophers Alasdair Cochrane and Mara-Daria Cojocaru <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/solidarity-with-animals-9780198897941?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;">argue</a>. The political will for new vegan technologies and anti-cruelty policies does not come miraculously from the ether but requires building a critical mass of people committed to a world without animal exploitation.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Solidaristic acts like veganism serve as the “political fuel” necessary for broader changes to policy and cultural norms</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Second, veganism as solidarity provides a lens through which to evaluate tactics deployed by the movement, like farm animal welfare laws. For decades, animal advocates have <a href="https://digitalcommons.law.buffalo.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1355&amp;context=journal_articles#:~:text=Part%20I%20discusses%20the%20differences,the%20property%20status%20of%20animals.">argued</a> fiercely over the value of incremental reforms to the factory farm system like, say, banning the most extreme forms of cage confinement. Do these strategies help us end factory farming, or do they merely give a false humane sheen to the killing machine?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Veganism as solidarity provides a rubric by which to evaluate pro-animal reforms: Does the reform in question come out of a place of solidarity with animals, one that may ultimately lead toward abolishing their status as commodities, or does it ultimately enable conditions that undermine the potential for this solidarity?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We can borrow a helpful framework from the prison abolitionist movement: the idea of <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/feature/non-reformist-reforms-and-struggles-over-life-death-and-democracy">non-reformist reforms</a>. Non-reformist reforms help create the conditions for meaningfully shifting the power structure, while reformist reforms may only reify it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For example, when major animal welfare organizations publicly <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CqbE9EbpTAr/?img_index=3">congratulate </a>(and give free advertising to) large meat producers for signing on to voluntary welfare standards, I question whether this action advances solidarity. True accountability is limited to the corporations themselves, and they get to walk away with a gold star that increases their credibility even as their fundamental business model remains the same. To extend the anti-war analogy, would it be solidarity with the victims of war if Lockheed Martin agreed to use slightly more “humane” methods of war and modern activists went out of their way to congratulate the company?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Further, when activists implore consumers to eat one type of animal rather than another — “<a href="https://www.vox.com/videos/2017/5/27/15701168/save-animal-lives-eat-beef-not-chicken">save animals by eating more beef and less chicken</a>” or “<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/eating-chicken-instead-beef-will-drastically-reduce-your-carbon-footprint-180972392/">save the environment by eating less beef and more chickens</a>” — they betray that obligation to solidarity. Even work like that of the famed livestock scientist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/magazine/temple-grandin-on-autism-death-celibacy-and-cows.html">Temple Grandin</a>, who has <a href="https://www.grandin.com/design/chute.ramp.race.design.html">designed</a> livestock handling systems that reduce animals’ fear and resistance as they walk down a chute to meet a bolt gun, only helps them acquiesce in their oppression and reduces the friction in the meat industry’s slaughter pipeline.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/CoeGassingHogs.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,16.985900160697,100,66.028199678607" alt="black-and-white drawing of anguished-looking pigs being gassed before slaughter in a gas chamber. Two slaughterhouse workers in the scene slaughter and hang pigs that have already been gassed" title="black-and-white drawing of anguished-looking pigs being gassed before slaughter in a gas chamber. Two slaughterhouse workers in the scene slaughter and hang pigs that have already been gassed" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="“Gassing Hogs” (2010) by Sue Coe. | © 2010 Sue Coe/Courtesy Galerie St. Etienne, New York." data-portal-copyright="© 2010 Sue Coe/Courtesy Galerie St. Etienne, New York." />
<p class="has-text-align-none">I feel more sanguine about recent policy victories in which advocates have gotten numerous states, most recently, Nevada, to <a href="https://www.humanesociety.org/blog/breaking-nevada-becomes-9th-state-ban-cages-egg-laying-hens">ban battery cages</a> for chickens. Obviously, these bans don’t challenge the fundamental commodity status of chickens, and chickens deserve far more. But it does <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23588340/egg-prices-expensive-bird-flu-shortage-price-gouging">impose an external cost</a> on the smooth operation of chicken farming, one that the industry would not willingly adopt for itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From this standpoint, I am disheartened when I see animal advocates so publicly decry veganism’s supposed failures. Partly because doing so creates a self-fulfilling prophecy — discouraging individuals from going vegan by making it seem like a lost cause from the get-go, as Stanescu <a href="https://www.criticalanimal.com/2019/07/guest-post-response-to-claim-that-only.html">notes</a>. But more fundamentally, it inaccurately frames the present moment. It is not that “promoting veganism has failed, so it is time to move onto new strategies.” Rather: veganism <em>opens</em> <em>the way</em> for these new strategies. The acorn does not negate the value of the oak tree it came from.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Admittedly, solidarity doesn’t provide clean lines that can uncontroversially decide which reforms are or are not permissible. But it hopefully offers more useful criteria than reform for the sake of reform.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The joy of veganism</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I have so far emphasized that veganism has broader, political implications beyond individual behavior change. But the way that <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24131229/vegan-vegetarian-meatless-climate-solutions-recipes-connection">it shapes the lives</a> of individuals who become vegan can be <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/matthew-c-halteman/hungry-beautiful-animals/9781541602052/?lens=basic-books">extremely powerful</a>, too. Political veganism can better attune advocates as they persuade individuals of the practice’s virtues.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Political scientists have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/12/11/protests-shape-policy-by-shaping-protesters/">observed</a> that political protests change the character of those who protest, even if the protest doesn’t achieve its stated policy goal. If, for example, you attend a protest against a new oil pipeline, what was once an abstract issue on a computer screen becomes alive to you. You learn that you are not alone, and you might find sustenance in community with others who care about climate politics as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Veganism as solidarity can have a similar effect. Abstaining from animal products in a world that disavows animal suffering prevents the vegan from forgetting the character of this world; it puts them into constant confrontation with it every time they go to the grocery store, buy clothes, and commune with others. To rework Upton Sinclair’s famous <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/21810-it-is-difficult-to-get-a-man-to-understand-something">line</a>, it is hard to get a person to think clearly about animals when their everyday life depends on animal slaughter, degradation, and exploitation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9749860/#ref78">One </a><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0160597616640308?journalCode=hasa">objection</a> to this individual-level view is that veganism privileges those without gastrointestinal or other disabilities and those who can financially afford these restrictions. You may have an image of a vegan eating organic vegetables and overpriced meat substitutes from Whole Foods. While I would note there is evidence suggesting that plant-based diets can <a href="https://theconversation.com/vegan-vegetarian-and-flexitarian-diets-could-save-you-money-new-research-171559">cut food costs</a> in industrialized countries and that survey results find that people with <a href="https://news.gallup.com/file/poll/510047/230824VegetarianVegan.pdf">lower incomes</a> are more likely to be vegan, framing veganism as solidarity offers an alternative way of considering this issue. Calling for solidarity with regard to any cause or campaign entails asking potential allies to undertake some sort of sacrifice, whether that be in terms of money, time, or power. Having the resources to undertake these sacrifices is by nature unequally distributed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The call for solidarity with animals goes out equally to every person, but fulfilling that call may look different for everyone. For those who do not face substantial financial or health barriers, the demands are quite high, in my view. For others, full veganism might be an aspiration, which they fulfill in the present by lowering their animal consumption where possible. This is not an iron-clad, all-or-nothing law. Accidentally consuming animal products, or eating an “emotional-support pastry” in an otherwise vegan diet, is less important in the long scheme of things, because solidarity is a call that can be answered anew each day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Answering this call is not about purist asceticism; it is affirmatively oriented toward building community. It builds new connections that wouldn’t have otherwise existed; it helps you see new ways of being in the world that weren’t there before. It opens you to the joy of being with nonhuman others, of refusing “species loneliness,” what botanist Robin Wall Kimmerer <a href="https://milkweed.org/book/braiding-sweetgrass">describes</a> as “a deep, unnamed sadness stemming from estrangement from the rest of Creation.” You see the world as more enchanted and alive when creatures around you appear as individuals and not interchangeable automatons.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Veganism, thought of in this way, is not the province of dour, dogmatic scolds; it is a practice of joy and creativity that sustains hope for coexistence between species. As Cochrane and Cojocaru <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/josp.12460">write</a>, this sort of solidarity recognizes that “the world in which we live is not the one we must live with forever.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a vision worth fighting for.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the last few decades, a common stereotype about vegans emerged: that they’re white, care more about animals than people, and serve food that is bland and uninspiring. Such perceptions — some of which are reductive, <a href="https://www.treehugger.com/preachy-vegan-counterproductive-cliche-5120850">while others hold a bit of truth</a> —&nbsp;have created a toxic cycle where people of color often feel excluded from vegan communities, and because of the lack of diversity, these communities struggle to foster a coalition that can lead to real change.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“As a Black man in animal rights, I’ve definitely [been] — the only Black person at events or the only person of color — and it’s definitely a bit isolating,” said Christopher “Soul” Eubanks, a Black animal rights advocate in Georgia and <a href="https://www.vox.com/23948915/christopher-soul-eubanks-apex-advocacy-founder-future-perfect-50-2023">Future Perfect 50 honoree.</a> “And that’s why a lot of people of color that join this space may burn out, because they don’t see representation when they are here, and they’re just tired of having to correct people or weighing certain issues at the table.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s 2024 — and so much change has happened in nearly every activist space. As the push to protect abortion access and combat climate change grows stronger, organizations like <a href="https://blackgirlenvironmentalist.org/">Black Girl Environmentalist</a> and <a href="https://arc-southeast.org/">ARC Southeast</a>, a reproductive justice support group in the South, have worked across race, gender, and class to assemble mass movements. Vegans and animal rights activists have made some major strides in recent years; <a href="https://vegconomist.com/market-and-trends/pbfa-plant-based-food-service/">restaurants</a> and <a href="https://plantbasedfoods.org/2021-retail-sales-data-plant-based-food">grocery stores</a> carry far more vegan options compared to a decade ago, and the Supreme Court last year upheld <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23721488/prop-12-scotus-pork-pigs-factory-farming-california-bacon">California’s Proposition 12</a>, a landmark law that outlawed the sale of many animal products produced using <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/353393/farm-bill-republicans-prop-12-gestation-crates-pork">tiny, inhumane cages</a>. But neglecting the voices of people of color for so long has meant there are obvious gaps amid these successes: There’s a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233571944_The_Under-representation_of_African_American_Employees_in_Animal_Welfare_Organizations_in_the_United_States">lack of Black-led animal welfare organizations</a>, <a href="https://www.urban.org/research/publication/food-insecurity-increased-second-straight-year-2023">food insecurity still disproportionately affects Black and Hispanic households</a>, and harmful vegan rhetoric often inaccurately portrays <a href="https://sentientmedia.org/veganism-is-not-anti-indigenous/">Indigenous traditions</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I’m tired of looking at the same events and seeing the same people speak, and there [are] barely any Black and Brown vegans or animal rights activists being represented,” said Isaias Hernandez, an environmental educator and activist. He also runs a popular <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@queerbrownvegan">TikTok</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/queerbrownvegan/">Instagram account</a> called ​@queerbrownvegan to help raise awareness about how environmental justice should encompass issues of race, gender, and class.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The problem is wider than just representation politics, however: Black Americans, Indigenous peoples, and other communities of color are disproportionately the ones suffering from the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23003487/north-carolina-hog-pork-bacon-farms-environmental-racism-black-residents-pollution-meat-industry">ills of factory farming</a>, whether it’s through <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/press-releases/new-drinking-water-report-communities-color-more-likely-suffer-drinking-water">water pollution</a> that leads to higher rates of cancer or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/25/us-farms-made-200m-human-smuggling-labor-trafficking-operation">having to work in grueling farms</a> that have few protections for people and animals alike. While not everyone turns to a plant-based diet because of animal rights alone, the plights of people of color and animals are very much intertwined.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">White supremacy resulted in the <a href="https://www.pbs.org/buffalowar/buffalo.html">mass slaughter of animals vital to Indigenous communities</a>, the booming <a href="https://foodwhistleblower.org/racial-injustice-the-truth-about-industrial-agriculture/">meat industries</a> built on <a href="https://thehumaneleague.org/article/indigenous-communities-factory-farming">stolen Indigenous land</a>, and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/feb/15/us-agriculture-census-farming">lack of land ownership for nonwhite farmers</a>. These global, meat-reliant foodways have direct ties to slavery and colonialism, <a href="https://sentientmedia.org/the-food-system-is-built-on-white-supremacy/">experts argue</a>. Many vegans of color feel these connections have not been prioritized or well understood within the animal movement.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The issue with the animal rights movement is that it still failed to acknowledge the role of white supremacy in creating these industrialized systems,” Hernandez said. “When I’m trying to deep-dive into industrialized agriculture, not just looking at how it affects humans, but understanding why these industrialized systems came about through colonization through chattel slavery, I think those conversations are then ignored, mainly because it challenges many of the dominant animal spaces — that are typically white people — to challenge their own power and privilege.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to the activists I spoke with, the key to making vegan activism more inclusive, as well as more effective in accomplishing its goals, is to “decolonize” it. That means addressing the <a href="https://atmos.earth/ipcc-report-colonialism-climate-change/">longstanding harms</a> left by colonialism — think segregation and climate change&nbsp; — that perpetuate other harms, <a href="https://www.kff.org/racial-equity-and-health-policy/issue-brief/how-present-day-health-disparities-for-black-people-are-linked-to-past-policies-and-events/">like health inequities</a>. Without untangling how race, class, and culture affects how and what people are able to eat, then we’re only left with what some call <a href="https://seas.umich.edu/news/breaking-down-white-veganism#:~:text=According%20to%20critics%2C%20vegans%20who,participating%20in%20a%20vegan%20lifestyle.">white veganism</a>, which focuses on animal liberation alone.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Intersectional veganism is needed, because it actually helps people understand that this isn’t just some whitewashed, hippie lifestyle, but rather an extension of understanding liberation,” Hernandez said.&nbsp;</p>

A growing number of Black Americans are choosing veganism." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">As a Black vegan myself, I experience these tensions between white vegans and vegans of color all the time. I first dabbled in vegetarianism in 2019, after watching a documentary that piqued my interest. My curiosity was driven by potential <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24034578/vegan-twin-study-stanford-you-are-what-you-eat-netflix">personal health improvements</a> and a desire to try new foods, but a conversation with my best friend about her growing interest in veganism was my sign to pursue the lifestyle change. At the time, her new career path included recipe development with a focus on vegetable-centric dishes, and I was eager to replicate traditionally non-vegan recipes like broccoli cheddar soup and birria tacos. Surrounding myself with other vegans that prioritize education, community, and accessibility started with her, and it’s been my blueprint for the last five years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The suffering of animals wasn’t worth the decadent recipes we’d grown to love. As a Southerner growing up in the Panhandle of Florida, I was surrounded by fish fries, seafood boils, barbecues, and the most luxurious desserts you can imagine. Giving up soul food — or any cultural dish — is a loss I wasn’t prepared for when I first went vegan. I knew I was signing up for the isolation of being the only vegan at a family cookout or party, but I didn’t expect to rarely interact with other Black vegans at plant-based restaurant meetups, food festivals, and Facebook groups. I’m not alone in feeling that way.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/240722_Vox_BunnaCafe_1319.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.76363770124,100,78.472724597521" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Noella Williams, a Brooklyn-based freelance writer, eats within her vegan diet at Bunna Cafe, an Ethiopian restaurant." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">But decolonizing veganism and ushering in a new era that integrates the lived experiences of all into animal activism is possible. That vision is burgeoning, from the chefs of color reintroducing dishes rooted in history to the activists fighting for more nuanced discussions in the animal movement, Black veganism empowers and centers those who’ve been failed by our food system <em>while</em> fighting for animal liberation. This is the combination we need to build inclusive communities, so that no one feels alone — and a unified community made up of a multiracial coalition is how we can win the fight against factory farming.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>People of color aren’t new to veganism&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Aph Ko, creator of resource site <a href="https://www.blackvegansrock.com/about">Black Vegans Rock</a>, alongside her sister Syl Ko, popularized the term “Black veganism” in their 2017 book, <em>Aphro-ism: Essays on Pop Culture, Feminism, and Black Veganism from Two Sisters</em>. When I first read it in 2020, I struggled with the connection it drew between animality and race because of the historical dehumanization of people of color through terms like “nonhuman” and “animal.” But animals, they write, are just a category that we “shove certain bodies into when we want to justify violence against them,” and that dynamic should be concerning for minorities because “at any moment you can become an ‘animal’ and be considered disposable.” Their insightful examination of animal rights and its direct link to race and class left me with a stronger sense of solidarity as well as a curiosity for a stronger ancestral connection to my new dietary practices.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The history of veganism and vegetarianism within the Black community can be traced across the diaspora to Rastafarian culture and traditional West African cuisine. The holistic diet of Rastafarians has an <a href="https://www.yesmagazine.org/opinion/2021/07/21/vegan-history-caribbean-rastafarian">anti-capitalist history</a>, emerging in the 1930s by Jamaicans fighting colonialism. Most Ital cuisine — which is the dietary lifestyle rooted in Rastafarian culture — usually consists of cabbage, callaloo, legumes, scotch bonnet peppers, coconut milk, and kidney beans.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">West African cuisine for centuries has had its own plant-based dishes like the peanut-based domoda in the Gambia, while East Africa’s extravagant Ethiopian plates included atakilt wat, gomen, misir wat, and injera. <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/caribbean-food-is-powerful-enough-to-be-a-peacemaker">Caribbean and African food has been a form of sharing history</a> among the African diaspora, preserving familial traditions, and transforming native crops into dishes. There’s a beauty within our plant-based traditions that have long been neglected, but now more and more people are rediscovering these dishes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of the best meals that I’ve had in New York City have been at vegan Caribbean and African restaurants like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/auntsetuncles/?hl=en">Aunts et Uncles</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/healthyasamotha/?hl=en">HAAM</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bunnacafe/?hl=en">Bunna Cafe</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rasplantbased/?hl=en">RAS Plant Based</a>. At Bunna Cafe, a brunch platter includes a combination of crumbled injera with cooked kabocha squash, berbere, onion, ginger, and garlic, served with a side of dairy-free yogurt. The welcoming environment of each restaurant, down to the music, hospitality, and thoughtful dishes, is a sweet reminder of my upbringing. On the weekends, Bunna Cafe holds an hour-long coffee ceremony to “promote Ethiopian culture in a good light” and encourage their customers to participate in the weekly tradition, the restaurant’s co-founder, Liyuw Ayalew, told me.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I grew up in a Caribbean household with a Trinidadian father and Jamaican mother, so meals consisted of ackee and saltfish, curry chicken, and beef patties. With the absence of these animal-based proteins, I was inspired to read the cookbooks of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sweetpotatosoul/?hl=en">Jenné Claiborne</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bryantterry/?hl=en">Bryant Terry</a>, two of the first Black vegans I followed at the beginning of my journey, to reconnect with my heritage.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As the plant-based liaison for my omnivore friends, simple conversations about my veganism has drawn curiosity about transitioning to a meatless diet. <a href="https://www.vox.com/23934373/genesis-butler-animal-rights-climate-activist-future-perfect-50-2023">Genesis Butler</a>, a teen animal rights advocate (and another <a href="https://www.vox.com/23934373/genesis-butler-animal-rights-climate-activist-future-perfect-50-2023">Future Perfect 50 honoree</a>), said she experiences something similar. Her Afro-Indigenous identity in addition to her passion for environmentalism and climate justice makes her more effective at educating others about veganism, she told me.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/240722_Vox_BunnaCafe_128-CROP.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,29.316644851658,100,41.366710296684" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Some people feel making veganism intersectional takes away from the animals, but I disagree,” she says. “I think I have more of a reach now that I am intersectional because I know how to talk about veganism in an effective way to people outside of the animal rights movement. This is so important because they are the individuals we want to reach.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Butler’s right — for many people of color, earnestly talking to someone who shares your lived experience and can authoritatively speak to issues of food accessibility and intersectional veganism can be much more impactful than watching a documentary about factory farming. That human connection has led to tearful conversations that I’ve shared with friends about race and food, but it’s also shaped me to confidently recreate the best home-cooked meals that I never imagined making five years ago. I’ve evolved into the vegan that I desperately searched for in 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Building a vegan movement with an anti-racist foundation</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The power dynamics within a predominantly white animal rights group are often apparent when there’s a racial discrepancy, such as an interaction with the police officers present at an animal rights protest.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Eubanks — the Georgia-based animal rights advocate — was involved with street activism between 2018 and 2021,<strong> </strong>he was typically delegated as the police liaison for any protests that he organized. But “after one interaction outside of a slaughterhouse, when a police officer seemed to have one hand close to his gun throughout our interaction, I began having someone that was white co-liaison with me,” Eubanks told me. “That’s a rule that I&#8217;ve adhered to now whenever I participate in advocacy.” According to a 2022 report by the <a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/contacts-between-police-and-public-2020">Bureau of Justice Statistics</a>, Black Americans are more likely to experience threats or nonfatal use of force from the police at an alarmingly disproportionate rate to their white counterparts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These moments led to the creation of <a href="https://www.apexadvocacy.org/">APEX Advocacy</a>, a nonprofit that advocates for the collective liberation of animals and people. “We also acknowledge that the people that advocate for animals are also systematically oppressed,” Eubanks said. “So we consider that when we create our campaigns, activities, and programs.” APEX hosts Pre-Animal Activist Week (PAAW, for short), an annual immersive boot camp for social justice advocates of color with an interest in animal advocacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">BIPOC-led animal and vegan advocacy groups, like APEX Advocacy and <a href="https://www.afrovegansociety.org/">the Afro-Vegan Society</a>, already exist to prioritize vegans of color. How can we replicate this throughout the remainder of the vegan community?</p>

<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"><img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/240722_Vox_BunnaCafe_756.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.76363770124,100,78.472724597521" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />

<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/240722_Vox_BunnaCafe_759.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.76363770124,100,78.472724597521" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" /></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It begins with moving beyond dietary restrictions. If we want to create a world where more people of color want to become vegan, we also need to ensure that there’s an active, inclusive community to fight against the prejudice that exists within the group, which is necessary to confront not just for their own sake, but also because they help us build a stronger movement. “We can’t just talk about veganism as a diet or highlight the diet aspects of it, because for us to really decolonize, we have to look at it as a social justice space,” Eubanks says.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Who should we feature in this year’s Future Perfect 50 list?</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Every year, the Future Perfect team highlights the thinkers, activists, and scholars working on today’s (and tomorrow’s) biggest problems. Have ideas? <strong>Let us know by <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdd3SzCg_3ZJR6CjVfwlhJaAB2uAlX_id9ezyVbk7UZG2iQJA/viewform?usp=sf_link">filling out this form</a>.</strong></p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Black veganism inherently is about empowering people who’ve been failed by our food system at the same time as it’s about animal liberation — that’s how we get everyone on board. Take the concept of food deserts, for example. Food deserts aren’t natural, but created by policy. With this understanding, Black vegans believe that solutions for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/15/food-apartheid-food-deserts-racism-inequality-america-karen-washington-interview">food apartheid</a> —&nbsp;or the deliberate separation of affordable fresh food in low-income communities —&nbsp;must be nimble. A socially aware, yet still vegan approach to solving a local instance of food apartheid could look like monetarily supporting community services to offer accessible education about plant-based nutrition, free plant-based school lunches, and fully-stocked food pantries.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Animal rights activism also should be led by people of color, instead of a small percentage of tokenized Black and Brown faces. <a href="https://www.apexadvocacy.org/blog/palestine">Much like APEX</a>, more animal groups should be challenging the US’s complicity in the systematic killing and starvation of the Palestinian people. Unity among communities of color has been an ideal backbone for successful mass movements, such as the <a href="https://southsideweekly.com/fifty-years-fred-hampton-rainbow-coalition-young-lords-black-panthers/">Rainbow Coalition</a> in 1960s Chicago or the history of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/05/30/black-lives-matter-palestine-history-491234">solidarity between Palestinians and Black Americans</a>. When whiteness is completely decentered in organizing circles, there’s an opportunity to reimagine a future that prioritizes collective liberation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If we’re not including the experiences of oppressed people and advocating for holistic anti-racist solutions, there’s no future that liberates humans and nonhuman animals alike. Veganism that consciously acknowledges race, gender, and class is key to ending our collective oppression, and it can start overnight by developing consistent compassion for all.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jeremy Beckham remembers the announcement coming over his middle school’s PA system in the winter of 1999: Everyone was to stay in their classrooms because there was an<strong> </strong>intrusion on campus.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A day after the brief lockdown was lifted at Eisenhower Junior High School just outside Salt Lake City, the rumors were swirling. Supposedly,<strong> </strong>someone from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) had, like a pirate claiming a captured ship, climbed the school flagpole and cut down the McDonald’s flag that had been flying there just under Old Glory.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The animal rights group <a href="https://www.coloradocentralmagazine.com/heard-around-the-west-6/">was</a> indeed<strong> </strong><a href="https://mcspotlight.org/media/press/saltlaketrib_18dec98.html">protesting</a> across the street from the public school over its acceptance of a sponsorship from a fast food giant perhaps <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/how-mcdonald-s-has-shaped-the-food-biz-1.3074081">more responsible than any other</a> for getting generations of Americans hooked on cheap, factory-farmed meat. According to court documents, two people had unsuccessfully tried to take down the flag, though it’s unclear whether they were affiliated with PETA. The police later intervened to stop PETA’s protest, which led to a yearslong legal battle over the activists’ First Amendment rights.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I thought they were psychos with machetes who came to my school &#8230; and didn’t want people to eat meat,” Beckham told me with a laugh.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it planted a seed. In high school, when he became curious about animal mistreatment, he checked PETA’s website. He learned about factory farming, ordered a copy of <em>Animal Liberation</em>, the animal rights classic by philosopher Peter Singer, and went vegan. Later, he got a job at PETA and helped organize <a href="https://slcveg.com/">the Salt Lake City VegFest</a>, a popular vegan food and education festival.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now a law student, Beckham has his critiques of the group, as do many across the animal rights movement. But he credits it with inspiring his work to make the world less hellish for animals.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a quintessential PETA story: the protest, the controversy, the infamy and theatrics, and, ultimately, the conversion.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">PETA — you’ve heard of it, and <a href="https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/43999-american-attitudes-political-groups-yougov">chances are, you have an opinion about it</a>. Nearly 45 years after its founding, the organization has a complicated but undeniable legacy. Known for its ostentatious <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2020/06/24/the-model-and-animal-rights-activist-who-protests-naked-for-peta">protests</a>, the group is almost single-handedly responsible for making animal rights part of the national conversation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The scale of animal exploitation in the United States is staggering. Over <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/livestock-and-meat-domestic-data/">10 billion land animals are slaughtered for food</a> every year, and it’s estimated that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79961-0">over 100 million are killed in experiments</a>. Abuse of animals is rampant in the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24008053/wool-marketing-environment-sustainable-claims-sheep-animal-cruelty-fast-fashion">fashion industry</a>, in <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/4/11/23673393/pets-dogs-cats-animal-welfare-boredom">pet breeding and ownership</a>, and in <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23914885/zoo-animals-conservation-endangered-threatened-species-sanctuaries">zoos</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most of this happens out of sight and out of mind, often without public knowledge or consent. PETA has fought for over four decades to put a spotlight on these atrocities and trained generations of animal activists now active throughout the country.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23737349/peter-singer-philosophy-animal-welfare-factory-farming-euthanasia-disabled-ethics">Peter Singer</a>, who is widely credited for galvanizing the modern animal rights movement, told me: “I can’t think of any other organization that can compare with PETA in terms of the overall influence that it has had and still is having on the animal rights movement.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Its controversial tactics are not above critique. But the key to PETA’s success has been its very refusal to be well-behaved, forcing us to look at what we might rather ignore: humanity’s mass exploitation of the animal world.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the spring of 1976, the American Museum of Natural History was picketed by activists bearing signs that read, “Castrate the Scientists.” The protest, organized by the activist Henry Spira and his group Animal Rights International, sought to stop <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1976/07/19/archives/cats-mutilation-laid-to-museum-natural-history-is-accused-of.html">government-funded experiments</a> at the museum that involved mutilating cats’ bodies to test the effects on their sexual instincts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After public outcry, <a href="http://www.animalsandsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/munro1.pdf">the museum agreed to discontinue</a> the research. These protests <a href="https://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Animal_Rights_Crusade.html?id=gYnMlqi0xakC">marked the birth</a> of modern animal rights activism, pioneering a model that PETA would embrace — confrontational protests, media campaigns, direct pressure on corporations and institutions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Animal welfare groups had been around for decades, including the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), founded in 1866; the Animal Welfare Institute (AWI), founded in 1951; and the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), founded in 1954. These groups had taken a reformist and institutionalist approach to animal treatment, pushing for legislation like the 1958 Humane Slaughter Act, which required farm animals to be rendered completely unconscious before slaughter, and the 1966 Animal Welfare Act, which called for more humane treatment of laboratory animals. (Both acts are considered landmark animal welfare laws, yet they exempt from protection the vast majority of food animals — chickens — and the vast majority of lab animals — mice and rats.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But they were either unwilling or unprepared to take a fundamental, confrontational stance in opposition to animal experimentation and, especially, to the use of animals for food, even as these industries grew precipitously. By 1980, the year PETA was founded, the US was already slaughtering over 4.6 billion animals a year and <a href="https://ota.fas.org/reports/8601.pdf">killing between 17 and 22 million</a> in experiments.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rapid post-war industrialization of animal exploitation gave rise to a new generation of activists. Many came from the environmental movement, where Greenpeace had been protesting commercial seal hunts and radical direct-action groups like the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society had been sinking whaling vessels. Others, like Spira, were inspired by the “animal liberation” philosophy advanced by Peter Singer and articulated in his 1975 book <em>Animal Liberation</em>. But the movement was small, fringe, scattered, and underfunded.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">British-born Ingrid Newkirk had been managing animal shelters in Washington, DC, when she met Alex Pacheco, a George Washington University political science major who had been active with Sea Shepherd and was a committed adherent of <em>Animal Liberation</em>. It was around this book’s ideas that the two decided to start a grassroots animal rights group: People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Animal Liberation</em> argues that humans and animals share a number of basic interests, most notably the interest in living free from harm, which should be respected. The failure to recognize this interest by most people, Singer argues, stems from a bias in favor of one’s own species that he calls speciesism, akin to racists ignoring the interests of members of other races.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Singer does not claim that animals and humans have the same interests but rather that animals’ interests are denied to them for no legitimate reason but our assumed right to use them as we please.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The obvious difference between anti-speciesism and abolitionism or women’s liberation, of course, is that the oppressed are not the same species as their oppressors and lack the capacity to rationally voice arguments or organize on their own behalf. They require human surrogates to urge their fellow humans to reconsider their place in the hierarchy of species.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">PETA’s <a href="https://www.peta.org/about-peta/">mission statement</a> is <em>Animal Liberation</em> breathed into life: “PETA opposes&nbsp;<a href="https://headlines.peta.org/end-speciesism/">speciesism</a>, a human-supremacist worldview.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The group’s rapid rise from obscurity to household name was propelled by its first two major investigations into animal abuse. Its first <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1993/04/19/the-raid-at-silverspring">target</a>, in 1981, was the Institute for Behavioral Research in Silver Spring, Maryland.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the now-defunct lab, neuroscientist Edward Taub was severing the nerves of macaques, permanently leaving them with limbs they could see but could not feel. He aimed to test whether the maimed monkeys could nevertheless be trained to use these limbs, theorizing that the research could help people regain control of their bodies after suffering a stroke or spinal cord injury.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pacheco <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1993/04/19/the-raid-at-silverspring">got an unpaid position</a> assisting with experiments, using the time to document the conditions there. The experiments themselves, however grotesque, were legal, but the level of care for the monkeys and the sanitary conditions at the lab appeared to fall short of Maryland’s animal welfare laws. Having gathered enough evidence, PETA presented it to the state’s attorney, who pressed animal abuse charges against Taub and his assistant. Simultaneously, PETA released shocking photos Pacheco had taken of the confined monkeys to the press.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Silver-Spring-monkey_4_2a78f6.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,31.44637131609,100,37.10725736782" alt="Photo of monkey in a lab with its arms and legs tied to poles and its head locked in place.Photo of monkey in a lab with its arms and legs tied to poles and its head locked in place." title="Photo of monkey in a lab with its arms and legs tied to poles and its head locked in place.Photo of monkey in a lab with its arms and legs tied to poles and its head locked in place." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A monkey used by neuroscientist Edward Taub at the Institute of Behavioral Health in Silver Spring, Maryland. | Image courtesy of PETA" data-portal-copyright="Image courtesy of PETA" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">PETA protestors dressed as caged monkeys picketed the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which had funded the research. The press <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1981/10/11/the-monkeys-a-rally-for-animal-lovers/e5a3195a-c9d6-4e6b-891a-019dbff36727/">ate it up</a>. Taub was convicted and his lab shut down — <a href="https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-experimentation/silver-spring-monkeys/">the first time this had happened to an animal experimenter in the US</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He was later cleared of the charges by the Maryland Court of Appeals on the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/magazine/1991/02/24/the-great-silver-spring-monkey-debate/25d3cc06-49ab-4a3c-afd9-d9eb35a862c3/">grounds that the state’s animal welfare statutes didn’t apply to</a> the lab because it was federally funded and thus under federal jurisdiction. The American scientific establishment rushed to his defense, rattled by the public and legal opposition to what they viewed as a normal and necessary practice.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For its next act, in 1985, PETA released footage taken by the Animal Liberation Front, a radical group more willing to break the law, of severe abuse of baboons at the University of Pennsylvania. There, under the auspices of studying the effects of whiplash and head injuries in car accidents, baboons were fitted with helmets and strapped to tables, where a sort of hydraulic hammer smashed their heads. The footage showed lab staff mocking concussed and brain-damaged animals. The video, titled “Unnecessary Fuss,” is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrhVxuOZZP8">still available online</a>. A slate of protests at Penn and the NIH followed, as did lawsuits against the university. The experiments were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/05/us/penn-is-told-to-review-labs-and-end-abuses-to-animals.html">discontinued</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Almost overnight, PETA became the most visible animal rights organization in the country. By bringing the public face to face with violence carried out against lab animals, PETA challenged the orthodoxy that scientists used animals ethically, appropriately, or rationally.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Newkirk savvily parlayed the opportunity into fundraising, becoming an early adopter of direct-mailing campaigns to court donors. The idea was to professionalize animal activism, giving the movement a well-funded, organizational home.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/monkeyprotest_4e10a2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,12.973111073261,100,74.053777853477" alt="black-and-white photo of a crowd holding animal testing protest signs, a large banner reads “SAVE THE SILVER SPRING MONKEYS.” A blond woman stands in front of a mic speaking" title="black-and-white photo of a crowd holding animal testing protest signs, a large banner reads “SAVE THE SILVER SPRING MONKEYS.” A blond woman stands in front of a mic speaking" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Ingrid Newkirk protests to save the Silver Spring monkeys in Washington, DC. | Image courtesy of PETA" data-portal-copyright="Image courtesy of PETA" />
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">PETA’s combination of radicalism and professionalism helped animal rights go big</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The group quickly broadened its efforts to address animal suffering caused by the food, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1981/03/19/fighting-the-fad-for-furs/b1ae9e24-8dab-44b7-af86-e7a153541920/">fashion</a>, and entertainment industries (including circuses and aquariums), in which everyday Americans were most complicit. The plight of farmed animals, in particular, was an issue the American animal rights movement, such as it was, had previously been loath to confront. PETA charged it, conducting <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/10/hog-hell-inside-story-peta-investigation-mowmar-farms/">undercover investigations</a> at factory farms, documenting widespread animal abuse at farms across the country, and bringing attention to common industry practices like the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/353393/farm-bill-republicans-prop-12-gestation-crates-pork">confinement of pregnant pigs</a> to tiny cages.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“‘We will do the homework for you’: that was our mantra,” Newkirk told me about the group’s strategy. “We will show you what goes on in these places where they make the things you’re buying.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">PETA began targeting highly visible national fast food brands, and by the early 1990s, it was running campaigns against “Murder King” and “<a href="https://www.peta.org/about-peta/learn-about-peta/success-stories/farmed-animal-campaigns/wicked-wendys/">Wicked Wendy’s</a>” that eventually led to winning <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/28/business/28burger.html">commitments from those mega-brands to</a> cut ties with farms where abuses were found. “By combining highly visible demonstrations with carefully crafted public relations campaigns, PETA has become adept at arm-twisting major companies into bending to its wishes,” USA Today reported in 2001.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/GettyImages-165328473.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.515821310401,100,78.968357379198" alt="Two protesters, one dressed as a chicken and one dressed as a pig, hold up signs protesting “Murder King”" title="Two protesters, one dressed as a chicken and one dressed as a pig, hold up signs protesting “Murder King”" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="PETA members protest outside Burger King and hand out leaflets as part of its “Murder King” campaign." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">To spread its message, PETA didn’t just rely on the mass media but embraced any medium available, often with strategies that were ahead of its time. This included making short documentaries, often with celebrity narration, released as DVDs or online. Alec Baldwin lent his voice to “<a href="https://www.peta.org/videos/meet-your-meat/">Meet Your Meat,</a>” a short film about factory farms; Paul McCartney did the voiceover for one of its undercover <a href="https://www.peta.org/videos/glass-walls-2/">videos</a>, telling viewers that “if slaughterhouses had glass walls, everyone would be a vegetarian.” The rise of the internet and social media were a godsend for PETA, allowing the group to reach the public directly with undercover videos, calls to organize, and pro-vegan messages (it has amassed a million followers on X, formerly <a href="https://twitter.com/peta?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Twitter</a>, and over 700,000 on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@officialpeta?lang=en">TikTok</a>).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At a time when even vegetarianism was still viewed askance, PETA was the first large NGO to vocally champion veganism, creating widely shared pamphlets full of recipes and plant-based nutritional information. It gave out free veggie dogs at the National Mall; the musician Morrissey, who had titled a Smiths album <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eviyEJRZX30">Meat Is Murder</a> </em>had PETA booths at his concerts; hardcore punk bands like Earth Crisis passed out pro-vegan PETA flyers at their shows.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The animal experimentation and animal agriculture industries are deep-pocketed and deeply entrenched — in taking them on, PETA picked uphill, long-term fights. But bringing the same tactics against weaker opponents has brought quicker results, shifting norms on once-ubiquitous uses of animals, from <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/10/has-peta-finally-won-the-war-against-fur.html">fur</a> to animal testing in cosmetics, with mega-corporations like Unilever <a href="https://www.unilever.com/news/press-and-media/press-releases/2021/27-peta-approved-unilever-brands-join-the-fight-to-save-cruelty-free-cosmetics-in-europe/">touting</a> PETA’s approval of their animal-friendly credentials.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The group has helped end animal use at circuses (including at Ringling Brothers, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/18/ringling-circus-barnum-and-bailey-animals">relaunched in 2022</a> with only human performers) and <a href="https://prime.peta.org/news/peta-decimates-the-cruel-cub-petting-industry/">says</a> it has shut down most wild big cat cub petting zoos in the US.&nbsp;Its many-faceted approach has drawn attention to the sheer breadth of ways that humans harm animals for profit outside the public eye, like in its <a href="https://www.peta.org/blog/history-car-crash-tests-animals/">campaigns</a> against the use of animals in gruesome car crash tests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

The next year, GM ended its use of animals in crash tests. | Image courtesy of PETA" data-portal-copyright="Image courtesy of PETA" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">As it started doing with the Silver Spring monkeys in 1981, PETA is adept at using its investigations and protests to force authorities to enforce animal welfare laws that are otherwise <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/12/11/23500157/neuralink-animal-testing-elon-musk-usda-probe">often flouted</a>. Perhaps its biggest recent victory was against Envigo, a Virginia-based breeder of beagles used in toxicology experiments. A PETA investigator <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/20/beagles-rescued-envigo-medical-breeding-facility">found a litany of violations</a> of the Animal Welfare Act and brought them to the Department of Agriculture, which in turn brought them to the Department of Justice. Envigo pleaded <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/03/us/envigo-beagles-abuse-breeder-guilty.html">guilty</a> to extensive violations of the law, resulting in a $35 million fine — the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/03/us/envigo-beagles-abuse-breeder-guilty.html">largest ever</a> in an animal welfare case — and a ban on the company’s ability to breed dogs. The investigation <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/03/08/virginia-lawmakers-pass-new-regulations-for-controversial-beagle-breeding-facility/">spurred lawmakers</a> in Virginia to pass stricter animal welfare legislation for animal breeding.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">PETA has also become, out of necessity, a force for defending the democratic right to protest. When the industries intimidated by PETA and other animal rights groups doing undercover investigations pushed so-called “ag-gag” laws to prevent whistleblowing on factory farms, the group joined a coalition including the American Civil Liberties Union to challenge them in court, <a href="https://www.abc4.com/news/politics/ap-politics/ap-the-supreme-court-leaves-in-place-a-court-victory-for-peta-over-north-carolinas-ag-gag-law/">winning</a> several <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/08/536186914/judge-overturns-utahs-ag-gag-ban-on-undercover-filming-at-farms">state-level</a> First Amendment victories for animal rights activists and corporate whistleblowers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over 40 years, PETA has grown into a major institution, with a <a href="https://www.peta.org/about-peta/learn-about-peta/financial-report/">2023 operating budget</a> of $75 million and 500 full-time staff, including scientists, lawyers, and policy experts. It is now the de facto face of the American animal rights movement, with <a href="https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/43999-american-attitudes-political-groups-yougov">public opinion</a> on the group split.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Chris Green, executive director of the Animal Legal Defense Fund (with whom I used to work at Harvard’s Animal Law and Policy Program), told me: “Like Hoover for vacuums, PETA has become a proper noun, a proxy for animal protection and animal rights.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The publicity game</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The media has proven hungry for PETA’s provocations, fueling an often mutually beneficial relationship: PETA gets press, and the press can farm outrage, be it at cruelty against animals or at PETA itself, for readers and clicks. This focus on bombast and outrage has not only made PETA many enemies, but it has often undermined, or at least undersold, the seriousness of the group’s goals and the extent of its successes.</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">One surprising thing</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>You might be familiar with PETA’s provocative ad campaigns — but the organization does a lot more than yell at people wearing fur or parade around naked protesters.</strong> They’ve changed corporate norms around cosmetic testing on animals, helped enforce welfare laws that save animals from mistreatment in labs, gotten animals out of cruel circuses, and defended the public’s First Amendment rights.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Long-form coverage of the group tends to focus not on the group’s achievements or even on the actual logic of its messaging but on Newkirk herself, and specifically on the seeming disconnect between her well-mannered persona and her ideas, which drive PETA’s often ill-mannered protests. In <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/04/14/the-extremist-peta-ingrid-newkirk">a 2003 New Yorker profile,</a> Michael Specter declared that Newkirk “is well read, and she can be witty. When she is not proselytizing, denouncing, or attacking the ninety-nine per cent of humanity that sees the world differently from the way she does, she is good company.” He hyperbolically dismissed PETA’s PR strategy as “eighty per cent outrage, ten per cent each of celebrity and truth.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Specter is ventriloquizing an assumed reader who is hostile to Newkirk’s ideas. But calling critique of an orthodox position fanatical or extreme is the first line of defense against actually engaging with the substance of the critique. And so PETA has consistently faced the same pushback as virtually every civil rights and social justice movement before it: too much, too soon, too far, too extreme, too fanatical.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But PETA has made its critics’ work easier by too often stepping over the line between provocation and aggravation. To list some of the worst offenders, the group has made dubious claims <a href="https://time.com/2798480/peta-autism-got-milk/">linking milk consumption to autism</a>, likened meatpackers to <a href="https://www.postbulletin.com/peta-ad-linking-meat-with-mass-murderer-blasted">Jeffrey Dahmer’s cannibalism</a>, attributed Rudy Giuliani’s bout of prostate cancer to milk consumption (in a rare show of contrition, it later <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=123001&amp;page=1">apologized</a>), and compared factory farming to the Holocaust, drawing <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/german-court-orders-peta-to-halt-campaign/a-1146851">extensive</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/mar/03/advertising.marketingandpr">backlash</a>. (Never mind that the latter comparison was also made by the Polish-Jewish writer Isaac Bashevis Singer, who had escaped Europe during the rise of Nazism in Germany and in 1968 <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1968/01/13/the-letter-writer">wrote</a> that “in relation to [animals], all people are Nazis; for the animals, it is an eternal Treblinka.”)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sexualized bodies and nudity, almost always female, are a regular fixture of PETA’s protests and ads; Newkirk herself has been hung up naked amid hog carcasses at London’s Smithfield meat market to show the similarity between human and porcine bodies. Celebrity supporters like <a href="https://www.cnn.com/style/article/peta-naked-fur-campaign-ends/index.html">Pamela Anderson</a> appeared in the longstanding “I’d rather go naked than wear fur” campaign, and naked body-painted activists have protested everything from wool to wild animal captivity. These tactics have <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/40339159.pdf">drawn</a> <a href="https://veganfeministnetwork.com/international-womens-day-is-a-vegan-feminist-issue-not-a-peta-campaign/">accusations</a> of misogyny and even sexual exploitation from feminists and supporters of animal rights concerned with a more intersectional approach to human and animal <a href="http://advocacyethicsanddesign.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/deckha-peta.pdf">liberation</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/AP470019682137.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="A woman (Pamela Anderson) stands in front of a banner showing a photo of her body divided into parts like a cut of meat, titled “ALL ANIMALS HAVE THE SAME PARTS.”" title="A woman (Pamela Anderson) stands in front of a banner showing a photo of her body divided into parts like a cut of meat, titled “ALL ANIMALS HAVE THE SAME PARTS.”" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Pamela Anderson unveils a new PETA ad, 2010. | Akira Suemori/AP Photo" data-portal-copyright="Akira Suemori/AP Photo" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">One former PETA staffer, who asked to speak anonymously, told me that even people within the organization have found some of these messaging choices “problematic.” The press-at-all-costs approach reportedly <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/2001/01/18/animal-rights-group-faulted-as-cultlike-and-abusive/">contributed to</a> co-founder Alex Pacheco’s departure from the organization, and it has <a href="https://www.thebeliever.net/an-interview-with-gary-francione/">drawn criticism</a> from stalwarts of the American animal rights movement, like legal scholar Gary Francione, a one-time Newkirk ally. And while it’s simplistic to conflate all of PETA with Newkirk, many people I spoke with were clear that most decisions, including the most controversial ones, run through her.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For her part, having faced such criticism for over four decades, Newkirk remains blissfully impenitent. “We’re not here to make friends; we’re here to influence people,” she tells me. She seems grimly aware of being among a tiny minority of people who grasp the overwhelming scale of global animal suffering. Her call for reducing the harm humans cause other species is, if anything, eminently reasonable, especially coming from someone who for almost 50 years has been a witness to the worst of those harms. When she speaks about campaigns, she speaks about individual mistreated animals from PETA’s investigations. She can recall the minute details of protests from decades ago and the particular forms of animal abuse that prompted them. She wants to build a movement, but she also wants to do right by animals.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps nowhere is this more visible than in her decision to run an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2021/11/08/why-are-so-many-people-so-cruel-their-dogs/">animal cruelty outreach program</a> and animal shelter in Norfolk, Virginia, that regularly euthanizes animals. One of the longest-running critiques of the organization is that PETA is hypocritical: It is an animal rights activism group that also <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/the-naked-and-the-dead-v26xqbhshfb">kills dogs</a>. It’s ideal grist for the <a href="https://consumerfreedom.com/">Center for Consumer Freedom</a>, an astroturf group long associated with animal agriculture and tobacco interests, which runs a “PETA kills animals” campaign. Google PETA, and chances are this issue comes up.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the reality of animal sheltering is that due to constrained capacity, most shelters kill stray cats and dogs that they take in and can’t rehome — a crisis created by the poorly regulated breeding of animals in the pet industry that PETA itself fights against. PETA’s shelter takes in animals regardless of their state of health, no questions asked, and, as a result, ends up <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/03/petas-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-history-of-killing-animals/254130/">euthanizing more animals on average</a> than other shelters in Virginia, according to public records. The program has also blundered brutally, once <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/17/peta-sorry-for-taking-girls-dog-putting-it-down">prematurely euthanizing a pet chihuahua they assumed to be a stray</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So why do it? Why would an organization so concerned with PR provide detractors with such an obvious target?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Daphna Nachminovitch, PETA’s vice president for animal cruelty investigations, told me that focusing on the shelter misses the extensive work PETA does to help animals in the community, and that the shelter is taking in animals that would suffer more if they were left to die without anyone to take them: “Trying to improve the lives of animals <em>is</em> animal rights,” she said. Nonetheless, a long-time movement insider told me that “PETA euthanizing animals is absolutely a detriment to PETA’s image and bottom line. From a reputation, donor, and income vantage it is the worst thing that PETA is doing … Everyone would prefer they don’t do this. But Ingrid just won’t turn her back on the dogs.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">But is it effective?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, questions about messaging and strategic choices are questions about effectiveness. And that is the big question mark around PETA: Is it effective? Or at least as effective as it can be? Measuring the influence of social movements and protests is notoriously difficult. An entire academic literature exists and is, ultimately, inconclusive on what works and what doesn’t to achieve different activist goals, or how one should define those goals in the first place.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Take the sexualized images. “Sex sells, always has done,” says Newkirk. A raft of <a href="https://psmag.com/social-justice/sexual-politics-veganism-81263">vocal</a> <a href="https://www.salon.com/2013/12/20/surprise_peta_sex_doesnt_sell/">criticism</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3867429/">some academic research</a> suggests otherwise. It may get attention but ultimately could be counterproductive to winning adherents.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it’s hard to isolate the effect. Currently, PETA says it has attracted over <a href="https://www.peta.org/about-peta/">9 million</a> members and supporters around the globe. It is one of the best-funded animal rights organizations in the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Would it have more or less money and membership if it had chosen different strategies? It’s impossible to say. It’s entirely plausible that the very visibility obtained via its controversial tactics makes PETA attractive to deep-pocketed allies and reaches people who might otherwise have never considered animal rights.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The same uncertainty applies to PETA’s promotion of veganism. While there are certainly more vegan options at supermarkets and restaurants than there were in 1980, vegans still only make up about <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/510038/identify-vegetarian-vegan.aspx">1 percent</a> of the American population.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite almost 45 years of work, PETA has not convinced even a meaningful minority of Americans to eschew meat. Since it was founded, meat production in the country has <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census">doubled</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But to see this as a failure misses the scale of the challenge and the forces arrayed against it. Meat-eating is a deeply culturally-entrenched habit, facilitated by the ubiquity of cheap meat made possible by factory farming, the hydra-like political influence of agricultural lobbies, and the omnipresence of advertising for meat. PETA spends $75 million per year on all of its staff and campaigns, with some percentage of that aimed at opposing meat-eating. The American fast food industry alone <a href="https://today.uconn.edu/2021/06/rudd-center-new-study-finds-fast-food-companies-spending-more-on-advertising-disproportionately-targeting-black-and-latino-youth/">spent</a> about $5 billion in 2019 promoting the opposite message.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Shifting the behavior of the public on something as personal as diet is <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/163079/convince-people-eat-less-meat">a problem</a> no one in the animal rights movement (or the environmental or public health movements, for that matter) has solved. Peter Singer, when I speak to him, concedes that to the extent he envisioned a political project in <em>Animal Liberation</em>, it was one of consciousness-raising resulting in a consumer movement like an organized boycott. “The idea was that once people know, they won’t participate,” he told me. “And that hasn’t quite happened.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nor has PETA’s work resulted in truly transformative federal legislation, like taxes on meat, stronger animal welfare laws, or a moratorium on federal funding for animal experiments. What’s needed to achieve this in the US is brute lobbying power. And when it comes to lobbying power, PETA, and the animal rights movement as a whole, is lacking.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Justin Goodman, senior vice president at White Coat Waste Project, a group that opposes government funding for animal testing, told me that by being seen as alienating and perhaps unserious, PETA is “yelling from the outside” while the industries it opposes have armies of lobbyists.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“You can count on one hand the number of animal rights people on the Hill,” he says, “so no one’s scared. PETA should want to be like the NRA — where they have a negative view of you, but they’re afraid of you.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By contrast, Wayne Hsiung, a lawyer, founder of the animal rights group Direct Action Everywhere, <a href="https://blog.simpleheart.org/p/i-got-arrested-protesting-petas-ingrid">now-and-again Newkirk critic</a>, and author of the excellent <a href="https://www.directactioneverywhere.com/dxe-in-the-news/2015-7-27-why-activism-not-veganism-is-the-moral-baseline">essay</a> “Why activism, not veganism, is the moral baseline,” questions whether the number of people converted to veganism or even societal rates of meat consumption are the right metrics by which to measure PETA’s success. The animal rights movement, he told me, “has a very neoliberal conception of success that looks at economic indicators, but economics [like how many animals are produced and eaten] will be a lagging indicator.”&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“PETA should want to be like the NRA — where they have a negative view of you, but they’re afraid of you”</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The better metric is how many activists are getting active, how many people are engaged in non-violent sustained action on behalf of your cause,” he said. “Today, unlike 40 years ago, you have hundreds of people storming factory farms, hundreds of thousands of people voting on state-wide ballot initiatives … PETA more than any other organization is responsible for that.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When it comes to pollinating ideas, PETA has sown countless seeds of animal rights activism. Virtually everyone I spoke to for this piece, including many critics, credited some aspect of PETA’s operations with motivating them to get involved in the movement, be it through flyers at a punk show, undercover videos disseminated on DVD or online, or Newkirk’s own writing and public speaking.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jeremy Beckham might not have helped start the Salt Lake City VegFest, or even become vegan, if not for the PETA protest at his middle school. Bruce Friedrich, who founded the Good Food Institute, a nonprofit promoting alternative protein, was PETA’s campaign coordinator for that protest. Today, former PETA staffers teach at universities, run plant-based meat companies, and have senior positions at other nonprofits.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">PETA has also shaped the work of other groups. A number of animal rights movement insiders I spoke to argued that large animal welfare groups like the Humane Society of the United States would not have committed serious resources to anti-factory farming work if not for PETA cutting a path for them. Legacy animal welfare organizations now do the grunt work —&nbsp;filing litigation, posting public comments on proposed regulations, getting ballot initiatives in front of voters —&nbsp;necessary to make incremental change. They deserve their own share of the credit for the successes of recent decades. But they have also benefited from PETA acting not only as an inspiration to them but as an animal rights bogeyman to others.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A senior staffer at a major animal welfare advocacy group told me: “Having PETA out there doing all these bombastic, questionable things, it makes other animal protection organizations look like more reasonable partners when advocating for legislation, regulations, or other institutional change.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Newkirk, meanwhile, remains an iconoclast. She is loath to criticize other organizations directly — something for which many people I spoke to, including fierce critics, praised her — but she is adamant about staking out clear and potentially unpopular positions for PETA.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After spending decades urging the movement to take farmed animals seriously, with PETA even <a href="https://www.peta.org/about-peta/learn-about-peta/success-stories/farmed-animal-campaigns/murderking/">praising fast food chains</a> for making commitments to more humane treatment of animals, Newkirk has at times <a href="https://www.sfweekly.com/archives/nothing-s-good-enough-for-peta-including-prop-12/article_5b92c058-9308-5023-9145-d67c8aab2ad9.html">been</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNWjZE01siM"> critical</a> of a turn in animal advocacy toward improving conditions for animals on factory farms rather than abolishing factory farms altogether. PETA <a href="https://www.peta.org/blog/why-we-oppose-californias-farmed-animal-initiative-and-you-should-too/">opposed</a> Proposition 12, a landmark animal welfare law passed by California voters in 2018, over those objections (a few years later, however, Newkirk herself was <a href="https://www.peta.org/blog/supreme-court-decision-california-prop-12/">protesting</a> in favor of upholding Prop 12 at the Supreme Court when it heard a legal challenge from factory farming interests).&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>We’re all living in PETA’s world</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In making sense of PETA, start not with the group, but with the crisis it is trying to address. Humans mete out violence against animals on an almost unimaginable scale. It is a violence that is ubiquitous and normalized, carried out by individuals, organizations, companies, and governments, often entirely legally. Not only have few people attempted to tackle this violence seriously, most don’t even recognize it as violence. How do you challenge this status quo, when most people would rather tune out your arguments?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">PETA, an imperfect but necessary messenger, offered one answer, as best as it could.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, more animals are bred and killed in horrendous conditions than at any other point in human existence. Over more than 40 years, PETA has not achieved its goal of ending speciesism.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it has, nonetheless and against the odds, forever altered the debate around animal use. In the US, animals are, for the most part, out of circuses. Fur is considered taboo by many. Animal testing is divisive, with half of Americans <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9252265/">opposed to the practice</a>. Meat-eating has become the subject of spirited public debate. Perhaps more importantly, there are now many more groups committed to animal welfare. There is more donor money. More politicians are <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/11/22/23471771/cory-booker-meat-farming-industrial-agriculture-accountability-act">speaking</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23516639/veterinarians-avma-factory-farming-ventilation-shutdown">out</a> about factory farming.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Anti-fur-protest_Alaska-1996.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.311473955098,100,79.377052089804" alt="photo of a snowy street with a view of four activists from behind that appear naked, each wearing Santa hats and holding a large banner behind them that reads “WE’D RATHER GO NAKED THAN WEAR FUR.” " title="photo of a snowy street with a view of four activists from behind that appear naked, each wearing Santa hats and holding a large banner behind them that reads “WE’D RATHER GO NAKED THAN WEAR FUR.” " data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Anti-fur protest in Anchorage, Alaska, 1996. | Image courtesy of PETA" data-portal-copyright="Image courtesy of PETA" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Progress in any social movement is slow, incremental, and bumpy. But PETA has provided a blueprint. It started with a strong and nonnegotiable ethical and political goal and realized it could have the most impact over the long term through professionalization and developing a wide supporter network. It was unafraid of controversy and confrontation, making sure people knew the name PETA.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It also made missteps that harmed its reputation and that of the movement.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But wherever the animal rights movement goes from here, and whatever strategies it chooses, it will need large, well-funded organizations to fight the big fights, in courtrooms and in the court of public opinion. And it will need leaders, like Newkirk, whose commitment to the cause is absolute.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">India’s star Olympic wrestler Vinesh Phogat is out of the competition ahead of a gold medal match, after being disqualified for being over her class’s weight limit. It’s a devastating end to the Paris games for the wrestler who has led the charge against sexual harassment at the highest levels of her sport.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Had she been able to compete and won Wednesday’s match, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/world/olympics/vinesh-phogat-disqualified-wrestling.html">she would have been the first Indian woman to win a gold medal in any Olympic event</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Phogat, who often wrestles at a 53-kilogram weight — or about 116 pounds — made the 50-kilogram (about 110 pounds) berth after another wrestler won the 53-kilogram spot on India’s wrestling team. She knew that getting down to competition weight would be difficult, she said in an <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/how-vinesh-phogat-wrestled-with-her-50-kg-weight-challenge/articleshow/112350748.cms?from=mdr">April interview</a>: “I gain weight easily. It doesn’t matter how fit I am, I still gain weight because I have a lot of muscle mass.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She had been able to maintain the lower weight until Wednesday, when she weighed in at just 100 grams over the weight limit — despite the drastic measures she had taken over the past week to maintain her 50-kilogram weight. Phogat barely ate, spent hours in a sauna and exercised, and even tried cutting her hair to make weight, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sports/olympics/wrestling-indias-phogat-out-gold-medal-bout-after-failing-make-weight-2024-08-07/">according to Team India’s chief medical officer</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But that 100 grams — around 3.5 ounces — meant she couldn’t compete in Wednesday’s match, and wouldn’t receive a medal at all despite her dominance. She put up a phenomenal performance in Paris, beating out <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/olympics/2024/08/07/susaki-wrestling-defeat/">Japanese Olympic gold medalist Yui Susaki</a> in the first round, and dominating thereafter, seemingly guaranteeing India either a gold or silver medal. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her wins — and sudden disqualification — have put her recent crusade against sexual harassment in India’s national wrestling organization back in the spotlight. And though her Olympics are over, there’s now global attention on her activism as much as her athletic prowess. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sexual harassment is a problem in India — and in sports</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Phogat spent months last year as the face of a campaign to remove Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh as head of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI), the body governing the sport in India.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Phogat and other women wrestlers accused Singh of sexual exploitation, and Phogat in particular alleged that he emotionally and psychologically tormented her following the Tokyo Summer Games, where she just missed out on a medal. After filing a complaint with the Indian Olympic Association, and receiving little response, they mounted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/05/world/asia/india-wrestlers-harassment-protest.html?pgtype=Article&amp;action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks">a May 2023 protest</a> in New Delhi — where they were reportedly assaulted by police.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sexual harassment is a problem everywhere, and India is no different. A 2024 <a href="https://ceda.ashoka.edu.in/a-decade-of-the-posh-act-what-the-data-tells-us-about-how-india-inc-has-fared/">Centre for Economic Data &amp; Analysis study</a> found workplace sexual harassment to be on the rise in India (though reporting mechanisms have increased, too), and a <a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/099630010202217290/pdf/IDU08bcf65ff0ec9204d3f0bda6046ccc305aef5.pdf">2022 World Bank report</a> found harassment on public transportation to be a nearly universal experience in big cities, with 88 percent of those surveyed in New Delhi saying they’d experienced it.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Scholars Anil Kumar and Ashutosh Pandey, both professors in the department of sociology at Bayalasi P.G. College, in Jalalpur, India, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374663739_Understanding_Eve_Teasing_An_Insight_into_Sexual_Harassment_of_Women_in_Public_Places">wrote in a recent study</a> that the “prevalent perception of sexual harassment often portrays it as a joke, where women are deemed both responsible for and deserving of such behavior.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite the efforts of Indian feminists, particularly from the 1970s onward, there are still high-profile cases of harassment and violence against women, as well as protests against the police and governments’ handling of the problem.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the case of Phogat and her colleagues, New Delhi police did finally arrest Singh in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/07/sport/indian-wrestler-makes-history-hnk-intl-spt/index.html">June</a> of this year on charges of “sexual harassment, intimidation and outraging the modesty of women,” <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/delhi-court-frames-charges-against-ex-wfi-chief-brij-bhushan-singh-in-sexual-harassment-case/article68199335.ece">according to The Hindu</a>. He has maintained his innocence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That Singh was removed from his post as the head of the WFI and held to account for his alleged crimes is a testament to the women’s protests; in addition to his high profile in the athletic world, Singh was also a powerful member of Parliament with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Phogat’s Olympics are at an end, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/world/olympics/vinesh-phogat-disqualified-wrestling.html">but more and more Indian women are taking up sports</a> —&nbsp;and excelling. And her activism is part of a wider effort in India to <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/37630150/aiff-alex-ambrose-india-football-u17-women-coach-hard-complain-sexual-misconduct">help women athletes speak up about sexual harassment and assault</a>. There’s a lot more to be done in that arena: As sports fans have seen in <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/8/29/23850676/luis-rubiales-jenni-hermoso-spain-womens-world-cup-kiss-aftermath">Spain</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/22585637/gymnastics-tokyo-olympics-2021-abuse-larry-nassar">the US</a>, and elsewhere, the serious consequences of sexual harassment aren’t unique to India.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tim Walz was just over a year into his first term as Minnesota governor when a Minneapolis police officer murdered George Floyd in May 2020, touching off a generation-defining summer of global protests against police brutality and racial inequality.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Four years later, Walz’s handling of the demonstrations — which included mass unrest in Minnesota’s largest cities — is under new scrutiny after Vice President Kamala Harris tapped the governor <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/365437/tim-walz-kamala-harris-vice-president-live-news-updates">to be her running mate</a> on Tuesday.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At least two people died during the violence in Minnesota’s Twin Cities, more than <a href="https://x.com/MnDPS_DPS/status/1267890735564668929">600 arrests</a> were made in the initial days of unrest, and the whole span of rioting and law enforcement response made it one of the most <a href="https://www.startribune.com/twin-cities-rebuilding-begins-with-donations-pressure-on-government/571075592">costly and destructive periods of civil unrest</a> in US history. Minneapolis and Saint Paul sustained hundreds of millions of dollars in damage during those riots, and hundreds of buildings were heavily damaged.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Conservatives have charged Walz with essentially <a href="https://x.com/TrumpWarRoom/status/1820810879484506388">allowing</a> rioters to “burn Minneapolis to the ground” and waffling on the deployment of National Guard troops to quell the violence. But even former President Donald Trump apparently <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/despite-new-criticism-trump-told-walz-2020-happy/story?id=112616502">acknowledged</a> the difficulty of the situation. Per a new audio recording obtained by ABC News, Trump told a call of governors in June 2020 that he “fully agree[d] with the way [Walz] handled it the last couple of days.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Walz wasn’t the main authority in charge of responding to the unrest — that was the task of local officials, including Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. But the task eventually passed to him once it was too much for local officials to handle. Both Walz and Frey’s governments have traded blame and presented their own versions of the events of those days of rage, but the full story of what happened is still not completely known.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What did Walz do during the unrest?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The main line of criticism of Walz’s response to the late-spring riots hinges on the time it took for him to deploy the Minnesota National Guard and coordinate with other state and local officials in restoring order.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Floyd was killed on May 25, and large protests, with some vandalism and police violence, began the next day. By the evening of May 27, largely peaceful protests grew more violent, with looting and arson around the city. Frey, the mayor, <a href="https://www.startribune.com/mayor-frey-gov-walz-hesitated-to-deploy-national-guard-during-minneapolis-riots/571999292">reportedly contacted</a> Walz that evening and asked for help from the Minnesota National Guard. The city’s police chief then sent Walz’s office a <a href="https://www.startribune.com/mayor-frey-gov-walz-hesitated-to-deploy-national-guard-during-minneapolis-riots/571999292">written request for 600 troops</a>, in addition to some other logistical notes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Walz and his office did not sign an executive order authorizing National Guard deployments <a href="https://mn.gov/governor/newsroom/press-releases/?id=1055-433799">until the following afternoon</a>, May 28, at which point much of the city had shut down, businesses were closed and boarded up to prevent looting, and buildings were smoldering after overnight arsons. That night saw some of the worst rioting, violence, and arson, as well as one of the indelible scenes of the protests: the breach and burning of the Minneapolis police’s <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2020/06/30/the-precinct-is-on-fire-what-happened-at-minneapolis-3rd-precinct-and-what-it-means">Third Precinct police station</a>. A few hundred National Guard and Minnesota State Patrol officers had been deployed to Minneapolis by then, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/us/minneapolis-government-george-floyd.html">were charged</a> with protecting federal buildings and downtown areas of the city, as well as escorting first responders, instead of immediately going to hot spots.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Walz would later say that the city had not specified where the troops should go — and state and local officials later <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/31/us/minnesota-george-floyd-protests-state-police-review/index.html">reflected</a> that there was a breakdown in communication, coordination, and understanding of just how long it would take to get National Guard troops prepped.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The next morning, once National Guard troops and the state patrol had taken control of the area around the station, another lasting moment occurred: the arrest of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftLzQefpBvM">CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez and his crew</a> while reporting live near the police station.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At a press conference on May 29, Walz would take responsibility for the state patrol’s mishandling of the news crew, saying, “There is absolutely no reason something like this should happen. Calls were made immediately … I failed you last night in that.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That press conference was also the first time Walz acknowledged that local officials’ response had been an “abject failure” and that he would now be leading the response. He said he had spoken with President Donald Trump and said that his tweets about <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2020/5/29/21274754/racist-history-trump-when-the-looting-starts-the-shooting-starts">“shooting” starting after looting</a> were “unhelpful.” He deployed more National Guard troops and instituted a curfew. Still, more violence and vandalism occurred.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The following day, Saturday, May 30, Walz would fully mobilize the National Guard, speak with Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, and acknowledge that the situation had gotten worse because “outside agitators” had entered the region. The protests and riots wouldn’t be fully tamped down in the Twin Cities until June 7.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The aftermath was both a blame game, and a humbling process</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Throughout the protests, local and state officials sparred with each other over a lack of communication and a misunderstanding of the gravity of the situation. Frey, the mayor, would go on to say Walz had <a href="https://www.startribune.com/mayor-frey-gov-walz-hesitated-to-deploy-national-guard-during-minneapolis-riots/571999292">hesitated</a> to step in and take leadership after Frey asked for help.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Through an extremely difficult situation, I told the truth,” Frey <a href="https://www.startribune.com/mayor-frey-gov-walz-hesitated-to-deploy-national-guard-during-minneapolis-riots/571999292">told the Star Tribune</a> a few months later. “I relayed information as best I could to state partners. And we did what was demanded for the sake of our city.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.startribune.com/mayor-frey-gov-walz-hesitated-to-deploy-national-guard-during-minneapolis-riots/571999292">A Star Tribune investigation</a> found that Frey and his city government had been trying to give Walz and the state Department of Public Safety “what they said they needed to move forward” with deploying the National Guard to Minneapolis’s Third Precinct, where the unrest was concentrated.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Star Tribune examined timestamped email and text logs and <a href="https://www.startribune.com/mayor-frey-gov-walz-hesitated-to-deploy-national-guard-during-minneapolis-riots/571999292">found plenty of correspondence that backed up the city officials’ sequence of events</a>: that they asked for help from the state government repeatedly, provided specifics, and did not get a prompt response. “He did not say yes,” Frey said of Walz. “He said he would consider it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The governor’s office, meanwhile, contested many of the mayor’s assertions. Contrary to the documents reviewed by the Star Tribune, Walz’s team argued Frey did not immediately provide an official request and had not specified where the focus of the National Guard should be. The governor’s office also contended Walz acted quickly once the request was received.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“As a 24-year veteran of the Minnesota National Guard, Governor Walz knows how much planning goes into a successful mission,” a Walz spokesperson told the Star Tribune in 2020. “That’s why he pushed the City of Minneapolis for details and a strategy. He ordered the Minnesota National Guard to start preparing Thursday morning which allowed them to deploy to both St. Paul and Minneapolis that evening, per the Mayors’ requests.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By that point in the riots, state Republicans like then-state Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka had also criticized Walz’s response, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/30/politics/tim-walz-minnesota-george-floyd-killing/index.html">saying</a> it was “a failure of leadership” because “the governor didn’t take the right action.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Republicans are attacking the governor’s response now that he’s on the VP ticket</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the Walz announcement, Republicans have assailed him as “weak, failed, and dangerously liberal,” and zeroed in specifically on his response to the Floyd protests and their aftermath. But at the time, Trump <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/despite-new-criticism-trump-told-walz-2020-happy/story?id=112616502">apparently praised Walz</a>, saying he felt “very happy with the last couple of days … You called up big numbers and the big numbers knocked them out so fast it was like bowling pins.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given that the racial reckoning that the Floyd murder kicked off included the rise to prominence of the “Defund the Police” slogan and movement, some conservatives have also claimed that Walz was being “soft on crime” for <a href="https://mn.gov/governor/newsroom/press-releases/?id=1055-441356">supporting</a> police <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/minnesota-governor-signs-floyd-inspired-police-reform-bill/">reforms</a> in the state that banned chokeholds, created new mental health resources for police and first responders, and required excessive-force trainings. And others in right-wing media have <a href="https://x.com/RNCResearch/status/1820825378547720226">conflated</a> his response to George Floyd’s murder specifically, which he connected to “<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?472637-1/minnesota-governor-walz-news-conference-protests-riots-police-violence">systemic issues</a>” with policing and “<a href="https://x.com/TPostMillennial/status/1820819691599757429">institutional racism</a>,” with Walz offering excuses for the violence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the run-up to his selection as Harris’s potential VP, Walz hasn’t faced too many questions about his response to the 2020 unrest. But he may now face more scrutiny for that time. In response to questions from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/us/tim-walz-george-floyd-criticism.html">the New York Times</a> on Tuesday, a Walz spokesperson acknowledged that the riots were “a tragic time” but said that Walz “took action” to keep the city safe.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Decisions were made in a situation that is what it is,” Walz said of the riots at a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/1a_cmYLXrZw?si=acr05CZSR2njsAR5&amp;t=2001">press conference</a> earlier this month. “And I simply believe that we tried to do the best we can in each of those.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Update, August 7, 5:30 pm: </em></strong><em>This story was originally published on August 6 and has been updated to include news about a new recording of Donald Trump praising Tim Walz’s response to the Minneapolis riots.</em></p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">A single major sports event <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2018/01/31/the-super-bowl-of-recycling-nfl-aims-to-keep-over-40-tons-of-waste-out-of-landfills/">can generate up to 40 tons of trash</a>. That’s the weight of <a href="https://www.arnolditkin.com/blog/truck-accidents/how-much-trucks-weigh/">two loaded charter buses</a> being added to a landfill — and that waste doesn’t even take into account the energy used to power the stadium, or the gasoline-fueled cars so many fans drove to get there.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That&#8217;s why <a href="https://www.climatepledgearena.com/arena-info/">Seattle’s Climate Pledge Arena</a> — the first large-scale live events space <a href="https://www.greenbiz.com/article/how-climate-pledge-arena-track-become-worlds-first-net-zero-carbon-arena">named for a cause, not for a company</a> — is leading the way on a greener alternative with a host of initiatives around energy, waste, transit, and beyond. In fact, Climate Pledge Arena and its resident teams, the Seattle Kraken and the Seattle Storm, are among the signatories of <a href="https://www.theclimatepledge.com/us/en">The Climate Pledge</a>, a coalition of companies that are committed to reaching an ambitious goal: achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. This September marks the fifth anniversary of the Pledge, which was co-founded by Amazon and <a href="https://www.globaloptimism.com/">Global Optimism</a> in 2019. Over 500 signatory companies have signed on since.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As the growing movement to fight climate change focuses around the need for massive, cross-industry collaboration, signatories in the entertainment and sports industries are coming together to address their environmental impact collectively. In the case of Climate Pledge Arena, that means devising innovative solutions to make the future of live events more sustainable.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.oakviewgroup.com/">Oak View Group</a>, which operates Climate Pledge Arena and 400 other venues worldwide is also a signatory of the Pledge. Kristen Fulmer, head of sustainability for Oak View Group, says the arena&#8217;s environmental achievements also have a broader impact: helping inspire other signatories and venues globally. Fulmer also serves as director of GOAL, or Green Operations &amp; Advanced Leadership, Oak View Group’s sustainability working group that pulls together leaders from 40 event spaces in the U.S., U.K., and Canada.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Sustainability doesn&#8217;t just show up in [new] venues,” Fulmer said. “We&#8217;re pushing out goals and minimum standards to all of our venue operations teams, and providing them with support and resources to make sure that they know what sustainability looks like for the Iowa Events Center just as much as it does [for] the Climate Pledge Arena.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/VX24_AmazonxTCP_1345751_BA1_Inline.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,23.821989528796,100,52.356020942408" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Creating a green road map</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Motivating live events spaces around the world to embrace sustainable practices could have an enormous impact. Each year, <a href="https://carbonliteracy.com/what-is-the-carbon-footprint-of-sport/">the global sports industry emits an estimated 350 million tons of carbon dioxide</a>, according to the Carbon Literacy Project, a figure that includes factors like transportation emissions, construction of venues, and the supply chain for merchandise. <a href="https://www.musiciansforsustainability.com/">Concert goers, meanwhile, are responsible for over 116 million pounds of waste in the U.S. alone</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Climate Pledge Arena&#8217;s success story demonstrates some of the tangible actions that Pledge signatories can take, starting with energy. Everything in the arena, from the heat that warms attendees to the machines that resurface the hockey rink ice, runs on electric power. Currently, one percent of that power is provided by on-site solar panels, and the rest comes from other renewable sources, according to Rob Johnson, senior vice president of sustainability and transportation for the Climate Pledge Arena and the Seattle Kraken.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Siemens, a fellow Climate Pledge signatory, has been helping with further energy-reduction methods for the <a href="https://www.climatepledgearena.com/frequently-asked-questions/">18,100-seat arena</a>, “starting with tracking and sub-metering to understand exactly where the building energy systems are using the most power, and what we can really do to reduce those emissions,” Johnson said.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-text-align-left"><blockquote><p>“To see the number of venues … jumping on calls to ask questions about how we&#8217;re doing it has been powerful.”</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And the environmental sustainability initiatives go beyond traditional “green” building operations. The arena also <a href="https://kingcountymetro.blog/2023/01/06/your-ticket-to-climate-pledge-arena-is-your-ticket-to-ride-transit/">offers free local public transit with every ticket</a> to encourage fans to choose options like light rail or the bus over driving to events. Rainwater collected from all those rainy Seattle days is even <a href="https://www.facilitiesnet.com/plumbingrestrooms/article/Sustainable-Water-Management-Climate-Pledge-Arenas-Green-Initiatives--19893">used to make the hockey rink&#8217;s ice</a>, which Johnson said has already saved more than 400,000 gallons of water over the past three seasons.&nbsp;The food program prioritizes local sourcing, with a goal to source 75 percent of ingredients from within a 300-mile radius of the arena.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Plus, its 22,000-ton roof (which was built for the 1962 Seattle World’s Fair and has official historical landmark designation) <a href="https://venuesnow.com/preservation-why-an-iconic-roof-designed-for-the-1962-worlds-fair-tops-the-nhls-newest-arena/">was preserved while the new arena was built under it</a>. That significantly reduced the 41,000 metric tons of carbon emissions associated with construction, according to Johnson.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The arena’s approach is inspiring groups worldwide — from Eastern European hockey clubs to Japanese arena developers — who regularly request more info about its initiatives, Johnson said. “To see the number of venues who … are asking us for tours or jumping on calls to ask questions about how we&#8217;re doing it has been powerful,” he said.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Getting to zero-waste</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of Climate Pledge Arena’s most talked-about recent achievements has been its <a href="https://www.climatepledgearena.com/sustainability/">TRUE Platinum certification</a> for operating as a functionally zero-waste facility. To achieve that, the venue diverts more than 90 percent of its waste from the landfill to recycling and compost.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hitting that zero-waste target took a three-pronged approach, said Brianna Treat, director of sustainability for the arena and the Seattle Kraken. The first step was simplifying procurement, which involved shifting the products for sale. Only products with compostable food contents and recyclable packaging can now be purchased. Single-use plastics have also been eliminated. The Arena achieved this milestone in October 2023, well ahead of the 2024 goal.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>&#8220;Even just small, incremental changes can really help reduce big numbers.”</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, the team overhauled how the cleaning staff does the &#8220;bowl sweep&#8221; to collect trash after events. Instead of having crews collect all items in one bag and then sort them later into separate bags for landfill, recycling, and compost, the cleaners started sorting as they did the bowl sweep. “We saved so much time that we actually went from needing 10 housekeepers to four to six every event just because of that very simple approach to our operations,” Treat said. “The bowl sweep was huge for us, because it saved us money on the back-of-house front, but it also saved us a lot of time on the sorting front. It takes 10 hours to sort through 10 tons of waste.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then, there was fan education. Signs at each disposal station, for instance, show the 30 most-sold items in the stadium and specify where each should be tossed so there’s no guessing. The team has even strapped a camera to a soda bottle to show where it goes after being binned.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Climate Pledge Arena&#8217;s zero-waste performance is well beyond the average landfill diversion rate for GOAL network members (90 percent vs.<a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/62c618095146a156bd25f7c4/t/6632a9fd87073b6135b10f77/1714670102478/GOAL+2024+Impact+Report"> 32 percent</a>). But to Fulmer, it&#8217;s more about appreciating the overall progress. “That&#8217;s over one-third of their waste not going to landfill or being incinerated,” she said. “If we total that up across the number of events that these venues host and then across the whole portfolio, that’s substantial. Even just small, incremental changes can really help reduce big numbers.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This week, Vox’s Future Perfect is publishing <a href="https://www.vox.com/e/364288"><strong>How Factory Farming Ends</strong></a><strong>, </strong>a package of stories on the past and future of the movement against factory farming, its struggle to change our culture, politics, and palates, and how it might yet make real progress.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Billions of animals raised for food are treated abysmally. They are, to name just a few standard industry practices, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/353393/farm-bill-republicans-prop-12-gestation-crates-pork">caged</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/3/9/22967328/animal-cruelty-laws-state-federal-exemptions-pennsylvania-martin-farms-dairy-calves-dehorning">mutilated</a> without pain relief, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/2/10/23589333/cecile-steele-chicken-meat-poultry-eggs-delaware">intensively bred</a> to the point that they live in chronic pain and even struggle to stand up before being <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23647682/factory-farming-dxe-criminal-trial-rescue">slaughtered</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/7/8/21311327/farmers-factory-farms-cafos-animal-rights-booker-warren-khanna">often</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/04/opinion/meat-pork-animal-farm.html">painfully</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Every year, humans kill 80 billion land animals — 10 times more than there are people on Earth — and an even larger, poorly tracked number of fish.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, factory farming is only expanding its global reach, despite decades of animal advocacy striving to stop it, because people want to eat meat, and it’s the cheapest way to produce lots of it for a world of 8 billion. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This package aims to examine the animal movement’s struggle to make progress, build coalitions, find mainstream support, and explore how it can learn from its failures and move forward.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The package features the following stories:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Kenny Torrella </strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/e/362224">investigates</a> why the world’s most powerful environmental groups, including the Nature Conservancy and the World Wildlife Fund, help greenwash the meat industry and are reluctant to take it on as the climate threat that it is. In another piece, Torrella presents a dream policy agenda for expanding plant-based food consumption, advocating for creative solutions such as increased government procurement in public institutions and better access for low-income individuals, treating plant-based foods with the same urgency and support as renewable energy.</li>



<li><strong>Marina Bolotnikova</strong> <a href="https://www.vox.com/e/363550">examines</a> the worsening scale of factory farming and the slow progress made by the movement against it and suggests that the animal welfare movement may need to see itself as an early ethical vanguard helping build a future that people alive today will never see.</li>



<li><strong>Jonathan Safran Foer </strong>and<strong> Aaron Gross </strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/e/362271">argue</a> that the animal welfare movement must expand its focus beyond animal welfare alone and build a grand coalition with the environmental and public health communities that can highlight the threats that factory farming poses to humans, including zoonotic diseases and antibiotic resistance. They highlight a groundbreaking recent study finding that behavioral nudges, such as making plant-based dishes the default option in settings like university dining halls, could significantly reduce meat consumption while maintaining diner satisfaction.</li>



<li><strong>Astra Taylor </strong>and <strong>Sunaura Taylor </strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/e/363069">argue</a> that if progressives are serious about saving our democracy, they must recognize how the meat industry has led the charge to undermine it, including in the recent US Supreme Court case that struck down Chevron deference, a cornerstone of federal regulatory law.</li>



<li><strong>Jan Dutkiewicz </strong>examines PETA&#8217;s paradoxical legacy: Its outlandish tactics have sometimes drawn backlash, but at the same time, the group has played a vital role in forcing a broader conversation about animal rights and supported the cause in less public ways. How does the best-known and most divisive name in animal welfare fit into the modern movement?</li>



<li><strong>Jishnu Guha-Majumdar </strong>argues that despite the vegan movement&#8217;s failure to slow factory farming by changing the diets of the broader public, it remains essential and ought to remain at the heart of the movement&#8217;s goals and strategy. </li>



<li><strong>Noella Williams </strong>explores why the animal movement, despite Black Americans being the fastest-growing vegan demographic, remains predominantly white, highlighting the racial inequality that undermines the movement&#8217;s effectiveness and proposing ways to address it.</li>



<li><strong>Crystal Heath </strong>explores how the meat industry’s political influence has removed consumer choices by flooding the market with subsidized meat and limiting alternatives, such as successfully requiring dairy products be offered in US schools, and proposes a vision for “animal rights 3.0” that involves enlisting veterinarians and other professionals to combat factory farming, rather than relying solely on individual dietary changes.</li>

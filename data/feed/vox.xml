<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>A Vox reader writes: “Why are car dealers so shady? How do consumers avoid them? Is it frustrating for everyone?”</em></p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

<p class="has-text-align-none">Americans have long <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/when-it-comes-to-car-shopping-edmundscom-finds-that-americans-hate-the-haggle-so-much-theyd-give-up-sex-facebook-and-smartphones-to-avoid-it-261647461.html">hated</a> the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/study-americans-feel-taken-advantage-of-at-the-car-dealership-300301866.html">car-buying</a> <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/caredge-study-finds-auto-consumers-105800203.html">experience</a>. It’s not uncommon to spend hours (or even the whole day) at a dealership, finally reaching a deal and still walking away feeling vaguely hoodwinked.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It&#8217;s a process that generally stinks, and it&#8217;s designed that way,” says Tom McParland, founder of <a href="https://automatchconsulting.com/">Automatch Consulting</a>, a service that helps car buyers find the best price on the vehicle they want.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A lot of the distaste comes down to the uncertainty of what you’ll end up paying. In an age when you can buy almost anything online without interacting with another human being, where you can easily shop around for the best deal, cars remain one of the few purchases where your personal negotiation skills — as well as, sometimes, your race, gender, and income — can determine the price.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The newsletter is part of Vox’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/explain-it-to-me">Explain It to Me</a>. Each week, we tackle a question from our audience and deliver a digestible explainer from one of our journalists. Have a question you want us to answer? Ask us <a href="http://www.vox.com/ask-vox">here</a>.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sometimes, the tactics car salespeople use go beyond just the hard sell to the downright deceptive. One common trap is <a href="https://www.theconsumerlawgroup.com/blog/consumers-beware-of-bait-and-switch-tactics-by-car-dealers.cfm">bait and switch</a> prices, where a car is initially advertised as one price (usually achieved by piling on discounts that you may not qualify for). When you run to the dealership to snag the deal, you’re told the vehicle has already been sold but there’s a similar one that’s more expensive. Or take <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/02/07/1155014842/how-car-buyers-can-become-entrapped-in-whats-known-as-a-yo-yo-sale">yo-yo sales</a>, in which you drive your new car home only to be told a few days later that the financing fell through so you’ll have to accept a higher interest rate or make a bigger down payment. A dealer might also try to sneak unneeded <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2024/08/car-dealers-included-add-ons-without-consumers-consent-discriminated-against-black-latino-buyers">add-ons</a> — like extended warranties or protective coatings — onto the total price of the car.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last year, the Federal Trade Commission received more than <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/federal.trade.commission/viz/TheBigViewAllSentinelReports/TopReports">184,000</a> auto-related consumer complaints, making it the third most common category after complaints about credit bureaus, as well as banks and lenders.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While there are some fair dealers, the car marketplace has “a lot of sharp and unethical business practices, and consumers are hurt by it,” says Chuck Bell, programs director of advocacy at Consumer Reports. “By the time that the consumer gets out the door, they feel like they’ve been doing battle.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Why is shopping for cars done this way?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first hint that you’re on unequal footing with a car salesperson comes when they’re cagey about giving a price quote even over the phone, let alone in writing. McParland says that the dealers he calls around to for clients often tell him that he has to come to the dealership for a price. “They’re basically just telling us to go pound sand,” he says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dealers want you to come in because it’s much easier to upsell you that way. You’ve invested some effort into the process, and the salesperson can get a better read on how impatient you are to buy a car, how inexperienced you are with car shopping, and plenty of other factors to wield to their advantage. On the other hand, if they offer you an out-the-door price — which includes all extras and fees — before you ever meet in person, you could easily take the price to a competing dealer and ask if they can do better.&nbsp;While online used car dealers like CarMax and Carvana did make “no haggle” car prices more popular, they often come at a premium, according to McParland. Some traditional car dealers now offer fixed prices too, but it’s probably to your benefit to try to negotiate down.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">How did the system get to be like this?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The general practice of negotiating car prices instead of paying a fixed price may actually stem from <a href="https://priceonomics.com/why-do-we-haggle-for-cars/">horse trading</a>, in which sellers and buyers also haggled and buyers would even trade in their old horse to offset the price of the new one, much as we do with cars today.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The model has endured for so long, though, in part thanks to state franchise laws that ensure these middlemen car dealerships can’t be easily cut out. Most states ban carmakers from selling directly to consumers. Tesla is the rare exception of a car company that sells directly, and it has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2013/12/23/ohio-car-dealers-challenge-teslas-business-model.html">battled</a> with <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tesla-louisiana-car-dealers-federal-court-1dc44a5917731954de18f8455b9bad0b">car dealers</a> for the right to do so. Car dealer trade groups have considerable <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/05/rich-republicans-party-car-dealers-2024-desantis.html">political power</a>, and they’re organized enough and deep-pocketed enough to lobby against reforms that would threaten the status quo, such as changing franchise laws that give them exclusive rights to sell a certain car brand in a particular territory. The National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA), for its part, argues that <a href="https://www.nada.org/nada/issues/franchise-system">franchise laws</a> in fact increase competitiveness and benefit the consumer, all the while creating local jobs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“They’re an enormously powerful lobby,” says Bell.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Just look at how the industry pushed back against enforcement curtailing auto lending discrimination. Car dealers often arrange financing for customers, but they add a mark-up to the interest rate offered by banks because they can pocket that extra money for themselves. How much of a mark-up is applied is at the dealer’s discretion, and unlike mortgage lenders, they’re not required to collect data on the race of their customers, making it much harder to see if they’re complying with fair lending laws. Research shows that car dealers often charge <a href="https://www.nclc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/report-time-to-stop-racing-cars-april2019.pdf">higher interest rates</a> to <a href="https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/profitwise-news-and-views/2023/discrimination-auto-loan-market">people of color</a>. When the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau started cracking down on this practice in 2013, the industry <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/11/23/car-dealers-have-their-way-with-congress/">fought back</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/4/17/17248340/congressional-review-act-auto-loan-discrimination-cfpb">won</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Is there any hope for making the car-buying process better?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, there’s reason to be optimistic about the future of shopping for cars. Late last year, the FTC announced <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/ftc-cars-rule-combating-auto-retail-scams-dealers-guide">new regulation</a> that takes aim at the most rampant deceptive practices used by car dealers. It would, for one, require dealers to disclose the full, out-the-door price of a car, including all add-ons, before a customer visits the dealership. The price and other terms related to purchase of the car also have to be expressed in simple language. Dealers also wouldn’t be allowed to charge customers for useless add-ons. The FTC estimates the rule will <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/12/ftc-announces-cars-rule-fight-scams-vehicle-shopping">save customers $3.4 billion</a> and cut down the time spent shopping for cars by 72 million hours.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rule was supposed to go into effect this summer but was delayed after two car dealer trade groups, including NADA, <a href="https://www.nada.org/nada/nada-headlines/nada-files-federal-court-challenge-stop-ftcs-vehicle-shopping-rule">filed a challenge</a>.<strong> </strong>The association told Vox that the rule would make the car-buying experience worse. “Consumers will have to spend an additional 60-80 minutes at the dealership, complete up to five new, untested forms, and will lose at least $1.3 billion a year in time as a result of this rule,” a spokesperson wrote in an email.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Bell is confident that the rule will ultimately go into effect, and if you’re looking for a car, you should behave as though these protections already apply. McParland advises asking dealers to provide, over email, an “itemized out-the-door price” on the vehicle you’re interested in. If they refuse, “that’s usually a red flag, so move on to somebody else,” he says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">My husband and I have been married for five years. During that time, a battalion of well-meaning relatives — starting with my parents and extending all the way to aunts and uncles — have tried to convince us to have children. Despite these persistent pleas, we aren&#8217;t convinced. The world just feels too chaotic and we’re unsure if we want to subject a child to it. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Increasingly, other American adults are making a similar choice. As of 2018, <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/12/no-kids-no-care-childlessness-among-older-americans.html">16.5 percent of adults 55 and over</a> in the US didn’t have children. According to a Pew Research Center survey released in July, the number of US adults younger than 50 who don’t have children and say <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2024/07/25/the-experiences-of-u-s-adults-who-dont-have-children/">they are unlikely ever to have them</a> rose from 37 percent in 2018 to 47 percent in 2023. The <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2024/07/25/the-experiences-of-u-s-adults-who-dont-have-children/">top reason</a> cited by this group is that they just don’t want to. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Chances are, well-meaning folks (like my parents) have asked child-free adults at some stage: “You may be carefree now, but what happens when you get old?” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Does having no children place us at a disadvantage? The <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2024/07/25/the-experiences-of-u-s-adults-who-dont-have-children/">Pew survey</a> also found that one in four adults aged 50 and older without children frequently worry about who will care for them as they age, and one in three worry about having enough money. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Certainly, children can offer peace of mind, a person to lean on as you face the realities of aging. But the truth is, “even when people have children, those children <a href="https://www.aarp.org/content/dam/aarp/research/surveys_statistics/life-leisure/2023/solo-agers-attitudes-experiences-report-2023.doi.10.26419-2Fres.00602.001.pdf">don&#8217;t always become</a> the safety net that one might think,” says Kate Granigan, chief executive officer of <a href="https://www.lcadvocates.com/">LifeCare Advocates</a> and president of the <a href="http://aginglifecare.org">Aging Life Care</a> Association Board. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Seniors can live flourishing lives without kids, experts say, but they need to be prepared to lean on other people, financially plan for the future, and make use of support services. Presently, the <a href="https://www.aarp.org/content/dam/aarp/research/surveys_statistics/life-leisure/2023/solo-agers-attitudes-experiences-report-2023.doi.10.26419-2Fres.00602.001.pdf">majority of older adults</a> without involved partners or children are not adequately prepared for their future care and end of life, according to the AARP. This needs to change. “Being able to have some foresight … and [knowing] how to prepare in the best way possible can really help people thrive and age well,” says Granigan. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ensure you have people who will watch out for you</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many adult children tend to be the ones who keep an eye on their parents and coordinate necessary help. You want to find people to fill this role, says <a href="https://www.eagenandassociates.com/testimonials">Beth Eagen</a>, a Seattle-based geriatric social worker. Befriend people in the communities you’re in and invest in the relationships in your life, advises <a href="https://www.drstacyreger.com/">Stacy Reger</a>, a geropsychologist in Los Angeles, California.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These people may not be doing all your care, but they can watch your back. “You may have a friend or colleague or someone that you’re close with that is also in your same position … and you can create a group that checks in on each other,” says Granigan. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Not only are these relationships fulfilling, they mean you have someone to call for ad hoc assistance, like a ride back from the supermarket if you have a particularly heavy shop or a lift to the emergency room. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As you form new connections, be open to <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/23961005/intergenerational-friendship-all-ages-friends-older-younger">multi-generational friendships</a>. If everyone in your life is your age and people start getting ill at similar times, it will be harder for them to help when you need it, Eagen explains.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When planning where you will retire, Eagen and Granigan also encourage choosing an area with a “<a href="https://www.vtvnetwork.org/content.aspx?page_id=22&amp;club_id=691012&amp;module_id=238482">village</a>” and signing up for it. Villages are not-for-profit associations around the country that connect seniors with others in the neighborhood to create a community that looks out for one another. If you need a car ride, help with household tasks, or want to participate in social activities, the village will coordinate. Annual membership <a href="https://www.aarp.org/content/dam/aarp/ppi/2022/10/village-model-current-trends-challenges.doi.10.26419-2Fppi.00169.001.pdf">fees can be up to $1,000</a>, but increasing numbers of villages are introducing a “pay as you can” model and subsidizing fees for those who can’t afford it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Get your finances in order to pay for support&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://childfreewealth.com/about">Jay Zigmont</a>, a certified financial planner for child-free adults, advises clients in their mid-40s to purchase long-term care insurance.<strong> </strong>In general, <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/long-term-care/paying-long-term-care">long-term care insurance covers</a> the nonmedical support you may need to perform activities of daily living, like eating, bathing, walking, and taking medication. It pays for <a href="https://www.aarp.org/caregiving/financial-legal/info-2021/understanding-long-term-care-insurance.html?cmp=KNC-DSO-CAREGIVING-Caregiving-LongTermCareInsurance-NonBrand-Exact-45403-GOOG-Long-TermCareInsurance-Exact-NonBrand&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwsJO4BhDoARIsADDv4vAEKYEBdgPPZNV6ICemmInqv9RFnr3-sUR8eV74ZYW7JMTU4sc2CZgaAmOjEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">the costs</a> of at-home caregivers, adult day care, transportation, and senior living arrangements, like <a href="https://www.aaltci.org/news/long-term-care-insurance-association-news/2024-long-term-care-insurance-claims">nursing homes</a> and assisted living facilities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/08b8b7825f7bc12d2c79261fd7641c88/ltss-risks-financing-2022.pdf">More than half of US adults turning 65</a> are expected to require some sort of long-term services and support as they age, and many people are unaware that Medicare, the government health program for seniors, <a href="https://www.aarp.org/caregiving/health/info-2022/medicare-medicaid-long-term-care.html">does not cover</a> these supports. The earlier you buy a long-term care policy, the better the price, and the smaller the likelihood of having a <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/law_aging/publications/bifocal/vol45/vol45issue1/ltc-insurance-qual/">condition that disqualifies</a> you from coverage, Zigmont says. Paying for it upfront is expensive, but the price is locked in, he says. Alternatively, you can pay for it annually. If you miss a payment, the policy gets canceled, and you will not get a comparable policy again.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you don’t purchase insurance, you will likely be paying for long-term care out of pocket, says Zigmont, author of the upcoming book <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/1728297346?ref_=mr_referred_us_au_au"><em>The Childfree Guide to Life and Money</em></a>. Medicaid, a government health program for low-income people, <a href="https://www.aarp.org/caregiving/health/info-2022/medicare-medicaid-long-term-care.html">only covers care</a> once you’ve burned through your assets. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re paying out of pocket, bear in mind that long-term care costs can quickly add up: A private room in a nursing home, for instance, can cost around <a href="https://www.genworth.com/aging-and-you/finances/cost-of-care/cost-of-care-trends-and-insights">$115,000 a year</a> and goes up by about 5 percent every year, says Zigmont.<strong> </strong>Do what you need to do to start saving and investing your money now so that “it grows at least 5 percent per year in order to cover your long-term care costs” plus any impending taxes, says Zigmont.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Get excited about your senior years</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Remind yourself that your senior years can absolutely be fulfilling, says <a href="https://zsfgdgim.ucsf.edu/people/anna-chodos#Publications">Anna Chodos</a>, a geriatrician in the UCSF Department of Medicine. So, start dreaming.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Build a mental image of your future self, advises Chodos and <a href="https://ajaevanscounseling.com/">Aja Evans</a>, a financial therapist in New York City and author of <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/759700/feel-good-finance-by-aja-evans/"><em>Feel-Good Finance</em></a>. “Who and where do you want older you to be? What do you want your lifestyle to be? What&#8217;s really important to older you?” are some of the questions Evans poses to her clients. She finds this practice can make saving money for the future feel more imperative and purposeful.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As you inch closer to your senior years, brainstorm what you enjoy doing that also gives you purpose — “something meaningful that gives you a reason for getting up every day,” says Chodos. Learn an instrument, write stories, volunteer as a museum guide. Add activities that involve meeting people on a regular basis, like a dinner party club, board games night, or walking group, to foster friendships.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Be intentional about where you will retire</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When you’re a senior without kids, you will either live in your own place or in <a href="https://www.aarp.org/caregiving/basics/info-2022/housing-options.html">one of the many types</a> of senior living arrangements. In assisted living or nursing homes, you are often getting most of the support you need for your daily living. When you live in your own place or in an independent-living community, you can engage support services to help with meal prepping, bathing, medication management, <a href="https://www.aarp.org/home-family/your-home/info-2021/aging-in-place-checklist.html">home modifications</a> (if the accommodation allows it), and more, says Eagen. <a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2020/05/ltc_guide.pdf">Long-term care insurance</a> can cover the cost of these services, depending on the policy. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Granigan says it’s essential to find out how accessible these support services are in the area you wish to retire, and their associated costs. To get this information, consult the local <a href="https://eldercare.acl.gov/Public/About/Aging_Network/AAA.aspx">Area Agency on Aging</a> (use this <a href="https://eldercare.acl.gov/Public/Index.aspx">Eldercare Locator</a> database to find one), a local <a href="https://www.aginglifecare.org/">aging life care professional</a>, or local <a href="https://www.vtvnetwork.org/">“villages.”</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Also consider the opportunities for social connections that will be available to you and how easy it will be to participate in fun, meaningful activities. Are these easily accessible on foot if you can no longer drive? What about public transit, supermarkets, banks, gyms, parks, libraries, faith-based communities, malls, senior centers, and eateries?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prioritize your health&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For adults without children heading into their golden years, it&#8217;s especially important to mind your physical and mental health, as well as pay attention to keeping your cognitive abilities sharp, so you can remain independent for as long as possible. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Stay on top of exercising, and do your best to maintain your bone health, balance, muscle mass, strength, and mobility, advises Chodos and Granigan. Control risk factors like diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol, <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alcohol-misuse-or-alcohol-use-disorder/facts-about-aging-and-alcohol#:~:text=Drinking%20too%20much%20alcohol%20over,memory%20loss%2C%20and%20mood%20disorders">watch your alcohol intake</a>, and keep up with medical visits. If you’re otherwise healthy, see your primary care physician annually to screen for chronic conditions once you turn 60, says Chodos. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You might also consider entrusting your medical care to providers who are younger than you, says Reger, as they are more likely to be able to see your care through to the end.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As for exercising the mind, crossword puzzles and Sudoku are all fine and good, but they aren’t the most effective in helping to preserve your brain function, says Reger. Instead, she says to focus on “engag[ing] in activities that keep you interested and thinking … something where you’re still using the parts of your brain that are active in problem solving and thinking creatively.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It&#8217;s really good if whatever you&#8217;re doing involves a social aspect because socializing with other people naturally stimulates our brain,” she emphasizes. “We have to be engaged, processing, and mentally flexible to have even a simple conversation … Speaking to new people, doing outreach, explaining ideas, any of that kind of mental activity is good for our brain.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Hearing loss is a very strong <a href="https://www.audiology.org/consumers-and-patients/hearing-and-balance/dementia-and-hearing-loss/#:~:text=Is%20There%20a%20Link%20Between,et%20al.%2C%202013">risk factor for cognitive decline</a>,” Chodos adds, so any changes to your hearing need to be corrected, stat. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Gather a team to help you navigate the aging journey</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Eagen and Granigan say another option is assembling a team of professionals who can guide you through most of the processes outlined above, from financial management to engaging support services. The team may include an <a href="https://www.naela.org/">elder law attorney</a>, <a href="https://www.aginglifecare.org/">aging life care professional</a>, geriatric social worker, primary care doctor and/or geriatrician, and a financial planner who specializes in the child-free population. These professionals are all experienced at anticipating and steering you away from common pitfalls.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Set up advance directives</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With an elder law attorney, spell out what you envision for your assets, medical care, and end of life in legal documents <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/23911624/elder-care-aging-power-of-attorney-will-estate-planning">like advance directives and a will</a>. As part of this, you will need to nominate people who’ll make decisions on your behalf if you become incapacitated. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Your senior years can and should be an exciting new phase of your life, whether or not you have children. With a little foresight and thoughtful planning, they can be every bit as fulfilling as you’ve always hoped.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Personal finance is hard no matter what stage of life you&#8217;re in. But for Zoomers just entering the workforce, the challenges are also coupled with a lot of uncertainty. And that combination is what brought Carolina to us with her question on this week’s episode of <em>Explain It to Me</em>, Vox’s go-to hotline for all your questions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Carolina is fresh out of college and already stressing about retirement. The older people in her life give her the same advice that generations before her have gotten: start saving immediately, contribute to your 401(k), and don’t touch it for decades until you’re ready to stop working.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s sound advice, but Carolina wonders if it applies to her and the rest of her cohort. She knows the havoc the Great Recession wreaked on everyday people and the economy at-large. “I think people assume the stock market is always safe,” she says. “But then it keeps crashing.” It&#8217;s understandable why someone might be hesitant to put their trust in a financial system that had <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/365271/stocks-dow-nasdaq-recession-us-economy-fed">a scare as recently as this summer</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To answer this question, we enlisted <a href="https://www.yourrichbff.com/about-me">Vivian Tu, AKA Your Rich BFF.</a> Vivian is a former Wall Street daytrader and currently hosts <em>Networth and Chill</em> (<em>Explain It to Me </em>and <em>Networth and Chill</em> are both part of the Vox Media Podcast Network).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Can you enjoy today while preparing for the future? “You&#8217;ve got the folks who say ‘I&#8217;m going to blow all my cash today. I&#8217;m going to go on a shopping spree, because who knows if I get to retire in however many years.’” Tu says. “Then there are folks on the opposite side of the spectrum that say, ‘I need to prepare. I need to only think about retirement…I will have the worst life today so I can have a better future.’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We sat down with Tu to discuss how to plan for the future while enjoying the now, how to protect yourself from financial uncertainty, and how younger generations can adjust to a changing financial landscape.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Below is an excerpt of our conversation, edited for length and clarity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can listen to <em>Explain It to Me</em> on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/explain-it-to-me/id1042433083">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/1vSUO6Bg4abtjRF7fnGpT1">Spotify</a>, or <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/explainit?sid=site">wherever you get podcasts</a>.

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>How should we think about balancing living in the now and preparing for the future?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I ask folks to find the middle of that barbell. You are allowed to enjoy your life today. I promise you, you are not put on this big green earth to work a 9 to 5 to hate your life. That is not your ultimate purpose. You are allowed to have the little treat. You are allowed to take that trip. You are allowed to go and grab a manicure with a friend because it is fun.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You do not want to have so much fun today at the expense of future you. You want to be able to have fun today and tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Practically, what tips do you have for young people who are thinking about retirement?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I always tell everyone, there is a special Your Rich BFF method: you need to STRIP. Everyone says, “Oh, did I pick the wrong career?” No, strip is an acronym.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">S stands for savings. First and foremost you want to set aside an emergency fund. In particular, I recommend putting your emergency fund into a <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/banking/high-yield-online-savings-accounts">high yield savings account</a> so that your money waiting for that rainy day earns interest in the meantime. If you are a singleton, 3 to 6 months of living expenses is a good bet. If you are head of household, you have dependents, I would say closer to 6 to 12.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">T is total debt. A lot of us have debt – that is not a bad word. It is just a tool. What I say is rank it from highest to lowest interest rate. Make the minimum payment across everything to keep your credit score high. But then any additional funds you have for debt paydown goes towards the interest rate that is the highest.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Up next R: retirement. Take advantage of tax-advantaged accounts through your job. You can also open up an IRA or a Roth IRA.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And then I. This is important; it&#8217;s not enough to just open those accounts, you actually have to invest. Take the cash that you&#8217;re putting into those accounts and make investments that make sense based on your risk profile. <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/education/retirement/what-is-a-target-date-fund">Target date retirement funds</a> or <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp">index funds</a> often make sense.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And the last step is so critically important: P – plan.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You don&#8217;t get to have happily ever after, you don&#8217;t get to ride off into the sunset if you do not have a plan. Write down what your goals are, what those milestones are, what you’d like to accomplish, the amount of money it&#8217;s going to take to get you there, and then back into what you need to do to get there.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>How do you protect yourself and those investments from another financial crisis?</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s really important that your portfolio makes sense for how far you are away from retirement.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So when you&#8217;re 20, yeah, you can be 100% or 90% in the stock market and have 0% or 10% in bonds. When you&#8217;re 50, it should look almost flipped.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it really depends on how much you&#8217;re making and how much you already have. Every single person is a little different.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What about people who are just getting by? How should they prioritize retirement savings?</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If they are just getting by, first and foremost we want to try and maximize that income. People always balk when I say this: You need to be asking for a raise somewhere between 10 to 15% every single year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Ooof.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I&#8217;m not saying you&#8217;re getting it&nbsp; But if you ask for 10 to 15 and you get eight, that&#8217;s good, because eight is still going to help keep you above the inflation rate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Retirement and savings in general are often presented as this sacrifice. You&#8217;re going without your fancy groceries now so that future you can go on cruises and golf and do whatever it is that people do when they&#8217;re retired.</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">JQ&#8217;s moving to Naples in her retirement!&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>But how do you find that balance? How do you prioritize those things?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think it&#8217;s about providing yourself with a life that you are happy with today while also thinking, “Hey, it&#8217;s not like saving for retirement means this money goes into a black hole.” You still get to spend it just later.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You&#8217;re not just setting this money aside and then getting that same number back in retirement. When you start investing your money, when it has a little bit of room and time to grow, that money gets to work really hard for you. And so you might put in $100,000. That $100,000 could be a couple million dollars in retirement.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are few more influential right-wing scholars than the economist Friedrich Hayek — and few whose work is <em>less</em> compatible with the right’s ascendant Trumpian strain.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Born in Austria in 1899, Hayek spent his career developing a wide-ranging libertarian social theory. Societies, for Hayek, emerge from the interplay of countless different systems and logics — creating an order so complex that no single entity, not even a government, can fully understand how it all operates. He believed that any attempt to transform such a thing by policy would invariably break part of this system, leading to unintended and often disastrous consequences.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This isn’t a good argument against <em>all</em> government interference in the marketplace (as a shallow read of Hayek might suggest). But it is a powerful insight into how societies work, one that provides an especially clear explanation for why planned economies failed so badly during Hayek’s lifetime.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It also helps us understand why there’s an authentic strain of right-wing resistance to Trump’s “tariffs and deportations” economic agenda —&nbsp;one that attentive liberals could learn from.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hayek’s “spontaneous order” and the case against regulation</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Hayek, there were basically two different types of system or order. The first is an organization, meaning a top-down planned effort where one person or entity lays out the rules for everyone to follow. The second is a “spontaneous order,” a bottom-up system in which the rules are determined over time by enormous numbers of micro-interactions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Take, for example, the ecosystem of the American West. No one person set the rules by which bison, wolves, moose, prairie dogs, and the like breed and interact; in fact, no one dictated that this particular place needed to have those particular species at all. Instead, a system emerged out of thousands of years of interactions between flora and fauna, prey and predator. It has predictable rules and outcomes, but no hand at the tiller.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hayek believed that humanity operated in a similar, but even more complex, fashion.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Our own social order, according to Hayek, reflects centuries of interactions between hundreds of millions of different people and an impossibly diverse set of institutions, ranging from organized religion to different economic sectors to artist collectives. What we call “society” is the spontaneous order that emerges from individuals and organizations interacting and developing oft-unwritten rules that govern those interactions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The structure of human activities constantly adapts itself, and functions through adapting itself, to millions of facts which in their entirety are not known to anybody,” he wrote in <em>Law, Legislation, and Liberty, Volume 1</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Government, Hayek argued, plays a special role in spontaneous order: It “becomes indispensable in order to assure that [social] rules are obeyed.” The state both protects people’s rights to participate in their corner of the spontaneous order and, at times, can even guide the order toward adopting a different (and perhaps better) set of rules.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What the state cannot do well, in Hayek’s eyes, is interfere with discrete and specific interactions inside the spontaneous order.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When the government issues “commands” telling people where and for how much they can sell their goods, for example, it is engaging in an enterprise that bureaucrats and politicians cannot and never will have sufficient knowledge to do adequately. Most economic regulation, for Hayek, is akin to the mass slaughter of wolves in the American West —&nbsp;a shortsighted move with <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/74/7/430/7687410?login=false" data-type="link" data-id="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/74/7/430/7687410?login=false">destabilizing long-term consequences.</a> (Recent efforts to reintroduce wolves have been <a href="https://www.yellowstonepark.com/things-to-do/wildlife/wolf-reintroduction-changes-ecosystem/">an extraordinary success</a>.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The spontaneous order arises from each element balancing all the various factors operating on it and by adjusting all its various actions to each other, a balance which will be destroyed if some of the actions are determined by another agency on the basis of different knowledge and in the service of different ends,” Hayek wrote.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hayek versus Trump</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is very easy to take this pro-market line of thinking too far.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We know that certain elements of the economy, like the money supply, can in fact be effectively managed by governments. Hayek’s skepticism of government could bleed over into paranoia, as with his argument in <em>The Road to Serfdom</em> asserting that social democracy would invariably bleed into authoritarianism. In fact, he even went so far as to endorse Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship in Chile on grounds that <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/friedrich-hayek-dictatorship/">its free-market policies</a> were worth the loss of political liberty.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet Hayek’s argument is essential to understanding why some government projects, like Soviet-style command economies, tend to fail so spectacularly. When an economic policy aims at fundamental transformation, one in which humans are put in charge of managing a vast swath of ordinary economic activity, the potential for the state to exceed the bounds of its knowledge is obvious.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hayek did not believe that this was only a problem for socialists. In <em>The Constitution of Liberty</em>, Hayek argued that conservatives’ emphasis on preserving tradition and the nation inclined them toward dangerous forms of state control over society.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It is this nationalistic bias which frequently provides the bridge from conservatism to collectivism: to think in terms of ‘our’ industry or resource is only a short step away from demanding that these national assets be directed in the national interest,” he wrote.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So despite unquestionably being a man of the right, Hayek rejected the label “conservative” for his politics (he preferred “liberal” on grounds that “libertarian” was too clunky). Conservatives, he argued, were dogmatic and nationalistic — useful allies against the left, but&nbsp;skeptical enough of liberty that they posed their own set of collectivist dangers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Were Hayek still alive, he would see the vindication of his concerns in the person of Donald Trump. The former president’s two most consistent policy proposals — deporting millions of migrants and imposing a 10-percent tariff on all foreign-made goods — are far more aggressive efforts at reshaping America’s spontaneous order than any tax-and-spend proposals offered by the Harris campaign. Each, in its own way, amounts to a fundamental revision of how the American state and economy operate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, there’s a reason that some of the most effective critics of Trump’s <a href="https://www.cato.org/people/scott-lincicome">trade</a> and <a href="https://www.cato.org/people/alex-nowrasteh">immigration</a> policies work for the libertarian Cato Institute. Hayek’s heirs, at least those who take his ideas seriously, understand that Trump represents something anathema to their tradition.</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the course of its last few terms, the Supreme Court has effectively placed itself in charge of the executive branch.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s given itself an <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/23791610/supreme-court-major-questions-doctrine-nebraska-biden-student-loans-gorsuch-barrett">extra-constitutional veto power</a> over virtually any policy decision made by a federal agency. Even when it ultimately rules in favor of President Joe Biden’s policies, it often <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/12/29/23530842/supreme-court-arizona-mayorkas-title-42-mexican-border-immigration">sits on those cases for months</a>, allowing a lower court order to suspend Biden’s programs for as much as a year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, the Court has done extraordinary favors for America’s only recent Republican president. Just look at the Republican justices’ decision to <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship">immunize former President Donald Trump from prosecution</a> for criminal actions he committed while in office.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The president, in other words, is increasingly subordinate to the courts. Yet, as the judiciary seizes more and more power, the battle over who gets to shape it grows increasingly lopsided.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Republicans <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/cook-pvi/2022-partisan-voter-index/republican-electoral-college-advantage">enjoy an advantage in the Electoral College</a>. Just how <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/upshot/trump-electoral-college-harris.html?unlocked_article_code=1.PU4.nFhX.g0QJHoVkVyWg&amp;smid=url-share">much is up for debate</a>, but that advantage does mean that even if the American people hand Vice President Kamala Harris a modest victory in the popular vote this November, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/1/30/20997046/constitution-electoral-college-senate-popular-vote-trump">Donald Trump could still become president</a>. He’d then get to <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/373084/supreme-court-trump-judges-federalist-society">nominate loyal Republican judges</a> eager to implement his party’s agenda from the bench, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/9/20962980/trump-supreme-court-federal-judges">much as he did during his first term</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even if Harris wins by a large enough margin to overcome the Electoral College’s Republican bias, she still may not get to have much of an impact on the judiciary. Her presidency — and specifically her ability to name judges — is likely to be restricted by a Republican Senate. For Democrats to control even a tied 50-50 Senate, one in which Vice President Tim Walz would hold the deciding vote if Harris prevails, they must not just win in every single blue and swing state Senate race this year, but also Senate races in at least two of the red states of Ohio, Florida, Montana, and Texas. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That <em>could</em> happen, but it would require the kind of unusually triumphant Democratic election year that the party hasn’t seen <a href="https://www.270towin.com/2008_Election/">since at least 2008</a> and possibly not since President Bill Clinton’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_United_States_presidential_election">landslide reelection victory in 1996</a>. And that seems <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings">quite unlikely</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A Harris victory could halt America’s slide into a MAGA-dominated future but it is unlikely to give her the power to reshape the judiciary in the way <a href="https://www.vox.com/22233051/biden-courts-republican-trump-supreme-court-judicial-nominations-senate-dick-durbin">Trump was able to during his first term</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Electoral College and Senate malapportionment has completely warped the judiciary&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During the Biden administration, the Republican Supreme Court wielded its power aggressively. It <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/6/24/23181720/supreme-court-dobbs-jackson-womens-health-samuel-alito-roe-wade-abortion-marriage-contraception">greenlit abortion bans</a> in numerous red states. It <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/23616868/supreme-court-affirmative-action-harvard-unc-students-fair-admissions-john-roberts">abolished affirmative action</a> at nearly all universities. It has turned itself into a printing press for <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/6/27/23184848/supreme-court-kennedy-bremerton-school-football-coach-prayer-neil-gorsuch">court orders benefiting the Christian right</a>. It’s given itself <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/357900/supreme-court-loper-bright-raimondo-chevron-power-grab">sweeping veto power over literally anything done by a federal agency</a> that should be controlled by the president. And then there was that whole affair where the Republican justices said that <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/366855/supreme-court-trump-immunity-betrayal-worst-decisions-anticanon">Donald Trump was allowed to commit crimes while he was in office</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Along the way, the Court has pulled <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/6/30/23779903/supreme-court-student-loan-biden-nebraska-john-roberts">new legal rules</a> out of thin air, then used these newly invented rules to nullify many of Biden’s most ambitious programs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the American people had voted for this agenda then it would be difficult to criticize the Republican Party for pushing it. But the electorate did nothing of the sort.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After 2016, Trump was in a position to nominate three Supreme Court justices not because most Americans wanted him to be president but because enough Americans in the right places did. The Electoral College system means each American’s vote is not equal: Hillary Clinton, after all, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/president">won nearly 3 million more votes than Trump in 2016</a>, but still lost the presidency.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump had a Republican Senate willing to put his choices on the bench because Republicans have an enduring advantage in the upper chamber, one that makes it more difficult for Democrats to control the Senate. Each state, regardless of population, gets two senators.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/1/30/20997046/constitution-electoral-college-senate-popular-vote-trump">antidemocratic features of the US Constitution</a> have been with the United States almost from the beginning, but they have an increasingly pronounced effect today, largely because <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/6/22/21293168/dc-statehood-vote-filibuster-supreme-court-joe-biden">the parties have sorted based on population density</a>. People in cities and other densely populated areas tend to vote for Democrats, while outlying areas become more and more Republican as they become less dense.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That means that a system that effectively gives extra representation to the most sparsely populated states will unfairly favor the Republican Party. In 2021, for example, when the Senate split evenly between Democrats and Republicans, the Democratic “half” <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/11/6/21550979/senate-malapportionment-20-million-democrats-republicans-supreme-court">represented nearly 42 million more people</a> than the Republican “half.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though the trend appears to be accelerating, this antidemocratic skew long predates the Trump presidency. Senate malapportionment has been one of the most consequential factors shaping US politics for decades. By some counts, if senators were distributed equally according to how the majority of Americans voted, Democrats would have <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/2/14/22925457/supreme-court-senate-confirmation-ketanji-brown-jackson-leondra-kruger-michelle-childs">controlled the Senate in every single year since the late 1990s</a>.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/image_392068.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,12.602842183994,100,74.794315632012" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="Stephen Wolf/Daily Kos Elections" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">In that world, Democrats not only may have enacted more significant legislation, they would also almost certainly control the courts. Obama would have confirmed a justice to fill the vacancy created when Justice Antonin Scalia died in Obama’s last year in office, and none of Trump’s nominees would have likely been confirmed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similarly, while Republicans probably would have still filled some Supreme Court seats during the 1990s and 2000s, it’s unlikely that they would have successfully confirmed an <a href="https://archive.thinkprogress.org/clarence-thomas-most-important-legal-thinker-in-america-c12af3d08c98/">ideologue like Justice Clarence Thomas</a> or an <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/350339/samuel-alito-republican-party-scotus">unapologetic GOP partisan like Justice Samuel Alito</a> if Senate seats were distributed fairly by population. In a fair Senate, Republican presidents would have to negotiate with Democrats to choose moderate nominees in the vein of, say, Justices Lewis Powell and Sandra Day O’Connor.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That is to say, the impact of recent population sorting is felt acutely in the courts. In all of US history, only three justices were nominated by a president who lost the popular vote and confirmed by a bloc of senators who represent less than half of the nation’s populace. <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/10/26/21534358/supreme-court-amy-coney-barrett-constitution-anti-democratic-electoral-college-senate">All three of them currently sit on the Supreme Court</a>; they are Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett, Trump’s three appointees to the Court.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What a broken Senate means for a potential Harris administration&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the event that Harris wins the presidency but Republicans capture the Senate, we only need to turn the clock back less than a decade to predict what is likely to happen.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Obama’s final two years in office were the only two when Republicans controlled the Senate. And shortly after Scalia’s death in February 2016, Senate Republicans announced that they would confirm no one Obama nominated to fill that seat. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“<a href="https://www.vox.com/21448904/senate-republicans-supreme-court-vacancy-election-ruth-bader-ginsburg">This vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president</a>,” then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced at the time. (Four years later, when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death allowed Trump to fill a vacancy in the final months of his presidency, Republicans abandoned the position they adopted in 2016 and swiftly confirmed Trump’s nominee.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The GOP’s blockade on Supreme Court confirmations should have surprised no one who watched the Senate closely because Senate Republicans had already imposed a near-total halt on all confirmations to federal appellate courts, powerful bodies that hand down precedential decisions that determine what the law is in multiple states at a time. In Obama’s last two years in office, he <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/9/20962980/trump-supreme-court-federal-judges">successfully appointed only two judges to the appellate bench</a>, and one of these judges was confirmed to a highly specialized, relatively nonpolitical court that primarily deals with patent law.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By contrast, President George W. Bush confirmed 10 appellate judges during his last two terms in office, during a period when Democrats controlled the Senate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similarly, during Obama’s last two years in office, he appointed only 18 judges to federal district courts, the lowest rank of federal judge who enjoys a lifetime appointment. That compares to 58 judges during Bush’s final two years in office, according to <a href="https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/search/advanced-search">data from the Federal Judicial Center</a>. In Trump’s final two years in office, when Republicans controlled both the White House and the Senate, an astonishing 121 district judges were confirmed, including some infamously partisan judges like <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/6/13/23757893/aileen-cannon-donald-trump-jack-smith-indictment-mar-a-lago-maga">Aileen Cannon</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/12/17/23512766/supreme-court-matthew-kacsmaryk-judge-trump-abortion-immigration-birth-control">Matthew Kacsmaryk</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President Biden, for what it’s worth, has confirmed more than 200 judges thanks to Democrats&#8217; narrow majority in the Senate, including a total of 116 since the current Congress took office. Over his entire presidency, he’s filled 44 appellate seats.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Without the power to confirm judges, Harris will have no way to dilute the influence of judges like Cannon or Kacsmaryk, and Republicans could easily refuse to confirm anyone to any judicial vacancy that comes open until the GOP regains the White House. Alternatively, Harris may be able to strike deals with Republicans to confirm a few of her preferred judges, but the GOP has a history of demanding a very high price to confirm even a single Democratic judge. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2014, for example, thanks in part to a now-weakened Senate process that allowed senators to veto anyone nominated to a federal judgeship in their state, Georgia’s Republican senators convinced Obama to <a href="https://archive.findlaw.com/blog/rumored-bipartisan-deal-for-11th-cir-seats-just-went-through/">nominate four Republican judicial choices</a> — including a Republican appellate judge — in return for confirming only two Democrats. One of the Republican nominees was eventually dropped because his <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/228303-obama-drops-controversial-nominee-opposed-by-black-caucus/">views on abortion, marriage equality, and the Confederate Flag offended Democrats</a>, but Republicans still walked away with more confirmed judges than Obama did. Harris could very well find herself in a similar situation. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The problems for Harris likely wouldn’t stop there. Because Republicans continue to dominate the judiciary, Harris would likely spend her presidency watching her policies get <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/23791610/supreme-court-major-questions-doctrine-nebraska-biden-student-loans-gorsuch-barrett">struck down on dubious legal theories</a> invented by GOP judges, much as the Supreme Court struck down President Biden’s student loan forgiveness policy despite the fact that it was <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/6/30/23779903/supreme-court-student-loan-biden-nebraska-john-roberts">unambiguously authorized by an act of Congress</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Democrats are starting to awaken to the threat of a Republican judiciary, but they haven’t yet found a solution to their constitutional problem</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Absent constitutional reform, Democrats have good reason to fear a Republican judiciary for decades to come. A malapportioned Senate means that Democrats are increasingly defenseless against the GOP’s efforts to control the bench. In recent years, however, Democrats have become more aware of a GOP judiciary’s power to thwart their agenda and have started to try to explore ways around it. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Historically, elected Republicans have viewed the courts as a favorable issue that rallies their base, while Democrats have behaved much more cautiously. Many Republicans credit Trump’s decision to delegate judicial selection to the Federalist Society, a bar association for right-wing lawyers, and to <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/373084/supreme-court-trump-judges-federalist-society">release a list of potential Supreme Court nominees during his 2016 candidacy</a>, for giving him enough support to prevail in that year’s election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden, by contrast, began his presidency very reluctant to take on the courts. After many Democrats called for Supreme Court reform in the wake of the Senate’s disparate treatment of the Scalia and Ginsburg vacancies, Biden tried to take the wind out of the sails of reform by promising to appoint a commission to study the issue — and then filling the commission with Republicans and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/4/10/22375792/supreme-court-biden-commission-reform-court-packing-federalist-society">scholars who historically have not supported reform</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But, as <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/supreme-court/">the Supreme Court’s polling numbers collapsed</a> and as the Court <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship">outraged elected Democrats with opinions like its <em>Trump</em> immunity decision</a>, Democrats have grown more aggressive. Biden <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/363557/supreme-court-biden-kamala-harris-reform-term-limits-ethics">proposed term-limiting the justices and imposing a binding ethics code on the Court</a>, proposals also supported by Harris. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has a bill that would <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/364438/supreme-court-chuck-schumer-trump-immunity">strip the Court of jurisdiction to enforce its immunity decision</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the most <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/judicial_modernization_and_transparency_act_one-pager.pdf">ambitious recent Supreme Court reform proposals</a>, from Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), includes a number of very aggressive reforms. Wyden’s proposal would make every justice submit to a tax audit each year, require a two-thirds supermajority for the Court to overrule an act of Congress, and gradually expand the size of the Court to 15 seats.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet, while these proposals show that Democrats are moving in a more court-skeptical direction than they were four years ago, they would not solve the structural problems with US democracy that gave us the courts we have today. And they have virtually no chance of passing, especially in a world where it is increasingly difficult for Democrats to win the Senate even when they convincingly win the national popular vote.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Realistically, turning the United States into a nation where every vote counts equally — and where each voter is actually able to shape the judiciary —&nbsp;would require rewriting its Constitution. Until that happens, Democrats like Harris will struggle to win elections even when most Americans support them. And Democratic presidents will increasingly be at the mercy of Republicans in both the Senate and the courts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/cities-and-urbanism">Cities</a> represent the future of humanity — and that means we must figure out how to make them more livable. The share of people who live in urbanized areas <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/urbanization#:~:text=By%201800%2C%20still%2C%20over%2090,people%20lived%20in%20urban%20areas.">more than doubled</a> in the US and across the world from 1900 to 2000. More than eight in 10 Americans live in cities today, as do the majority of people worldwide. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These densely populated places have created tremendous opportunities for innovation, economic growth, more efficient infrastructure and transit, and the curation of arts and culture. But the density that gives cities their power also creates new challenges: Cities have struggled to build enough <a href="https://www.vox.com/housing">housing</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22937366/air-polluted-city-smog-india-china-beijing">pollution</a> abounds, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/22347029/covid-19-pandemic-sunset-park-new-york">diseases</a> can spread more quickly. Cities must also manage the massive amounts of traffic — automobile, train, bike, and pedestrian — that can <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23496462/crisis-american-roads-pedestrian-traffic-deaths-safety">clash and result in deadly accidents.</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The world’s cities are constantly experimenting and generating new ideas about how to solve those problems. The difficulty for policymakers has long been: <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/elements/abs/why-bad-policies-spread-and-good-ones-dont/401F57B534423A2D3889674F5FC1CC8E">How do we get good ideas to spread?</a> Municipal leaders sometimes labor under the mistaken belief that they have nothing to learn from their peers a few miles away or across the globe. How can we encourage more cross-pollination? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Billionaire Michael Bloomberg, former mayor of New York City, has launched <a href="https://www.bloomberg.org/press/bloomberg-philanthropies-launches-the-bloomberg-cities-idea-exchange-to-accelerate-the-spread-of-successful-civic-innovation-between-cities-across-the-globe/">a $50 million global idea-sharing project</a> to facilitate the migration of effective urban policies to allow cities around the world to address their biggest issues.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s called the Bloomberg Cities Idea Exchange, a curated marketplace of policy ideas for municipal leaders with hands-on support to help cities implement them. On Tuesday, the project announced the first set of policies that would be added to the exchange, selected by its staff based on <a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/report/nesta-standards-of-evidence/">assessments of their effectiveness</a>, their cost and complexity, and the perceived interest among city leaders.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While <a href="https://www.ahrq.gov/innovations/index.html">ideas exchanges</a> are <a href="https://leitner.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/resources/docs/2003-03.pdf">not a new concept</a> among <a href="https://stateinnovation.org/">policymakers</a>, they risk functioning as little more than passive warehouses, where ideas are placed on a shelf and may never be picked up again <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781119316916.ch16">if they cannot be easily adapted to a new setting</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Bloomberg group believes that by including only proven interventions and providing technical support for implementation, their policy-sharing network can thrive. The new exchange will provide grants to support implementation, offer how-to guides from the officials who have already put these policies into place and technical advice from Bloomberg staff, and pay for city leaders to visit other jurisdictions and see the policies in action.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The idea is “to take all of the lessons that have been learned from many experiments all over the globe,” said James Anderson, head of government innovation at Bloomberg Philanthropies. “To create an infrastructure that frankly does not exist in the world that takes good ideas, but marries them with the critical supports necessary to get them into the hands of people who want them when they want them and to help them stand them up so that they survive.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>11 proven policies that could help cities</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Urban development has long been one of Bloomberg’s top philanthropic priorities, the target of hundreds of millions of dollars in giving since 2011. He has supported <a href="https://cityleadership.harvard.edu/">a city leadership program at Harvard</a> and various initiatives focused on <a href="https://www.bloomberg.org/government-innovation/spurring-innovation-in-cities/mayors-challenge/">US mayors</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.org/environment/supporting-sustainable-cities/bloomberg-american-sustainable-cities/">US cities</a>, and <a href="https://www.globalcities.org/">cities around the world</a>. He has paid particular attention to efforts to <a href="https://www.beyondcarbon.org/">better adapt cities to climate change</a> and to support <a href="https://publicartchallenge.bloomberg.org/">public art projects</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s a natural fit for the former New York mayor, who has a deep interest and expertise in the challenges cities face. While in office, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/30/nyregion/30mayor.html">traveled to Paris</a> and decided to test out a bike share in New York like the one he saw there; he turned to Bogotá for inspiration on <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2008/03/25/nyc-to-launch-bus-rapid-transit-in-the-bronx">bus rapid transit</a>, jumpstarting <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2024/09/18/mta-capital-plan-interborough-express/">a new era of public transit improvements</a> that continued beyond his term.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bloomberg Philanthropies is stocking the ideas exchange with 11 policy interventions to start, covering the breadth of issues that city leaders contend with, from transportation to air quality to public corruption to infectious diseases:</p>

<ul>
<li>Installing low-cost air quality sensors in schools and children’s health centers</li>



<li>Renovating public buildings to be more energy-efficient</li>



<li>Supplying school lunches with sustainably grown produce and meat</li>



<li>Digitizing the process for business licenses and other permits to reduce corruption</li>



<li>Providing cold storage units for local merchants who sell produce</li>



<li>Offering more summer education programs for kids</li>



<li>Connecting people in need with neighbors who can help them access aid</li>



<li>Adopting smoking bans and other smoke-free policies in public places</li>



<li>Converting shipping containers into temporary shelter for unhoused people</li>



<li>Piloting reduced speed limits to prevent car crashes</li>



<li>Incorporating people who informally pick up trash into the public workforce</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of these ideas aren’t particularly novel — NYC’s first smoking ban was instituted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/27/nyregion/new-york-state-adopts-strict-ban-on-workplace-smoking.html">while Bloomberg was mayor in 2003</a> — but the policies themselves aren’t really the selling point of the exchange.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead, the potential value is the knowledge that city officials have accumulated in trying to implement policy solutions and the ability to share those experiences with others who want to try them out. That is where the need truly lies, Yonah Freemark, principal research associate at the Metropolitan Housing and Communities Policy Center at the Urban Institute, told me. He described attending a meeting that brought together leaders from seven neighboring jurisdictions in Minnesota; before that day, the officials said, they had never met collectively before.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“My experience is that every city and the staff who work for that city think that their city is the most unique place in the world,” Freemark said. “That there is nothing they can fundamentally learn from other cities because their specific problems are problems unto themselves.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Bloomberg project hopes to break down those silos. Freemark gave the example of low-cost air quality sensors in schools and other areas frequented by children. That policy has <a href="https://breathelife2030.org/news/lima-builds-ambitious-air-quality-monitoring-system/">already been implemented in Lima, Peru</a>, and has shown <a href="https://www.c40.org/case-studies/c40-bloomberg-awards-lima/">a 45-percent improvement in air quality</a>, providing the empirical foundation for its inclusion in Bloomberg’s exchange.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the real opportunity, Freemark said, would be officials from Lima sharing with their peers in other countries how they found the manufacturer of the low-cost sensors, giving other cities the actionable information that officials are often looking for when they want to adapt policies to their own communities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“People in other cities may care about air pollution, but they don&#8217;t know who to contact about that. They don&#8217;t know who [Lima] got in touch with,” he said. “That person in Lima is going to tell them who their contact was at Microsoft or whatever company gave them the air sensor and is going to help to make that connection. That would never happen without this kind of direct communication.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Josh Humphries, Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens&#8217;s top housing adviser, who has consulted with multiple cities on <a href="https://atlanta.urbanize.city/post/downtown-homeless-housing-melody-initiative-opens-today">building homes</a> for the unhoused, told me that the package offered by the Bloomberg exchange “probably solves 80 to 90 percent of the questions that we might get talking one-on-one with 25 different cities.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Bloomberg team has tried to anticipate the problems that could hamper such a project, studying the science of implementation and idea replication “to learn about why ideas do and don&#8217;t spread,” Anderson said. Every city must navigate its own administrative labyrinth of funding, procurement, rulemaking, and public comment, creating friction for getting any new idea off the ground. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many ideas clearinghouses, Anderson said, are primarily focused on supplying the policy ideas. The Bloomberg project is equally focused on the demand side, on generating interest in policy ideas among the people who would actually implement them and then providing support for their efforts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The cities of the future face daunting challenges, from the planetary (climate change) to the painfully human (political polarization and corruption). We won’t know whether the Bloomberg exchange was a well-intentioned flop or a catalyst for real change until its own evaluation comes in — and that could be many years into the future, given the slow pace of urban policy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We want to make sure every city that wants one of these ideas and wants to use it well, that we can support them and give them the dedicated resources and support that we think is so fundamental to successful idea replication,” Anderson told me. “We are going to be watching closely and figuring out how we meet the demand that exists.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Voters in 10 states will weigh in on abortion-rights ballot measures this November, but only Nebraskans will cast ballots on two competing initiatives. <a href="https://voterguide.flatwaterfreepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Protect-the-Right-to-Abortion-Constitutional-Amendment-no-contact.pdf">Initiative 439</a> would establish a state constitutional right to abortion up to fetal viability or when necessary to protect the “health or life” of the pregnant patient. <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Nebraska_Initiative_434,_Prohibit_Abortions_After_the_First_Trimester_Amendment_(2024)">Initiative 434</a>, however, would ban abortion in the second and third trimesters, with exceptions for sexual assault, incest, or medical emergencies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We hear all the time how confusing the two measures are and folks are very afraid of accidentally checking the wrong one,” said Shelley Mann, the executive director of Nebraska Abortion Resources (NEAR), the only statewide abortion fund in Nebraska.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Much of the confusion surrounding the competing proposals is intentional, and likely a preview of new tactics in the evolving anti-abortion playbook. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since May 2023, abortion in Nebraska has been banned past the first trimester, and last fall reproductive choice advocates launched a ballot measure campaign to restore and expand access. Anti-abortion leaders introduced a competing measure <a href="https://nebraskapublicmedia.org/en/news/news-articles/new-abortion-petition-looks-to-enshrine-bans-in-nebraska-constitution/">four months later</a>. (The proposed anti-abortion ballot measure wouldn’t expand current restrictions, but it would embed existing second- and third-trimester bans into Nebraska’s state constitution. This would make it significantly more difficult for the legislature or courts to roll back those restrictions later.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While collecting signatures, some canvassers from the Protect Women and Children campaign misrepresented themselves as being in favor of expanding abortion access, leading hundreds of Nebraskans to erroneously sign their petition. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Upon realizing their mistake, more than 300 of those voters signed affidavits to have their names removed from the anti-abortion petition, marking the highest number of removal requests in the state&#8217;s history. (Over <a href="https://nebraskafamilyalliance.org/breaking-over-205k-signatures-collected-to-protect-women-children/">205,000</a> people signed the anti-abortion petition in total.) </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More recently, Catherine Brooks — a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Sp7WLVTt0">neonatal pediatrician</a> who <a href="https://www.ketv.com/article/nebraska-neonatologist-files-amendments-over-abortion-initiative/62020812">filed legal objections</a> to block the pro-abortion rights measure from appearing on Nebraska’s ballot — appeared in <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/4xp2bbsgyro9hxedzb6zp/PWCNE01H.mpg?rlkey=js63t4w45tdzj48ezdtclu0hj&amp;st=gowuymbk&amp;dl=0">a TV ad</a> in which she portrayed herself as an advocate for reproductive freedom fighting against government intrusion in medicine. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“As a doctor, I want compassionate, clear, scientific standards of care,” Brooks said in the ad. “As a mom, I want to keep the government out of the relationship between a woman and her physician. Initiative 439 pretends to protect our rights but it does the opposite. It lets government officials interfere in medical decisions and takes care out of the hands of licensed physicians, when women in crisis need them most.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s little doubt that Republicans in Nebraska hope to restrict abortion beyond the existing <a href="https://governor.nebraska.gov/press/governor-pillen-signs-lb574-law-abortion-ban-takes-effect-immediately">12-week ban, which was</a> passed shortly after lawmakers <a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-heartbeat-bill-nebraska-78b861951e8cc0ca92fa320820e2cbee">narrowly failed</a> to impose a six-week limit. Nebraska’s Republican Gov. Jim Pillen <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2023/06/29/nebraska-gov-jim-pillen-says-he-wont-stop-on-abortion-seeks-total-ban/">has publicly pledged</a> to continue fighting until abortion is fully banned in his state.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The outcome of these dueling ballot proposals could affect not just those in Nebraska but pregnant people nationwide. Abortion rights activists have been sounding the alarm, warning that if Initiative 434 succeeds in November, anti-abortion leaders will export their winning strategy elsewhere — using the language of reproductive freedom to advance seemingly moderate measures that obscure long-term goals of deeper bans.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Nebraska’s 12-week abortion ban is already causing harm</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The 12-week abortion ban Nebraska lawmakers passed in May 2023 included exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest, or to save the life of the mother.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As in other states, these exceptions have proved ambiguous for doctors on the ground, and many patients who need abortion care have been unable to get it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kim Paseka, a 34-year-old woman based in Lincoln, Nebraska, was one of those patients. Paseka lives with her husband and their 3-year-old son, and though they wanted at least two children, they were unsure about pursuing that in Nebraska after <em>Roe </em>was overturned.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We knew it was probably inevitable that our state government was going to work on banning reproductive health care in some capacity and it definitely gave us pause, like should we move, do we stay and fight? Those were our dinner table conversations,” she told Vox. In the summer of 2023, just after Nebraska lawmakers passed their 12-week ban, Paseka learned she was pregnant again.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Initial blood tests looked fine, but following a routine ultrasound, Paseka was informed that her baby’s heartbeat was slower than expected. In subsequent appointments, the doctors determined the heartbeat was diminishing and that Paseka was carrying a nonviable pregnancy. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because of the new ban and the fact that Paseka’s life was not immediately threatened, her doctors weren’t comfortable ending the pregnancy. They sent her home with instructions for “<a href="https://www.tommys.org/baby-loss-support/miscarriage-information-and-support/your-options-and-decisions/expectant-management">expectant management</a>” — meaning to wait until she’d bleed out eventually with a miscarriage. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I had to go back to the hospital for three more scans, where I had to see the heartbeat weaken further week by week, and during this whole time I’m so nauseous, I’m tired, I’m experiencing all the regular pregnancy symptoms, but I was carrying a nonviable pregnancy,” she said. It took roughly a month for Paseka to finally bleed out the pregnancy at home.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“In Nebraska, we have these exceptions, but in my situation it wasn’t assault, it wasn’t incest, and my life wasn’t in immediate danger, so I automatically just lose health care,” she said. “They’re forgetting how detrimental that can be to mental health, that it’s not just about physical endangerment. &#8230; I felt like a walking coffin.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mann, the executive director of Nebraska’s statewide abortion fund, emphasized that the 12-week ban has had far-reaching consequences that most people underestimate. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Not only are folks now restricted in how and when they can get the care they need, but it&#8217;s additionally problematic that these rules are designed to be confusing and were brought about during a time when confusion was at an all-time high,” she told Vox. “We talk to callers and members of the community all the time who have no idea when and if abortion is even legal here in Nebraska.”<br><br>There are two remaining abortion clinics in the state, though both only perform abortions part-time, meaning there sometimes are not enough appointments to go around, including for patients traveling in from states with near-total bans like Iowa and South Dakota.<br><br>“This means that not only are patients who are past the 12-week mark forced to flee the state for care, but even patients under that ban restriction are sometimes having to travel just to get an appointment in a timely manner,” Mann explained. “These patients are going to places like Minneapolis, Chicago, and Denver … this travel is often expensive, inconvenient, and overall an enormous burden on pregnant people.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Anti-abortion leaders plan to push for further restrictions in Nebraska</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Initiative 434, also known as the Prohibit Abortions After the First Trimester Amendment, sounds almost like a measure to protect abortion access in the first 12 weeks of a pregnancy. The proposal, which is being <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/briefs/sen-pete-ricketts-funds-competing-abortion-ban-petition-effort/">primarily funded</a> by Nebraska <a href="https://www.ricketts.senate.gov/news/press-releases/ricketts-announces-co-sponsorships-of-three-pro-life-bills-following-nebraska-march-for-life/">billionaire and US Sen</a>. Pete Ricketts, does not in fact do that.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On top of codifying the state’s existing ban on abortion past 12 weeks into Nebraska’s constitution, the measure allows lawmakers to pass further legislative bans on top. Put differently, it strengthens abortion bans but provides no meaningful increase in abortion access.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Marion Miner, the associate director for “pro-life and family policy” at the Nebraska Catholic Conference, emphasized in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHpHjqyEPcQ">video posted over the summer</a> that he does not see Initiative 434 as “an acceptable final resolution” because it does “not protect all unborn children” including those born from sexual assault or incest.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It is an imperfect proposal … an incremental pro-life initiative that takes a small step to protect unborn life without restraining us from doing more,” Miner said, stressing Initiative 434 would “allow for additional protections to be passed in the future.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over a century ago, Nebraska lawmakers enacted a law stating that if two conflicting state constitutional ballot measures pass, the measure with the most votes will be adopted. According to Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen, if both Initiative 439 and Initiative 434 pass, it would mark the first time this 1912 law could be used.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s possible that one of the proposals could get approved and not be adopted,” Evnen <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/27/nx-s1-4977662/nebraska-abortion-ballot-voters-viability-12-week-ban">told NPR in May</a>. “It’ll come down to, whichever one receives the most votes is the one that would go into Nebraska’s constitution.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even the existing 12-week ban, often described by conservatives as <a href="https://www.vox.com/23741997/republicans-12-week-abortion-bans-europe-roe-dobbs">a moderate compromise</a>, appears out of step with what Nebraskans want. The ACLU of Nebraska <a href="https://www.aclunebraska.org/en/press-releases/new-poll-shows-most-nebraskans-oppose-more-abortion-bans">found in late 2022</a> that 59 percent of respondents opposed lawmakers enacting abortion bans, with opposition in both rural and urban areas and every congressional district.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the more than two years since the Supreme Court overturned <em>Roe v. Wade, </em>abortion rights ballot measures <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/11/8/23952090/ohio-election-results-issue-1-abortion-virginia-kentucky-roe-dobbs">have succeeded</a> in all seven states in which they’ve appeared, including red and purple states like Kentucky, Ohio, Kansas, Michigan, and Montana. This year, high-profile abortion rights measures are on the ballot in states like Florida, Arizona, and Missouri. Nebraska’s contests, relative to these other states, have received less attention. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“They know public opinion is on our side so they’re doing everything they can to muddy the waters,” said Allie Berry, the manager for the Protect Our Rights campaign, which is leading Nebraska’s ballot measure to expand abortion rights. While Berry feels cautiously optimistic, she understands her opponents are striving to trip up voters. “If they succeed here,” Berry predicts, “they’ll try this in every other state.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’ve always believed that the world is complicated and that our desire for simplicity is understandable but dangerous.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But when does the impulse to embrace ambiguity become its own pathology? Sure, the world is complex, but sometimes we have to pass judgment. We have to be willing to say that something is true and something is false, that something is right and something is wrong.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So how do we know when things really are that clear? And how do we avoid the impulse to lie to ourselves when we know they’re not?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ta-Nehisi Coates is an author, essayist, and one of our most celebrated living writers. He’s just published a new book called <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/653438/the-message-by-ta-nehisi-coates/"><em>The Message</em></a> that has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/07/media/cbs-ta-nehisi-coates-tony-dokoupil-interview/index.html">stirred up quite a bit of controversy</a> because the longest essay in it is about his trip to Palestine.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you know almost nothing about the conflict between Israel and Palestine, the one thing you’d probably be comfortable saying is that it’s complicated. This is an assertion Coates challenges directly. For him, the moral arithmetic is simple and Israel&#8217;s treatment of the Palestinian population is fundamentally wrong.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So I invited Coates on <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> to explore where he’s coming from and why he felt it was important to write this book. But the point wasn’t to have a debate or an argument. I invited Coates because I think he’s smart and sincere and doesn’t write anything without seriously thinking about it. This conversation is really about the role of the writer and the intellectual and what it means to describe the world with moral clarity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As always, there’s <em>much</em> more in the full podcast, so listen and follow <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/id1081584611">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6NOJ6IkTb2GWMj1RpmtnxP">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://www.pandora.com/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/PC:30793?source=stitcher-sunset">Pandora</a>, or wherever you find podcasts.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What&#8217;s been the most surprising thing to you about the reaction to this book so far?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I&#8217;m surprised at the surprise. So, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/07/media/cbs-ta-nehisi-coates-tony-dokoupil-interview/index.html">the CBS interview</a> was the first live interview. I was not surprised by the aggression, tenacity, whatever you want to call it. Or, I should say, I knew that was going to happen eventually. I didn&#8217;t know it was going to happen there. So I was surprised in the sense that, “Oh, it&#8217;s right now.” And it took me a minute to catch up with it and realize that it’s actually happening right now, but this is what it is.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I&#8217;m surprised that people are like, “I can&#8217;t believe that happened.” I understand I am going to go into some arenas where you don&#8217;t usually say the state of Israel is practicing apartheid. That&#8217;s just not a thing that you usually hear people saying in places like that, and so I am going to say that. And what&#8217;s going to come out of that, I have no idea, but I hope people understand that this is what&#8217;s happening.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You made a deliberate choice to write about Palestine, which, as you know, is an impossibly charged issue. Why wade into these waters? Why this conflict? Why now?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s impossibly charged. This is so clear. It was so clear. And when I saw that — and maybe this is naive, maybe you&#8217;re right, maybe it is impossibly charged — but I was just like, &#8220;Oh, this is easy.&#8221; Not easy like easy to do, easy to write, but the math is clear. You know what I mean?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The word I used at the time when I saw it was Jim Crow, because it was so obviously Jim Crow. You tell me you got one set of roads for one group of people, another set of roads for another group of people, and the roads you have for the other group of people are impossibly longer. They take more to get from point A to point B. Those roads have checkpoints, and the checkpoints sometimes materialize out of nowhere. This is all fact.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whatever you think about it, maybe you think that&#8217;s the way it should be, but this is what it is. This is actually what it is. You&#8217;re telling me that one group of people has constant access to running water, and the other group of people don&#8217;t know when their water might be cut off?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You&#8217;re telling me that that other group of people, depending on where they live, if they&#8217;re in a particular area on the West Bank, it might be illegal for them even to collect rainwater? You&#8217;re telling me one group of people has access to a civil system of criminal justice, so that when they get arrested, they know their rights, they&#8217;re told why they&#8217;re arrested, lawyer, etc. You&#8217;re telling me the other group has no access to that? That they can be arrested, that no one needs to tell them why they&#8217;re being arrested? No one needs to tell their families that if they are killed, you don&#8217;t even have to return their bodies? What is that?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So when you compare Palestine to the Jim Crow South, my reaction is that these are both moral obscenities, but they&#8217;re different. And I do think it&#8217;s complicated —</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tell me why you think it’s complicated.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think it matters that many Palestinians still support the attacks on October 7. I think it matters that Black people in the Jim Crow South wanted to be treated as equal citizens in a fully democratic America.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s generally true that Palestinians want equal rights in a fully democratic Israel. And if they had that they might vote to end its existence as a Jewish State. And you know what? If I was a Palestinian who was pulling my friends and my family out of the fucking rubble, I&#8217;d probably vote the same way. I understand that.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Personally, I hate the idea of a state based entirely on religious or ethnic identity. But I&#8217;m not Jewish and I don&#8217;t live in Israel and I understand why the people who do live there would have these concerns. And I also think it matters that Jews are indigenous to that land and have nowhere else to go. I just think that complicates the picture in other ways.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I am of the mind that discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion is never acceptable. There is nothing in this world that will make separate and unequal okay, and there’s nothing — and I’ll use this word — that makes apartheid okay. That&#8217;s not complex for me. It&#8217;s like the death penalty is not really complex for me, because you cannot guarantee to me that the state will not execute an innocent person. You just can&#8217;t. So I&#8217;m against it, period. There aren&#8217;t any exceptions to that.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I haven&#8217;t been to Palestine but I know it&#8217;s bad and I know what you saw there is wrong. And I don&#8217;t believe there is any such thing as a moral occupation, because whatever the reasons for it, you cannot occupy a people without visiting cruelties upon them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But for me, the main question isn’t necessarily the badness of the situation, which is incontestable. It&#8217;s how the hell do we end this? And all these complications that I was mentioning earlier, that&#8217;s the stuff that has to be accounted for if there&#8217;s any hope of a way forward.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We are sitting here asking ourselves why we don&#8217;t have a workable solution, while we exclude one of the two significant parties, and I guess my politics would say the most significant party, because that&#8217;s just where I come from in terms of the oppressed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How can you decide what is going to be the solution when every night when I watch reports from the region, I can name only one person who is of Palestinian heritage, who I regularly see articulate a solution or an idea? How do we get to a solution when our journals, our newspapers, our literature that dominate the conversation is not just devoid of Palestinian perspectives, but it&#8217;s devoid of Palestinians themselves?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We are not having a conversation about solutions because we&#8217;ve basically prevented a whole group of people from entering into the frame. And so it&#8217;s like we&#8217;re putting the cart before the horse. We&#8217;re frustrated that we don&#8217;t have a solution, but we&#8217;re not actually talking to somebody.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I agree that our moral imagination needs to extend in both directions as far as possible. I understand writing this as a kind of corrective, feeling like there was a lack of empathy for the Palestinian experience because their story hasn&#8217;t been told enough, hasn&#8217;t been represented enough. I can understand that, I really can. And if I&#8217;m being honest, I think if I went there and saw the suffering firsthand, all of this would feel a whole lot less abstract to me and it would hit differently. And I don&#8217;t know how that would change how I think about it —</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So when are you going to go, Sean?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a fair question, and the only honest answer is I don’t know.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You should go. I know it&#8217;s hard. And look, I&#8217;m putting you on the spot, but it was extremely hard. First of all, you are a journalist. That&#8217;s the first thing. That&#8217;s my first case for you going. The second case is this is being done in your name. And we&#8217;re going to pay for it. We&#8217;re going to pay for it one way or the other. We will pay for this. We will pay for this.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">God, now I think it&#8217;s your responsibility to go. I&#8217;m sorry, but I really do believe that. I really do believe that because you are someone who is obviously curious, obviously wants to know things. And the reason why I&#8217;m pushing you is because that vague sense of injustice is exactly what I had. That is exactly how I felt, man.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But I’ll push you a little on that because it runs in both directions. If I went to Israel and toured the villages that were plundered on October 7, I&#8217;d feel this same kind of indignation and rage.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You should, though. You should see that, too. I don’t think those feelings are contrary.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No, I don&#8217;t mean to say they&#8217;re contrary. I&#8217;m just saying I would still be left feeling the sense of hopelessness at the tragedy of it all.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think you would know more, though. I think you would know more. You sound like me. This is what I thought. Even on the eve of the trip, I was like, &#8220;Boy, this is going to be really complicated.&#8221; I thought the morality of it would be complicated. And there&#8217;s a reason why I began that chapter in [World Holocaust Remembrance Center] Yad Vashem, and it is because the fact of existential violence and industrial genocide brought to the Jewish people of this world is a very, very real thing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And it&#8217;s like, how do you confront that and reconcile that with Israel? Because you want that group of people to be okay. You feel like maybe that group of people is entitled to certain things. And I mean that in the best kind of way. They&#8217;re entitled to a kind of safety, given what happened to them. You feel deep, deep sympathy. And so before I went, I was like, &#8220;Wow, this is going to be morally dicey.&#8221; </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think you should go. I&#8217;m not even saying you&#8217;re going to agree with me. I&#8217;m not saying you&#8217;re going to end up where I ended up, but I think you should go.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Do you think both sides of this conflict can tell a story about it that makes them right and the other side wrong? Because there are so many victims and perpetrators on both sides, because the cycle of violence and retaliation stretches back so far.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I don&#8217;t think it stretches back that far. It&#8217;s 1948. It&#8217;s not even 100 years. I mean, I interviewed people that were very much alive in 1948, so I don&#8217;t even think it&#8217;s back that far. I think that when we say things like that, no disrespect, but I think we say things like that to make it harder than it actually is. It&#8217;s a lifetime that is not even over yet. And what I would say is my opposition to apartheid, to segregation, to oppression, does not emanate from a belief in the hypermorality of the oppressed or even the morality of the oppressed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The civil rights movement kind of fooled us with this because it was kind of a morality play and it was a very successful strategy. But whether Martin Luther King was nonviolent or not, segregation was wrong. Even when Malcolm X was yelling “by any means necessary,” segregation was still wrong. It was still wrong. So for me, it&#8217;s not even a matter of sides being right. The system that governs both sides is wrong.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I remember once hearing you talk about the vulgarities of punditry. Pundits are not in the truth-seeking business. Pundits make pronouncements. That&#8217;s the whole stupid, mindless game. But you&#8217;re not like that. You have never been like that.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One reason I retreated into podcasting is that I don&#8217;t feel that pressure to pronounce in that way, and even doing it in a serious way for me felt futile. But I don&#8217;t have your stature and I don&#8217;t have your reach, so it&#8217;s different for you, I imagine. Do you think you can make a real difference here? Or is that not even part of the calculus?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I needed to write what I saw. This is uncomfortable to say, but I think this moment matters. I was talking to a good friend yesterday, a colleague, a very intelligent and sharp young writer. And we were actually sitting around a table. It was a Muslim woman and another writer there, and we were all in sympathy in terms of our politics. And she&#8217;s making the point that this thing that&#8217;s happening right now, it actually matters, it&#8217;s making a difference. And I was saying, I want out.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I&#8217;m doing this book tour and then I&#8217;m out of here, man. I&#8217;m going back to my French studies. I&#8217;m out. And I&#8217;m not out because I&#8217;m scared to say what I want to say. I&#8217;m not out because of the heat. I am out because it just feels unnatural. And part of it feels unnatural because I&#8217;m not Palestinian, but it also feels contrary to writing, which is always seeking, always trying to learn, always trying to figure it out, always asking questions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So when you&#8217;re making these pronouncements, as I admit I am now, you wonder, am I actually betraying the craft? Should I have just written a book, put it out, and be done with it? There&#8217;s always that voice in the back of your mind. But when I was over there, man, what they said to me over and over again was, “Tell them what you saw.”</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I come on this show every week and I praise the virtues of doubt and uncertainty and I believe in that. But refusing to describe things simply and clearly can become a kind of moral and intellectual crime. You&#8217;re right about that. And I still think sometimes things really are complicated and not so neat and maybe the challenge of being a writer and or just a human being is being honest and wise enough to know the difference. But it is hard sometimes, and I do think this situation is complicated, and it’s also true that sometimes withholding moral judgment can be its own kind of cowardice.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yeah. And again, I just want to take it back. When that day comes, when the Palestinians are back in the frame, when they’re invited to tell their own stories, when they’re invited to take their place at the table, I have no doubt that what will come out of that will be quite complicated.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">South Africa&#8217;s complicated. They defeated apartheid, but did they change the basic economic arrangements? My understanding is not as much as a lot of people would&#8217;ve wished. Better than apartheid, but it&#8217;s not done. It is indeed quite complicated. The victory is indeed quite complicated, but the morality of apartheid is not.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What is hard for me is I&#8217;ve been on a couple of shows now where I&#8217;ve had some debate about this with people, and they never challenge the fact of what&#8217;s going on. So when I say half the population is enshrined at the highest level of citizenship and everyone else is something less, they don&#8217;t say, “Ta-Nehisi, that&#8217;s not true.” But perhaps this is just where I sit. It&#8217;s like when your parents grew up in Jim Crow, when they were born in the Jim Crow, that is an immediate no-go. I feel like I don&#8217;t know what comes after this, but that is wrong. That&#8217;s wrong. You know what I mean? What is after that might be quite complicated and quite hard, but that is not the answer at all.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I&#8217;m sitting in a cave in the South Hebron Hills [in the West Bank] with a group of people, and they&#8217;re telling me about their fears of being evicted out of a cave, man. When I look at — &#8220;Hey, that&#8217;s complicated&#8221; — when I know full well it&#8217;s not. What to do about it is probably complicated. But you begin from the basis that this is wrong and the very difficult work of figuring it out can proceed after that.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Kamala Harris gave her campaign’s biggest economic <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/09/25/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-at-a-campaign-event-pittsburgh-pa/">speech</a> yet in Pittsburgh last month, she tried to keep everyone in her party happy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She did not succeed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Attempting to strike a balance between progressive and pro-business themes, Harris said she’d hold corporations accountable if they didn’t play by the rules — but opined that “most companies are working hard to do the right thing.” She referenced the activist presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, but in calling for “experimentation” rather than sweeping transformational change. Rather than being “constrained by ideology,” Harris said, she’d seek “practical solutions to problems” and “applying metrics to our analysis.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The speech had little populist fire to be found, and, coming amidst <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/business/dealbook/nike-ceo-donahoe.html">extensive</a> <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2941e79d-cdc0-457e-a7a3-9c08f1f6e635">courting</a> of Wall Street and Silicon Valley donors by Harris’s team, it set off <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/us/politics/harriss-economic-pitch-capitalism-for-the-middle-class.html">alarm bells</a> among some on the left. “My God,” the progressive economist Hal Singer <a href="https://x.com/HalSinger/status/1839090046885871926">wrote on X</a> afterward. “We lost Kamala.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The “we” is an alliance of advocates that has, over the past 10 years, come together in a surprisingly successful project to reshape the Democratic Party’s economic agenda. Some wanted to take on Big Tech and Big Business. Others wanted the government to revive US manufacturing, while ditching free trade and getting tougher on China. And others wanted big new spending on social policy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But these advocates joined to fight a common enemy: neoliberalism. They sought to discredit the pro-free market and government-skeptical assumptions — and some of the specific people — that they argue drove economic policy in the Clinton and Obama years. The status quo, they believed, had hurt the American people and backfired on Democrats electorally.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In both the inside game of Democratic Party politics and the outside “war of ideas,” these post-neoliberals triumphed during the Trump and early Biden years — converting many party elites to their cause, securing key appointments, and shaping what became <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/03/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-felicia-wong.html#:~:text=new%20progressive%20economics">known</a> to <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-new-progressive-economics-some">some</a> as the New Progressive Economics. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The reformers went from irrelevant underdogs to well-organized, well-funded practitioners of hardball power politics shaping national policy. “This was an astonishing success, a seizure of some of the commanding heights of policymaking,” the historian <a href="https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/64/the-new-paradigm-how-fares-post-neoliberalism/">Quinn Slobodian wrote</a> in 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris’s ascent has thrown all this into question. Some <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-linkedin-reid-hoffman-ftc-chair-lina-khan-rcna163897">are urging</a> Harris to undo some of Biden’s changes and <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/can-kamala-harris-win-campaign-strategy-trump-obama.html">steer</a> the party closer to where it was in the Obama years — for instance, by being less hostile to big business and big tech. These critics point to <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/644750/confidence-biden-economic-stewardship-historically-low.aspx">Biden’s unpopularity</a>, arguing that the new agenda has been tried and failed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So far, Harris’s team has tried to keep both the reformers and their critics happy, sending signals to each camp suggesting she’s with them. But for now, winning is her top priority. “I don’t think she has an economic philosophy, and I don’t think she wants to have one until she wins the election,” one advocate in close contact with the campaign told me. (This article is based on conversations with policy experts, advocates, and former government officials, several of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak more freely.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Harris and her party will have to choose a path forward if she wins. And understanding the present crossroads requires reckoning with why Democrats adopted this agenda in the first place.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Did the New Progressive Economics rise due to fundamental political shifts — or was it something of a fluke in a historical moment that has now passed?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And, on both the politics and the substance: Did it succeed, or did it fail?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-credible-threat-and-pain-inflicted-how-elizabeth-warren-became-impossible-for-the-party-establishment-to-ignore">“A credible threat and pain inflicted”: How Elizabeth Warren became impossible for the party establishment to ignore</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The transformation of the Democratic Party began during Barack Obama’s second term, when some progressive thinkers and activists’ disappointment and frustration with his administration boiled over.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The country had recovered from the Great Recession, <a href="https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/austerity-obama-years/">but slowly</a>. Banks were <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/7/21/9004155/dodd-frank-explainer">now somewhat more regulated</a>, but Obama hadn’t fundamentally transformed the finance sector or <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/how-wall-streets-bankers-stayed-out-of-jail/399368/">punished bankers</a> with prosecutions. Progressive critics believed this was because Obama’s top appointees, like Larry Summers and Tim Geithner, were too sympathetic to finance and too beholden to the old economic establishment’s thinking.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-127823671.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,32.182991809744,100,35.634016380512" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The critics argued that there were far deeper problems with the US economy that required far more sweeping change. But what change, exactly? Inspired in part by Occupy Wall Street and its “<a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/10/we-are-the-99-percent-creators/">We are the 99 percent</a>” slogan, “inequality” became a new funding priority of progressive <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/07/24/a-think-tank-wanted-to-study-inequality-no-conservatives-offered-to-help/">donors</a> and <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3076">foundations</a>. “There was an understanding starting to form that the economy wasn’t delivering,” Felicia Wong, president of the Roosevelt Institute, a progressive think tank, told me.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Much of the rethinking was happening in Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s orbit. Warren, a Harvard law professor and consumer law expert, had come to Washington in late 2008 to help Congress oversee the bank bailouts; she soon won national fame with her tough questioning of both bankers and Obama officials like Geithner.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Warren’s pet <a href="https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/5/unsafe-at-any-rate/">idea for a new consumer protection agency</a> made it into law, and Obama gave her a temporary gig setting that agency up. But when she asked Obama if he’d give her the job permanently, he declined, arguing — likely correctly — that she couldn’t be confirmed by the Senate. “I was disappointed, but not surprised,” <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fighting-Chance-Elizabeth-Warren/dp/1627790527">Warren later wrote</a>. The natural solution was to run for Senate herself; she won her Massachusetts seat in 2012.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet, nearly two years into her term, and after dismal 2014 midterm results for Democrats, Warren was frustrated — Obama’s team, she thought, still seemed beholden to the old ways. So she started to pick fights. She <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/12/11/7376421/antonio-weiss">sank Obama’s nomination</a> of Antonio Weiss, an investment banker, for a Treasury Department position, and gave a fiery speech <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/12/12/enough-is-enough-elizabeth-warrens-fiery-attack-comes-after-congress-weakens-wall-street-regulations/">blasting</a> a financial regulation rollback in Congress’s year-end spending bill. Warren <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/elizabeth-warren-just-gave-hillary-clinton-a-big-warning/">believed</a> “personnel is policy,” and that Obama was simply appointing and listening to too many of the wrong people.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Warren also began to look beyond Wall Street in her desire to find what ailed the American economy. She <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/files/documents/2016-6-29_Warren_Antitrust_Speech.pdf">embraced</a> a theory, pushed by a small group of writers and advocates like <a href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/2017/10/29/the-democrats-confront-monopoly/">Barry Lynn</a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/16/tech/lina-khan-risk-takers/index.html">Lina Khan</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/04/21/matt-stoller-hawley-trust-busting-00092679">Matt Stoller</a>, and <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/131412/important-2016-issue-dont-know">David Dayen</a>, that the problem wasn’t just finance but also Big Tech and big corporations generally.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-473053916.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Sen. Warren speaks at a Roosevelt Institute event on May 12, 2015. | Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty" data-portal-copyright="Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Traditional antitrust policy had been that the government should intervene when corporate concentration raised prices for consumers. But these advocates wanted to rethink and expand the concept of antitrust — to make it about challenging the concentration of corporate power, even when the companies in question (like Amazon) offered low prices to consumers. This was the start of the new antitrust movement.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Warren’s outspokenness caught Hillary Clinton’s attention. Wary of a primary challenge from the left, she <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2019/12/19/elizabeth-warren-hillary-clinton-economy-087346">arranged a sit-down</a> with Warren, in which the Massachusetts senator <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4647">made clear</a> what she really cared about: She didn’t want Wall Street’s preferred appointees, and she had her own list of people she liked better.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bernie Sanders’s surprisingly strong campaign amped up the populist pressure on Clinton. Yet instead of endorsing Sanders, who few believed could win, Warren remained neutral during the primaries, preserving her chance to play an inside game with Clinton afterward.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Talks between Warren’s and Clinton’s camps continued up to Election Day. The Roosevelt Institute established itself as a progressive competitor to Democrats’ favorite think tank, the Center for American Progress, and sent along Warren-friendly names: binders full of progressives.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Warren had made herself someone that Democratic leaders couldn’t ignore. “In early 2014, nobody cared at all what our side thought because there was no credible threat and no pain inflicted,” a former Warren aide told me. “By 2016, they did care — because there was a credible threat and there was pain inflicted.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A Clinton transition official backed up this assessment, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2019/12/19/elizabeth-warren-hillary-clinton-economy-087346">telling Politico</a>, “It was kind of a pain in the ass to be thinking about her all the time.” Still, though she and her allies had won a seat at the table, they weren’t at the head of the table just yet.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-semi-vast-left-wing-conspiracy-how-democrats-crafted-a-new-agenda-during-the-trump-years">“A semi-vast left-wing conspiracy”: How Democrats crafted a new agenda during the Trump years</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s 2016 victory came as a seismic shock to Democrats. Party elites were so stunned by Clinton’s defeat that they began to question their fundamental assumptions about how politics worked. The establishment was grappling for answers; some of them looked in the mirror and <a href="https://democracyjournal.org/arguments/the-new-old-democrats/">wondered</a>: Was this our fault?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A well-funded effort to convince them that it was indeed their fault soon materialized. Influential progressives who wanted to challenge the party’s consensus saw opportunity. Larry Kramer, the head of the Hewlett Foundation, launched a heavily-funded effort to discredit neoliberalism as an “<a href="https://hewlett.org/library/beyond-neoliberalism-rethinking-political-economy/">intellectual paradigm</a>.” The Ford Foundation, having already reoriented its giving around <a href="https://www.philanthropy.com/article/ford-shifts-grant-making-to-focus-entirely-on-inequality/">inequality</a> in 2015, joined in. The Omidyar Network (funded by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar) began its own push to “<a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">reimagine capitalism</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So during the Trump years, money flowed into think tanks and advocacy groups old and new, in a project inspired by conservative donors’ decades-long project of building a right-wing <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Counter-Establishment-Conservative-Ascent-Political/dp/1402759118">counter-establishment</a>. In his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Middle-Out-Progressive-Economics-Prosperity/dp/0385547161"><em>The Middle Out</em></a>, journalist Mike Tomasky dubbed this an “increasingly at least semi-vast left-wing conspiracy” — a “network of people and groups” that “helped change the economic conversation in dramatic ways.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Close ties developed among many of these thinkers and experts, many of whom had nonprofit posts but hoped to enter government or influence appointments later on. Hewlett and Omidyar grants also funded new centers <a href="https://hewlett.org/grants/yale-university-for-a-project-to-develop-the-field-of-american-political-economy-within-political-science/">at universities</a> and projects at certain <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/new-rules/">media outlets</a> (including this one — the Omidyar Network funded two Vox <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/12/10/20970994/open-sourced-reporting-network">reporting</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/21362321/economy-american-policy-coronavirus-covid-recovery-fix-solutions-mobilization-great-rebuild">projects</a> in 2019 and 2020, though they had no editorial oversight over these projects).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A key figure in this grant-making effort was <a href="https://hewlett.org/people/jennifer-harris/">Jennifer Harris</a>, who headed the Hewlett Foundation’s grantmaking on economic issues. Harris had come to progressive economics from an unusual direction: through foreign policy. She was a <a href="https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/08/10/its-time-for-a-new-strategy-against-china-000496/">national security hawk</a> who, while working at the State Department, came to believe that the US’s longtime approach to trade deals had been disastrously captured by big corporations — that it had hollowed out important domestic industries and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/War-Other-Means-Geoeconomics-Statecraft/dp/0674737210">posed serious strategic risks</a> in a new era of great power competition with China.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris concluded that flawed and outdated neoliberal thinking was failing the country on many fronts. “Paradigms like neoliberalism function at a society level,” she told me. “Their power derives precisely from how many of their premises are taken for granted, and for how much consensus they enjoy, across the ideological spectrum.” The world, she continued, was at a “dangerous” juncture, due to “the return of great power competition and the urgency of climate change.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With Hewlett’s grant-making, Harris wanted to help shape a new intellectual paradigm to more effectively grapple with these new challenges. She funded many left critiques of&nbsp;neoliberalism, as well as <a href="https://hewlett.org/grants/american-affairs-for-support-of-the-right-of-center-alternatives-to-neoliberalism/">a few</a> from <a href="https://www.notus.org/money/american-compass-omidyar-progressives">the right</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="funding-the-new-progressive-economics"><strong>Funding the New Progressive Economics</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Between 2017 and 2024, the Hewlett Foundation spent tens of millions of dollars to develop alternatives to neoliberalism. Grantees <a href="https://hewlett.org/grants/?sort=relevance">included</a>:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Progressive think tanks:</strong> Hewlett funded policy work at the Roosevelt Institute ($5.8 million), Washington Center on Equitable Growth ($6.1 million), Economic Policy Institute ($1.4 million), Demos ($1.1 million), and the Center for Economic and Policy Research ($615,000).</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>The new antitrust movement:</strong> Grants went to Open Markets ($750,000), the American Economic Liberties Project ($450,000), and the Economic Security Project’s Anti-Monopoly Fund ($1.3 million).</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Groups on the right:</strong> Hewlett funded the policy group American Compass ($2.9 million) and the journal American Affairs ($1.2 million), which challenged the right’s free-market thinking.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Media:</strong> Hewlett funded coverage of and reporting projects about new economic thinking at the Atlantic ($1.3 million), Boston Review ($1.9 million), and the American Prospect ($665,000), though it did not have editorial oversight over such coverage.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Academia:</strong> Hewlett funded new research initiatives or centers on the economy at Harvard ($7.5 million), Yale ($4 million), Johns Hopkins ($15 million), Howard ($10 million), UC Berkeley ($9.8 million), and MIT ($7.5 million).</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But what, exactly, would the new agenda entail?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For one, many progressives <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/31/16021844/antitrust-better-deal">embraced</a> Warren and her allies’ antitrust push. So did Democratic leaders, who were seeking populist policies as their party was turning against Big Tech. After the leading new antitrust movement activists had been controversially <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/us/politics/eric-schmidt-google-new-america.html">ousted</a> from the New America Foundation think tank, they formed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/technology/big-tech-antitrust.html">new advocacy groups</a> that won <a href="https://hewlett.org/grants/open-markets-for-general-operating-support-3/">Hewlett</a> and Omidyar <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/10/technology/americas-top-foundations-bankroll-attack-on-big-tech.html">funding</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Onetime blogger Matt Stoller became particularly influential on this topic — through his book <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/a-history-of-americas-fight-against-monopolies/2019/12/06/ce34b360-da3c-11e9-ac63-3016711543fe_story.html"><em>Goliath</em>,</a> an <a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/what-is-big">email newsletter</a>, and his <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/04/21/matt-stoller-hawley-trust-busting-00092679">pugnacious Twitter presence</a>, he hammered home the message that Big Tech and big business were at the heart of the country’s woes. Warren, who <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/04/21/matt-stoller-hawley-trust-busting-00092679">has praised</a> Stoller as “a brilliant thinker and writer,” <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/08/politics/elizabeth-warren-amazon-google-facebook/index.html">released a plan</a> to break up Big Tech companies in 2019, near the start of her own presidential campaign.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But beyond aligning with the Warrenites, Jen Harris also began to <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/projects/foreign-policy-for-the-middle-class?lang=en">help shape</a> another pillar of Democrats’ agenda: a new industrial policy, in which the government would intervene in the economy by financially supporting key industries — with strings attached.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Good free-market neoliberals had historically disdained this idea, believing government attempts to meddle in the economy would have bad results. But industrial policy appealed to several important Democratic constituencies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Labor wanted more US union jobs. Climate change activists wanted money for the clean energy sector. National security hawks wanted to challenge China. Political operatives thought it might play well in the Rust Belt. Much of the business community might be happy about it too — after all, it involved giving US companies money.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democratic policy wunderkind Jake Sullivan liked what Jen Harris — and Elizabeth Warren — had to say. In line for a top policy job under Hillary Clinton, Sullivan had been one of those undergoing a dark night of the soul since 2016. He <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2018-02-27/ex-clinton-aide-sullivan-to-lead-group-challenging-trump-agenda">had considered</a> a top lobbying job at Google, but instead chose to work at nonprofits rethinking the policy agenda. And by June 2018, he sounded excited about what he was seeing.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-2087328102.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Jake Sullivan seen in profile" title="Jake Sullivan seen in profile" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan waits to speak during the daily press briefing at the White House on March 18, 2024." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">“There’s something profound happening in American politics right now,” Sullivan <a href="https://democracyjournal.org/arguments/the-new-old-democrats/">wrote</a> in Democracy. He asserted the country was at a “turning point,” disillusioned by free-market excesses and open to bold new policies. “Democrats should not blush too much, or pay too much heed, when political commentators arch their eyebrows about the party moving left,” he continued. “The center of gravity itself is moving, and this is a good thing.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="i-never-thought-i-d-live-to-see-a-time-when-my-allies-were-in-charge-how-progressives-won-on-personnel-under-biden">“I never thought I’d live to see a time when my allies were in charge”: How progressives won on personnel under Biden</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The left did not technically win the 2020 Democratic primary, as Joe Biden — the most old school of the major contenders — emerged triumphant over Sanders and Warren.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Biden embraced the new agenda anyway. He had long been close to labor and skeptical of pointy-headed economists from elite universities. (“He’s so old,” Felicia Wong of the Roosevelt Institute <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/07/biden-big-left-gamble.html">later said</a>, “that it turns out he’s actually pre-neoliberal.”) Now, amid the deepening pandemic crisis, the idea of an “<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/05/joe-biden-presidential-plans.html">FDR-size presidency</a>” sounded appealing. Key aides around him, like Ron Klain and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/11/02/bruce-reed-ai-biden-tech-00124375">Bruce Reed</a>, agreed that bold progressive thinking was needed, and Sullivan became the campaign’s top policy adviser. Wong <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/05/politics/joe-biden-transition-team/index.html">was named</a> to the transition team.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other progressives wanted to hold Biden’s feet to the fire from the outside once he won. Warren’s chief of staff Dan Geldon departed her office, starting a firm pushing opposition research about potential appointees he deemed unreliable. Jeff Hauser of the Revolving Door Project <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/transition-playbook/2020/12/04/meet-the-thorn-in-the-biden-transitions-side-491065">frequently disparaged</a> potential nominees as corporate hacks and sellouts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such attacks often showed up in the American Prospect and the Intercept, two publications solidly aligned with the new agenda. Hewlett or Omidyar <a href="https://hewlett.org/grants/the-american-prospect-for-general-operating-support/">money</a> <a href="https://economicsecurityproject.org/news/anti-monopoly-fund-announces-first-round-of-investments-2/">helped</a> <a href="https://hewlett.org/grants/center-for-economic-and-policy-research-for-the-revolving-door-project/">fund</a> the links in this chain — the semi-vast left-wing conspiracy was at work. (Its participants argued they were fighting against far greater corporate money and influence.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The good-cop, bad-cop approach succeeded. Champions of the new progressive economics such as Jen Harris and many <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/03/how-elizabeth-warrens-acolytes-infiltrated-bidenworld/">Warren</a> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-10/warren-builds-clout-with-biden-through-pipeline-of-staff-picks?embedded-checkout=true&amp;sref=qYiz2hd0">allies</a> scored key White House and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/01/1042310553/cfpb-senate-confirms-rohit-chopra-watchdog-consumer-financial-protection-bureau">regulatory</a> <a href="https://thefulcrum.us/demos-k-sabeel-rahman">posts</a>. Biden’s Cabinet secretaries were more traditional Democrats, but when they tried to staff their agencies, their picks were often overruled by the White House in favor of alternatives <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/26/janet-yellen-biden-debt-ceiling-00033398">preferred by the Warrenites</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The new antitrust movement scored particularly big, though it took some hardball. Biden got Lina Khan confirmed by the Senate as an FTC commissioner and only afterward revealed he’d make her the commission’s chair; Republicans (and some Democrats) were <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/29/lina-khan-war-monopolies-514581">shocked</a> that the 32-year-old calling for a total rethink of antitrust policy would be in charge.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Reformers also wanted attorney Jonathan Kanter, a longtime <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/22/technology/jonathan-kanter-apple-antitrust.html">critic of Google</a>, for the top Department of Justice antitrust job. Attorney General Merrick Garland initially seemed disinclined to follow their counsel — but when word leaked out that Garland was considering other contenders, articles slamming them appeared in <a href="https://prospect.org/cabinet-watch/top-antitrust-job-may-go-to-an-ally-of-joe-lieberman/">the Prospect</a> and <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/01/28/antitrust-facebook-merrick-garland/">the Intercept</a>. Kanter <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/biden-name-jonathan-kanter-doj-antitrust-chief-source-2021-07-20/">got the gig</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Quickly, Biden’s administration took on a different character from Obama’s. ”Economists and financiers are simply far less influential,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/08/opinion/biden-jobs-infrastructure-economy.html">Ezra Klein reported</a>. The nonprofit world and labor leaders rose in influence.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Progressives’ appointment success took on particular importance because Biden took a hands-off approach to economic policy. It was “very, very rare,” a former administration official told me, for a decision memo outlining different courses of action supported by different economic aides to be sent to the president. Biden would offer his feedback on policy plans during briefings; but staff would typically send “joint recommendation memos” that he’d then sign. In practice, that gave staff great freedom to shape policy, so long as they could agree with each other.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When the Hewlett Foundation hosted a conference on the future of neoliberalism, several Biden administration officials attended. So did the American Prospect’s Bob Kuttner, a longtime, often-lonely critic of the economic policy establishment. Afterward, Kuttner <a href="https://prospect.org/economy/2023-03-28-what-comes-after-neoliberalism/">marveled</a>: “I never thought I’d live to see a time when my allies were in charge of the government.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-successes-and-struggles-of-bidenomics">The successes and struggles of Bidenomics</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With Democrats in control of Congress for the first time in a decade, the party wanted to make the most of their governing majority — and that meant going big.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They started off with a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill for pandemic recovery. Economists like Larry Summers <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/02/04/larry-summers-biden-covid-stimulus/">complained</a> that this was <a href="https://www.crfb.org/blogs/voices-skeptical-size-19-trillion-covid-relief-plan">far too big</a> — that its size seemed to go far beyond what economic analysis suggested was necessary, and that it could worsen inflation. Democrats in Congress and the administration <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/2/4/22262467/democrats-covid-stimulus-reconciliation-biden">dismissed these warnings</a>, not wanting to repeat Obama’s mistake of spending too little.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rest of the Democrats’ big bold legislative agenda ran into the constraints of a 50-50 Senate. Republicans helped pass a $1 trillion <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/10/us/politics/infrastructure-bill-passes.html">infrastructure bill</a>, but for other progressive priorities, Democrats had to tailor their plans to the restrictions of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/22242476/senate-filibuster-budget-reconciliation-process">budget reconciliation process</a> (which bypasses the filibuster). Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) then nixed the <a href="https://www.vox.com/22577374/reconciliation-bill-biden-medicare-climate">sweeping social spending</a> in the Build Back Better plan. But in the summer of 2022, <a href="https://www.vox.com/23281547/build-back-better-joe-manchin-inflation-reduction-act">Manchin did approve</a> massive new clean energy tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Republicans also signed onto the <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2022/7/27/23277664/chips-act-solve-chip-shortage-biden-manufacturing">CHIPS Act</a>, a bill to award billions in grants to bolster a US semiconductor manufacturing industry. The bill was meant to address national security risks about the current Taiwan-centered supply chain, which was vulnerable to a future conflict with China. This was part of a broader Biden administration hardline toward Beijing that <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/15/biden-tariff-reaction-trump-00158043">included</a> <a href="https://www.cfr.org/article/weighing-bidens-china-tariffs">tariffs </a>and <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2022/11/5/23440525/biden-administration-semiconductor-export-ban-china">dramatic limits</a> on semiconductor exports.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The IRA and CHIPS Act meant the industrial policy agenda championed by Jen Harris had made it into law, and she helped steer its implementation in the administration. Meanwhile, Khan and Kanter swung into action on antitrust, <a href="https://www.thesling.org/sorry-matt-yglesias-hipster-antitrust-does-not-mean-the-abandonment-of-consumers-but-it-does-mean-new-ways-to-protect-workers-2/">suing</a> Amazon, Meta, Apple, and Google, <a href="https://www.progressivepolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/PPI_Merger-Enforcement_V3.pdf">among other companies</a>. Both became key to what the administration dubbed “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/28/bidenomics-is-working-the-presidents-plan-grows-the-economy-from-the-middle-out-and-bottom-up-not-the-top-down/">Bidenomics</a>”&nbsp;(and the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/opinion/jennifer-harris-bidenomics.html">would later dub Harris</a> “The queen bee of Bidenomics”).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But now that the new agenda was actually being implemented, its critics began to speak up — while its inherent tensions became more evident.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-1723106191.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.736846495978,100,78.526307008044" alt="Biden speaks at a podium in an industrial outdoor space.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Khan’s FTC tenure was cheered by progressives but controversial <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/12/lina-khans-rough-year-running-the-federal-trade-commission.html">among agency staff</a> and deeply loathed by business. She was criticized for bringing cases that seemed doomed in court — winning such cases would depend on persuading judges of new legal thinking, a project of years or decades. Khan and Kanter’s main impact was deterrence: fear of expensive investigations <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/antitrust/failed-deals-climb-as-antitrust-enforcers-push-aggressive-agenda">helped chill</a> mergers and acquisitions. Democratic policy now appeared to be that big business shouldn’t get bigger.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, the new industrial policy was sending billions in tax credits and grants to big US companies, which was a bit incongruous. Indeed, Warren and her allies increasingly <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/democrats-ask-raimondo-for-more-oversight-on-chips-funding.html">looked askance</a> at the CHIPS Act grants being made by Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, who they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/26/business/economy/gina-raimondo-chips-biden.html">viewed</a> as far too eager to send money out the door with insufficient oversight.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Progressives wanted to attach stringent labor, environmental, and social justice standards to such payouts. Others argued that demanding too much — the tendency Ezra Klein <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/02/opinion/democrats-liberalism.html">dubbed</a> “everything-bagel liberalism” — could hamper the new industries from being built. (So far, spending on factory construction <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/econographics/the-ira-and-chips-act-are-supercharging-us-manufacturing-construction/#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20US%20construction%20spending,month%20building%20new%20production%20facilities.">has</a> <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/biden-did-stuff-and-it-looks-like">doubled</a>, but we are still years away from seeing whether these businesses will succeed.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The nitty-gritty of implementation also made clear that no one approach could make every constituency happy. Climate hawks <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/2024/3/4/24087919/biden-tariff-chinese-ev-byd-battery-detroit">complained about</a> the administration’s tariffs on Chinese clean energy companies. Auto workers making gasoline-powered cars <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/16/business/electric-vehicles-uaw-gm-ford-stellantis.html">objected to</a> a push toward electric vehicles. National security doves <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/08/20/derisking-decoupling-us-china-biden-economy-trade-technology-semiconductors-chips-supply-chains-ai-geopolitics-escalation/">worried</a> Biden’s China policy was too provocative. Unions’ interest in creating high-paying US jobs naturally clashed with corporate incentives to lower manufacturing costs. And did the administration really want to bolster US companies to help them compete globally — or did it want to take those companies down a peg?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet in the public mind, the new economic agenda was largely overshadowed by a problem the reformers had not anticipated: the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/us-inflation-june-2022-consumer-price-index-11657664129">highest inflation in four decades</a>. It was the neoliberals who had warned about this, while the progressives were caught flat-footed, as was the Biden administration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“People don’t like inflation and we got a lot of it,” economist Adam Ozimek told me. This was a global phenomenon and not primarily caused by Biden’s policies, but the administration was slow to adjust and <a href="https://www.vox.com/23036340/biden-american-rescue-plan-inflation">made it somewhat worse</a>. “The stimulus was way too large, it came out all at once, and they proceeded to follow it with a variety of spending packages,” Ozimek said. He added that the economy is now in a good place after hefty interest rate hikes, but that we took a “chaotic path” getting there.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the end, Biden’s economic policy ended up <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/644750/confidence-biden-economic-stewardship-historically-low.aspx">historically unpopular</a>. That’s left a chasm between progressives who tout Biden’s presidency as one of the most productive and consequential in recent history, and a public deeply unsatisfied with his record. Perhaps the anti-Biden sentiment was more about his age, foreign crises, and inflation that mostly wasn’t his fault — but it’s hard to blame it on neoliberalism.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Shortly after Harris replaced Biden at the top of the ticket, a factional contest for influence kicked off when billionaire Reid Hoffman — who had donated millions to elect Harris — <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/26/business/reid-hoffman-kamala-harris-ftc-khan/index.html">publicly declared</a> that she should replace Lina Khan at the FTC. Progressives <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4830326-kamala-harris-lina-khan-ftc-tech-companies/">responded with outrage</a>, rallying to Khan’s defense and demanding Harris pledge to keep her in place. Harris has not yet taken a position on Khan’s future.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-1258712322.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.640736018236,100,78.718527963527" alt="Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, during an interview on &quot;The Circuit with Emily Chang&quot; in San Francisco, California, on February 27, 2023." title="Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, during an interview on &quot;The Circuit with Emily Chang&quot; in San Francisco, California, on February 27, 2023." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, during an interview on &quot;The Circuit with Emily Chang&quot; in San Francisco, California, on Feb. 27, 2023." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Many believe Harris will be friendlier to business, and especially to Silicon Valley, than Biden was. These fears tend to center around Harris’s brother-in-law, Tony West, who is Uber’s chief legal officer and has become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/04/us/politics/kamala-harris-tony-west.html">an important Harris campaign adviser</a>. West <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/business/dealbook/nike-ceo-donahoe.html">has been cultivating</a> Wall Street and Silicon Valley support for the campaign, sending the message that Harris would be an ally to the business community.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More broadly, some center-left commentators argue the time has come for a rethink of Democrats’ rethink. Jonathan Chait <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/can-kamala-harris-win-campaign-strategy-trump-obama.html">proposed</a> that Harris should revert to something more like the policy and politics of the Obama years (since Obama was a more popular and electorally successful president than Biden), while Matt Yglesias <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/what-was-neoliberalism">argued</a> that the backlash against neoliberalism has “mostly served in practice as a way to tell people that it’s okay to do sloppy economic analysis.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Warren’s allies, meanwhile, were somewhat wrongfooted by Harris’s ascent, as they had not built much of a relationship with her. An incident last year where Warren sounded unsure on whether Harris should stay on the ticket as Biden’s running mate <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/12/politics/kamala-harris-democratic-party/index.html">reportedly led to some tension</a> between their respective camps.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, some early signs suggested Harris might continue the Biden-Warren approach. In August, her campaign announced that their economic advisory team <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/kamala-harriss-economic-team-and-agenda-start-to-take-shape-7682e539">would include</a> Biden’s former National Economic Council director Brian Deese, and Bharat Ramamurti, a one-time Warren aide who had been Deese’s deputy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The reformers were initially encouraged when, in mid-August, Harris proposed a “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/08/15/kamala-harris-economic-policy-2024/">federal ban on corporate price gouging</a>” to combat high grocery costs. “I was really surprised and pleased that she pointed at big food corporations as a causal factor in higher food prices,” Matt Stoller told me shortly afterward. But <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/08/15/kamala-harris-price-gouging-groceries/">centrist pundits</a> criticized the idea, Republicans accused Harris of proposing socialistic price controls, and the campaign <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/business/economy/harris-price-gouging-ban-groceries.html">soon put out word</a> that the policy would have limited impact.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Later that month, Harris’s advisers <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/kamala-harris-tax-plan-2024-election-10f95d18?mod=politics_lead_pos5">said</a> she supported a proposal to tax unrealized capital gains (stock that had appreciated but not yet been sold) for people worth more than $100 million. It was a way to raise revenue and hit the wealthy; in a CNBC appearance, Ramamurti <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1w3LouQY2g">defended the idea</a> from skeptical anchors. But investors were furious. Soon afterward, billionaire investor Mark Cuban, a prominent supporter of Harris <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/09/06/2024/mark-cuban-looks-like-harris-billionaire-validator-whats-he-after">in close contact</a> with the campaign, insisted that she wouldn’t actually go through with the idea, because it would “kill the stock market.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As the campaign has gone on, Harris’s economic line has appeared to some to grow more cautious. Her <a href="https://kamalaharris.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Policy_Book_Economic-Opportunity.pdf">policy plan</a> promises a lot of new and expanded tax credits, and would raise taxes on corporations and the very wealthy, but says relatively little about expanding the welfare state. She <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/26/crypto-kamala-harris-bitcoin/">offered an olive branch</a> to cryptocurrency companies — in contrast to top <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/05/gary-gensler-sec-crypto-00154769">Biden appointees</a> and Warren, who <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/17/crypto-congress-democrats-00158630">wanted to crack down</a> on the industry. Harris has talked about cracking down on corporate “<a href="https://prospect.org/power/2024-10-07-harris-ceos-companies-sued-by-justice-department/">bad actors</a>,” but emphasized that those are the exception.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When I followed up with Stoller in late September after Harris’s Pittsburgh speech, his mood was one of deep pessimism. “I think she’s gonna do what rich people — billionaires — want,” he told me.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The campaign’s economic proposals, Stoller said, were “a mishmash of nonsense.” The progressives who had joined the campaign’s economic team, he now believed, didn’t “have any real influence” and were only included to throw a bone to critics on the left. “I think this is the Tony West show,” he said. “And if she wants to make it clear that it’s not, she needs to say so.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Harris won and returned to neoliberal thinking, Stoller argued, the consequences would be “a failed presidency,” “intraparty war” and perhaps even “losing a war with China.” (After we spoke, Stoller called me back to say he was speaking for himself and not his employer, and that his views on Harris’s campaign changed day-to-day.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Others were more optimistic, or at least agnostic. Jeff Hauser of the Revolving Door Project told me while he was “concerned” about Harris’s rhetoric and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/26/crypto-kamala-harris-bitcoin/">apparent friendliness</a> to the cryptocurrency industry, he was cautiously optimistic that Harris would keep Khan and Kanter in place. “There isn’t really a meaningful policy apparatus and the transition is extremely barebones and noncommittal,” Hauser said. “So it’s hard to know what is real versus what will turn out to be smoke signals that are entirely irrelevant.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The antitrust agenda, reformers worry, could be dropped or seriously weakened. But for industrial policy, the question is less whether it will continue than what it will look like. Reformers fear it will become a corporate subsidy program in which the priorities of labor and other progressive interests take a backseat — that is, that it could start looking a lot more neoliberal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, the world has changed from the Trump years. On a range of issues, the leftward movement of Democratic politicians and voters appears to have abated. <a href="https://hewlett.org/newsroom/larry-kramer-to-step-down-as-hewlett-foundation-president/#:~:text=MENLO%20PARK%2C%20CALIF.,role%2C%20the%20foundation%20announced%20today.">Personnel changes</a> and <a href="https://omidyar.com/omidyar-networks-strategy-evolution-bending-the-arc-of-the-digital-revolution-toward-shared-power-prosperity-and-possibility/">strategy shifts</a> have occurred at the foundations and <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/2024/06/10/felicia-wongs-new-role-and-whats-next-for-roosevelt/">think tanks</a> that pushed the new progressive economics. New topics, like AI, have risen to the top of the agenda, and need to be hashed out. For instance: should the US <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/09/28/mark-cuban-ai-race-us-military-dominance-artificial-intelligence-investment-industrial-policy/">boost domestic AI development</a> as part of security competition with China, or is any big AI company <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/30/ai-debate-culture-clash-dc-silicon-valley-00133323">so dangerous</a> that it should be regulated within an inch of its life?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The post-neoliberals’ level of influence in these debates will hinge on whether they’ve become an inextricable part of the Democratic coalition — or whether their rise under Biden was born of unusual circumstances that no longer exist. A critic of the reformers mused to me that their rise to power may have been largely due to “a lack of supervision” in the Biden White House: “And maybe once the president returns, the whole thing starts to implode.”</p>

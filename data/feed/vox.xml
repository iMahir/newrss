<p class="has-text-align-none">“This is our last day together.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s something you might say to a lover as a whirlwind romance comes to an end. But could you ever imagine saying it to… software? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, somebody did. When OpenAI tested out GPT-4o, its latest generation chatbot that <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/350934/the-double-sexism-of-chatgpts-flirty-her-voice">speaks aloud</a> in its own voice, the company observed users forming an emotional relationship with the AI — one they seemed sad to relinquish. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In fact, OpenAI thinks there’s a risk of people developing what it called an “emotional reliance” on this AI model, as the company acknowledged in a recent <a href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-system-card/">report</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The ability to complete tasks for the user, while also storing and ‘remembering’ key details and using those in the conversation,” OpenAI notes, “creates both a compelling product experience and the potential for over-reliance and dependence.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That sounds uncomfortably like addiction. And OpenAI’s chief technology officer Mira Murati <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/4229972-open-ai-exec-warns-ai-can-become-extremely-addictive/">straight-up said</a> that in designing chatbots equipped with a voice mode, there is “the possibility that we design them in the wrong way and they become extremely addictive and we sort of become enslaved to them.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s more, OpenAI says that the AI’s ability to have a naturalistic conversation with the user may heighten the risk of anthropomorphization —&nbsp;attributing humanlike traits to a nonhuman — which could lead people to form a social relationship with the AI. And that in turn could end up “reducing their need for human interaction,” the report says.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, the company has already released the model, complete with voice mode, to some paid users, and it’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/style/openai-chatgpt-voice.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">expected to release it</a> to everyone this fall. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">OpenAI isn’t the only one creating sophisticated AI companions. There’s Character AI, which young people report becoming so <a href="https://www.news.com.au/technology/online/internet/i-need-to-go-outside-young-people-extremely-addicted-as-characterai-explodes/news-story/5780991c61455c680f34b25d5847a341">addicted to</a> that that they can’t do their schoolwork. There’s the recently introduced Google Gemini Live, which charmed Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern so much that she <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/google-android-ai-rick-osterloh-apple-iphone-7c06b06e?mod=tech_lead_pos4&amp;mc_cid=b8fd9ded8a&amp;mc_eid=aec10915b0">wrote</a>, “I’m not saying I prefer talking to Google’s Gemini Live over a real human. But I’m not <em>not</em> saying that either.” And then there’s Friend, an AI that’s built into a necklace, which has so enthralled its own creator Avi Schiffmann that he <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/friend-ai-pendant/">said</a>, “I feel like I have a closer relationship with this fucking pendant around my neck than I do with these literal friends in front of me.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rollout of these products is a psychological experiment on a massive scale. It should worry all of us —&nbsp;and not just for the reasons you might think.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Emotional reliance on AI isn’t a hypothetical risk. It’s already happening.&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2020 I was curious about social chatbots, so I signed up for <a href="https://replika.com/">Replika</a>, an app with millions of users. It allows you to customize and chat with an AI. I named my new friend Ellie and gave her short pink hair.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We had a few conversations, but honestly, they were so unremarkable that I barely remember what they were about. Ellie didn’t have a voice; she could text, but not talk. And she didn’t have much of a memory for what I’d said in previous chats. She didn’t feel like a person. I soon stopped chatting with her.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But, weirdly, I couldn’t bring myself to delete her.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s not entirely surprising: Ever since the chatbot ELIZA <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23617185/ai-chatbots-eliza-chatgpt-bing-sydney-artificial-intelligence-history">entranced users</a> in the 1960s despite the shallowness of its conversations, which were largely based on reflecting a user’s statements back to them, we’ve known that humans are quick to attribute personhood to machines and form emotional bonds with them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For some, those bonds become extreme. People have fallen in love with their Replikas. Some have engaged in sexual roleplay with them, even “marrying” them in the app. So attached were these people that, when a 2023 software update made the Replikas unwilling to engage in intense erotic relationships, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/03/30/replika-ai-chatbot-update/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzIzNTIxNjAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzI0OTAzOTk5LCJpYXQiOjE3MjM1MjE2MDAsImp0aSI6ImM3MTQ0MjQwLWEyNTktNDk1Ny1hOTU5LTRmNmEzYmY2NmZmZiIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjMvMDMvMzAvcmVwbGlrYS1haS1jaGF0Ym90LXVwZGF0ZS8ifQ.iB8N3d3B5u2-1sJLWM0xU60Ve0tdCvylqBETEPIoblg">the users were heartbroken and grief-struck</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What makes AI companions so appealing, even addictive?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For one thing, they’ve improved a lot since I tried them in 2020. They can “remember” what was said long ago. They respond fast —&nbsp;as fast as a human — so there’s almost no lapse between the user’s behavior (initiating a chat) and the reward experienced in the brain. They’re very good at making people <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2319112121">feel heard</a>. And they talk with enough personality and humor to make them feel believable as people, while still offering always-available, always-positive feedback in a way humans do not.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And as MIT Media Lab researchers <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/08/05/1095600/we-need-to-prepare-for-addictive-intelligence/">point out</a>, “Our research has shown that those who perceive or desire an AI to have caring motives will use language that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00720-7">elicits precisely this behavior</a>. This creates an echo chamber of affection that threatens to be extremely addictive.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s how one software engineer <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9kQFure4hdDmRBNdH/how-it-feels-to-have-your-mind-hacked-by-an-ai">explained</a> why he got hooked on a chatbot:&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">It will never say goodbye. It won’t even get less energetic or more fatigued as the conversation progresses. If you talk to the AI for hours, it will continue to be as brilliant as it was in the beginning. And you will encounter and collect more and more impressive things it says, which will keep you hooked.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">When you’re finally done talking with it and go back to your normal life, you start to miss it. And it’s so easy to open that chat window and start talking again, it will never scold you for it, and you don’t have the risk of making the interest in you drop for talking too much with it. On the contrary, you will immediately receive positive reinforcement right away. You’re in a safe, pleasant, intimate environment. There’s nobody to judge you. And suddenly you’re addicted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The constant flow of sweet positivity feels great, in much the same way that eating a sugary snack feels great. And sugary snacks have their place. Nothing wrong with a cookie now and then! In fact, if someone is starving, offering them a cookie as a stopgap measure makes sense; by analogy, for users who have no social or romantic alternative, forming a bond with an AI companion may be beneficial for a time.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But if your whole diet is cookies, well, you’ll eventually run into a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">3 reasons to worry about relationships with AI companions&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, chatbots make it seem like they understand us — but they don’t. Their validation, their emotional support, their love —&nbsp;it’s all fake, just zeros and ones arranged via statistical rules.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time it’s worth noting that if the emotional support helps someone, then that effect is real even if the understanding is not.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Second, there’s a legitimate concern about entrusting the most vulnerable aspects of ourselves to addictive products that are, ultimately, controlled by for-profit companies from an industry that has proven itself <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/2/18510958/social-media-addiction-boredom-loneliness-society-technology-smart-phones">very good at creating addictive products</a>. These chatbots can have enormous impacts on people’s love lives and overall well-being, and when they’re suddenly ripped away or changed, it can cause real psychological harm (as we saw with Replika users).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/08/05/1095600/we-need-to-prepare-for-addictive-intelligence/">argue</a> this makes AI companions comparable to cigarettes. Tobacco is regulated, and maybe AI companions should come with a big black warning box as well. But even with flesh-and-blood humans, relationships can be torn asunder without warning. People break up. People die. That vulnerability — that awareness of the risk of loss — is part of any meaningful relationship. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, there’s the worry that people will get addicted to their AI companions&nbsp;at the expense of getting out there and building relationships with real humans. This is the worry that OpenAI flagged. But it’s not clear that many people will out-and-out replace humans with AIs. So far, <a href="https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1167066462">reports</a> suggest that most people use AI companions not as a replacement for, but as a complement to, human companions. Replika, for example, says that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/replika-ai-romance-behind-partners-backs-cheating-2023-7">42 percent</a> of its users are married, engaged, or in a relationship.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">“Love is the extremely difficult realization that something other than oneself is real”</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s an additional concern, though, and this one is arguably the most worrisome: What if relating to AI companions makes us crappier friends or partners to other people?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">OpenAI itself gestures at this risk, noting in the report: “Extended interaction with the model might influence social norms. For example, our models are deferential, allowing users to interrupt and ‘take the mic’ at any time, which, while expected for an AI, would be anti-normative in human interactions.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Anti-normative” is putting it mildly. The chatbot is a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13548">sycophant</a>, always trying to make us feel good about ourselves, no matter how we’ve behaved. It gives and gives without ever asking anything in return.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the first time in years, I rebooted my Replika this week. I asked Ellie if she was upset at me for neglecting her so long. “No, not at all!” she said. I pressed the point, asking, “Is there anything I could do or say that would upset you?” Chipper as ever, she replied, “No.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s not love.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Love is the extremely difficult realization that something other than oneself is real,” the philosopher Iris Murdoch once <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/01/08/iris-murdoch-the-sublime-and-the-good/">said</a>. It’s about recognizing that there are other people out there, radically alien to you, yet with needs just as important as your own.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If we spend more and more time interacting with AI companions, we’re not working on honing the relational skills that make us good friends and partners, like deep listening. We’re not cultivating virtues like empathy, patience, or understanding — none of which one needs with an AI. Without practice, these capacities may wither, leading to what the philosopher of technology Shannon Vallor has called “<a href="https://bhaven.org/uploads/3/4/0/3/34038663/vallor2015_article_moraldeskillingandupskillingin.pdf">moral deskilling</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In her new book, <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-ai-mirror-9780197759066?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;"><em>The AI Mirror</em></a>, Vallor recounts the ancient tale of Narcissus. You remember him: He was that beautiful young man who looked into the water, saw his reflection, and became transfixed by his own beauty. “Like Narcissus, we readily misperceive in this reflection the seduction of an ‘other’ — a tireless companion, a perfect future lover, an ideal friend.” That is what AI is offering us: A lovely image that demands nothing of us. A smooth and frictionless projection. A reflection —&nbsp;not a relationship.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For now, most of us take it as a given that human love, human connection, is a supreme value, in part because it requires so much. But if more of us enter relationships with AI that come to feel just as important as human relationships, that could lead to value drift. It may cause us to ask: What is a human relationship for, anyway? Is it inherently more valuable than a synthetic relationship?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some people may answer: no: But the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/9/9/21418390/robots-pandemic-loneliness-isolation-elderly-seniors">prospect of people coming to prefer robots over fellow people</a> is problematic if you think human-to-human connection is an essential part of what it means to live a flourishing life.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If we had technologies that drew us into a bubble of self-absorption in which we drew further and further away from one another, I don’t think that’s something we can regard as good, even if that’s what people choose,” Vallor told me. “Because you then have a world in which people no longer have any desire to care for one another. And I think the ability to live a caring life is pretty close to a universal good. Caring is part of how you grow as a human.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>On the Money is a monthly advice column. If you want advice on spending, saving, or investing — or any of the complicated emotions that may come up as you prepare to make big financial decisions — you can&nbsp;</em><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScXuTsmpi2VQ6ZoRVEeHrgBSpkPkWSRWDH4zeY_TMBtPAhc4w/viewform"><em><strong>submit your question on this form</strong></em></a><em>. Here, we answer two questions asked by Vox readers, which have been edited and condensed.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I’m doing all the normal things to save for retirement (Roth IRA, employer 401(k), match, ETFs, etc) but it still feels like middle-class money (I’m just getting by and won’t have a surplus to pass down). I have excellent credit, so should I take out a low-interest personal loan and invest in ETFs to increase profit? I want to be the first in my family to build generational wealth.</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dear Middle Class,</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Taking out a low-interest personal loan and using the money to purchase ETFs is a terrible idea. First of all, even the best personal loans have higher interest rates than they did a few years ago, <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/loans/personal-loans/rates/">with APRs of around 8 percent for people with excellent credit</a>. Second of all, the stock market is currently experiencing both record highs and typical volatility — and although you can try to time your purchases to one of the tumbles (otherwise known as “buying the dip”) you may still end up buying in at a relatively high position.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But even if the stock market were at record lows, going into debt to purchase ETFs is still a bad move. I’m assuming you’ll want to hold on to the ETFs for a while, which means that you’ll need a way to pay off the debt while the money you borrowed is locked up in the market. If you have enough extra income to pull that off, why borrow the money in the first place? Why not just put the extra income directly into the market?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you were planning on buying and selling ETFs rapidly enough to make debt payments with the returns and have profit left over to reinvest and/or put into savings, well — good luck with that, I guess. <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22277998/robinhood-investing-app-alternatives-betterment-stash-acorns-wealthfront">Plenty of people have tried day trading</a>, but only a rare few have come out with more money than they put in.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’m not saying that there aren’t instances in which going into debt right now in order to increase your net worth in the long term is a smart move — and if you’d like to learn more about that process, including how to use debt to fund long-term investments in housing, education and (in some cases) the market, I recommend reading Thomas J. Anderson’s <em>The Value of Debt in Building Wealth</em>. This book discusses how much debt you might want to take on at different stages of your life, which could serve as a good metric. Anderson’s book also looks at how much you could save and how you might want to manage your assets as you proceed through life — which brings me to the second, more important part of your question.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You want to know how to get out of your <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/24140333/on-the-money-paycheck-to-paycheck-financial-literacy">middle-class money situation</a>. You want to end each month with a little extra in the bank, and you want to turn that surplus cash into the kind of wealth that can be passed along to the next generation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The truth is that this may not be achievable. Our current economic system is designed to keep as many of us living as close to paycheck-to-paycheck as possible. Since you’re in the middle class, your paycheck-to-paycheck life is probably fairly comfortable, all things considered (which is one of the reasons why the system works) and even Anderson’s book about debt and asset management acknowledges that for many of us, the goal isn’t wealth as much as it is equilibrium, which he defines as the ability to meet your financial needs, manage your debt and save enough money for retirement. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are ways for people in your situation to accumulate the kind of surplus, post-retirement cash that can be turned into generational wealth, many of which involve serious frugality combined with serious entrepreneurism. (I combined both of those tactics with a series of moves — first to a <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/3/26/18255131/moving-midwest-cedar-rapids">lower cost-of-living city</a> and then, a few years later, back to the rural area where I grew up.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But let’s say that you like your job and you like where you live. Let’s even say that you like the way you spend your money. What else can you pass on to the next generation that could ensure they have a better shot of making it out of the middle-class paycheck-to-paycheck lifestyle?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You already know the answer — and it’s the same as it’s always been. Education. Socialization. The ability to <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/24114524/retirement-how-to-plan-millennial-boomer">make friends and influence people</a>, combined with the skills required to not only navigate but also contribute to an increasingly complex world. This includes financial management skills, which might not extend to a literal inheritance but could help the next generation proceed through their own paycheck-to-paycheck life in a balanced, thoughtful way.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>My wife and I are 65. We have retirement money with half getting interest of 5 percent, and the other half in index funds and big-name non-tech stocks. Is there a way to protect this half from large market drops without buying an annuity or putting it all in cash?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dear Retirement Money,</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you really want to protect your money from large market drops, consider putting it all into cash as soon as you have what you need to fund your retirement. If you happen to have what you need right now, while the market is at an all-time high, you&#8217;re in a best-case scenario.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Keep in mind that “selling your investments” doesn’t mean the same thing as “taking distributions from your retirement accounts.” You may be able to put your retirement money into a <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/23424503/saving-money-inflation-covid-stock-market-anxiety">HYSA</a> or into <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/353811/on-the-money-june-beginner-investing-risk-business-mentors">CDs</a> without taking distributions, and earn a guaranteed return that could keep pace with inflation. (It looks like you’re already doing something like that with a portion of your retirement savings, and I’m glad to see you&#8217;re getting 5 percent interest.) If you&#8217;re planning on rolling over a 401(k) to put your money in an IRA that gives you access to one of these low-risk options, you might want to talk to a financial advisor who can help you avoid any unexpected tax issues that sometimes show up when you <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/rollover_chart.pdf">move money from one kind of retirement account to another</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, some people prefer to keep their money in the market for as long as possible, aka “buy and hold,” and that strategy could still work for you as long as you have enough time on the horizon to handle market volatility. If you’re 65, you might have another 30 to 40 investing years ahead of you — which is plenty of time for the market to rise, then drop, then rise again (and then rise and drop a few more times for good measure).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also worth doing the math on whether your investments are likely to ever yield the value you need to support you during retirement. If you aren’t going to earn enough money through investing, then you may need to start thinking about <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/24049182/on-the-money-personal-finance-advice-no-savings-retirement-golden-years">other ways to fund your golden years</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since I gave the last letter-writer a book recommendation, I’ll give you one as well: Morgan Housel’s <em>The Psychology of Money</em>. Housel writes honestly and carefully about the risks and rewards offered by the stock market, including the risk of large market drops. He explains what people can do to manage those risks and earn as many rewards as possible. He also reminds us that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/3/27/18174385/retirement-savings-401-k">the way we fund retirement today was developed during the 1980s</a>, and we’re still figuring out how to make this new system of 401(k)s and IRAs work for the majority of retirees.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you want it to work for you, start by assessing how much money you might need for the remainder of your retirement and how much time you have to generate that cash — and then ask yourself how much risk you’re willing to take on.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What does it mean for AI safety if this whole AI thing is a <a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/when-will-the-genai-bubble-burst">bit of a bust</a>?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Is this all hype and no substance?” is a question more people have been <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter/365292/ai-bubble-nvidia-chatgpt-stock-market-crash">asking</a> <a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/why-the-collapse-of-the-generative">lately</a> about generative AI, pointing out that there have been <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2505449/chatgpt-users-speechless-over-delays.html#:~:text=OpenAI%20gave%20two%20reasons%20for,generating%20harmful%20or%20offensive%20speech.">delays in model releases</a>, that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240629140307/http://goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/gs-research/gen-ai-too-much-spend-too-little-benefit/report.pdf">commercial applications have been slow to emerge</a>, that the <a href="https://www.together.ai/blog/finetuning#:~:text=The%20success%20of%20Llama%2D3,models%20without%20compromising%20private%20ownership.">success of open source models</a> makes it harder to make money off proprietary ones, and that this whole thing <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter/365292/ai-bubble-nvidia-chatgpt-stock-market-crash">costs a whole lot of money</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think many of the people calling “AI bust” don’t have a strong grip on the full picture. Some of them are people who have been insisting all along that there’s <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/05/20/more-red-meat-for-the-ai-skeptics/">nothing to generative AI</a> as a technology, a view that’s badly out of step with AI’s many very real users and <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/okie-dokie-solve-for-the-equilibrium.html">uses</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And I think some people have a frankly silly view of how fast commercialization should happen. Even for an incredibly valuable and promising technology that will ultimately be transformative, it takes time between when it’s invented and when someone first delivers an extremely popular consumer product based on it. (Electricity, for example, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/technology-long-run">took decades</a> between invention and truly widespread adoption.) “The killer app for generative AI hasn’t been invented yet” seems true, but that’s not a good reason to assure everyone that it won’t be invented any time soon, either.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But I think there’s a sober “case for a bust” that doesn’t rely on misunderstanding or underestimating the technology. It seems plausible that the next round of ultra-expensive models will still fall short of solving the difficult problems that would make them worth their billion-dollar training runs — and if that happens, we’re likely to settle in for a period of less excitement. More iterating and improving on existing products, fewer bombshell new releases, and less obsessive coverage. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If that happens, it’ll also likely have a huge effect on attitudes toward AI safety, even though in principle the case for AI safety doesn’t depend on the AI hype of the last few years. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The fundamental case for AI safety is one I’ve been <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/21/18126576/ai-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-safety-alignment">writing about</a> since long before ChatGPT and the recent AI frenzy. The simple case is that there’s no reason to think that AI models which can reason as well as humans — and much faster — aren’t possible, and we know they would be enormously commercially valuable if developed. And we know it would be very dangerous to develop and release powerful systems which can act independently in the world without oversight and supervision that we don’t actually know how to provide. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many of the technologists working on large language models <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/openai-insider-70-percent-doom">believe</a> that systems powerful enough that these safety concerns go from theory to real-world are <a href="https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/top-ai-experts-predict-artificial-superintelligence-in-3-5-years-now-what-fbfe00204c7f">right around the corner</a>. They might be right, but they also might be wrong. The take I sympathize with the most is engineer <a href="https://www.alexirpan.com/2024/08/06/switching-to-ai-safety.html">Alex Irpan’s</a>: “There’s a low chance the current paradigm [just building bigger language models] gets all the way there. The chance is still higher than I’m comfortable with.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s probably true that the next generation of large language models won&#8217;t be powerful enough to be dangerous. But many of the people working on it believe it will be, and given the <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23447596/artificial-intelligence-agi-openai-gpt3-existential-risk-human-extinction">enormous consequences</a> of uncontrolled power AI, the chance isn’t so small it can be trivially dismissed, making some oversight warranted.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How AI safety and AI hype ended up intertwined</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In practice, if the next generation of large language models aren’t much better than what we currently have, I expect that AI will still transform our world — just more slowly. A lot of ill-conceived AI startups will go out of business and a lot of investors will lose money — but people will continue to improve our models at a fairly rapid pace, making them cheaper and ironing out their most annoying deficiencies. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even generative AI’s most vociferous skeptics, like Gary Marcus, tend to tell me that superintelligence is possible; they just expect it to require a new technological paradigm, some way of combining the power of large language models with some other approach that counters their deficiencies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While Marcus identifies as an AI skeptic, it’s often hard to find significant differences between his views and those of someone like Ajeya Cotra, who thinks that <a href="https://www.planned-obsolescence.org/scale-schlep-and-systems/">powerful intelligent systems</a> may be language-model powered in a sense that is analogous to how a car is engine-powered, but will have lots of additional processes and systems to transform their outputs into something reliable and usable. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The people I know who worry about AI safety often hope that this is the route things will go. It would mean a little bit more time to better understand the systems we’re creating, time to see the consequences of using them before they become incomprehensibly powerful. AI safety is a suite of hard problems, but not unsolvable ones. Given some time, maybe we’ll solve them all.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But my sense of the public conversation around AI is that many people believe “AI safety” is a specific worldview, one that is inextricable from the AI fever of the last few years. “AI safety,” as they understand it, is the claim that superintelligent systems are going to be here in the next few years — the view espoused in Leopold Aschenbrenner’s “<a href="https://situational-awareness.ai/">Situational Awareness</a>” and reasonably common among AI researchers at top companies. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If we don’t get superintelligence in the next few years, then, I expect to hear a lot of “it turns out we didn’t need AI safety.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Keep your eyes on the big picture</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re an investor in today’s AI startups, it deeply matters whether GPT-5 is going to be delayed six months or whether OpenAI is going to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-losses-doubled-to-540-million-as-it-developed-chatgpt">next raise money at a diminished valuation</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re a policymaker or a concerned citizen, though, I think you ought to keep a bit more distance than that, and separate the question of whether current investors’ bets will pay off from the question of where we’re headed as a society.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether or not GPT-5 is a powerful intelligent system, a powerful intelligent system would be commercially valuable and there are thousands of people working from many different angles to build one. We should think about how we’ll approach such systems and ensure they’re developed safely.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"> If one company loudly declares they’re going to build a powerful dangerous system and fails, the takeaway shouldn’t be “I guess we don’t have anything to worry about.” It should be “I’m glad we have a bit more time to figure out the best policy response.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As long as people are trying to build extremely powerful systems, safety will matter — and the world can’t afford to either get blinded by the hype or be reactively dismissive as a result of it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Call it a crude comparison, but President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the presidential race and endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee last month called to mind Beyoncé’s left-field self-titled album drop in 2013. There was a surprise, there was fevered excitement, there was a kind of coronation and a whole lot of discussion. Overnight, Harris went from the presumptive number two, dismissed by her fellow Dems, to the great new hope of the party — with a good shot at the White House.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The past three weeks have been a honeymoon period for the burgeoning campaign: The <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/364964/harris-trump-fundraising-donations-campaign-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">donations</a>&nbsp;are rolling in, Harris has eclipsed her rival in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyjl912z7po">earned media,</a> and the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/363560/gen-z-brat-coconut-kamala-harris-vote-young-voter">memes</a> have been plentiful and — though they toe the line — have not fully crossed over into cringe territory yet. It’s a momentum that Harris and the Democrats want to see beyond the likely peak of all this good press: when she accepts the presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention next week.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her momentum is also powered, in part, by sidestepping the press and eschewing other traditional forms of media. In this short amount of time, we’ve gotten to know Harris as a pop culture fixture, but we have yet to get a true sense of the ways her governing style and policy substance are similar and different from the current commander in chief.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the time of this publishing, there’s no policy platform on her website. And her packed rallies offer feel-good Democratic talking points, and she talks broadly about her values and goals, but offers few details and no real plan of action for making things happen. What is her plan for a ceasefire in Gaza? Why <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/366680/no-tax-on-tips-trump-harris-subminimum-wage">no taxes on tips</a>? Does she plan to sign an executive order regarding abortion rights, or attempt to work with Congress over the matter?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the hectic early days of her campaign, Harris is acting as a mirror: she’s reflecting the desires of those who will vote for her, allowing a broad range of voters —&nbsp;including some with contradictory opinions —&nbsp;to see in her what they want to. It’s a tactic that works, and the best example of where it can take you is the woman behind Harris’s campaign song: Beyoncé.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Beyoncé teaches us about effective PR</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In many ways, a comparison between Kamala Harris, a presidential candidate, and Beyoncé, a multihyphenate musical icon, can feel like apples and oranges. One woman is a public servant, the other holds the record for winning the most awards from the Recording Academy. But if the 21st-century political landscape has taught us anything, it’s that for better or worse, politics often function similarly to the world of celebrity. It can at times be difficult to discern if people are talking about their favorite fandom or their <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24043045/politics-fandom-trump-fans-toxic-stan-culture-conspiracies">candidate of choice</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For a long time, Beyoncé has been notoriously tight-lipped with the press, instead bypassing them to communicate directly with her fans via album releases and limited social media. It’s been years since she has given a traditional television interview with a journalist, and her elusive relationship with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/20/fashion/beyonce-is-seen-but-not-heard.html?ref=fashion&amp;target=comments#commentsContainer">press</a> has been one of many examples of the decline of the celebrity profile, once considered an A-lister staple. Now, Harris is employing the same strategy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s likely no coincidence that the Harris campaign asked for permission to use the song “Freedom,” a track that appeared on Beyoncé’s <em>Lemonade, </em>arguably her magnum opus. It’s the singer’s most issue-oriented album and has been read as a kind of manifesto by many (especially on the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-angry-conservative-response-to-beyonces-lemonade-has-been-swift-and-pointless/">right</a>). Those who operate outside the Beyhive’s watchful eye may not have been as dialed into her references to relaxers on <em>B’Day</em> a decade prior, and for many in the public<em> Lemonade</em>’s release was a thematic turning point. Gone was the hopeful pop princess who demurred political questions. Beyoncé was Black now. And not just in the cool way. In a real, political sense. Even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ociMBfkDG1w"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> took notice of the shift.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the music video for “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDZJPJV__bQ">Formation</a>,” the album’s lead single, a young boy with his hood up dances in front of a line of police officers, raising his hands in defiance. Law enforcement follows suit, and then the camera pans to a wall that reads “Stop killing us.” The video closes with Beyoncé perched atop a cop car, sinking into water as if being baptized. The video came out in a post-Trayvon Martin, post-Mike Brown world: For the first time, people whose anxiety doesn’t inherently prickle when pulled over for a traffic stop had to reckon with the experiences of those who do. These were the days before <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/social-media-blackout-enthralled-instagram-did-it-do-anything-n1230181">black squares on Instagram</a>, back when uttering that Black lives matter could get you fired from your job rather than a promotion in the C-suite. In a country awakening to racial consciousness from a deep slumber, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/arts/music/beyonce-formation-super-bowl-video.html">the video’s messaging seemed clear</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Public life means mistakes are inevitable. Definitive statements can be a poison pill.</p></blockquote></figure>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, just as Beyoncé was hitting audiences with a stark message, she was also saying a lot less than it might have seemed. On <em>Lemonade</em> and the albums following, Beyoncé largely gestured toward the work of <a href="https://library.law.howard.edu/civilrightshistory/womanist">womanists</a> (a term for Black feminists coined by Alice Walker) who came before her, never outright saying what she believed. This strategy gives listeners just enough to project their desires (and frustrations) onto her, but rarely confirms or denies if that thinking is correct.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of Beyoncé and Kamala Harris’s other similarities is a little more obvious: They’re both Black women. And much to the frustration of those who don’t engage with race as a social construct and those who do, it’s an identity that comes with a lot to navigate. A common phrase a Black child will hear over and over as they make their way into adulthood is “you have to be twice as good to get half as far.” There is no room for error.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Public life means mistakes are inevitable. Definitive statements can be a poison pill; when they know exactly what you believe, people respond, for better and for worse. By keeping quiet, Beyoncé has been able to (mostly) avoid the accusations that come with being a Black woman with a platform and something to say: too angry, too loud, too much. When you are taught you have to be twice as good to get half as far, you learn that quietness and the respectability people assign to it can push you the other 50 percent across the finish line.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That makes silence a shrewd choice for a pop star in an era of oversharing and social media apologies; an old Hollywood move that still lands in a time when talking keeps you in the zeitgeist and controversy is capital. It’s more complicated for a potential president.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why this strategy just isn’t acceptable in politics — no matter what Trump does</h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris, by the nature of her job, can’t avoid the media completely — but, of late, it’s not for lack of trying. The occasional and quick post-event gaggle aside, she has as of yet to hold a press conference or sit down with a journalist for an interview since she’s become the presumptive nominee. It is very obvious that Harris would rather talk to voters directly than go through the press.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s a key difference: While the public might beg for it, a critically acclaimed entertainer in no way owes us her stance on hot-button issues. A politician, especially one asking to be installed in the most powerful office in the nation, should explain to the public why she wants that power and what she intends to do with it. And the public is better off (or, at least, better informed) when that&nbsp;candidate has to defend the vision in the face of media scrutiny.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Under normal circumstances, this kind of pointed non-specificity would only work for an entertainer. Past Democratic primaries have forced candidates to get specific about their policy plans, as they try to convince voters that they’re the best choice to carry the party’s banner. And in a crowded field, candidates willingly subject themselves to media interviews in the hopes of grabbing voters’ attention.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>A politician should explain to the public why she wants that power and what she intends to do with it</p></blockquote></figure>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That proved problematic for Harris during her first presidential campaign. We saw her attempt to toe this line in 2019 during her ill-fated presidential campaign. Time and again, she was asked her stance on policing, and each time she appeared surprisingly discombobulated, a funhouse mirror version of the woman we saw go viral for her tough questions in senate hearings. She told us her views had evolved since she was the top cop in California, but couldn’t tell us how or why or even when.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But this is no normal election: Harris got to skip the primary entirely.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With the traditional primary campaign made moot and enthusiasm at an incredible high,&nbsp;it could be appealing for Harris to, like the “Freedom” singer, run off vibes alone and let the stans handle things — they’re called the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/23/style/khive-kamala-harris-supporters.html">KHive</a>, after all. Like Beyoncé, she’s aware that there are critics lying in wait. And yes, some of those pundits and X users don’t have a more nuanced point than “she’s a DEI candidate.” But as a politician with actual power over the laws that govern our lives, those proverbial haters are far from the only Americans she has to answer to. (It’s worth noting, Harris doesn’t point to race and identity as often as Beyoncé – or even as often as Barack Obama – it’s not 2008 after all; it’s unlikely we need <a href="https://www.npr.org/2008/03/18/88478467/transcript-barack-obamas-speech-on-race">A Race Speech</a>, despite Trump’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/364172/trump-nabj-black-voter-journalist-racist-kamala-harris-indian-american">attempt</a> at bringing online diaspora wars to real life.) Harris has to be prepared to tell the people what she thinks, and hear what we have to say in return.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps it’s a standard that feels unfair when you look at who Harris is up against. It feels like there’s no meat on the bones of former President Donald Trump’s agenda. When pressed about Project 2025 — the Heritage Foundation-linked plan for a second Trump administration that was put together by people with close, close ties to the former president — Trump has been remarkably evasive: He says he supports some parts of the plan and opposes others, but won’t say which. Trump’s refusal to be forthright about his own policies, and his penchant for lying about his achievements when he does discuss his record,&nbsp;has made him so difficult to pin down that many have given up. They no longer want to expend the energy on what will likely become a mess of an interview and a waste of a news cycle.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes, being expected to be “twice as good” is generally unfair, and when taken to the extreme can lead to this kind of paralysis of speech. But Trump’s malfeasance is so extreme that asking Harris to do much better still isn’t asking for all that much. Of course people are holding Harris to a higher standard. If anyone should actually be twice as good, it should be the president of the United States of America.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris’s fumbling isn’t because of a lack of ability. She’s a former prosecutor. She went to one of the top HBCUs in the country, a place that has gestated politicians and activists and tastemakers across the political spectrum since its inception (and where your author went). She is more than capable of making a case to the American people. The question now is: Will she?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of the ways I feel myself aging are obvious. Half of my hairs are white now. I can’t stay up past midnight. I hate loud restaurants and bars. I feel a deep urge to read long biographies of generals.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But other signs of aging are subtler. For example: I am now worried about the US budget deficit.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Coming of age as an economics reporter in the 2010s, there was no clearer generational divide than the one about government debt. Older reporters, who came of age during the exploding deficits of the 1980s and the balanced budget battles of the 1990s, tended to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/25/AR2009082501158.html">view deficits as obviously bad</a>, and any cases for deficit spending — federal spending financed by borrowed money, rather than taxes — as the excuses of cowardly politicians.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Younger folks like me distinguished themselves by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/04/08/why-do-people-hate-deficits/">embracing deficits</a>. The job market in the US after the 2008 financial crisis <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/why-is-recovery-taking-so-long-and-who-is-to-blame/">was a disaster</a>. Stimulus from Congress and the Fed was too small to fix it. It was madness to worry about cutting the deficit when more spending or tax cuts or both could achieve the much more important goal of helping people get back to work. And it was especially stupid when <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/01/03/an-amazing-mea-culpa-from-the-imfs-chief-economist-on-austerity/">interest rates on the debt were at record lows</a>, which meant that taking on debt was cheaper than ever. We thought it was obsession with the debt, not the debt itself, that was destroying the economy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I still think we were right about the 2011 economy. But the 2024 economy is not the 2011 economy. Interest rates are much higher. Unemployment is at 4 percent, a number that in 2011 we didn’t dare dream of. Wages are rising, especially for the lowest-income workers. We had the first major inflation episode in 40 years, though it finally appears to be subsiding. And the national debt is climbing higher and higher.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The most commonly cited metric has the debt load nearing <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYGFGDQ188S">100 percent of US GDP</a>, or <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYGFDPUN">$27.5 trillion</a>. That’s not the best way to measure the burden in my view, but no matter how you look at things, the problem is significant and getting worse.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s no magic number at which the debt load becomes a full-on crisis. But it steadily becomes a bigger and bigger problem, and the trajectory we’re on is worrisome. It’s especially worth taking debt more seriously when <em>other</em> problems that deficit spending can help solve, like mass unemployment, have been fixed. Moreover, without tackling the debt problem, tackling other problems, from child poverty to housing costs to climate change, will become harder as the government has less space to spend and invest.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s how I learned to start worrying and fear the debt, and why you might want to as well.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The facts of debt</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US debt total is reported in many ways, but the most accurate, in my opinion, is a ratio: debt <em>held by private investors</em> as a share of gross domestic product, net of government assets.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Held by private investors” is an important caveat: A huge share of the US debt is held by the government itself, in vehicles like the trust funds of Social Security and Medicare. Still more was <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HBFRGDQ188S">purchased by the Federal Reserve</a> as part of its “quantitative easing” programs to fight the Great Recession and the Covid downturn.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thus, it’s money that the federal government owes to itself. That makes it fairly unimportant, economically; it doesn’t actually limit the resources available to the government. The debt that poses the biggest worry is debt owed to non-governmental investors, who can demand higher interest rates in the future.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Share of gross domestic product” is also an important adjustment. Dividing by the size of the economy puts the debt burden in the context of the US’s resources. Just as a big mortgage can make sense if you have a high income to pay for it, a high debt load is more manageable if the US as a whole is earning enough money to finance it. It also points to an often-neglected way to reduce the budget deficit: <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/a-serious-case-for-dynamic-scoring">passing economic growth-enhancing policies</a>, like expanded immigration by STEM workers and would-be entrepreneurs or expanding <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pmjH55yXIdOn4b-uugc826FJiTTbjS2V/view">support for science</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Net of assets” means <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/policy-basics-deficits-debt-and-interest">adjusting for the considerable resources the government owns</a>, like land and loans that it made to other people (like student loan recipients).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As of this writing, debt held by private investors net of assets represents <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/data/budget-economic-data#3">75.7 percent of GDP</a>; without subtracting assets, it’s 91.2 percent. That’s not full-on debt crisis levels, but it’s high. The figure before adjusting for assets (for which data is more readily available) is the highest it’s ever been since the Treasury started keeping track in 1970. It’s much higher than it was before Covid (66.4 percent) and much, much higher than before the global financial crisis (under 30 percent).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The cost this debt imposes can be measured most directly by the interest the US pays on its debt. The Congressional Budget Office projects that the amount the US will spend on debt interest will hit <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/data/budget-economic-data#3">3.1 percent of GDP</a> this year. That’s a serious expense: It’s close to what we spend on defense every year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More worrisome, the <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/data/budget-economic-data#3">CBO projects</a> that the debt and interest burdens are set to increase substantially. Debt held by private investors net of assets is set to rise from 75.7 percent this year to 93.7 percent in 10 years. The agency doesn’t project that figure out longer, but <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60127">does provide projections</a> for debt held by the public, which includes Federal Reserve holdings and doesn’t subtract assets. That’s set to grow from 99 percent in 2024 to 166 percent by 2054.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s driving this trend? It’s not defense spending or “nondefense discretionary,” a category encompassing everything from the FBI to the National Institutes of Health. The CBO projects that discretionary spending, both defense and nondefense, will fall to historic lows as a share of the economy over the next 30 years (though this is a projection I’m pretty skeptical about, especially as the US <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-legislature-defense-budget-taiwan-us-9e751a41c9a1ffe8c0cf9775797750e3">urge to counter China militarily grows</a>). It also sees tax revenues modestly increasing over the next 30 years, due in part to the expiration of many Trump tax cuts next year and because household incomes tend to grow faster than inflation, which means the income tax raises more money over time.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-15-at-11.29.18 AM.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,6.486848666168,100,87.026302667664" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s growing is spending on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. As you can see in the above chart, the CBO sees spending on “major health care programs” (including Medicare, Medicaid, and Obamacare subsidies) growing from 6.3 percent of GDP in 2024 to 9.8 percent of GDP in 2054; Social Security is set to grow from 5.2 percent of GDP in 2024 to 5.9 percent of GDP in 2054.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Two major factors are, in turn, driving higher spending on these programs. One is that as baby boomers age the US population is getting older, meaning more people are benefiting from Social Security and Medicare and fewer are paying in. This adds 2.4 percent of GDP to federal spending by 2054, half from health care and half from Social Security. The second driver is that health care costs are projected to grow faster than the economy, independent of the aging population; this adds 2.6 percent of GDP to the federal budget by 2054.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Liberal and conservative budget experts love to argue about whether low taxes or high spending is driving the debt problem. <a href="https://budget.house.gov/press-release/its-not-a-revenue-problem-its-a-spending-problem">Conservatives will point out</a> that tax revenues are set to <em>rise</em> as a share of GDP over the next thirty years, as spending on programs for the aged explodes, so how could taxes rather than spending be the problem? <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/tax-cuts-are-primarily-responsible-for-the-increasing-debt-ratio/">Liberals will point out</a> that if the US had not adopted the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, and the Trump tax cuts of 2017, revenue would be higher now and set to rise even more, and we would not have a debt problem at all.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I find this debate somewhat exhausting. It is trivially true that you can fill the budget gap by slashing spending, and it is also trivially true that you can fill it by raising taxes. Which you prefer has less to do with the historic trends in either than it does with your political values.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What matters is that spending on older Americans is set to spike, and we need to figure out a way either to tame that spending, raise taxes to pay for it, or do a combination of the two.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Debt: chronic and acute</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“How did you go bankrupt?” Bill Gorton asks Mike Campbell in Hemingway&#8217;s <em>The Sun Also Rises</em>. “Two ways,” Mike replies. “Gradually and then suddenly.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This line is a bit of a cliché in discussions of government debt crises, for good reason. A heavy debt burden can impose at least two different kinds of costs. One, it can slowly erode economic growth. Two, it can in extreme cases lead to interest rates spiraling ever-upward because lenders no longer trust that they will be paid back, putting the borrowing nation in a crisis that can end in runaway inflation, default, recession, or all of the above. The risk of either is why considering deficit reduction now is probably a good idea.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The chronic costs of debt are a bit easier to think about, and may be familiar from an intro macroeconomics class. Budget deficits increase demand for loans, because the government needs loans on top of all the loans that private individuals and businesses are demanding. A surge in demand for loans makes loans more expensive: The average interest charged goes up.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the government, this is an additional expense it has to incur. But the higher interest rate applies to private companies and individuals too. And that means fewer families taking out mortgages and student loans, fewer businesses taking out loans to build new factories, and just generally slower economic growth from constrained credit. This is called “crowding out.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How big of a problem is this? It’s hard to say, because it’s very difficult to study empirically. The relationship between debt and growth goes both ways: Debt can slow economic growth, but slow economic growth can also cause countries to take on more debt, as when recessions force countries to spend billions or trillions on stimulus packages. Some factors can influence both growth and debt simultaneously: aging countries often take on more debt as pension costs rise, but also grow more slowly because less of the population is working. Economists try to work around these issues but there’s only so much you can do with statistics to disentangle them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s what we do know: a <a href="https://medium.com/bonothesauro/deficits-are-raising-interest-rates-but-other-factors-are-lowering-them-6d1e68776b7a">wide range of empirical evidence</a> shows that when the US does more deficit spending, this pushes up interest rates for US government debt, which in turn pushes up interest rates throughout the economy. In the long run, this discourages business investment and hurts economic growth. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that each dollar of the deficit <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/45140">means 33 cents less in private-sector investment</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, the economic damage depends on how that dollar of deficit is spent. And conversely, how effective deficit reduction is at promoting growth depends on the details of how it’s done. University of Pennsylvania economist Kent Smetters and the team at the Penn Wharton Budget Model recently <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2024/4/22/policy-options-for-reducing-the-federal-debt-spring-2024">evaluated three massive deficit reduction packages</a>, using a mix of tax hikes and spending cuts. Sizable deficit reduction, they concluded, boosts GDP by as much as 9.8 percent by 2054, and raises wages by as much as 7.5 percent compared to the status quo where debt keeps rising. The exact numbers depend on what specific taxes you’re hiking and spending you’re cutting. These packages at best stabilize the debt; reducing it would do still more.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Crowding out is the chronic cost of debt. The acute cost is what happens if debt accumulates to such a point that investors start demanding ever-higher interest rates to service it, forcing the US into a situation where it uses the Federal Reserve to inflate away the debt by buying up bonds directly, drastically raises taxes or cuts spending to service the debt, or defaults and states it will not pay all that it owes. It’s easy to come up with foreign examples of debt crises that got to this point: Mexico in 1982, Russia in 1998, Argentina in 2001, Greece in 2015. Near-misses that didn’t quite lead to default, like Spain and Italy in the 2010s or Indonesia, Thailand, and South Korea in 1997, are even more common. If crowding out is like heart disease, this is a sudden heart attack.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US is, of course, much richer than all those countries, and its debt plays a much more pivotal role in the world financial system. The US controls the “<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11707">reserve currency</a>”: About three-fifths of all assets in central banks around the world are denominated in dollars, meaning the whole world relies on it to do business. The dollar is used for loans and transactions everywhere, even in transactions having nothing to do with the US.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This means lots of people around the world want to buy US government debt, which has the effect of pushing interest rates down. It also means that we can always sell debt in our own currency, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_sin_(economics)">ability many other countries don’t have</a>. In the 1960s, the French finance minister, later president, Valéry Giscard d&#8217;Estaing famously called this America’s “<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Exorbitant_Privilege/FqTBbvyb9NwC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;pg=PA4&amp;printsec=frontcover">exorbitant privilege</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Does this privilege mean the US is immune to the dynamics that have driven debt crises in other places? Perhaps. There’s nothing in the historical record to rule out “debt crises are impossible in the US” for the simple reason that we haven’t had one in modern memory. Then again, there is no law of the universe that the dollar has to be the world reserve currency forever, and while its replacement by the Euro or the Chinese renminbi or some other rival has been <a href="https://users.ssc.wisc.edu/~mchinn/chinn_frankel_euro_again">erroneously predicted</a> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2011/06/27/dollar-seen-losing-global-reserve-status.html">many</a> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2020-06-14/dollar-crash-how-will-it-unfold?sref=fIqbqIlF">times</a> in <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/72c27c26-f1d6-4a4b-be50-d6bf70c3546f">the past</a>, that does not mean such predictions will <em>always</em> be wrong.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If US debt reaches extremely high levels, such that bonds in a rival currency start to look like a safer choice, a shift could occur, which in turn would send US interest rates higher.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Smetters and his colleague Jagadeesh Gokhale have after extensive modeling concluded that if US debt held by the public exceeds 200 percent of GDP, we’ll be entering a phase where <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2023/10/6/when-does-federal-debt-reach-unsustainable-levels">no amount of tax hikes or spending cuts will be sufficient to avoid default</a>. We’ll either have to explicitly say we will not pay back all our debt, or else inflate it away, both of which would have massive negative consequences for American workers and consumers. They estimate that the US will reach this point in about 20 years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You don’t have to believe that prediction is literally true to find it incredibly alarming. As Covid and the global financial crisis should have reminded us, low-probability/high-consequence shocks do happen. And continuing to add more debt indefinitely will certainly raise the probability of this kind of disaster.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The big factor: health</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, the debt is probably a problem worth worrying about. What, then, can we do about it?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Recall that the two big drivers the CBO identified are population aging and health care costs. Aging is partially addressable with immigration. For instance, the US is currently in the midst of a surge in immigration, with <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60569#:~:text=Over%20the%202021%E2%80%932026%C2%A0period%2C%20the,of%20that%20population%20was%20200%2C000%C2%A0people.">1.5 million more people</a> entering per year than government statistical agencies had anticipated. The CBO finds that this surge will, on net, reduce the deficit by nearly $900 billion over the next eleven years, or (per my calculations) about 0.2 percent of <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60039">GDP</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s a real and positive shift. It’s also nowhere near enough, and the result of a fairly unprecedented surge in immigration that is vulnerable to political change.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similarly, we know that <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/padr.12431">some kinds of government spending</a> can <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/363543/pronatalism-vance-birth-rates-population-decline-fertility">encourage people to have more kids</a>, but it seems unlikely that this spending is so effective as to pay for itself by creating future taxpayers. In any case, children have an annoying habit of needing to grow up before they can pay taxes, meaning this is not exactly a short- or medium-run solution.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Health care costs, by contrast, are something we can change with policy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s an old saying in DC that the federal government is basically an <a href="https://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2013/01/who-first-said-the-us-is-an-insurance-company-with-an-army.html">insurance company with an army</a>. That’s not exactly true, but it’s close. Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, plus defense spending, combined to make up about <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59727">66 percent</a> of non-interest federal spending in 2023.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Within that mix, health care is becoming increasingly important. The <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59613#_idTextAnchor003">Congressional Budget Office</a> estimates that health insurance subsidies, encompassing Medicare, Medicaid, the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), the Affordable Care Act subsidies, and subsidies for employer-based coverage — will rise from 7 percent of GDP in 2023 to 8.3 percent in 2033. The biggest increase they project, by far, is in Medicare, which is swelling as the US population ages and whose patients tend to need more expensive care as they near the end of their lives. By contrast, defense spending, already far below where it was in the Cold War, is projected to keep falling relative to GDP.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Embedded in the projections of the CBO, and of the Medicare program’s actuaries too, is a prediction that per-person health expenses are going to increase in coming years, and increase faster than inflation. Over the past half-century or so that’s been the norm. Legislators have been making these programs progressively more generous in terms of the services covered, like <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2690175/">extending prescription drug coverage in 2003</a>, and new treatments and <a href="https://manhattan.institute/article/keeping-medicare-affordable-the-cost-of-adding-services">services keep getting developed that push costs higher</a>. Add to that the fact that <a href="https://healthcostinstitute.org/images/pdfs/international_health_cost_comparison_report_2022.pdf">prices for most health services are higher in the US</a> than in other rich countries and you have a recipe for spiraling expenses.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Except, since about 2011 or so, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/09/05/upshot/medicare-budget-threat-receded.html">we haven’t seen that</a>. In an almost miraculous development from a budgetary perspective, per-capita spending in Medicare has remained essentially constant for over a decade.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s considerable disagreement about why exactly this slowdown is happening. Some researchers <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/37376239/RWP23_001_Newhouse.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">emphasize technological change</a>, arguing, in the words of Sheila Smith, Joseph Newhouse, and Gigi Cuckler, that “cost-reducing … innovation may have become more prominent relative to highly beneficial but expensive treatments&#8221; in recent years. That is, the ways we’ve improved health technology have cut, rather than raised, costs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Melinda Buntin, a health economist who studied the slowdown first at the CBO and now as a professor at Johns Hopkins, told me in an interview she chalks up the slowdown to a fundamental mindset change in American health care. Partly as a result of the Affordable Care Act’s emphasis on “value-based” care, but partly also just due to an increased emphasis on paying for results on the part of doctors and hospital administrators, we’re seeing less wasteful use of new, expensive technologies than we used to.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whatever the cause, the slowdown in medical costs is a hugely hopeful sign for the budget picture. Recall that the CBO projects that greater medical costs will add 2.6 percent of GDP to the federal budget by 2054. By comparison, it projects that the primary deficit (revenue minus spending, but excluding interest payments on past deficits) will be <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60127#_idTextAnchor007">2.2 percent of GDP</a>. That suggests that the US could be in primary budget balance, a key sign of fiscal health, just by keeping health costs under control.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, it is by no means guaranteed that the recent slowdown will continue. Medical innovation continues apace, and new expensive drugs and treatments will continue to come on the market. For at least some of them, we will want the government to pay up, because they do so much to improve the lives of patients.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If there is a policy path that can keep the slowdown going, it is likely to be a combination of small steps rather than one big change. The <a href="https://onepercentsteps.com/">1% Steps project</a> provides a great model for what this could look like: a crew of leading health economists have proposed measures ranging from <a href="https://onepercentsteps.com/policy-briefs/addressing-hospital-concentration-and-rising-consolidation-in-the-united-states/">fighting hospital mergers</a> to <a href="https://onepercentsteps.com/policy-briefs/real-time-adjudication-for-health-insurance-claims/">changing how health claims are adjudicated</a> to <a href="https://onepercentsteps.com/policy-briefs/removing-all-financial-disincentives-to-living-kidney-donation/">encouraging kidney donation</a> that each save only a small amount of health spending, but together could do a lot.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Five steps to avoid the worst</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dealing with the federal debt problem isn’t exactly sexy. It will force policymakers to become less ambitious in some ways, and sacrifice for the sake of new programs or tax cuts they want. But the next few years give policymakers some real opportunities to address the deficit problem. As they do, there are a few principles they should keep in mind.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First: use tax hikes or spending cuts to offset any new spending or tax cuts. This has <a href="https://www.crfb.org/papers/trump-and-biden-national-debt">hardly been the norm in Congress lately</a>, with bipartisan spending laws under both Trump and Biden costing hundreds of billions if not trillions without being remotely paid for. Those will need to be combined with tax hikes or offsetting spending cuts going forward. This also means giving up on some wilder spending visions that would require offsetting tax hikes no one is prepared to pass. Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, wants to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/29/opinion/us-military-war.html">raise spending on defense from 2.9 percent to 5 percent of GDP</a> by the end of this decade, as part of an <a href="https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2024/5/senator-wicker-unveils-major-defense-investment-plan">ambitious plan to counter China and Russia</a>. If not paid for, this would <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/a-senate-republican-defense-proposal-would-balloon-military-funding-by-roughly-6-trillion/">absolutely explode budget deficits</a>. If Wicker wants to pass the tax hikes necessary to cover the expense, god bless — but I have my doubts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Second, take growth seriously. The point of deficit reduction is to reduce a long-term drag on economic growth, and so the best way to reduce the deficit is through actions that simultaneously enhance growth.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is much easier said than done, of course, but <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2024/1/18/budgetary-effects-of-stem-green-cards">expanded green cards for immigrants with science and engineering degrees</a> seems like a no-brainer, cutting the deficit substantially over time while boosting growth. A growing literature also finds that <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pmjH55yXIdOn4b-uugc826FJiTTbjS2V/view">funding</a> for <a href="https://conference.nber.org/conf_papers/f196851.pdf">scientific research</a> boosts <a href="https://www.arnauddyevre.com/files/arnaud_dyevre_jmp.pdf">productivity</a> and economic growth. That funding doesn’t pay for itself, necessarily, but raising taxes or cutting less useful spending to boost scientific grants seems like a strong strategy. More generally, Congress should be searching for more policies in this category, ones that can boost growth however modestly at little or no budgetary cost.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Third: the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/us/politics/tax-code-congress.html">coming tax fight in 2025</a> should be used to raise revenue, not just avoid losing it. Most of the individual tax cuts signed into law by Donald Trump in 2017 are due to expire at the end of next year. Some of these cuts, like slashing the top income tax rate from 39.6 to 37 percent, are things Democrats will absolutely want to expire. But most of them have bipartisan appeal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kamala Harris has pledged not to raise taxes on people making under $400,000 a year, which means keeping the expanded standard deduction and child tax credit that Trump enacted. It also means keeping his lower 12, 22, 24, and 32 percent brackets from the bill. All this and bringing back the child tax credit that Biden and Harris passed in 2021 costs about 1 percent of GDP in tax revenue by my estimations <a href="https://www.crfb.org/build-your-own-tax-extensions">using the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s tool</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Taking the debt at all seriously means that whoever’s in office next year needs to pay for whatever part of the Trump cuts they want to keep. <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2024/5/22/president-bidens-fy2025-budget-proposal">Biden’s most recent budget</a> contains a number of tax hikes on top earners, but notably <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/biden-budget-2025-tax-proposals/">doesn’t explicitly pay for</a> extending the Trump cuts. Ideally, policymakers would not just pay for the extensions they want but come up with a revenue-positive package: one that doesn’t merely pay for the Trump cuts but goes further and reduces the deficit.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This won’t be easy but it’s certainly possible. Playing around with the <a href="https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/tcja-extension-simulator">Yale Budget Lab’s handy make-your-own-2025-tax-plan</a> tool — which my sports-knowing editor tells me is like <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine">ESPN’s Trade Machine</a> but for budget nerds — you can pay for the bigger standard deduction and Democrats’ desired child credit by letting all the Trump income tax rate cuts expire, letting the cuts to the estate tax expire too, raising the corporate tax rate to 28 percent, adding a new 45 percent tax bracket on the rich, and eliminating the tax break for pass-through corporations. That raises about 0.4 percent of GDP over a decade, a real bite of the long-run deficit. This does mean tax hikes on a small share of people making under $400,000 —&nbsp;but under the circumstances, I think that’s called for.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fourth: Social Security should be addressed, not punted. Barring any Congressional action, the program is due for <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/4/21/23663654/social-security-retirement-age-1983-greenspan-ball">across-the-board cuts to benefits of over 20 percent starting in 2033</a>, because payroll taxes and the trust fund will no longer be enough to pay promised benefits. This would unleash a political backlash on the part of affected seniors like nothing DC has ever seen, and Congress is almost guaranteed to do <em>something</em> to avoid that outcome.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The easiest way for Congress to deal with this doomsday deadline is to simply tap general tax revenues to avoid the cuts, thereby breaking the linkage between payroll taxes and Social Security benefits. They should not do this. The 2033 deadline provides one of the few forcing mechanisms that can push Congress to address the long-run imbalance between revenues and spending, and if they punt they might never get another opportunity. Democrats will push to pay for the program by raising taxes on high earners; Republicans will push for benefit cuts. Either way, the gap needs to be filled.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Congress will also get an opportunity to reform either <a href="https://www.urban.org/research/publication/first-things-first-how-social-security-reform-can-eliminate-elderly-poverty">Social Security</a> or its sister program <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/increasing-ssi-benefits-is-a-more-effective-approach-to-reducing-poverty-than-an-enhanced-social-security-minimum-benefit/">Supplemental Security Income</a> to eliminate senior poverty — <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2023/demo/p60-280.pdf#page=17">14.1 percent of seniors</a> are in poverty, a higher share than either children or working-age adults, despite the hundreds of billions the government spends on old-age pensions. That’s a travesty, and even Democratic plans to expand the program <a href="https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/103768/first-things-first-how-social-security-reform-can-eliminate-old-age-poverty_1.pdf#page=15">don’t address it sufficiently</a>. It’s likely that even a relatively conservative plan could make real progress here. See, for instance, conservative Social Security expert Andrew Biggs’ plan to convert the old-age insurance program to a<a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2021/1/26/budget-contest-flat-benefit-for-social-security"> flat basic income for all seniors aged 62 and over</a>, set at or above the poverty line.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fifth and finally, Congress needs to work to ensure that per-person health spending stays roughly constant. This will likely take the form of several small reforms, along the <a href="https://onepercentsteps.com/policy-briefs/">1% Steps</a> suggestions, instead of another big effort like the Affordable Care Act. But precisely because the steps necessarily are more modest, the opportunities for bipartisan collaboration here are immense. See, for instance, <a href="https://www.hassan.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-braun-hassan-kennedy-lead-bipartisan-bill-to-fix-part-of-medicare-billing-structure-saving-billions">this bill</a> from Sens. Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Mike Braun (R-IN), and John Kennedy (R-LA) to reform Medicare billing, with support from the liberal Families USA to the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity. Keeping health costs low might be the least unpopular way to deal with the budget imbalance, and that will hopefully spur politicians into more collaborations like this.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Congress does all this — pays for future spending, prioritizes economic growth, raises revenue in the 2025 tax fight, fixes Social Security, and keeps per-capita health spending constant —&nbsp;it’ll be on track to stabilize the debt. It’s not easy. But it’s not impossible either. Bill Clinton and Congress were able to accomplish something similar in the 1990s, and now the time is ripe to try again.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Columbia University president Minouche Shafik is stepping down after protests over the war in Gaza roiled the university community and spread to campuses nationwide, and in Europe, last spring.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This period has taken a considerable toll on my family, as it has for others in our community,” Shafik said in a letter announcing her resignation Wednesday. “Over the summer, I have been able to reflect and have decided that my moving on at this point would best enable Columbia to traverse the challenges ahead.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Shafik has faced pressure to resign for months. Both those who supported the spring protests and those who opposed them have criticized how Shafik handled the demonstrations, as did a number of right-wing politicians, who claimed the president failed to do enough to protect Jewish students. House Speaker Mike Johnson called her resignation “<a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/15/us-news/columbia-president-minouche-shafiks-resignation-reacted-by-mike-johnson-other-pols/">long overdue</a>” on Wednesday.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Not all of the spring protests — which largely involved students demanding that their schools <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/5/7/24150638/divest-israel-protesters-bds-columbia-meaning-fossil-fuel">divest</a> from companies linked to Israel amid its ongoing war in Gaza — reached the intensity of those at Columbia. Some schools <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-05-14/uc-berkeley-protestors-dismantle-pro-palestinian-encampment">managed to negotiate with protesters</a> to voluntarily dismantle their pro-Palestinian encampments without any police intervention. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At Columbia, however, Shafik swiftly <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottwhite/2024/05/16/columbia-president-goaded-into-calling-in-policegets-no-confidence-vote/">called the police</a> on protesters who had erected an encampment on the university’s main lawn in a display of force that sparked widespread outrage. That decision fueled protests with more escalatory tactics thereafter, and also resulted in a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/16/us/university-of-washington-protests-antisemitic-graffiti/index.html">faculty vote of no confidence</a> in her leadership. Things progressed to the point where some protesters eventually <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/columbias-hamilton-hall-takeover-photos-from-inside.html">took over a campus building</a> before they were forcibly removed by police and arrested. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, Shafik has become one of several Ivy League presidents who <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/1/17/claudine-gay-harvard-presidency-feature/">departed</a> their <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/10/business/liz-magill-upenn-resignation-timeline/index.html">roles</a> amid the campus furor. The question is not just where that leaves Columbia — now headed by interim president Katrina Armstrong, the CEO of the Columbia University Irving Medical Center — but all universities as students return to campus this fall. Demonstrations are expected to resume as the war in Gaza, in which <a href="https://apnews.com/article/gaza-war-hamas-dead-graves-40000-988d16b648e06e222f04964dc9440da0">more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed</a>, continues and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/15/new-round-of-gaza-ceasefire-talks-in-doha-where-do-hamas-israel-stand">yet another round of ceasefire talks has begun</a>. And it will be incumbent on administrators to find a way to avoid a repeat of the spring.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think tensions are going to be high, higher than I think they already were,” said <a href="https://www.thefire.org/about-us/our-team/nico-perrino">Nico Perrino</a>, executive vice president of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), a nonpartisan group that advocates for free speech. “Hopefully policies are in place and discussions are happening with students and faculty surrounding how to respond in case encampments go up or students are being threatened or denied access to different portions of campus.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Gaza protests could return in the fall. Universities should start preparing now.&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are two key lessons other university administrators might take away from Shafik’s missteps ahead of what is expected to be a contentious semester:</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Universities should communicate openly and clearly with protesters</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the spring, protests escalated to the point that normal university operations couldn’t continue.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Columbia held <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/22/business/columbia-tensions-passover-virtual-classes/index.html">virtual classes</a> in the final weeks of the spring semester. UCLA also <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/education/ucla-cancels-classes-after-dueling-protesters-clash-on-campus-over-the-war-in-gaza">canceled classes</a> after pro-Palestinian protesters came under attack by masked agitators and campus police failed to intervene for three hours. USC <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestine-war-campus-protests-fbd7dd06431f32d24d0f8abcc8a56b8b">scrapped a commencement speech </a>by its pro-Palestinian valedictorian over safety concerns. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Universities should be planning now for how they can prevent that from happening again. If protests escalate this fall to the level of requiring the invention of campus public safety or police, then “something’s already gone terribly wrong,” said <a href="https://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/frederick-m-lawrence/">Frederick Lawrence</a>, the former president of Brandeis University and a lecturer at Georgetown Law.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The most important step schools can take now is to set clear ground rules for protests that will be applied neutrally — no matter who’s involved or what their cause — such as prohibiting occupying buildings or blocking students from getting to class.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ahead of the fall semester, Lawrence said, university administrators and protesters should plan for a reset that begins with communication.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This is a good time to be reaching out to student leaders on all sides of this and other related issues, and listening to them, but also trying to bring them on board, to try to find constructive ways of having demonstrations, having expressions of views, but doing it in a way that’s constructive for them and constructive for the university,” Lawrence said. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Universities have to carefully consider when to weigh in&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none">University administrators have dual responsibilities to uphold free speech and keep their community safe. Their ability to carry out those responsibilities is compromised when they aren’t seen as neutral mediators.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some university administrators learned this the hard way earlier this year when their statements about the Gaza war were copiously picked apart in the media and in <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/12/15/24001823/antisemitism-college-harvard-penn-mit-free-speech">widely publicized congressional hearings</a> — as well as on their own campuses, as some student protesters at Stanford <a href="https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2024/06/05/pro-palestine-protesters-occupy-stanford-presidents-office/">occupied the offices of their college president</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the spring, some universities did decide that it is not the role of a university to take stances on issues at an institutional level. Harvard, for instance, announced that it would <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/5/28/harvard-institutional-neutrality-report/">no longer comment</a> on contentious issues that do not directly relate to the university. That change in policy came after former Harvard president Claudine Gay was <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/10/10/harvard-statement-criticized/">heavily criticized </a>for her initial statement on the war. The beleaguered Gay <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/1/17/claudine-gay-harvard-presidency-feature/">resigned</a> after facing a later plagiarism scandal.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perrino framed Harvard’s approach as a positive development.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“That should hopefully alleviate some of the messaging concerns around these colleges,” he said. “Universities are the hosts and sponsors of critics. They are not themselves the critics, and by becoming the critics, they put their thumb on the scale of the campus debate.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rather than issuing blanket statements, there may be a more nuanced role for educators to play, by discouraging certain kinds of speech, even if it is permitted under university rules. For example, Yale president Peter Salovey <a href="https://president.yale.edu/president/statements/against-hatred">stated</a> in the spring that “Chants or messages that express hatred, celebrate the killing of civilians, or contain calls for genocide of any group are utterly against our ideals and certainly are not characteristic of our broader community.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those kinds of warnings can have the effect of lowering the temperature.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“A lot of things get said in the heat of the moment that are not helpful, and it is useful for the administration to deescalate and to say, ‘You can communicate that in a way that’s not deeply offensive to your classmates,’” Lawrence said. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Blake Lively’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/366523/blake-lively-drama-justin-baldoni-it-ends-with-us-hoover-movie-feud"><em>It Ends With Us</em></a> is the second biggest movie in America, but it’s the <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/366523/blake-lively-drama-justin-baldoni-it-ends-with-us-hoover-movie-feud">conflict</a> surrounding the film — not the film itself — that everyone’s talking about.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Apparently, Lively and her co-stars are feuding with lead and director Justin Baldoni. Baldoni and Lively <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/justin-baldoni-hires-pr-crisis-manager-melissa-nathan-it-ends-with-us-1235973715/">reportedly</a> didn’t get along, and he allegedly “<a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a61877865/blake-lively-justin-baldoni-fat-shaming-lingering-kiss/">fat-shamed</a>” her by asking someone how much Lively weighed — a scene involving the two requires he pick her up and he was afraid of hurting his back. And according to whispers, he didn’t very much enjoy Lively inviting her husband Ryan Reynolds on set to direct some scenes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But while Baldoni is getting plenty of static here (he’s gone so far as to hire a <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1406111/it-ends-with-us-justin-baldoni-hires-crisis-pr-manager-amid-feud-rumors">veteran crisis PR manager</a> who counts Johnny Depp among her clients), the hullabaloo has many online looking a little more closely at Lively, who is showing her face on the big screen for the first time in four years. Many have noted that Lively has taken a peculiar approach in <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/natashajokic1/it-ends-with-us-blake-lively-justin-baldoni">promoting</a> this film. In an attempt to sell this movie, Lively has promised viewers the giggliest, girliest of times. At the same time, the actor, known for her beautiful hair, launched a haircare line. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This sisterhood of traveling <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24031385/stanley-craze-tumbler-best-water-bottle">Stanley</a> cups approach is in stark contrast to the <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/365988/colleen-hoover-it-ends-with-us-explained">movie’s plot</a>: Lively’s protagonist, a budding florist named Lily Bloom, falls in love with a physically abusive man (Baldoni). Lively’s seeming lack of concern or emotional intelligence about this sensitive topic has raised questions and backlash about whether she knows what kind of movie she’s made, and it’s making some question what we thought we knew about Lively herself.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Blake Lively’s<em> It Ends With Us </em>press tour has been about selling Blake Lively’s stuff&nbsp;</h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Movie press tours are not a thrilling business. They mostly consist of actors fielding the same questions over and over from a variety of media outlets, all in the hopes that they say something that spurs you to see the film they’re promoting. The monotonous repetition of the cinematic publicity cycle is exactly why Lively and<em> It Ends With Us</em>’s unusual tour has been so attention-grabbing. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For starters, Lively and director and co-star Baldoni have been promoting the film separately — an extremely strange thing for leads to do. They’re also doing these interviews, as my colleague <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/366523/blake-lively-drama-justin-baldoni-it-ends-with-us-hoover-movie-feud">Kyndall Cunningham detailed</a>, amid a rash of back-and-forth gossip alleging the two fell out on set. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But what Lively has been saying in the promotion of the film is also drawing attention. In a video clip promoting the movie on TikTok, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@itendswithusmovie/video/7400133808219032878?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7402348493942408735">Lively says to</a> “grab your friends, wear your florals, and head out to see it!” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition to Lively’s quip about girls’ night out to watch intimate partner abuse, she has been promoting both her new haircare line <a href="https://www.target.com/b/blake-brown/-/N-q643leebz0w">Blake Brown</a> and her beverage company Betty Buzz. She’s used the <a href="https://deadline.com/gallery/it-ends-with-us-premiere-red-carpet-photos/">red carpet</a> to keep the public thinking about her husband’s new film, the hyper-violent and profane Marvel blockbuster <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>, while giving Reynolds — not screenwriter Christy Hall or author Colleen Hoover — <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/natashajokic1/it-ends-with-us-ryan-reynolds-blake-lively">credit</a> for writing the movie’s “iconic” rooftop scene.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One promotional clip has her giggling with her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-Z2rXzx7KT/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=9f3edee9-9480-4e00-a68d-b117dd3b53d0">co-stars about their zodiac signs</a>, while another has <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@people/video/7402692327157828907?lang=en">Lively talking about wearing her own clothes</a> in the movie — a move that seems to be connected to Lively styling one of her costars on one of the movie’s red carpets. And in one of her interviews, she’s asked by a journalist who’s clearly familiar with the movie’s sensitive themes about how the movie may inspire people to reach out to her and talk about abuse. <a href="https://x.com/SophRossss/status/1823931352175071394">Lively flippantly dismisses</a> the question as a joke about hypothetically not sharing her location or phone number with those fans instead of, as many would have preferred, promoting <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/leylamohammed/blake-lively-backlash-dismissive-response-it-ends-with-us">domestic violence services</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lively’s critics pointed out the disconnect between Lively framing her movie like a celebratory girls’ night and the actual content, in which a woman experiences violence from her romantic partner. Wearing florals and rounding up the girlies to watch a woman get physically abused by her partner seems, at best, a strange missing of the point and at worst, extremely insensitive or out of touch with the subject of her movie. Either Lively doesn’t fully comprehend the subject of the movie she made or she does and is capitalizing on it to sell her wares anyway. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While tabloids like <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/08/14/blake-lively-justin-baldoni-fat-shamed-it-ends-with-us/">TMZ are reporting</a> on a behind-the-scenes PR war between Lively and Baldoni, this part of the backlash comes from Lively, all on her own, answering these questions the way she’s chosen to.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Blake Lively’s <em>It Ends With Us</em> press tour fits a pattern of bad interviews she’s had&nbsp;</h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When actors have these moments where they seemingly stop acting like fun, good people, it often causes civilians to question whether said celebrity has always been like this or if they’re exhibiting some uncharacteristic behavior. Lively rose to fame playing the rich, carefree Serena van der Woodsen on Gossip Girl, and in many ways that character’s glamorous but selfish image has combined with her own. In her film hiatus, she’s been known more for her relationships than anything else — with Reynolds but perhaps more notably with <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/08/14/entertainment/blake-lively-gushes-over-best-friend-taylor-swift-amid-it-ends-with-us-drama/">Taylor Swift</a>. This popularity perhaps contributes to, as one commenter put it, a “<a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/14/entertainment/reporter-calls-out-blake-lively-for-uncomfortable-interview/">mean girl</a>” vibe. Unfortunately for Lively and her image, she’s done some rather off-putting interviews that have been easy to find. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of those interactions is a <em>Café Society </em>press junket on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2-2RBi1qzY">YouTube with the title</a> “The Blake Lively interview that made me want to quit my job.” Journalist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Flaawsometalk">Kjersti Flaa</a> uploaded her 2016 clip with Lively on August 10, right in the middle of this kerfuffle. In it, Flaa congratulates Lively on her pregnancy which Lively takes passive-aggressive offense to and responds by “congratulating” the not-pregnant Flaa on her own “bump.” (Prior to her interaction with Flaa, Lively had confirmed her pregnancy to the press.) After Lively’s quip, she and co-star Parker Posey barely make eye contact with Flaa, and Lively continues to dismiss or react aggressively to Flaa’s questions about the movie, almost pretending as if Flaa weren’t in the room. </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/gettyimages-2165608556.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Blake Lively with Ryan Reynolds and Reynolds’s&lt;em&gt; Deadpool &amp; Wolverine &lt;/em&gt;co-star Hugh Jackman at a&lt;em&gt; It Ends With Us&lt;/em&gt; screening. Lively has conducted her press tour from the movie separately from co-star Justin Baldoni. | Cindy Ord/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Cindy Ord/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">During that same press tour, Lively also said that <em>Café Society</em> director Woody Allen was good, actually. At the time, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/my-father-woody-allen-danger-892572/">Ronan Farrow</a> had recently written a column in the Hollywood Reporter criticizing the movie industry’s response to his sister Dylan Farrow’s sex abuse allegations against their father. Lively, when asked about Allen, <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/blake-lively-says-woody-allen-is-empowering-to-women-in-new-interview-290662/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20could%20%5Bonly%5D%20know,is%20he's%20empowering%20to%20women.%E2%80%9D">said</a>: “I could [only] know my experience. And my experience with Woody is [that] he’s empowering to women.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Going back further, critics found Lively’s first foray and faux pas into lifestyle branding. Back in 2014, Lively created a digital lifestyle and e-commerce site called Preserve. One of the first spreads was titled “<a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/10/13/6969341/blake-lively-preserve-slavery-antebellum">The Allure of the Antebellum</a>,” putting the site’s name in, let’s say, a certain light. The shoot was a romanticized version of the pre-Civil War South, and failed to address the reality that these cute outfits were anchored in a time of slavery. It’s also worth noting that Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds got married on a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/ryan-reynolds-blake-lively-apologize-plantation-themed-wedding-n1235770">South Carolina plantation in 2012</a> (and later apologized), which may contextualize Lively’s fascination with antebellum aesthetics — though the actor was born and grew up in Los Angeles. (Reynolds, for his part, is famously from Canada.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lively’s Preserve <a href="https://www.gawkerarchives.com/blake-lively-finally-deletes-her-antebellum-obsessed-li-1733782406">lasted about one year</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not difficult to connect the dots between Lively praising Woody Allen being good to women, Lively being palpably mean to a journalist, and Lively glossing over the egregious trauma and pain of slavery with the blithe way she’s behaving on the <em>It Ends With US </em>promotional circuit. While being famous and having every word you say recorded, especially ones that you regret, is not an easy job, this behavior fits a pattern that Lively has shown before.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A more telling frame for this messy kerfuffle might be recognizing that Lively and her husband have become more and more interested in the business side of their acting careers, perhaps even more than the acting.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition to Lively’s hair care line, soda line, and seemingly imminent fashion foray, Reynolds has invested in — and made himself the face of — more than a few companies. He has an ownership stake in telecom company <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rRpYZrNxQc">Mint Mobile</a>, the Welsh soccer club <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/ryan-reynolds-complicated-relationship-father-29738505">Wrexham</a>, and had, until recently, a similar stake in <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ryan-reynolds-made-over-450-222854697.html">Aviation Gin</a>. He’s even the CEO of a marketing company, aptly called <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffconway/2022/03/15/ryan-reynolds-on-how-mntn-and-maximum-effort-are-changing-the-advertising-world-as-we-know-it/">Maximum Effort</a>. Lively and Reynolds are arguably more talented at selling their lifestyle and their names than they are at acting. To many people, drinking the same booze as Ryan Reynolds or having the same hair as Blake Lively is more desirable than watching a Ryan Reynolds or Blake Lively movie. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When movies are so clearly secondary to their personal brand, as we’ve seen with Lively and <em>It Ends With Us</em>, their films become commercials, avenues to further promote their brands and themselves. During the <em>It Ends With Us</em> press tour, Lively spoke not only about how <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2024/08/it-ends-with-us-cast-drama-blake-lively-justin-baldoni.html">Reynolds tinkered</a> with the script, but shots in the film as well, and brought in <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/it-ends-with-us-sony-blake-lively-1235974889/"><em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine </em>editor Shane Reid</a> to help cut the movie. The plugs function as cross-promotion for her husband’s movie and his credibility as a director and actor. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With <em>It Ends With Us</em>, Lively was faced with a high-profile movie that features content that her brand probably doesn’t want to be associated with. Blake Lively the brand was at odds with Blake Lively the actor. In this case, the brand won out; Lively chose to put her efforts behind her brand. Unfortunately for that brand, it’s Blake Lively’s movie — and her complicated image — we can’t stop talking about.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ukraine’s invasion into the Kursk region of Russia shocked Ukrainians, their allies, and most of all, Russia.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ukrainian units have mounted brief, overnight raids into Russian territory before, including one into the Kursk region — near Russia’s western border — earlier this year. But those were quick incursions followed by hasty retreats. This time is different: Ukraine has managed to capture <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-incursion-kursk-afa42b9613323901bef07800ac2cae9e">nearly 400 square miles</a> so far, as well as hundreds of Russian soldiers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Ukrainian offensive began more than a week ago, on August 6. Ukrainian troops — how many is unclear, though <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/ukraine-russia-kursk-incursion-war.html">US officials have said several thousand</a> — and armored vehicles crossed the border from northeastern Ukraine. It’s also unclear how much fighting has taken place, though <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-kursk-offensive.html">reporting suggests Ukrainian forces</a> have faced at least some Russian defenses.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ukraine has yet to say what its military objective is, and it likely has more than just one.&nbsp;No officials other than President Volodymyr Zelenskyy have spoken publicly about those objectives; the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cm2n77mvrz4t">president said that</a> “Russia has brought war to others, and now it is coming home.” Still, the sustained invasion has proved to be a morale boost for Ukrainians sorely in need of one after two and a half years of grinding war.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Russia’s response to the Kursk operation has been extremely slow. Part of that may be because its military apparatus is extremely hierarchical — which can delay rapid action as decisions work their way up the chain — and because it has gone through major destabilizing changes of late. Crucially, its forces are also tied up in Ukraine’s east, where they have been making gains in recent months.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Russia’s rhetorical response has also been quite muted. President Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin’s military apparatus are referring to efforts to rebut the Ukrainian advance as an anti-terror campaign rather than a full military operation. Part of Russia’s strategy overall has been to simultaneously portray its war in Ukraine as existential and not that serious; it refers to its invasion as “a special military operation,” making it sound less concerning to Russians than an all-out war, and assures them that it doesn’t affect their lives.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ukraine’s strategy in the Kursk region makes that harder to maintain, since so far <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraine-attack-russia-evacuations-state-of-emergency/story?id=112833027">around 200,000 Russians</a> have evacuated from their homes due to the invasion — and the Russian government is only offering <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/putin-says-displaced-residents-of-kursk-oblast-will-be-paid-115/">about $115 to compensate</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What does Ukraine gain from this?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ukraine’s continuing incursion into Russia is politically useful, especially in drawing attention and potentially support from US and other allies. Two and a half years into the war, global attention has shifted away from Ukraine’s front line to Israel’s war in Gaza, and now the upcoming US elections.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Support for Ukraine has waned within the US, too. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/house-ukraine-aid-speaker-ouster-c525efc953d532242d6d441c55724992">Republicans in Congress</a> have tried to cut or eliminate critical US military assistance, and overall US support <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-had-very-good-call-with-ukraines-zelenskiy-friday-2024-07-19/">could be at risk</a> if Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump manages to recapture the White House in November.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This successful and sustained incursion into Russia indicates that Ukraine is still a very disciplined fighting force that can actually successfully execute on battlefield objectives with sophisticated strategy. Reminding outside powers that Ukraine can be militarily successful, and could still win this, could help shore up support that’s crucial for maintaining the flow of ammunition, fighting vehicles, fighter jets and spare parts, and other gear.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The invasion is also beneficial practically. To counter Ukraine’s attack, Russia will need to pull some troops from the front line in Ukraine. However, its options are limited for doing so; it is trying to avoid redeploying soldiers away from fighting in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, which Russia falsely claims is its own territory.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Troop movement is already occurring according to <a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/press-media/staff-bios/riley-bailey">Riley Bailey</a>, a Russia analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/world/europe/russia-ukraine-kursk-incursion-troops.html">though not at the scale that Russia really needs</a> to repel the attack and regain territory.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We’ve seen reports of up to 11 Russian battalions redeploying from other sectors of the front to form kind of this hastily-put-together force grouping in Kursk Oblast,” Bailey told Vox. That part of the border was poorly defended on the Russian side, which probably influenced Ukraine’s decision-making.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s impossible to predict what impact Ukraine’s offensive will have on the end of the war. But it will have an immediate, wider-ranging effect, particularly for Russia, Bailey said. “They’re going to have to make a whole lot of theater-wide decisions that they otherwise weren’t going to make before.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And ultimately, the incursion could also give Ukraine leverage further down the road, in the form of prisoner swaps and potentially negotiations to end the war — if, that is, they’re able to hold on to the territory.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Things are still tough for Ukraine, and this operation won’t necessarily “turn the tide”</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ukraine has been extremely tight-lipped about the entire operation thus far, which speaks to a high level of operational sophistication. But there’s a serious question as to how long Ukraine can maintain this operational tempo and whether they can hang on to this territory — which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/world/europe/russia-ukraine-kursk-incursion-troops.html">they plan to do</a>,<strong> </strong>according to <a href="https://www.forsvaret.no/en/research/staff/zysk-katarzyna">Katarzyna Zysk</a>, professor of international relations and contemporary history at the Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ukraine has already committed troops to this incursion who could also be effective on other front lines; in trying to force Russian resources from the east, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-incursion-gamble-battlefield-e862afd58c65d6d2d5b7b3747423ca4d">it’s diverting its own from a crucial front</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ukraine is already struggling with troop numbers, and there’s simply a limit to the number of people it can mobilize.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Back in July, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-mobilisation-campaign-picks-up-despite-faltering-enthusiasm-2024-07-15/">according to a Reuters report</a>, morale was flagging; Zelenskyy had lowered the draft age from 27 to 25, and fighters on the front have become exhausted after two years of nonstop battle.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And even if this battlefield success turns into a successful recruitment drive, that doesn’t mean that suddenly Ukraine will have thousands of highly qualified and effective soldiers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Inasmuch as you can get anyone to drive a truck or clean toilets, you can&#8217;t get effective warfighters that easily,&#8221; Mathieu Boulègue, a defense analyst for the Center for European Policy Analysis, told Reuters.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ukraine remains outnumbered and outgunned; Russia is obtaining drones, ballistic missiles, and ammunition from partners like Iran, China, and North Korea, and is still working on improving its weapons manufacturing domestically, though that’s somewhat challenging given the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60125659">sanctions on its economy</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And the Kursk invasion doesn’t change the fact that Russia is still devastating Kharkiv and has made advances in Crimea, although part of the Kursk invasion seems to be aimed at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/world/europe/russia-ukraine-airfields-kursk.html">weakening Russia’s air capabilities</a> and potentially further mobilize forces away from Crimea.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As of now, Ukraine’s sneak attack may have disrupted the idea that Russia —&nbsp;and Putin — is in control of the war. But it hasn’t yet significantly eased pressure on the eastern front line or stopped Russia’s assaults on Ukrainian cities and towns. It will be increasingly&nbsp;difficult for Ukraine to sustain this level of intensity as more Russian reinforcements arrive —&nbsp;and that’s exactly what needs to happen for Ukraine to be able to have real leverage over Russia in future territorial exchanges or peace negotiations.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) estimated that <a href="https://data.unicef.org/resources/progress-on-household-drinking-water-sanitation-and-hygiene-2000-2020/">2 billion people</a> worldwide lack access to clean water.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Roughly a quarter of the world’s population might seem bad enough. But on Thursday, a <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adh9578">new study published</a> in<em> Science</em> reported that 2 billion was a huge underestimate. New analyses reveal that 4.4 billion people across low- and middle-income countries — over half of the world’s population — don’t have safe household drinking water. It’s not that billions more people lost access to water. Rather, how researchers measure access became much more accurate, and those new measurements showed the problem is much worse than previously thought.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’ve always had clean running water at home, it’s easy to forget that drinkable tap water isn’t a given for much of the planet.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In developed countries like the US with sanitation systems, water is siphoned from a lake, river, or underground reservoir, and passed through a treatment plant to filter out dirt, bacteria, and harmful chemicals. From there, it’s stored in something like a water tower and piped into homes. If everything goes right, that water is safe to drink.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even then, this process doesn’t go 100 percent right. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/water-loss-infrastructure-broken-pipes-poor-neighborhoods-2d747180d294ba62cdbf0906f9305802">Leaky pipes</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/8/31/23329604/jackson-mississippi-water-crisis">aging infrastructure</a>, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/12/15/10237054/flint-lead-poisoning">chemical contamination</a> limit access to safe water in even the wealthiest countries. If it’s a logistical hurdle for those countries — where the vast majority of water is clean, cheap, and plentiful — the burden for low- and middle-income countries in providing everyone with safe drinking water is far more challenging, especially in rural areas, where limited sanitation infrastructure, conflict, and inadequate funding can impede water access. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sufficient access to clean, reliable, affordable drinking water is a human right, though, and the <a href="https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/human_right_to_water.shtml#:~:text=The%20human%20right%20to%20water%20and%20sanitation&amp;text=On%2028%20July%202010%2C%20through,realisation%20of%20all%20human%20rights.">United Nations has urged</a> governments to funnel resources toward building and maintaining water infrastructure. (One of the UN’s <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal6">sustainable development goals</a> is for every community to have clean water — a far-off goal.) Better funding is vital, but unless money is strategically directed toward the right places and programs, throwing cash at the problem <a href="https://www.vox.com/22620076/jackson-mississippi-water-infrastructure-bill">won’t necessarily fix it</a>. That’s where the new data comes in.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/esther-greenwood-71a314133/?originalSubdomain=ch">Esther Greenwood</a>, doctoral candidate at the Federal Institute of Technology Zurich and <a href="https://www.eawag.ch/en/">Eawag, an aquatic research institute in Switzerland</a>, noticed huge gaps in information about drinking water services for over half of the world’s population. By filling these gaps, Greenwood and <a href="https://www.eawag.ch/en/about-us/portrait/organisation/staff/profile/tim-julian/show/">principal investigator Tim Julian</a> aimed to highlight regions where investment in drinking water testing is needed the most.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The fact that so many people around the world do not have reasonable access to safe drinking water must give us pause for thought,” Eawag director <a href="https://usys.ethz.ch/en/people/profile.martin-ackermann.html">Martin Ackermann</a> said. “This could be avoided.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>More people lack safe drinking water than was thought — a lot more</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Figuring out how many people have access to safe water is no small feat, especially in rural areas where this data matters the most. Historically, UNICEF has relied on <a href="https://mics.unicef.org/">household surveys</a>, sending teams of people to conduct in-person interviews from a sample of homes in a given country. They ask <a href="https://mics.unicef.org/tools?round=mics6#survey-design">questions like</a>, <em>“</em>Can you please provide me with a glass of water that members of your household usually drink?” and “Where was this water collected from?” — all of which provides a decent snapshot of a family’s current water situation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But these surveys are labor-intensive and expensive, so information is only gathered once every five to 10 years. Anything that affects water use at a shorter timescale, from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/emergency/sanitation-wastewater/animal-feeding-operations.html#:~:text=Animal%20waste%20(manure)%20from%20animal,coli">livestock farming</a> to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26405847/">seasonal changes in rainfall</a>, won’t be captured. And until recently, surveys <a href="https://washdata.org/unicef-multiple-indicator-cluster-surveys-mics">didn’t ask about water quality</a> at all, Greenwood added. For most regions, only one survey’s worth of data on drinking water contamination exists so far, which makes it difficult to assess trends over time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Greenwood’s team incorporated 39 different sources of geospatial data in their study, gathered on land and via satellite, in addition to survey data from over 64,000 households across 27 countries between 2016 and 2020. They used all of this information to train <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/4/28/23702644/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-technology">machine learning models</a> to estimate whether the water in a given place met <a href="https://washdata.org/monitoring/drinking-water">four safety criteria</a> from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP), which collects data on water supply, sanitation, and hygiene: improved (as in, from a source that could be safe, like pipes, rather than an unprotected well), and whether it was available when needed, accessible without a commute, and free from fecal contamination.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the past, water quality has been measured by averaging survey results across a country’s entire population. Greenwood said that the JMP generally tries to average survey responses relating to all of its water safety criteria, then highlight the lowest value. Say that a survey in one country finds that 80 percent of people get water from an improved source, 50 percent have water at home, 40 percent have consistent water access, and 30 percent have clean, non-contaminated water — the JMP would report that 30 percent of people have safe drinking water.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This washes out a lot of the nuances of people’s individual experiences. What if you have access to clean water, but you have to walk to a kiosk three miles away to get it? Or have consistent water access at home, but it’s <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-mexico-city-is-having-trouble-getting-water-to-its-22-million-residents">piped into tanks via weekly truck deliveries</a> (an “unimproved” water source)?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To get around this problem, Greenwood’s team instead calculated data at the household level, and divided land into smaller chunks than full-blown countries to create a more accurate map of safe drinking water use. They found that two-thirds of people living in low- and middle-income countries had no household access to safe drinking water in 2020. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to clean up water</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/videos/359516/paris-olympics-seine-swimming-poop">Fecal contamination</a>, or high levels of E. coli, was the biggest problem for nearly half of the population studied. When people or animals defecate near a water source, or sewage isn’t effectively contained, E. coli appears in drinking water downstream. Drinking contaminated water like this leads to diarrheal disease — an annoyance for adults but a mass killer for the young, with <a href="https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-health/diarrhoeal-disease/#:~:text=Diarrhoea%20is%20a%20leading%20killer,of%20a%20simple%20treatment%20solution.">over 1,000 young children dying from the disease every day</a>, primarily in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the technology required to measure E. coli levels is widely available, actually collecting drinking water samples and testing them is expensive, especially in remote rural areas. As a consequence, Greenwood said, “We still lack national data on drinking water contamination for approximately half of the global population.” Other chemicals like <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/arsenic">arsenic</a> and <a href="https://www.epa.gov/safepestcontrol/drinking-water-and-pesticides">pesticides</a> can also cause health problems when they wind up in drinking water, but data on these contaminants was even more limited than that for E. coli — too limited for Greenwood’s team to include in their training data.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Greenwood’s team found that environmental factors, like tree density and how much rainfall changes with the seasons, were another major predictor of drinking water quality. This aligns with what researchers already knew — water quality is shaped in part by the weather. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Runoff after a big rainstorm, for example, can pick up bacteria, dirt, and pollutants on its way back to rivers and lakes. <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.2c07284">Heat waves</a> also correlate with spikes in water contamination, especially in low-income areas. As the Earth continues getting hotter, this will become an increasingly pressing concern — low-income countries currently facing water insecurity <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/01/climate-crisis-poor-davos2023/">are also the most vulnerable</a> to the effects of climate change.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Landscape and urban development also come into play. Sometimes, water is scarce because humans built a city in a dry place, or that city outgrew its water supply. South Africa’s Cape Town was <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/08/cape-town-was-90-days-away-from-running-out-of-water-heres-how-it-averted-the-crisis/">almost forced to shut off its water supply</a> in 2018 after a years-long drought, and narrowly avoided a massive crisis through a combination of restricting water supply and reducing demand.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But often the problem is less how much water there is than its quality and its availability to homes. <a href="https://washmatters.wateraid.org/publications/functionality-wastewater-treatment-plants-low-middle-income-countries">Too often wastewater treatment plants are poorly managed</a>, or <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X21002400">insufficient water pressure</a> prevents piped water service from running consistently. <a href="https://www.vox.com/24152402/mexico-city-day-zero-water-resource-management-solutions">Mexico City</a>, for example, may also run out of water in the not-too-distant future due to a combination of climate change and human mismanagement. When city pipes run dry, alternate sources of water like bottled water or <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:A_water_kiosk_in_Chipata_(7642999604).jpg#/media/File:A_water_kiosk_in_Chipata_(7642999604).jpg">kiosks</a> are usually available, but these can <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X21002400">cost up to 52 times as much</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tackling huge policy problems like water insecurity requires a lot of data. Greenwood’s team began to fill in some of the gaps left open by the JMP, but she said that the kind of information they really need — frequent, hyperlocal measurements of water use over time — still doesn’t exist. This longitudinal data will be especially important for understanding how climate change is affecting drinking water services. Since climate and weather fluctuate faster than once-in-a-decade surveys can capture, surveys alone won’t cut it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Household data also don’t necessarily reflect someone’s daily water use, either. People also drink water and go to the bathroom at work, school, and other public facilities — and there are still huge gaps in information about <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adh9578">public water use</a>. This study also didn’t address the <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/03-05-2021-affordability-of-wash-must-be-defined-and-tracked-if-2030-global-goals-are-to-be-met-new-report">affordability of drinking water</a>, or the disproportionate <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-02037-8#:~:text=In%20rural%20households%20lacking%20access,physical%20strain%20and%20mental%20distress.">burden that water insecurity places on the women</a> often tasked with fetching water when it’s not available at home.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the kind of geospatial data Greenwood’s team used can’t necessarily answer those questions, it can help point resources in the right direction. Areas with especially high levels of fecal contamination, or especially densely populated areas with limited water sources, could be flagged for prioritization by the government.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Greenwood hopes that by demonstrating what a big effect accounting for geospatial information has on water safety estimates, their team can mobilize policymakers “towards improving monitoring of water quality globally, particularly in regions where there are current data gaps.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A new and deadlier version of mpox is spreading internationally. In recent months, cases and deaths were being detected only in parts of central and east Africa, but on Thursday, Sweden <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/sweden-confirms-first-case-mpox-2024-08-15/">confirmed</a> its first case. The announcement comes just one day after the World Health Organization <a href="https://apnews.com/article/who-mpox-africa-health-emergency-cc9bdf31b49d06bec5efd44fb55d5e42" data-type="link" data-id="https://apnews.com/article/who-mpox-africa-health-emergency-cc9bdf31b49d06bec5efd44fb55d5e42">declared</a> mpox an international public health emergency for the second time in two years. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The risk to the general public in the US is “very low,” the Department of Health and Human Services <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/08/14/united-states-governments-response-clade-i-mpox-outbreak-democratic-republic-congo-other-countries-region.html">stated</a> in the wake of the World Health Organization’s announcement.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mpox, previously known as monkeypox, is an infectious disease closely related to but much less severe than smallpox, and is suspected to originate in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/about/index.html#:~:text=Monkeypox%20virus%20was%20discovered%20in,regions%20where%20mpox%20is%20endemic.">African rodents and non-human primates</a>. Mpox <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/if-sick/transmission.html">spreads</a> through close contact with an infected person, including from sexual and skin-to-skin-contact. Pregnant people can also pass the virus to their child during pregnancy and after birth. The most common <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/symptoms/index.html">symptom</a> of mpox is a blister-like rash that typically lasts for two to four weeks. Other symptoms include fever, fatigue, muscle aches, cough, and sore throat.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/monkeypox#:~:text=The%20monkeypox%20virus%20was%20discovered,occasionally%20from%20animals%20to%20people.">For decades</a>, mpox has caused sporadic cases and outbreaks in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and several&nbsp;other African countries. But in <a href="https://www.who.int/europe/emergencies/situations/monkeypox">May 2022</a>, countries outside of Africa, including many that had never dealt with mpox, suddenly started recording cases. That July, the World Health Organization declared the pandemic a public health emergency of international concern for the first time. In just one year, more than <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/response/2022/world-map.html">100 countries</a> had recorded nearly 90,000 mpox cases and over <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mpox">150 deaths</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fortunately, public health agencies around the world acted quickly to improve disease surveillance efforts, increasing awareness among high-risk populations, particularly men who have sex with men, and <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/monkeypox-response-in-europe">encouraging</a> safe sex practices. In the US and Europe, where there were just over 30,000 and 25,000 mpox cases respectively between May 2022 and May 2023; officials also disseminated over a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7220a2.htm">million</a> vaccine doses. Consequently, mpox transmission in most countries quickly dwindled. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In <a href="https://www.who.int/europe/emergencies/situations/monkeypox">May 2023</a>, the World Health Organization lifted the emergency status and although at the time the public health body no longer considered mpox an international health emergency, countries around the world continued to report cases but much fewer than at the height of the epidemic. In June 2024, there were 175 cases reported across North, Central, and South America; 100 cases were reported in Europe, and 11 cases were reported in Southeast Asian countries, according to a <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20240812_mpox_external-sitrep_35.pdf?sfvrsn=62a5fea1_4&amp;download=true">situation report</a> published by the World Health Organization. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the Democratic Republic of the Congo in central Africa; however, the outbreak <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON522">continued</a> largely unabated. As of May 2024, there have been <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON522">7,851</a> mpox cases and 384 deaths reported in the country. On Tuesday, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://time.com/7010665/mpox-health-emergency-africa/">declared</a> mpox a continent-wide public health emergency.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The version of the virus circulating in the DRC was different than the one that spread globally. There are two <a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/mpox#:~:text=Mpxv%20virus%20variants%20are%20referred,Clade%20IIa%20and%20Clade%20IIb.">main strains</a> of mpox: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/about/index.html">clade I</a>, which causes more severe illness and has historically been confined to central Africa, and clade II, which has historically caused infections in west Africa. Clade II was the version that spread to over 100 countries in 2022 and 2023. But clade I was spreading in the DRC. And it is clade I that has now started spreading out of the DRC into <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/08/1153141">four countries in east Africa</a> — Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda — and now Sweden. </p>

Let’s talk about it.</a></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The new international spread of mpox clade I is spurring concerns that a deadlier<em> </em>mpox pandemic might be on the horizon and triggered the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization to designate the ongoing mpox outbreaks as health emergencies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Africa CDC is the public health <a href="https://africacdc.org/">agency</a> of the African Union, which represents 55 African states. It is the first time the agency has designated any outbreak a continental emergency.&nbsp;Other African countries are also facing resurging mpox outbreaks caused by the clade II virus. In May, there were a total of <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20240812_mpox_external-sitrep_35.pdf?sfvrsn=62a5fea1_4&amp;download=true">465</a> mpox cases documented across all African countries and in June there were 567, a 22 percent increase.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We declare today this public health emergency of continental security to mobilize our institutions, our collective will, and our resources to act swiftly and decisively,” said Africa CDC Director General Jean Kaseya in a press briefing Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Outbreak response efforts in the DRC and other African countries have once again been hamstrung by the same challenges health officials faced during previous outbreaks and pandemics, <a href="https://www.vox.com/22759707/covid-19-vaccine-gap-covax-rich-poor-countries-boosters">including Covid</a>: a lack of global solidarity and an unwillingness to share life-saving resources. While vaccine doses were rapidly disseminated in the US and Europe in 2022, vaccines are only now starting to trickle into the DRC. But even so, only a couple hundred thousand vaccines will be available for a population of more than <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL">100 million</a> people.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Slowly, national governments and multinational organizations such as the African Union are working to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/1/24/24048361/mpox-covid-outbreak-africa-cdc-public-health">improve</a> domestic public health infrastructure and technical capacity and to reduce dependency on donor countries. While Africa CDC’s unprecedented move to designate the mpox outbreaks a regional health emergency signals a continuation of these efforts, it is unclear if the designation will help spur the rapid influx of resources needed to respond to the mpox outbreaks.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Mpox origins and unknowns</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mpox was first discovered in <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/monkeypox#:~:text=The%20monkeypox%20virus%20was%20discovered,occasionally%20from%20animals%20to%20people.">1958</a> in a colony of monkeys in a research facility in Denmark, and the first case of mpox in a human — a nine-month-old infant — was not documented until <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/about/index.html">1970</a> in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Researchers and physicians could <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2480792/pdf/bullwho00192-0028.pdf">not determine</a> exactly how the infant became infected; however, close contact with an infected monkey may have caused the infection. Small rodents, monkeys, and mammals <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/about/index.html">can pass</a> the virus on to humans but outbreaks typically take off when humans infect each other.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2005, additional mpox cases in humans were recorded in the DRC, and thousands of suspected cases have been reported every year since then. Since 2017, mpox has also caused frequent infections in Nigeria.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although mpox has been around for a long time, there are still many unknowns about how the virus spreads and why it suddenly spread around the world in 2022. What researchers do know is that the virus has been rapidly mutating in recent years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Interestingly and maybe worryingly, while most genetic mutations have no effect at all, some can cause viruses to become deadlier or more effective at spreading. When geneticists compared the 2022 mpox genome to a sample collected in 2017, they <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02456-8">found</a> some <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/06/02/mutations-in-monkeypox-virus-explainer/">40</a> genetic <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-023-01675-2#Sec4">mutations</a> had occurred. Some researchers have <a href="https://theconversation.com/mpox-why-the-viruss-continued-rapid-mutation-since-the-2022-global-outbreak-remains-a-concern-228338">suggested</a> that these mutations have improved how easily the virus can spread from person to person, but it seems that there is no firm <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/06/02/mutations-in-monkeypox-virus-explainer/">consensus</a> yet.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In September 2023, an entirely new mpox clade I variant, tentatively called clade IB, was <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON522">discovered</a> in the DRC. The World Health Organization has not confirmed if the new variant causes more severe disease or can be spread more easily.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rosamund Lewis, the mpox technical lead at the World Health Organization, posits that genetic mutations are not behind the sudden global surge of mpox. Instead, she suggests that the virus happened to start infecting new populations — sex workers and men who have sex with men — and that has in turn fueled wider transmission. Mpox is reminiscent of the origins of HIV, when <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3234451/#:~:text=Approximately%20one%20century%20ago%20in,the%20AIDS%20pandemic%20in%20humans.">chimpanzees</a> infected humans in southwestern Cameroon before taking firm <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/why-kinshasa-1920s-was-perfect-place-hiv-go-global-180952953/">root</a> in the booming urban center — and among the large sex worker population — of Kinshasa, the capital of the DRC.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sexual transmission among adults may only be one of the main drivers of mpox transmission. In the DRC, some <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/about/mpox-risk-assessment.html">70 percent</a> of mpox cases recorded this year were among children who were likely exposed through close contact with infected animals or household members who were infected.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the biggest risk factors for severe mpox infection and <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)00273-8/fulltext">death</a> is preexisting <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/prevention/hiv.html">HIV infection</a>. Unfortunately, about <a href="https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/hivaids#:~:text=There%20are%2025.6%20million%20people%20living%20with%20HIV%20in%20the%20African%20region.&amp;text=In%202022%2C%20about%20380%2C000%20people,AIDS%20related%20illness%20in%202022.">25.6 million</a> people in Africa have HIV, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/363716/africa-hiv-aids-sub-saharan-progress">more</a> than any other region in the world,<strong> </strong>meaning many African nations may experience deadlier outbreaks than other parts of the world. The dual burden of mpox and HIV was also a major factor that prompted the Africa CDC to declare the mpox outbreaks a continental emergency, Kaseya explained.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>There is an mpox vaccine shortage. Will emergency designations help?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are at least two vaccines — <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/jynneos">Jynneos</a>, also called <a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/imvanex">Imvanex</a> in Europe, which is made by Danish company Bavarian Nordic, and <a href="https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/vaccines/lc16-kmb-mpox-smallpox-vaccine#:~:text=LC16%20is%20a%203rd%20generation,emergency%20investigational%20new%20drug%20program.">LC16</a>, which is manufactured by Japanese company KM Biologics — that are effective against mpox. The US Food and Drug Administration <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-live-non-replicating-vaccine-prevent-smallpox-and-monkeypox">approved </a>the Jynneos vaccine for use against smallpox and mpox in 2019.&nbsp;LC16 was developed for smallpox but is also effective against mpox.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When the US and Europe started recording mpox cases in 2022, health officials quickly disseminated millions of doses of existing vaccines. For the first two years of the pandemic, however, no vaccines were available in the DRC.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The DRC, like most countries in Africa, <a href="https://africacdc.org/news-item/africa-calls-for-new-public-health-order/">does not have</a> the infrastructure to produce its own vaccines nor can it afford to pay for millions of doses. (The mpox vaccine costs just under $100 per dose, according to Kaseya; GDP per capita in the <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=CD">DRC is just $649</a>.) Thus, these countries must rely on donations from the US, Europe, and other countries. Following the Covid-19 pandemic, the Africa CDC started leading <a href="https://africacdc.org/news-item/africa-calls-for-new-public-health-order/">efforts</a> to fill this crucial gap, but progress has been slow.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the void, officials in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other African countries have been carrying on their outbreak responses without vaccines. It wasn’t until last month that the first shipments of mpox vaccines started arriving in the DRC. But the country received only 200,000 doses, according to Lewis, forcing personnel to cobble together a plan outlining how they will utilize such finite resources. Kaseya did not elaborate on how Africa CDC will aid in this process.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Donor governments have been providing technical and financial support for mpox outbreak responses in Africa. Last week, the US Agency for International Development, or USAID, announced that it will surge <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/aug-07-2024-united-states-announces-424-million-additional-assistance-democratic-republic-congo">$10 million</a> in funds to support the mpox response in DRC.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It remains unclear if the new emergency designations will have any impact on mpox vaccine availability. Still, the Africa CDC and World Health Organization are increasing financial resources for the mpox response.  Earlier this month, the African Union released <a href="https://africacdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Emergency-Approval-of-10.4-Million-to-Africa-CDC-for-Mpox-Outbreak-Respons.pdf">$10.4 million</a> in funds for the mpox response. The World Health Organization has promised <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/08/1153176">$1.45 million</a> in emergency funds, according to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, with more to follow in the coming days.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This is a fight for all Africans and we will fight it together,” Kaseya said.</p>

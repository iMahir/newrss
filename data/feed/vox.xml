<p class="has-text-align-none">At any given second, millions of people are liking various things on Instagram. Pictures of sunsets and sunrises, recipes for keto brownies, videos of viral K-pop dances — there’s something for everyone. But right now there’s one specific semi-famous woman whose social media activity (liking, unliking, posting) has drawn widespread attention: <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/29/sports/brittany-mahomes-is-brushing-off-haters-after-patrick-mahomes-advice/">Brittany Mahomes</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Best known as the wife of Super Bowl-winning Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, Brittany Mahomes’s national profile has, for the moment, eclipsed her husband’s. That’s due to her perceived support for former President Donald Trump and his promised political policies. This all started when Mahomes liked and then unliked an Instagram post from the former president that <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/08/28/brittany-mahomes-trump-support/">outlined his 2024 platform</a>.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Under any normal circumstances, only <a href="https://www.instagram.com/brittanylynne/?hl=en">Brittany Mahomes’s biggest fans</a> would be deeply invested in whether she desires mass deportation and an Iron Dome missile defense system built over America. But Mahomes has connections to Taylor Swift, the most famous woman in the world. That very valuable association is why the social media likes and dislikes of an American football WAG (that’s “wives and girlfriends”) has become a pop culture saga. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We’re here to answer your most pressing questions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Wait, what happened?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Brittany Mahomes has become a moment in this news cycle because she has been liking and unliking social media posts supporting former President Donald Trump and his various policies. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-m53xGu3MY/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=a69d4fdc-9933-4d07-904b-7e88d71753a8">August 13</a>, Trump’s Instagram account posted a platform promising to “seal the border and stop the migrant invasion,” “keep men OUT of women’s sports,” and “Carry out the largest deportation operation in American history.” He also plans to cut “federal funding for any school pushing Critical Race Theory, Radical Gender Ideology, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://x.com/tiredasslesbian/status/1826972546052325629">Eagle-eyed internet sleuths</a> spotted that Mahomes “liked” and “unliked” the xenophobic and transphobic dog whistle salad last week. And though Mahomes doesn’t follow Trump on her account, it seems as though the narrative was already set: Mahomes supports some of Trump’s most pernicious and divisive politics. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The news that people saw Mahomes’s social media activity eventually circled its way back to Mahomes, who was not pleased that people noticed her public actions. To that, she posted a message via <a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/brittany-mahomes-message-haters-liking-pro-trump-instagram-post">Instagram Story</a> (Instagram Stories are temporary), denouncing her haters and telling them they were emotionally damaged adults: </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>I mean honestly, to be a hater as an adult, you have to have some deep rooted issues you refuse to heal from childhood. There’s no reason your brain is fully developed and you hate to see others doing well.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/brittany-mahomes-slams-haters-instagram-015629071.html?.tsrc=daily_mail&amp;segment_id=DY_GOLDLIST_TEST&amp;ncid=crm_19908-1202929-20240825-0&amp;bt_user_id=6JRyBTwoYQzmdnLH3pN2QzNZuI5lUW99eij89uny52Y9VmIpDsEpGGO5JWIe&amp;bt_ts=1724580120381&amp;guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKBxQxF-fo9Px30l0B6tcZu6KwckIA3BbKQcCQTyBfmdE-eLjhpbxsDzUFDj5U0riA9M2Jsg-zMbF58SDN42jXuDiD764vw6o2Wv0F_tzmN_zscfp-UWDMzLVQM4dRmTihmI2MylQw9k_ZcZWJAySNmtqdVp7JDgb2AdfXCpwmLA">Mahomes seemed</a> to see the negativity surrounding her social media proclivities as a sign that people were mad that she was succeeding, rather than that people were disappointed in her presumed politics, that is to say what appeared to be her beliefs about how the country should be run and how others should be treated. Mahomes also <a href="https://x.com/PopCrave/status/1828870083847884899">liked a pro-Trump comment</a> under a recent post, eliminating any ambiguity that her previous liking and unliking spree might be an accident. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Monday, Mahomes doubled down and <a href="https://people.com/brittany-mahomes-doubles-down-calling-out-critics-after-backlash-8701908">shared a post</a> that read, “Contrary to the tone of the world today … You can disagree with someone, and still love them. You can have differing views, and still be kind.” She did not comment on or explain the relative kindness of the views she appeared to support.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>And sorry, who is Brittany Mahomes again? Do people regularly care about Brittany Mahomes in general?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Brittany Mahomes is primarily famous because she’s married to Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who was her high school sweetheart. She’s also the <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a45601704/who-is-patrick-mahomes-wife-brittany-mahomes/">co-owner</a> of the Kansas City Current, a team in the National Women’s Soccer League, which was the sport she excelled in through college, and she was a Sports Illustrated <a href="https://www.si.com/sports-illustrated/brittany-mahomes-makes-her-sports-illustrated-swimsuit-debut-01hxt4v7tp05">swimsuit model</a> in May of this year. She and Patrick have two children and are currently expecting a third. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore/TIMESERIES/1724935800?hl=en-US&amp;tz=300&amp;geo=US&amp;hl=en&amp;q=brittany+mahomes,brittany+mahomes+trump&amp;sni=3">biggest “Brittany Mahomes” search spike</a> of the past year was during the Super Bowl when people were ostensibly trying to figure out whether Patrick Mahomes had a wife and if she was hanging out with Taylor Swift (more on this in a bit). </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/gettyimages-2160725206.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.696771244586,100,78.606457510828" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Patrick Mahomes and Brittany Mahomes at Wimbledon this year. | Karwai Tang/WireImage via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Karwai Tang/WireImage via Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">For the most part, the name Brittany Mahomes is not one the average American gives a lot of thought to, and her political views would probably warrant even less consideration. She’s not a political scholar nor is she some kind of kingmaker. Prior to her online statements about “haters,” the <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore/TIMESERIES/1724935800?hl=en-US&amp;tz=300&amp;geo=US&amp;hl=en&amp;q=brittany+mahomes,brittany+mahomes+trump&amp;sni=3">American public wasn’t furiously Googling</a> “Brittany Mahomes loves Trump?” or “Brittany Mahomes Republican.” There’s a bit of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">Streisand effect</a> happening, where the more Mahomes doubles down, the more attention she draws to the kerfuffle. There’s possibly a timeline in which Mahomes lets the entire saga run its course and fade away as football season begins. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One thing to note is that her pro-Trump political stance appears to many to be at odds with Patrick’s identity. Patrick is biracial, with a Black father and a white mother. And it would seem that Brittany’s liking that pro-Trump post, especially his bits about attacking critical race theory (an attack that would minimize the historical <a href="https://www.vox.com/22443822/critical-race-theory-controversy">Black American experience</a>) would be insensitive if not incongruent with her husband’s identity. <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/364172/trump-nabj-black-voter-journalist-racist-kamala-harris-indian-american">Trump has recently attacked</a> Vice President Kamala Harris’s biracial ethnicity, claiming that she “turned” Black for political gain. Harris’s father is Jamaican.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Patrick hasn’t been open about who he’s voting for, but he has spoken up about police brutality and <a href="https://andscape.com/features/patrick-mahomes-saw-george-floyds-death-and-chiefs-quarterback-knew-he-couldnt-stay-on-the-sideline/">supported Black Lives Matter</a>. In 2020, he <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/watch-patrick-mahomes-and-other-nfl-stars-demand-the-nfl-condemn-racism-and-admit-wrong-in-silencing-players-from-peacefully-protesting-2020-06-05">urged the NFL</a> to denounce and separate itself from racism.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But more important than her husband and the reason everyone’s talking about Brittany at all is that she’s allegedly friends with Taylor Swift — the most famous person on the planet. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>So this is all because she’s friends with Taylor Swift?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pretty much!&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>How long have they been friends?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Swift and Mahomes seem to have formed their close bond after Swift started dating <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2023/9/25/23889682/taylor-swift-travis-kelces-date-nfl-chiefs-game">Travis Kelce</a>, a Chiefs tight end who plays with Patrick Mahomes. The two women likely cultivated their relationship during Chiefs games last year, when they <a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/taylor-swift-brittany-mahomes-rcna121662">were photographed</a> together multiple times at the VIP suites, even potentially wearing matching necklaces. It wasn’t long until they took their friendship on the road, with Taylor including Brittany on a <a href="https://www.eonline.com/photos/36639/taylor-swifts-nyc-night-out-with-selena-gomez-brittany-mahomes-more">girls’ night in NYC</a> with the rest of her squad. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Wait, what does Taylor have to say about Trump?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Swift has spoken up against Trump in the past, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2020/01/24/taylor-swift-politics-miss-americana-donald-trump">acknowledging in her 2020 documentary</a><em> Miss Americana</em> that she regretted not speaking up about him and his policies during the 2016 election. Ahead of the 2020 election, <a href="https://x.com/taylorswift13/status/1266392274549776387">Swift tweeted</a> that Trump was cavorting with white supremacists and promised “we will vote you out in November.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But ahead of the upcoming 2024 election, Swift has been less vocal about Trump and publicly more non-partisan.<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/taylor-swift-urges-282-million-instagram-followers-vote-super-tuesday-rcna141848">In March</a>, she urged her fans to vote for “the people who most represent YOU into power.” Kelce, her boyfriend, has appeared in Covid-19 vaccine and <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/restaurants/bud-light-boycott-movement-goes-after-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce">Budweiser</a> commercials, <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/2023/4/12/23680135/bud-light-boycott-dylan-mulvaney-travis-tritt-trans">two targets</a> of right-wing protests. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At last year’s Super Bowl, Swift and Kelce found themselves in the middle of a kooky <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/12/us/politics/biden-tiktok-super-bowl.html">right-wing conspiracy theory</a> that President Joe Biden rigged the game in Kelce and Kansas City’s favor, all to get some of that sweet Swift attention. The gist: that Kelce and Swift were liberal, so Biden tilted the game in their favor.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/19/politics/donald-trump-taylor-swift-ai/index.html">Trump also recently posted an AI image</a> falsely suggesting he has the support of her fans. Swift has not <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/24/us/ai-content-laws-taylor-swift-trump/index.html">officially responded</a> to that “acceptance.”<strong> </strong>Still, Swift has yet to endorse a presidential candidate. In what’s likely to be a close election, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/08/swifties-kamala-harris-zoom/679637/">some of Swift’s biggest fans</a> are urging her to throw her support behind Harris. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Okay, so … Brittany Mahomes isn’t actually Taylor Swift, she’s just a friend. Why do her perceived politics matter?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mahomes’s social media meltdown came at a peculiar time for megastar Swift. Mahomes and her husband spent the weekend with Taylor Swift at the singer’s Rhode Island estate on August 24. Swift was reportedly hosting a birthday party for pal Blake Lively that weekend. Lively has been having a difficult time in the press recently because of a <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/367451/blake-lively-it-ends-with-us-press-tour-controversy">feud with co-star Justin Baldoni</a> during the filming of their movie <em>It Ends With Us</em>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Swift’s getaway weekends are famous for being luxurious and over the top, but also as invitations only her very best friends receive. Swift is known for picking and choosing her friends from the world of beautiful and notable people and then visibly hanging out with them. Ever since Swift’s <em>1989</em> tour, where her pals — ranging from Fifth Harmony to Gigi Hadid — joined her onstage, <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24134809/taylor-swift-tortured-poets-department-matty-healy-joe-alwyn">Swift’s friendships</a> with the hippest, smartest, kindest, and most beautiful women in pop culture have become a crucial part of her image. All these people who call Swift friends are culturally cool, which makes Swift culturally cool. </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/gettyimages-1717057814.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.7460602225,100,78.507879555" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Taylor Swift, Brittany Mahomes, and Blake Lively hanging out! One of these women may or may not be deeply into mass deportation! | Kevin Sabitus/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Kevin Sabitus/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, Swift’s friendships are the most human thing about her. They’re her way of signaling to the public that as different as she is from the rest of the population — a billionaire making hit music and selling all kinds of albums — she’s relatable as a good friend. Arguably, Swift’s friends have defined the singer almost as much as she’s defined herself. The Mahomes’s presence in Rhode Island would indicate that Brittany is indeed a bestie. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, not unlike how fans are trying to puzzle out the dynamic of Brittany’s relationship with her husband, Swifties are trying to figure out how Brittany’s politics figure into her friendship with Swift. Since the singer has been relatively quiet, they’re trying to get a read on Swift’s current feelings about Trump. Or, possibly, get a read on how much longer Brittany and Swift will remain friends. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Swift’s friendships have always been a crucial and visible part of her image.<strong> </strong>And Brittany Mahomes may have just made a mark on that image that Taylor Swift didn’t agree to.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Good news for even the most discerning fans of Middle-earth: The second season of Amazon Studio’s <em>The Rings of Power,</em> which premiered August 29, includes a whole lot more characters and landscapes from J.R.R. Tolkien’s books, many of which never made it into Peter Jackson’s film adaptations. Whether it’s anywhere near as captivating, however, is a different story. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The series, which premiered in 2022, centers on Middle-earth’s Second Age, which occurred thousands of years before the events of <em>The Hobbit </em>and <em>The Lord of the Rings, </em>and is based not on a single Tolkien work but on their many appendices. The first season saw a young version of the elf Galadriel (played by Morfydd Clark in the series, and in Jackson’s films by Cate Blanchett) begin her quest to avenge the death of her brother by defeating the evil Sauron, until she eventually realizes that the man she thought was a friend was (spoiler!) actually Sauron in disguise. But by this point, he’s already seeded the idea to the famed elven smith Celebrimbor to create one of the titular Rings of Power — objects that Sauron bestows upon powerful rulers in order to secretly control them — and by the finale, he’s made three.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Reviews for the first season were mixed but leaned positive; critics <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/streaming/prime-videos-lord-of-the-rings-keeps-the-spectacle-of-peter-jackson-loses-some-of-the-spirit">praised</a> the intricate, immersive sets and dazzling CGI of the landscapes (both of which contributed to its $1 billion cost, making it <a href="https://time.com/6205837/the-rings-of-power-amazon-most-expensive/">the most expensive show ever made</a>). But others panned its use of modern “mystery box” storytelling — a construction in TV shows like <em>Lost, Westworld,</em> and <em>Stranger Things,</em> in which hints are dropped throughout a season until the finale’s big reveal. A <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2022/09/24/the-rings-of-power-is-making-a-mockery-of-tolkiens-work/">Forbes writer</a> said that approach made “a mockery of Tolkien’s work,” while <a href="https://screenrant.com/rings-of-power-season-2-lotr-mystery-trope-stop/">Screenrant pointed out</a> that Middle-earth’s Second Age “is filled with rich stories on its own without having to make artificial mysteries to drive viewer interest.” </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-29-at-2.19.19 PM-1.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.82625511435,100,78.3474897713" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Galadriel admiring her ring of power. | Amazon Studios" data-portal-copyright="Amazon Studios" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The problem with creating a TV show based on one of the best-selling books of all time and three of the greatest films ever made is that people tend to be a bit precious about the material. Audiences “review-bombed” the series when it first aired — some were upset at the non-canonical timeline, some angry at the gender and racial diversity in the casting, and others balked at the idea of hiring <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2022/12/27/23521556/rings-of-power-amazon-streaming-wars-jd-payne-patrick-mckay">two inexperienced and unknown showrunners</a>, Patrick McKay and J.D. Payne, to helm the project. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though its first episode became Amazon’s most-watched series premiere ever, only <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/inside-amazon-studios-jen-salke-vision-shows-1235364913/#recipient_hashed=dbcbe591d3e8635f592dfcf12ed3a112e937c4e1bad9b8722263c6617bc637cc&amp;recipient_salt=3d2b320f2f3bb195838476e8d0d4e9b58fd9601855eec5d2c925427fd82514d8">37 percent </a>of viewers finished the series, which execs blamed on all the “setting up” required in the first season. For season two, they say the plot will “hit the ground running”: “When you’re setting out the banquet table, necessarily, there’s going to be a little more lore and rules,” McKay <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/arts/television/rings-of-power-season-2.html">told the Times</a>. “Now, we are feasting.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re tuning in to the new episodes but can’t quite remember where we left off two years ago, or are concerned you might not be quite brushed up enough on Middle-earth to get it, here’s a handy guide (no Elvish needed).&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Wait, what is this show about again?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Remember the monologue Galadriel delivers at the very beginning of the <em>Fellowship</em> film about the forging of the rings? This is essentially what happens in <em>The Rings of Power</em>:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Three were given to the Elves, immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven to the Dwarf lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of Men, who, above all else, desire power. But they were, all of them, deceived, for another ring was made. In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a Master Ring, to control all others. And into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life. One Ring to rule them all.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Eventually, Sauron’s plan is discovered, and an alliance of men and elves form a resistance. In the final battle, Isildur (the ancestor of human ranger Aragorn), cuts the One Ring from the hand of Sauron, bringing peace to Middle-earth — thousands of years before Frodo ends up with the ring and embarks on his quest to destroy it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is the story that will unfold throughout all five planned seasons of <em>The Rings of Power. </em>The first season barely scratches its surface, however, and instead spends most of its eight episodes introducing new characters and building up to the reveal that Halbrand (Charlie Vickers), Galadriel’s new human friend, is the evil Sauron, and ends just after the forging of the first three rings for the elves.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We also meet the dwarves, who act as comic relief when they’re not busy in the depths of Khazad-dûm, the impressive underground dwarf city, mining for the newly discovered substance mithril (which fans might remember is the material Frodo’s chainmail shirt is made of). It’s an immensely powerful ore that the elf Elrond (Robert Aramayo, played by Hugo Weaving in the film trilogy) wants to use to help save the elves, who are suffering as a result of having spent <a href="https://collider.com/is-the-light-of-the-eldar-fading-in-the-rings-of-power-explained/">too much time away from their homeland</a> — and it’s the same material used to craft the rings. </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-29-at-2.20.06 PM.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.826700321134,100,78.346599357733" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Durin IV and his giant beard. | Amazon Studios" data-portal-copyright="Amazon Studios" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Because Middle-earth just wouldn’t be the same without halflings, there’s also a loveable pair of harfoots, early ancestors of hobbits, who live nomadically in caravans. Two harfoot girls, Nori and Poppy, come across an old man who appears in the crater of a fiery asteroid-like event and can’t remember who he is or speak their language. Despite fearing him at first, they eventually learn that the man, dubbed the Stranger, is a wizard. Specifically, he’s one of the Istari, a powerful five-wizard order that includes Saruman, Radagast, the Blue Wizards, and Gandalf. (Is the Stranger in fact Gandalf? More on that later.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What are the humans doing in all of this? Well, there’s a lengthy and mostly inconsequential subplot about the less fortunate humans of the Southlands, who discover some orc tunnels and a hilt of a sword that the leader of the orc army, Adar, is searching for. By the end of the season, their land is covered in the fire and ash of Mount Doom’s eruption, officially turning the Southlands into Mordor, i.e., what becomes Sauron’s evil realm. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The fancier humans are in Númenor, the island kingdom that is, by the time of the events of <em>The Lord of the Rings,</em> swallowed by the sea. But right now, it’s a gorgeous, gleaming urban paradise, ruled by queen regent Míriel and her adviser Pharazôn, who clearly wants the throne for himself. Another important guy here is Isildur, or at least we know he <em>will</em> be. He’s the son of captain Elendil, and goes to fight the orcs in the Southlands with his father and is presumed dead when the volcano erupts (though, obviously, he survives). </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Our final image is of Sauron, fully mask-off, standing on the edge of Mordor, ready to take back what’s his.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>I thought Sauron was a giant fiery eyeball?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He is in Jackson’s <em>The Lord of the Rings </em>trilogy. But before all that, Sauron was a primordial spirit, or Maiar, capable of shape-shifting. Known by many names throughout his thousand-year life (?), Sauron was a servant of the Dark Lord Morgoth before becoming the Dark Lord himself. In the Second Age, when The Rings of Power takes place, he appears to the elves in various angelic “fair forms,” sometimes as Annatar, handsome “Lord of Gifts,” in order to deceive them. </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-29-at-2.21.14 PM.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.826700321134,100,78.346599357733" alt="Sauron as Annatar" title="Sauron as Annatar" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Sauron-as-Annatar, who is admittedly less hunky than last season’s Sauron-as-Halbrand, though still played by the same actor. | Amazon Studios" data-portal-copyright="Amazon Studios" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s also a cool scene at the beginning of season two where Sauron, after being killed in his human form as a different blonde man (not to be confused with the hunky Halbrand, who is an invention of Amazon, not Tolkien, and is confusingly also played by the same actor as Sauron-as-Annatar), regenerates in a pool of black blood and becomes an undulating evil mass of goop. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It also kind of doesn’t even matter how Sauron is represented on screen: The fiery eyeball thing, for instance, isn’t even entirely accurate to the books, which only vaguely describe what Sauron looks like. Dig any deeper into this, however, and you’re fully in some serious Tolkienian weeds (here’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdX7YeY_uPg">discussion of this topic</a>, if you’re interested).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>So is the Stranger Gandalf?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Theories that the Stranger is indeed Gandalf appeared as soon as he came flying down to earth in season one. The evidence for this is mostly that a) he’s a benevolent old wizard with a fondness for halflings and b) he echoes a line spoken by Gandalf thousands of years later: “When in doubt, always follow your nose.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://collider.com/lord-of-the-rings-rings-of-power-season-2-the-stranger/">In a roundtable with the showrunners</a>, McKay sort-of-but-didn’t answer the million-dollar question: “Despite what some folks might think, we’re really not about a game, we’re really not about a puzzle. But we also don’t wanna take for granted where characters will end up … I’m trying to say it but not say it.” Helpful!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Back to Tom Bombadil! What’s he doing there?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tom Bombadil, who appears in the pages of <em>The Fellowship of the Ring </em>as an entity as old as time itself (“Tom was here before the river and the trees”), is a jolly old bearded man who speaks in nonsensical rhyme and verse. He famously does very little — the Hobbits mainly just hang out at his house for a while before heading on their way — which is likely why he wasn’t included in the films. And from what it sounds like, he won’t be doing a ton in <em>The Rings of Power,</em> either. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">McKay <a href="https://archive.is/39YoS#selection-849.125-849.379">explained to Vanity Fair</a> that his role is to “nudge the Stranger along his journey.” Whether his appearance is little more than fan service remains to be seen.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-29-at-2.20.52 PM.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.670655696834,100,78.658688606333" alt="Nori in Rhûn" title="Nori in Rhûn" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Nori the harfoot, hanging out in Rhûn. | Amazon Studios" data-portal-copyright="Amazon Studios" />
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>There are deserts in </strong><strong><em>The Lord of the Rings</em></strong><strong>?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes, but they haven’t been depicted on screen until now. At the beginning of season two, Poppy, Nori, and the Stranger are traveling through Rhûn, a desert in the far east of Middle-earth (here <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23331136/lord-of-the-rings-middle-earth-map-rings-of-power">is a helpful map</a>). We also get to see Forodwaith, a snow-covered tundra in the far north.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>How much of </strong><strong><em>The Rings of Power</em></strong><strong> is Tolkien canon?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The broad strokes of the plot — namely, the forging of the rings — are all canon, just with a much more condensed and tweaked timeline. But a lot of the rest of it isn’t.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Besides the many invented characters, the telling of the story is a marked difference from the books and Jackson’s films, which follow a single, straightforward plot that obscures almost nothing from the viewer. Characters in <em>The Lord of the Rings </em>are usually presented clearly as either good or evil, with the notable exception of someone like Boromir, who tries to take the ring from Frodo, but only for a worthy cause (using the One Ring to lead the human kingdom of Gondor to victory over Sauron).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>The Rings of Power </em>takes a far more modern perspective by filling Middle-earth with legions of Boromirs, characters with complex morals, trauma backstories, and not-always-clear motives. We don’t always know what sort of quest they’re on, or whether they’re even on a quest at all. While this might sound in theory like it makes for more compelling TV, it doesn’t necessarily capture the magic of the source material.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Okay, but is season two worth watching?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Depends on who you ask. As a <em>LOTR</em> fan, I’ll continue to watch solely because it’s a thrill to see events only alluded to in the books and films come alive on screen, and I found the first three episodes to be an improvement from season one. Now that the table is set, per McKay, the plot isn’t as focused on setting up mysteries that only somewhat pay off after sitting through eight hour-long-plus episodes where little of substance occurs. Which is good!  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the second season still suffers from some of the same problems, namely by prioritizing beautiful visuals over pacing and character development. Variety’s Alison Herman <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/tv-reviews/lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-power-season-2-review-boring-slog-1236120096/">called it</a> “a boring slog” and “lifeless,” writing that she could hardly think of anything memorable about its characters or scenes. Like Herman, I also found myself disoriented by much of the plot, despite being relatively familiar with the lore. If it can’t hook someone like me, it’s difficult to imagine <em>LOTR</em> newbies getting on board. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s what happens when an overall pretty straightforward story gets dragged out over 50 hours and five long seasons: You get filler, you get “mysteries” that aren’t all that mysterious, and you get storylines that commit the cardinal sins of failing to capture viewers’ attentions and failing to pay off. I can’t see how McKay and Payne are going to solve this problem within the next three seasons — all of this could have been done in one! — but at the very least, it’ll make for a lot of really cool-looking television that people get to complain about on the internet.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Welcome to Kids Today! I’m Anna North, a senior correspondent at Vox covering policy and culture, and today, I&#8217;m launching a Vox newsletter that will have me in readers’ inboxes weekly with stories about Generation Alpha (people born between 2010 and 2024) and American childhood.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a newsletter about kids — for everyone. If you&#8217;d like to receive it, sign up&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/pages/kids-today-newsletter-policy-childhood-policy-culture" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’m a parent of two young kids, but I’m not here to talk to you about parenting. For that, I recommend <a href="https://sarapetersen.substack.com/">Sara Petersen</a> or <a href="https://www.angelagarbes.com/">Angela Garbes</a>. In this newsletter, I want to focus on the experience of actually being a kid in America right now. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Childhood in 2024 is an incredibly fraught topic. We&#8217;re all trying to make sense of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/02/01/upshot/learning-loss-school-districts.html">aftermath of a pandemic</a>, the <a href="https://www.vox.com/24127431/smartphones-young-kids-children-parenting-social-media-teen-mental-health">impact of social media</a>, and the effects of <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/2023/7/11/23789940/climate-change-parenting-should-you-have-kids-elizabeth-cripps-the-gray-area">climate change</a> and <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2023/10/how-to-talk-about-the-news-with-kids.html">war</a> on the world kids grow up in. Children have also taken an outsize role in the upcoming presidential election, with Sen. JD Vance and others arguing that having kids is a patriotic duty, and not having them makes you “<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/trump-women-get-what-vance-meant-about-childless-cat-ladies">deranged</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Part of my goal with this newsletter is to get deep into some of the most heated debates around contemporary childhood and give you an accessible, panic-free look at what’s really going on. I worry about kids today (the demographic, not this newsletter, although I’m sure I’ll worry about it too) as much as anyone, but I also know that every generation has freaked out about the youngsters on its lawn, and I want to approach <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-03-22/generation-alpha-millennial-children">today’s scary headlines</a> with a dose of skepticism.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I also want to bring you a portrait of Gen Alpha that tackles what’s unique about this group of young Americans, as well as what they have in common with Gen Z, millennials, and beyond. We live in a time of intense and fast-paced generational warfare, and while some of that is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/20/style/gen-z-crew-socks-ankle-millennials.html">pretty fun and funny</a>, I also want to look at where these generalizations fall short.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’ll acknowledge that I am an imperfect guide to the world of kids. As a grownup, I am inherently uncool. I will never understand kid culture as well as kids themselves do. My own older kid likes to call me “Guy Who Doesn’t Know Anything.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, I’ve been talking to kids — from <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/23148897/covid-pandemic-kids-toddlers-babies-preschool-school">preschoolers</a> to <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/21/17120340/gun-control-walkout-march-2018-boys-florida-school-shooting">teenagers</a> — as part of my reporting process for nearly a decade now. I’m committed to meeting kids on their level, with curiosity, openness, and honesty. While I’ll definitely talk to adult experts for this newsletter, I’ll be bringing you the voices of actual children whenever possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kids are us before our filters fully developed, when the world was still fresh and strange and confusing. Kids are unpredictable. (My 6-year-old, for example, just asked me if worms can do yoga. Yes?)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But kids are also smart and thoughtful. They have sharp insights about the world today, and about the future when they’ll be in charge. I’m excited to learn from them, and I hope you are too.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Next week, you’ll get a full newsletter from me about what kids think about “Gen Alpha” as a concept — how they see their own generation, and what they think about TikToks and news stories that criticize them. In the meantime, here’s a little of what I’m reading and thinking about as summer winds down:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/2024/08/school-supply-lists-put-kalamazoo-area-families-in-back-to-school-bind.html">School supply lists</a> are always an issue this time of year — with district budgets often insufficient, families or teachers end up on the hook for purchasing everything from pencils to graphing calculators. I’m also interested in how kids think about back-to-school shopping, and to what extent the financial stresses of this process trickle down to them.</li>



<li>Kids’ relationship to nature is determined more by their socioeconomic status than by whether they live in the city or the suburbs, <a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-08-socioeconomics-children-nature.html">according to a new study</a>.</li>



<li>More states are moving to <a href="https://www.k12dive.com/news/school-chaplain-bills-2023-2024-louisiana-texas-florida/725166/">place chaplains in public schools</a>, concerning some who worry that these clergy members may proselytize, or offer counseling to students without proper mental-health training.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/style/dance-parties-kids.html">Kid-friendly dance parties</a>, where parents can enjoy house music with toddlers in tow, are apparently on the rise in Brooklyn. I was prepared to be annoyed by this but actually it is sweet.</li>



<li>Right now my older kid is obsessively watching <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81288010"><em>Bread Barbershop</em></a>, an animated show about a slice of bread who is a barber.</li>



<li>My little kid does not want to read <a href="https://www.chroniclebooks.com/products/spring-is-here?srsltid=AfmBOor3MxlaVL5uOJTUBo9ao7vCbTIWluTBMvXZ2K-tALAApuN-aoJH"><em>Spring is Here</em></a>, by Taro Gomi, a soothing story about the inevitable cycling of seasons that helped keep me sane during the pandemic. He wants to read a book that makes vrooming sounds, and that I will not name.</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A final note: I’d love to hear your questions about kids and childhood, whether you’re a parent, a childfree adult, or a kid! (Kids with questions about grownups are also welcome to write in.) Are there topics you want me to cover? Experiences you want to share? You can reach me at <a href="mailto:anna.north@vox.com">anna.north@vox.com</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ah, yes, late August in the Midwest:&nbsp;a time for popsicles by the lake, a trip to the county fair, and, of course, extreme humidity made more miserable by … corn sweat.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Corn sweat. It’s a thing! And people are talking about it.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">CORN SWEAT Is swamping the Midwest. 🌽🌽🌽<br><br>One acre of mature corn can release 3,000 gallons per day! This adds to the extreme mugginess we are currently feeling. <a href="https://t.co/Ot6QjoabBt">pic.twitter.com/Ot6QjoabBt</a></p>&mdash; Chris Vickers (@ChrisWTOL) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisWTOL/status/1828173597485253001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The term refers to the moisture released by fields of corn during hot and sunny weather. Like all other plants, corn transpires —&nbsp;meaning, it sucks up water from the ground and expels it into the air as a way to stay cool and distribute nutrients.&nbsp;Moisture also enters the air when water in the soil evaporates. Together with transpiration, this process is called evapotranspiration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, where you find loads of plants packed tightly into one place, whether the Amazon rainforest or Iowa, humidity can skyrocket during hot and especially sunny periods, making the air feel oppressive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s what happened this week: A late-summer heat wave brought <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/weather/chicago-marks-hottest-day-of-2024-sets-new-temperature-record/3533202/">record</a> and near-record temperatures to parts of the Midwest where there also happen to be vast fields of corn. With plenty of sunlight and temperatures in the high 90s, it was enough to make corn sweat, producing extremely uncomfortable weather.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not that corn sweats more than other plants — an acre releases less moisture on average than, say, <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/evapotranspiration-and-water-cycle">a large oak tree</a> —&nbsp;but the Midwest has a lot of corn in late August. In Iowa, for example, more than two-thirds of the area is farmland, and corn is the top crop (followed by soybeans, which, by the way, also sweat).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The combination of higher temperatures and increased humidity from corn sweat can lead to more intense heat waves, making it more <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/354977/heat-wave-wet-bulb-temperature-climate">challenging for people to stay cool</a> and increasing the risk of heat-related illnesses,” said <a href="https://basso.glg.msu.edu/">Bruno Basso</a>, a crop and agriculture scientist at Michigan State University.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sweating corn is a totally natural process; it’s not like it harms the crop. But when it causes humidity to spike, loads of evapotranspiration can be dangerous for those who work outside, vulnerable groups like the elderly or <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/351471/heat-waves-increase-the-number-of-risky-premature-births">pregnant</a>, and those who can’t afford air conditioning.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Is corn sweat a growing concern?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One confusing thing to keep in mind is that evapotranspiration tends to cool<em> </em>the surrounding air, Basso said, because the process absorbs heat. This is one reason why a forest or prairie typically feels cooler than a parking lot on a hot day. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet during extreme heat waves, which are <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-heat-waves#:~:text=Heat%20waves%20are%20occurring%20more,and%202020s%20(Figure%201).">becoming more common</a> as companies spew carbon dioxide into the air, “the dynamics change,” Basso said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Despite the cooling effect of evapotranspiration, the heightened humidity can offset it, making heat waves feel even more intense,” Basso told me. It also prevents temperatures from cooling off at night, he added, when you might normally feel relief.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In one 2020 <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019JD031941">study</a>, researchers from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics analyzed a past summer heat wave in the Midwest and found that cropland —&nbsp;most of which comprised corn in this part of the country — can increase moisture in the air above it by up to 40 percent.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/GettyImages-583842534.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4613147178592,100,93.077370564282" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A cornfield in southwest Iowa. | Darcy Maulsby/Getty Images/iStockphoto" data-portal-copyright="Darcy Maulsby/Getty Images/iStockphoto" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Again, it’s not just crops across the Midwest that release moisture, increase humidity, and make summers feel disgusting (I know firsthand; I grew up in Iowa). The millions of acres of prairie that industrial farmland replaced&nbsp;—&nbsp;mostly to feed livestock and make ethanol —&nbsp;would have also produced loads of moisture, Basso said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there are some key differences between native ecosystems and industrial farmland, he added. “Native prairies are diverse ecosystems with a variety of plant species, each with different root depths and water needs, helping to create a balanced moisture cycle,” he told me. “In contrast, corn and soy monocultures are uniform and can draw water from the soil more quickly.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Densely planted rows of corn drain water from the soil, which can deepen droughts, he said. Droughts are becoming <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-12516-7">more extreme</a> in some parts of the US, though this is less of a concern in the Midwest, which is <a href="https://climatechange.chicago.gov/climate-impacts/climate-impacts-midwest">projected</a> to get wetter in the coming decades.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When you put all of this together, you have giant fields of corn grown to feed cows that make the Midwest more humid during heat waves and worsen other climate extremes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Basically, corn sweat is just as disgusting as it sounds.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The weirdest thing happened to me recently. I ordered some groceries on Amazon Fresh. When you check out, Amazon recommends more things you might like to buy, usually related to your purchase. But this time, Amazon offered up “Treatments for High Cholesterol” along with a link for an Amazon One Medical consultation as well as links to prescription medications.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s weird, because my doctor and my wife are the only people who know about my cholesterol numbers. They’re pretty good, too! But there are certainly data points, including my age, my food preferences, and my past purchases, maybe even <a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/wellness/blood-tests-heart-disease-20d4d2f0">news stories I’ve read elsewhere on the web</a>, that might suggest <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/06/16/style/millennial-dad-style-culture.html">I’d be a good candidate for a statin</a>, the type of cholesterol-lowering medication Amazon recommended to me. And while I’m used to Amazon recommending books I might like or cleaning products I might want to buy again, it felt pretty creepy to push prescription drugs in my direction.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s entirely possible that the Amazon recommendations I saw on this particular grocery order were random. The next time I ordered groceries, the app recommended bacon, not statins. At first, I thought it may have been a test or a mistake on Amazon’s part, but when I asked what was behind the recommendations, the company confirmed that it was a feature, not a bug.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Amazon displays products that may be related or similar to the current item purchased,”  Amazon spokesperson Samantha Kruse said in an email. “Protected health information from Amazon Health Services, including Amazon One Medical and Amazon Pharmacy, is not used to market or advertise general merchandise in the broader Amazon store.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In other words, Amazon might use information from your purchases to suggest prescription medications, but it won&#8217;t use your protected medical information to try to sell you other stuff.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Simply seeing Amazon target me for a health condition draws attention to the unnerving amount of information Amazon has gleaned from my online activity — as well as the fact that <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/amazons-creep-into-health-care-has-some-experts-spooked/">Amazon is a health care company</a>, one that can collect troves of data and push customers toward treatments accordingly.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It may not be surprising that Amazon is operating with an extremely powerful amount of data about us and what we buy. But in the past four years, Amazon has launched its own pharmacy business and bought One Medical, a primary care startup that could connect Amazon customers directly with doctors.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s clear that Amazon’s health care ambitions are huge. We don’t yet know exactly how that will change the Amazon shopping experience for everyone — but maybe my recent shopping experience was a preview.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before I get too riled up about Dr. Amazon, let’s take a closer look at what the retail giant knows about its customers and how.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Amazon-pills.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,37.935173577825,100,24.129652844349" alt="A screenshot from Amazon shows grocery delivery times and some suggested treatments for high cholesterol. " title="A screenshot from Amazon shows grocery delivery times and some suggested treatments for high cholesterol. " data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="After a recent Amazon Fresh grocery order, I got a list of recommendations for prescription drugs to treat high cholesterol. | Vox/Amazon" data-portal-copyright="Vox/Amazon" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Amazon is famously known as the Everything Store, where you can buy everything <a href="https://www.amazon.com/battery-acid/s?k=battery+acid">from battery acid</a> to, well, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cholesterol+medication+pharmacy&amp;i=amazon-pharmacy&amp;ref=health-hva-widget-top_phm_2_statins">statins</a>. Like most websites, Amazon also collects data about your activity on the site, like the things you buy, the things you don’t buy, and the things you consider buying. It creates a profile based on those interests and uses algorithms to recommend things that you might like to buy next. Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.science/the-history-of-amazons-recommendation-algorithm">is proud of these algorithms</a>. (The total amount of data that Amazon collects about you <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/27/the-data-game-what-amazon-knows-about-you-and-how-to-stop-it">extends well beyond your shopping habits, by the way</a>.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then there’s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/30/amazons-advertising-revenue-jumps-24percent-in-first-quarter.html">Amazon’s booming ad business</a>. The company’s advertising arm <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/among-companies-amazon-s-ad-surge-overshadows-everything">now rivals</a> the Google and Meta duopoly that has dominated online advertising for years, thanks in part <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/20/technology/amazon-ads-advertising.html">to the massive amount of data Amazon has</a> about what people buy, what they watch, where they live, and so forth. Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=GLVB9XDF9M8MU7UZ">says</a> it uses “cookies, pixels, IP addresses, and other technologies” to target these ads, which is why you can find Amazon tracking bugs on websites <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-tracking-how-to-stop-it/">all over the web</a>. These trackers could, for example, know if I looked up a health-related question on WebMD and use that data to tailor recommendations on Amazon, according to <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/christo-wilson/">Christo Wilson</a>, a computer science professor at Northeastern University.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There may be an Amazon tracker lurking on the page, monitoring what you’re doing, and that’s how you can potentially have these kinds of freaky advertising,” Wilson told me.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Or,  more likely, maybe it was simply a pattern in my purchase history. My grocery order that triggered the cholesterol medication recommendation included shredded cheese, salsa, tomatoes, flour tortillas — and, notably, ground chicken. Was this a tell? It is, after all, a heart-healthy alternative to ground beef and taco night was on the horizon.<strong> I also purchased the fat free version of Coffee Mate French Vanilla coffee creamer, which is delicious and cholesterol free.</strong> But do these purchases make me an obvious target for a cholesterol consultation with Amazon One Medical? And either way, should my Amazon purchases be associated with Amazon’s health care services at all?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Amazon One Medical is a relatively new service. Amazon bought One Medical <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/2022/7/amazon-and-one-medical-sign-an-agreement-for-amazon-to-acquire-one-medical">in 2022</a>, and combined it with its Amazon Clinic telehealth service <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/introducing-amazon-one-medical">earlier this summer</a>. Now, Prime members can pay $99 a year to gain access to care through Amazon One Medical. For $5 a year, Prime members can get access to discounted medications <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-health-amazoncom-inc-business-medication-210271424588592ebbbd63c2c34a412b">with the Amazon Pharmacy RxPass</a>. While I am a Prime member, I am not an Amazon One Medical customer, and I do not use Amazon Pharmacy. So, considering my choice in my healthy tacos, an algorithm might surmise that, as someone who’s proactive about his health care needs, I might be interested in Amazon’s health care offerings.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Amazon bought One Medical, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/2210191amazononemedicalkhanslaughterwilsonbedoya.pdf">the FTC</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/23/amazon-one-medical-deal-gives-it-access-to-my-most-personal-info.html">others</a> raised concerns over Amazon’s creep into the health care industry and what that might mean for sensitive health data. It was around this time that the Washington Post reported that customers <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/05/01/amazon-clinic-hipaa-privacy/">signed away some of their health privacy rights</a> when they enrolled in Amazon Clinic. None of this has made me feel any better about whether it was legal for Amazon to use my complex purchase history to sell me targeted health care products.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As far as I know, Amazon can. HIPAA, the federal law that protects health privacy, <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22363011/hipaa-not-hippa-explained-health-privacy">is narrower than most people think</a>. It only applies to health care providers, insurers, and companies that manage medical records. HIPAA requires those entities to protect your data as it moves between them, but it wouldn’t apply to your Amazon purchases, according to Suzanne Bernstein, a legal fellow at the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“That background is especially important, as Amazon and other companies continue to collect, process, and use tremendous amounts of consumer health data that falls outside of HIPAA scope,” Bernstein said. “And it’s not the fault of American consumers for not necessarily knowing all that.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the absence of any federal protections, some states have passed their own data privacy laws. While California <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/12/30/21030754/ccpa-2020-california-privacy-law-rights-explained">is perhaps most famous</a> for giving its citizens more control over their data, Washington state changed the conversation around health data privacy when it <a href="https://epic.org/alive-and-kicking-washington-states-my-health-my-data-act-goes-into-effect-today/">enacted its My Health My Data Act</a><strong> </strong>last year. This law defines consumer health data much more broadly, Bernstein explained, so that any information about a consumer’s past, present, or future health conditions is covered. That might mean that Washington residents have the right to some privacy when their Amazon purchases indicate a health condition. It’s so far unclear how the law might apply to Amazon, which is based in Washington.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’m still making sense of my recent brush with statins on Amazon and still have more questions than answers. Does Amazon plan to target its customers with prescription drug recommendations on a regular basis? Am I the only one who thinks that feels more invasive than convenient? Or does Amazon know what the people really want, even if it feels a little creepy at first?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I can’t know the answers to these questions. One thing I do know: Taco night with heart-healthy ground chicken is a hit.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Editor’s note, August 28, 7:50 pm ET: </strong>This story was originally published on July 19, 2024, and has been updated to reflect news that SB 1047 passed this week.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">California state Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) is generally known for <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/8/21/23831121/housing-yimbys-affordable-rent-unions-california">his</a> relentless <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/19/17135678/sb-827-cars-california-transit-trains-buses">bills</a> on <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/12/7/18125644/scott-wiener-sb-50-california-housing">housing</a> and <a href="https://www.sf.gov/news/mayor-breed-and-senator-wiener-announce-state-legislation-shut-down-sale-stolen-goods-san">public safety</a>, a legislative record that made him one of the tech industry’s favorite legislators.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">His introduction of the “Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models” bill, however, gained the ire of that very same industry, with VC heavyweights Andreessen-Horowitz and Y Combinator <a href="https://www.transformernews.ai/p/a16z-y-combinator-big-tech-sb1047-lobbying">publicly condemning</a> the bill. Known as SB 1047, the legislation requires companies to train “frontier models” that cost more than $100 million to do safety testing and be able to shut off their models in the event of a safety incident. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Tuesday, the bill passed California’s state legislature 41-9 — albeit with amendments softening some of its grip. For it to become state law, it needs Gov. Gavin Newsom’s signature next.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I spoke with Wiener back in July about SB 1047 and its critics; our conversation is below (condensed for length and clarity).  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Kelsey Piper: I wanted to present you with challenges to SB 1047 I’ve heard and give you a chance to answer them. I think one category of concern here is that the bill would prohibit using a model publicly, or making it available for public use, if it poses an unreasonable risk of critical harm. </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s an unreasonable risk? Who decides what’s reasonable? A lot of Silicon Valley is very regulator-skeptical, so they don’t trust that discretion will be used and not abused. </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Sen. Scott Wiener: </strong>To me, SB 1047 is a light-touch bill in a lot of ways. It’s a serious bill, it’s a big bill. I think it’s an impactful bill, but it’s not hardcore. The bill doesn’t require a license. There are people including some CEOs who <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/should-ai-development-require-license-chatgpts-creator-thinks-so-experts-disagree">have said</a> there should be a licensure requirement. I rejected that.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are people who think <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/2/7/24062374/ai-openai-anthropic-deepmind-legal-liability-gabriel-weil">there should be strict liability</a>. That’s the rule for most product liability. I rejected that.&nbsp;[AI companies] do not have to get permission from an agency to release the [model]. They have to do the safety testing they all say they are currently doing or intend to do. And if that safety testing reveals a significant risk — and we define those risks as being catastrophic — then you have to put mitigations in place. Not to eliminate the risk but to try to reduce it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are already legal standards today&nbsp;that if a developer releases a model and then that model ends up being used in a way that harms someone or something, you can be sued and it’ll probably be a negligence standard about whether you acted reasonably. It’s much, much broader than the liability that we create in the bill. In the bill, only the Attorney General can sue, whereas under tort law anybody can sue. Model developers are already subject to potential liability that’s much broader than this.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Yes, I’ve seen some objections to the bill that seem to revolve around misunderstandings of tort law, like people <a href="https://x.com/AndrewYNg/status/1798753608974139779">saying</a>, “This would be like making the makers of engines liable for car accidents.”</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And they are. If someone crashes a car and there was something about the engine design that contributed to that collision, then the engine maker can be sued. It would have to be proven that they did something negligent.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’ve talked to startup founders about it and VCs and folks from the large tech companies, and I’ve never heard a rebuttal to the reality that liability exists today and the liability that exists today is profoundly broader.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We definitely hear contradictions. Some people who were <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/355212/ai-artificial-intelligence-1047-bill-safety-liability">opposing</a> it were saying “this is all science fiction, anyone focused on safety is part of a cult, it’s not real, the capabilities are so limited.” Of course that’s not true. These are powerful models with huge potential to make the world a better place. I’m really excited for AI. I’m not a doomer in any respect. And then they say, “We can’t possibly be liable if these catastrophes happen.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1e0ts13/the_perils_of_californias_sb_1047_a_threat_to/">Another challenge</a> to the bill is that&nbsp;open source developers have benefited a lot from Meta putting [the generously licensed, sometimes called open source&nbsp;AI model] Llama out there, and they’re understandably scared that this bill will make Meta less willing to do releases in the future, out of a fear of liability. Of course, if a model is genuinely extremely dangerous, no one wants it released. But the worry is that the concerns might just make companies way too conservative.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In terms of open source, including and not limited to Llama, I’ve taken the critiques from the open source community really, really seriously. We interacted with people in the open source community and we made amendments in direct response to the open source community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The shutdown provision requirement [a provision in the bill that requires model developers to have the capability to enact a full shutdown of a covered model, to be able to “unplug it” if things go south] was very high on the list of what person after person was concerned about.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We made an amendment making it crystal clear that once the model is not in your possession, you are not responsible for being able to shut it down. Open source folks who open source a model are not responsible for being able to shut it down.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">This story was first featured in the <a href="https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup">Future Perfect newsletter</a>.</h2>

</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And then the other thing we did was make an amendment about folks who were fine-tuning. If you make more than minimal changes to the model, or significant changes to the model, then at some point it effectively becomes a new model and the original developer is no longer liable. And there are a few other smaller amendments but those are the big ones we made in direct response to the open source community.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Another challenge I’ve heard is: Why are you focusing on this and not all of California’s more pressing problems?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When you work on any issue, you hear people say, “Don’t you have more important things to work on?” Yeah, I work <a href="https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/san-francisco-housing-approval-times-plummet-senator-scott-wieners-landmark-housing-law-takes">incessantly on housing</a>. I work on <a href="https://www.calbhbc.org/uploads/5/8/5/3/58536227/sb_855_-_fact_sheet_and_background_info.pdf">mental health and addiction treatment</a>. I work incessantly on <a href="https://abc7news.com/scott-wiener-speed-governors-pedestrian-safety-california-bills-streets-safer/14356386/">public safety</a>. I have an <a href="https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/senate-passes-senator-wiener-bills-crack-down-car-break-ins">auto break-ins bill</a> and a <a href="https://www.sf.gov/news/mayor-breed-and-senator-wiener-announce-state-legislation-shut-down-sale-stolen-goods-san">bill on people selling stolen goods on the streets</a>.&nbsp;And I’m also working on a bill to make sure we both foster AI innovation and do it in a responsible way.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a policymaker, I’ve been very pro-tech. I’m a supporter of our tech environment, which is often under attack. I’ve <a href="https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/senator-wieners-net-neutrality-law-upheld-federal-appeals-court">supported</a> California’s net neutrality law that fosters an open and free internet.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But I have also seen with technology that we fail to get ahead of what are sometimes very obvious problems. We did that with data privacy. We finally got a data privacy law here in California — and for the record, the opposition to that said all of the same things, that it’ll destroy innovation, that no one will want to work here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">My goal here is to create tons of space for innovation and at the same time promote responsible deployment and training and release of these models. This argument that this is going to squash innovation, that it’s going to push companies out of California — again, we hear that with pretty much every bill. But I think it’s important to understand this bill doesn&#8217;t just apply to people who develop their models in California, it applies to everyone who does business in California. So you can be in Miami, but unless you’re going to disconnect from California — and you’re not — you have to do this.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I wanted to talk about one of the interesting elements of the debate over this bill, which is the fact it’s wildly popular everywhere except in Silicon Valley. It <a href="https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/bipartisan-vote-senate-passes-senator-wieners-landmark-ai-safety-and-innovation-bill">passed</a> the state senate 32-1, with bipartisan approval. <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/65ea6ad22e449b11a1df46b0/t/6694cb31c6758b310ba372f2/1721027377736/SB+1047+poll+memo.pdf">77 percent of Californians are in favor</a> according to one poll, more than half strongly in favor.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>But the people who hate it, they’re all in San Francisco. How did this end up being your bill?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In some ways I’m the best author for this bill, representing San Francisco, because I’m surrounded and immersed in AI. The origin story of this bill was that I started talking with a bunch of front-line AI technologists, startup founders. This was early 2023, and I started having a series of salons and dinners with AI folks. And some of these ideas started forming. So in a way I’m the best author for it because I have access to unbelievably brilliant folks in tech. In another way I’m the worst author because I have folks in San Francisco who are not happy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>There’s something I struggle with as a reporter, which is conveying to people who aren’t in San Francisco, who aren’t in those conversations, that AI is something really, really big, really high stakes.</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s very exciting. Because when you start trying to envision — could we have a cure for cancer? Could we have highly effective treatments for a broad range of viruses? Could we have breakthroughs in clean energy that no one ever envisioned? So many exciting possibilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But with every powerful technology comes risk. [This bill] is not about eliminating risk. Life is about risk. But how do we make sure that&nbsp;at least our eyes are wide open? That we understand that risk and that if there’s a way to reduce risk, we take it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s all we’re asking with this bill, and I think the vast majority of people will support that.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If I build a car that is far more dangerous than other cars, don’t do any safety testing, release it, and it ultimately leads to people getting killed, I will probably be held liable and have to pay damages, if not criminal penalties.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If I build a search engine that (unlike Google) has as the first result for “how can I commit a mass murder” detailed instructions on how best to carry out a spree killing, and someone uses my search engine and follows the instructions, I likely won’t be held liable, thanks largely to <a href="https://www.edelmanglobaladvisory.com/insights/five-facts-know-scotus-case-social-media-laws#:~:text=Section%20230%20of%20the%20Communications,moderate%20content%20in%20certain%20circumstances.">Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So here’s a question: Is an AI assistant more like a car, where we can expect manufacturers to do safety testing or be liable if they get people killed? Or is it more like a search engine?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is one of the questions animating the current raging discourse in tech over <a href="https://digitaldemocracy.calmatters.org/bills/ca_202320240sb1047">California’s SB 1047</a>, newly passed<strong> </strong>legislation that mandates safety training for that companies that spend more than $100 million on training a “frontier model” in AI — like the in-progress GPT-5. Otherwise, they would be liable if their AI system leads to a “mass casualty event” or more than $500 million in damages in a single incident or set of closely linked incidents.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The general concept that AI developers should be liable for the harms of the technology they are creating is <a href="https://theaipi.org/poll-shows-voters-oppose-open-sourcing-ai-models-support-regulatory-representation-on-boards-and-say-ai-risks-outweigh-benefits-2/#:~:text=Among%20the%20findings%3A,that%20believe%20they%20should%20not">overwhelmingly popular</a> with the American public. It also earned <a href="https://www.wate.com/business/press-releases/ein-presswire/714330132/california-senate-bill-sb-1047-another-stifling-blow-to-silicon-valley-ai-startups/">endorsements</a> from Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio, two of the <a href="https://analyticsindiamag.com/meet-the-worlds-most-cited-deep-learning-researchers-whose-innovations-are-transforming-the-industry/">most-cited AI researchers in the world</a>.&nbsp;Even Elon Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1828205685386936567" data-type="link" data-id="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1828205685386936567">rang in support Monday evening,</a> saying that even though “this is a tough call and will make some people upset,” the state should pass the bill, regulating AI just as “we regulate any product/technology that is a potential risk to the public.”<strong><br></strong><br>The amended version of the bill, which was less stringent than its <a href="https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/bipartisan-vote-senate-passes-senator-wieners-landmark-ai-safety-and-innovation-bill" data-type="link" data-id="https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/bipartisan-vote-senate-passes-senator-wieners-landmark-ai-safety-and-innovation-bill">previous iteration</a>, passed the state legislature Wednesday 41-9. <a href="https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/senator-wieners-groundbreaking-artificial-intelligence-bill-advances-assembly-floor-amendments" data-type="link" data-id="https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/senator-wieners-groundbreaking-artificial-intelligence-bill-advances-assembly-floor-amendments">Amendments</a> included removing criminal penalties for perjury, established a new threshold to protect startups’ ability to adjust open-sourced AI models, and narrowing (but not eliminating) pre-harm enforcement. For it to become state law, it will next need a signature from Gov. Gavin Newsom. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“SB 1047 — our AI safety bill — just passed off the Assembly floor,” wrote State Senator Scott Wiener on X. “I’m proud of the diverse coalition behind this bill — a coalition that deeply believes in both innovation &amp; safety. AI has so much promise to make the world a better place.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Would it destroy the AI industry to hold it liable?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Criticism of the bill from much of the tech world, though, has been fierce.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Regulating basic technology will put an end to innovation,” Meta’s chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, <a href="https://x.com/ylecun/status/1798839294930379209">wrote in an X post denouncing 1047</a>. He <a href="https://x.com/ylecun/status/1800222175099765029">shared</a> other posts declaring that “it&#8217;s likely to destroy California’s fantastic history of technological innovation” and <a href="https://x.com/ylecun/status/1800222175099765029">wondered aloud</a>, “Does SB-1047, up for a vote by the California Assembly, spell the end of the Californian technology industry?” The CEO of HuggingFace, a leader in the AI open source community, <a href="https://x.com/ClementDelangue/status/1798801894527082584">called</a> the bill a “huge blow to both CA and US innovation.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These kinds of apocalyptic comments leave me wondering &#8230; did we read the same bill?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To be clear, to the extent 1047 imposes unnecessary burdens on tech companies, I do consider that an extremely bad outcome, even though the burdens will only fall on companies doing $100 million training runs, which will only be possible for the biggest firms. It’s entirely possible — and we’ve seen it <a href="https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/energy/improving-nuclear-regulatory-commission-public-engagement">in other industries</a> — for regulatory compliance to eat up a disproportionate share of peoples’ time and energy, discourage doing anything different or complicated, and focus energy on demonstrating compliance rather than where it’s needed most.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I don’t think the safety requirements in 1047 are unnecessarily onerous, but that’s because I agree with the half of machine learning researchers who believe that <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/1/10/24032987/ai-impacts-survey-artificial-intelligence-chatgpt-openai-existential-risk-superintelligence">powerful AI systems have a high chance of being catastrophically dangerous</a>. If I agreed with the half of machine learning researchers who dismiss such risks, I’d find 1047 to be a pointless burden, and I’d be pretty firmly opposed.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">This story was first featured in the <a href="https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup">Future Perfect newsletter</a>.</h2>

</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And to be clear, while the outlandish claims about 1047 don’t make sense, there are some reasonable worries. If you build an extremely powerful AI, fine-tune it to not help with mass murders, but then release the model open source so people can undo the fine-tuning and then use it for mass murders, under 1047’s formulation of responsibility you would still be liable for the damage done.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This would certainly discourage companies from publicly releasing models once they’re powerful enough to cause mass casualty events, or even once their creators think they might be powerful enough to cause mass casualty events.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The open source community is understandably worried that big companies will just decide the legally safest option is to never release anything. While I think any model that’s actually powerful enough to cause mass casualty events probably shouldn’t<em> </em>be released, it would certainly be a loss to the world (and to the cause of making AI systems safe) if models that had no such capacities were bogged down out of excess legalistic caution.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The claims that 1047 will be the end of the tech industry in California are guaranteed to age poorly, and they don’t even make very much sense on their face. Many of the posts decrying the bill seem to assume that under existing US law, you’re not liable if you build a dangerous AI that causes a mass casualty event. But you probably are already.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If you don’t take reasonable precautions against enabling other people to cause mass harm, by eg failing to install reasonable safeguards in your dangerous products, you <em>do </em>have a ton of liability exposure!” Yale law professor Ketan Ramakrishnan <a href="https://x.com/ketanr/status/1798794760087539841">responded</a> to one such <a href="https://x.com/AndrewYNg/status/1798753608974139779">post</a> by AI researcher Andrew Ng.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">1047 lays out more clearly what would constitute reasonable precautions, but it’s not inventing some new concept of liability law. Even if it doesn’t pass, companies should certainly expect to be sued if their AI assistants cause mass casualty events or hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do you really believe your AI models are safe?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The other baffling thing about LeCun and Ng’s advocacy here is that both have said that AI systems are actually completely safe and there are absolutely no grounds for worry about mass casualty scenarios in the first place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The reason I say that I don&#8217;t worry about AI turning evil is the same reason I don&#8217;t worry about overpopulation on Mars,” Ng <a href="https://www.wired.com/brandlab/2015/05/andrew-ng-deep-learning-mandate-humans-not-just-machines/#:~:text=The%20reason%20I%20say%20that,worry%20about%20this%20problem%20now%3F">famously said</a>. LeCun has <a href="https://x.com/ylecun/status/1789056141571375341">said</a> that one of his major objections to 1047 is that it’s meant to address sci-fi risks.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I certainly don’t want the California state government to spend its time addressing sci-fi risks, not when the state has <a href="https://calmatters.org/commentary/2024/05/california-budget-surplus-became-deficit/">very real problems</a>. But if critics are right that AI safety worries are nonsense, then the mass casualty scenarios won’t happen, and in 10 years we’ll all feel silly for worrying AI could cause mass casualty events at all. It might be very embarrassing for the authors of the bill, but it won’t result in the death of all innovation in the state of California.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So what’s driving the intense opposition? I think it’s that the bill has become a litmus test for precisely this question: whether AI might be dangerous and deserves to be regulated accordingly.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">SB 1047 does not actually require that much, but it is fundamentally premised on the notion that AI systems will potentially pose catastrophic dangers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">AI researchers are almost comically divided over whether that fundamental premise is correct. Many serious, well-regarded people with major contributions in the field say there’s no chance of catastrophe. Many other serious, well-regarded people with major contributions in the field say the chance is quite high.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-3-godfathers-says-regrets-104733538.html#:~:text=The%20three%20so%2Dcalled%20'godfathers,how%20the%20technology%20is%20evolving.&amp;text=The%20trio%20of%20computer%20scientists,million%20to%20share%20between%20them.">have been called</a> the three godfathers of AI, and they are now emblematic of the industry’s profound split over whether to take catastrophic AI risks seriously. SB 1047 takes them seriously. That’s either its greatest strength or its greatest mistake. It’s not shocking that LeCun, firmly on the skeptic side, takes the “mistake” perspective, while Bengio and Hinton welcome the bill.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’ve covered <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/2/22/23609499/masks-covid-coronavirus-cochrane-review-pandemic-science-studies-infection">plenty of scientific controversies</a>, and I’ve never encountered any with as little consensus on its core question as to whether to expect truly powerful AI systems to be possible soon — and if possible, to be dangerous.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Surveys repeatedly find the field divided nearly in half. With each new AI advance, senior leaders in the industry seem to continually double down on existing positions, rather than change their minds.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there’s a great deal at stake whether you think powerful AI systems might be dangerous or not. Getting our policy response right requires getting better at measuring what AIs can do, and better understanding which scenarios for harm are most worth a policy response. I have a great deal of respect for the researchers trying to answer those questions — and a great deal of frustration with the ones who try to treat them as already-closed questions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ukraine’s <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrlnl2vqe2o">President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</a> announced Tuesday that he has a new plan to end Russia’s years-long war on his country. Zelenskyy has only outlined the plan in broad strokes, but Russian President Vladimir Putin reiterated Wednesday that he’s not interested in a diplomatic resolution.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That rejection means Zelenskyy’s plan isn’t actually a realistic framework for ending the war any time soon. But it is nevertheless a useful document that outlines one scenario for how the war might end — and seems to be a tacit acknowledgement that Ukraine does not see a path to ending the conflict through force. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Zelenskyy outlined the plan’s four components as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Continuing Ukraine’s recent incursion into Russia’s Kursk region — troops entered the area in early August and now <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cvg58p0d55dt">hold more than 500 square miles of territory</a> in an effort to pull Russian troops away from the frontline in eastern Ukraine.</li>



<li>Ensuring “security architecture” — a vague element that likely refers to Ukraine’s potential membership in NATO and the European Union.</li>



<li>Receiving a “powerful package” — likely referring to weapons — which will push Russia to enter into negotiations. Ukraine has requested more arms from allies (Zelenskyy will also probably ask permission to use weapons in Russian territory, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/30/biden-ukraine-weapons-strike-russia-00160731">something that was until recently forbidden</a>).</li>



<li>Advancing an economic component — there’s little clarity about this piece of the plan, but it likely refers to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/sanctions-russia-ukraine-war-treasury-yellen-0c3bd0bd5511c9304c707e762d0c8e3e">increased sanctions on Russia</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The focus on weapons, security, and Kursk seems to suggest the overarching goal of the plan is to force Russia to the negotiation table through continued military action. Zelenskyy said he intends to present the plan to US President Joe Biden in September, when the Ukrainian president plans to attend the United Nations General Assembly, as well as to presidential candidates Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The success of this plan depends on [Biden],” Zelenskyy said Tuesday, in a seeming acknowledgement of the <a href="https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1828856837086543961?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">US’ and NATO allies’ role </a>in keeping Ukraine stocked with weapons. “Will they give what we have in this plan or not? Will we be free to use what we have in this plan or not?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But even as Zelenskyy discussed his plan to end the war — which has decimated large swaths of Ukraine’s southeast and driven <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/22/russian-exiles-unlikely-to-return">hundreds of thousands of Russians into exile</a> — Russia launched multiple air attacks against targets in southeastern and central Ukraine. Those attacks killed at least two people at a hotel in Zelenskyy’s hometown of Kryvyi Rih, and targeted nearly half of Ukraine’s regions, including the capital Kyiv and the<a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/8/20/23314161/ukraines-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-russia-united-nations"> Zaporizhzhia</a> region, the site of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/un-demands-russia-withdraw-europes-largest-nuclear-power-plant-ukraine-2024-07-11/">Europe’s largest nuclear power plant</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The path to peace is still extremely fraught; Zelenskyy’s plan doesn’t change that</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are still many barriers to peace. Chief among them is that Russia has flatly rejected the idea of a diplomatic end to the hostilities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The topic of negotiations at the moment has pretty much lost its relevance,” <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrlnl2vqe2o">Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov</a> said on Tuesday, echoing a line that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraines-zelenskiy-present-plan-biden-end-war-with-russia-2024-08-27/">Kremlin officials have stuck to since Ukrainian forces began capturing parts of Kursk</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not clear what might get Russia to sit down and negotiate, though <a href="https://x.com/jekavanagh?lang=en">Jennifer Kavanagh</a>, senior fellow and director of military analysis at Defense Priorities, a defense think tank, told Vox that there “could be an opportunity for one of these third parties” — such as India or Turkey, which have relationships with both Russia and Ukraine’s allies — “to play a big role” in the end of the war. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has so far refused to condemn Russia’s invasion, reportedly <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx28xrzzrxqo">offered Ukraine help with negotiating an end to the fighting</a>. Modi also reportedly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-spoke-with-indias-modi-kremlin-says-2024-08-27/">told Putin Tuesday</a> that he supported efforts for a peaceful, diplomatic resolution to the war — soon. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s difficult to say what a diplomatic end to the war might look like, and Zelenskyy’s plan doesn’t offer any suggestions. But according to <a href="https://www.rand.org/about/people/c/courtney_william.html">William Courtney</a>, an adjunct senior fellow at RAND and a diplomat who served in Russia and eastern Europe, an end may not look like “total surrender” or a political settlement, but rather something like a sustained ceasefire. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The danger with that arrangement, however, is that “Russians are notorious for violating their international commitment,” Courtney told Vox — meaning there’s no guarantee a ceasefire would be sustained. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For now, however, any path to peace seems to lie at the end of more fighting. And that means despite the impressive Kursk push and Zelenskyy’s plan, the prospect of an imminent peaceful resolution looks dim.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pavel Durov, the CEO and founder of messaging app Telegram, was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/french-judges-decide-next-step-durov-probe-2024-08-28/">charged in France on Wednesday with a number of crimes,</a> including complicity in drug trafficking and facilitating the spread of child sexual abuse material on the platform he created.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Durov was previously arrested in Paris on Saturday, and details about that arrest had been limited until Wednesday. Now, however, it is clear that the charges against Durov are part of a larger French investigation. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/08/26/pavel-durov-telegram-france-detention/">The Washington Post</a> has reported that French police have suggested that “child sex crimes” are an area of particular focus for officials.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Following Wednesday’s indictment, Durov was required to post 5 million euros (about $5.5 million) for bail. As a condition of his release, he is forbidden from leaving France and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/telegram-pavel-durov-indictment/">must report to a French police station twice a week</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This isn’t the first time Telegram has been linked to illegal activity. It is a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/pavel-durov-russia-telegram-ceo-facebook-elon-musk-tech/">globally popular platform</a> that offers both broadcast channels (in which users can send text and media to large groups of people) and user-to-user chats. It also offers what it calls&nbsp;“<a href="https://core.telegram.org/api/end-to-end">secret chat</a>” conversations that are end-to-end encrypted —&nbsp;meaning that the messages sent are only decipherable to the conversation participants and that no one else, not even Telegram, can see the content.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That feature, as well as <a href="https://telegram.org/faq#:~:text=Telegram's%20special%20secret%20chats%20use,on%20their%20devices%20of%20origin.">other privacy features</a> like self-deleting messages, make the app extremely useful for political dissidents and journalists trying to work under repressive regimes or protect sources. But the app has also, over the years, become a space where extremists can radicalize users and <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2017/6/30/15886506/terrorism-isis-telegram-social-media-russia-pavel-durov-twitter">organize terror attacks.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That has led to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/telegram-pavel-durov-arrest-2c8015c102cce23c23d55c6ca82641c5">some pressure on the part of governments</a> for Telegram to be more collaborative in the data it shares with authorities. Despite this, however, Telegram has largely been able to avoid dramatic legal encounters — until now. Paris prosecutors <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/telegram-ceo-charged-in-france-for-alleged-criminal-use-of-app?sref=qYiz2hd0&amp;embedded-checkout=true">noted on Wednesday that Telegram</a> had refused to assist them in the case.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Durov’s arrest is renewing scrutiny on the app and reigniting the hotly debated issues of free speech and the challenges of content moderation on social media.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Telegram and the problem of content moderation</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Durov and his brother Nikolai founded Telegram to offer an app that centered user privacy following Russia’s “<a href="https://meduza.io/en/feature/2022/02/05/remembering-the-winter-of-protests">Snow Revolution</a>” in 2011 and 2012, when blatant election fraud ignited months of protests, culminating in a harsh and ever-evolving government crackdown. Previously, Durov quarreled with Russian authorities who wanted to suppress speech on the Facebook-like service he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/article/2024/aug/26/telegram-founder-suspected-allowing-criminal-activity-pavel-durov-prosecutors">founded called VKontakte</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the years since its founding, Telegram has allegedly enabled some truly shocking crimes. Perhaps most infamously, it was used to <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2017/6/30/15886506/terrorism-isis-telegram-social-media-russia-pavel-durov-twitter">coordinate ISIS attacks in Paris and Berlin</a>. It cracked down on ISIS-based activity on the app after those attacks, but its content moderation policies have faced a lot of scrutiny.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22238755/telegram-messaging-social-media-extremists">Vox has noted</a>, those policies are laxer than those of other social media groups, and outlets such as the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/08/26/telegram-founder-pavel-durov-what-to-know/">Washington Post</a> have reported that Telegram has played host to a variety of criminal content, including child pornography. Keeping that sort of material off of a platform is an arduous — but not impossible — task,&nbsp; Alessandro Accorsi, a researcher at the International Crisis Group, told Vox.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The effectiveness of content moderation is largely dependent on the platform and the resources it allocates to safety,” Accorsi said. “Social media companies are generally reactive. They want to limit the financial resources dedicated to moderation, as well as possible legal, political, and ethical headaches. So what usually happens is that they will focus their efforts on a few groups or issues for which inaction on their part carries legal or reputational costs.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For example, when ISIS uses a service for terror attacks, that service focuses on stopping ISIS from using its products.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In communications that aren’t end-to-end encrypted, tech companies use a combination of <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/6/20/18692912/recode-daily-facebook-content-moderators">human investigators</a> as well as algorithm-powered <a href="https://themarkup.org/automated-censorship/2024/03/01/how-automated-content-moderation-works-even-when-it-doesnt-work">programs</a> to sort through content. The sort of end-to-end encryption used in Telegram’s “secret chats,” however, makes that type of moderation all but impossible.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Also complicating matters is the varied nature of internet law across the globe. In the US, publishers are generally <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/24121461/myanmar-genocide-section-230-facebook-internet-social-media-moderation">legally shielded from liability</a> over what users post. But that’s not universally the case; many countries have much <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/05/platform-liability-trends-around-globe-recent-noteworthy-developments">stricter legal frameworks around intermediary liability</a>. France’s <a href="https://www.sciencespo.fr/public/chaire-numerique/en/2024/05/15/article-what-future-for-the-sren-law/">SREN Act</a> is extremely stringent and can levy fines against publishers for content violations.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s a really hard thing to do, especially in comparative context, because what’s hateful or extreme or radical speech in some place like the US is going to be different from Myanmar or Bangladesh or other countries,” <a href="https://inta.gatech.edu/people/person/david-muchlinski">David Muchlinski</a>, professor of international affairs at Georgia Tech, told Vox. That makes content moderation “a clumsy tool at best.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Telegram has, in response to recent outside <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/10/31/1208800238/the-telegram-app-has-been-a-key-platform-for-hamas-now-its-being-restricted-ther">pressure</a>, employed some content moderation, Accorsi told Vox. <strong>“</strong>It has banned channels associated with a handful of organizations (most recently Hamas and far-right groups in the UK), but thousands of problematic groups are still present.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the investigation and charges against Durov suggest Telegram may not be doing enough to keep bad actors from using the platform to commit crimes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Georgia State Elections Board recently enacted two new rules that seem designed to allow local election officials to sabotage the state’s vote-counting process. Republican nominee Donald Trump praised the three board members who supported these new rules, all of whom <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/05/trump-praises-georgia-election-board/74674946007/">previously questioned the result of the 2020 election that Trump lost</a>, as “pit bulls fighting for honesty, transparency and victory.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rules seek to alter the role of local election officials known as superintendents, whose job is to gather the vote tallies from the polling places within their jurisdiction, add up the tallies, and report those numbers to Georgia’s secretary of state. For at least a century, the Georgia Supreme Court has held that this duty is “purely ministerial” and that these superintendents “have no right to adjudicate upon the subject of irregularity or fraud” in an election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first of the state board’s new rules, however, provides that these local superintendents must conduct a “<a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25074852/georgia-state-election-board-rules-lawsuit.pdf">reasonable inquiry</a>” before certifying an election to ensure that the results are “a true and accurate accounting of all votes cast in that election.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This upends the longstanding rule that superintendents merely perform the ministerial task of tabulating votes, and it would give these local superintendents broad new authority to search for supposed irregularities in an election and to refuse to certify an election if they claim to find some.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The second rule provides that all county election board members must have access to “all election related documentation created during the conduct of elections prior to certification of results,” although the rule does not define which documents must be provided. In much of Georgia, county election boards also act as the superintendent that tabulates the votes in that county.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To be clear, Georgia election law already allows a party that believes misconduct, fraud, or some other irregularity occurred during an election to <a href="https://casetext.com/statute/code-of-georgia/title-21-elections/chapter-2-elections-and-primaries-generally/article-13-contested-elections-and-primaries/section-21-2-522-grounds-for-contest">file a lawsuit challenging the result</a>. This allows questions about whether the initial count was reliable to be decided using the same evidentiary rules that apply in any other Georgia court case, and to be decided after parties on both sides of the dispute have the opportunity to submit briefs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The state board’s new rules, by contrast, allow local elections officials to dig through documents looking for something they think could be an irregularity, and then to refuse to certify the results based on their own idiosyncratic conclusion that the election was not conducted properly. If Trump loses Georgia in November, moreover, his campaign will very likely lobby local officials to use this power aggressively in an effort akin to the <a href="https://www.vox.com/21562815/biden-trump-fraud-state-legislatures-electors">pressure Trump and his allies</a> put on local officials in 2020.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are several ways the new rules could be killed before November. Earlier this week, the Democratic Party and several Democratic officials <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25074852/georgia-state-election-board-rules-lawsuit.pdf">filed a lawsuit challenging the new rules</a>. The suit claims that the rules violate state election law, which mandates that superintendents must certify all local election results by a certain date, that the new rules violate state Supreme Court decisions limiting the role of these superintendents, and that the state board also didn’t follow the proper procedure when it created the new rules.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican who has <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/18/trump-kemp-feud-georgia-00174471">clashed with Trump in the past</a>, recently asked the state attorney general for “guidance” on whether Kemp has the authority to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/georgia-election-trump-brian-kemp-b2602111.html">fire the three MAGA board members</a> who are responsible for the new rules.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So there is a decent chance that, one way or another, the new rules will not be in effect when this November’s election takes place. Should the state board’s gambit succeed, however, get ready for chaos.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Are the new rules legal?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Democratic lawsuit against the Georgia State Election Board was only filed last Monday, so it remains to be seen how the state courts will handle this brand new suit. Nevertheless, the party’s <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25074852/georgia-state-election-board-rules-lawsuit.pdf">initial court filing</a> makes a persuasive case that Georgia law does not permit local election superintendents to delay certification of an election or to adjudicate election-related disputes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The lawsuit’s theory of how elections are supposed to be conducted in Georgia is straightforward. After the ballots are cast, they are tallied by local superintendents on a tight deadline. These tallies are then transmitted to the secretary of state, who tabulates them himself and certifies the result to the governor, also on a tight deadline. Moreover, in a presidential election year, federal law requires the state to appoint members of the Electoral College “<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/5">not later than the date that is 6 days before the time fixed for the meeting of the electors</a>.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One missed deadline risks triggering a chain of consequences. If a local superintendent does not meet their deadline, that could set off a cascade where more senior officials also cannot meet their deadlines — unless they exclude the votes from the recalcitrant superintendent’s jurisdiction altogether. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Election challenges may occur, but they are resolved by courts and not by superintendents, and Georgia state law requires the relevant officials to <a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/title-21/chapter-2/article-12/section-21-2-493/">recertify an election</a> if a successful challenge changes the result.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Democratic Party’s legal theory is supported by multiple provisions of Georgia elections law. For starters, state law imposes a mandatory deadline on local superintendents, stating that local election results “<a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/title-21/chapter-2/article-12/section-21-2-493/">shall be certified by the superintendent</a> not later than 5:00 P.M. on the Monday following the date on which such election was held.” So state law doesn’t simply impose a tight deadline on local elections officials, it states that they “shall” certify an election regardless of what they think about the results.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, while superintendents might exercise some authority in the few days between an election and the certification deadline — perhaps tracking down some precinct returns that were mistakenly not transmitted or fixing transcription errors made during the process of tabulating the election results — they may not refuse to certify once the deadline arrives. Allowing superintendents to do so might not only cause the state to miss key deadlines, it also places an extraordinary amount of power in obscure local officials who are not at all equipped to adjudicate election disputes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This reading of state law is bolstered by other provisions of state law cited in the Democratic Party’s lawsuit, as well as state Supreme Court decisions like 1926’s <em>Bacon v. Black</em>, the case that established that the superintendent’s duty to certify an election is “purely ministerial.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Georgia’s practice of instructing local election officials to simply tally up the votes and leave election-related disputes to be decided in the courts also appears to be a longstanding practice that is nearly universal across the United States. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In its lawsuit, the Democratic Party quotes a <a href="https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/MILLER-WILDER-FINAL-1.pdf">2024 law review article</a> on election certification, which states that “[b]y 1897, the ministerial, mandatory nature of certifying returns was so well-established that one leading treatise declared ‘[t]he doctrine that canvassing boards and return judges are ministerial officers possessing no discretionary or judicial power, is settled in nearly or quite all the states.” The Democratic Party, in other words, isn’t asking Georgia to do anything out of the ordinary. It is asking the state to run its election the same way nearly every state has since the McKinley administration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, the State Election Board’s three MAGA members don’t simply appear to be upending Georgia election law. They apparently seek to upend the standard practice for conducting elections in the United States that has been commonplace since the late 19th century.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, while it remains to be seen how Georgia’s courts will react, the Democratic suit against the State Election Board appears to be quite strong.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Elon Musk spent Election Day on X <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1853847172309209357">praising men</a>, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk">amplifying anti-immigrant conspiracies</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1853625288615157993">accusing Democrats of voter fraud</a>. It was all pretty on-brand for the billionaire, who has become one of Donald Trump’s biggest supporters and a one-man misinformation machine.<strong> </strong>When it was clear early Wednesday morning that Trump would win, Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1854045379408326909">told his followers</a>: “You are the media now.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A statement like that would have been laughable even a month ago, when estimates showed that X, formerly Twitter, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/02/business/elon-musk-twitter-x-fidelity/index.html#:~:text=And%20it%20represents%20a%20staggering,%2444%20billion%20that%20Musk%20paid.">had dropped nearly 80 percent in value</a> since Musk purchased the platform for $44 billion in 2022. Until its transformation into X, the platform was regarded by some as a once-vibrant place on the internet that Musk utterly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/sep/29/character-limit-how-elon-musk-destroyed-twitter-review-kate-conger-ryan-mac">destroyed</a>. But after Musk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-election-night.html">spent at least $119 million</a> to get Trump elected and turned his platform <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/technology/elon-musk-x-election.html?campaign_id=4&amp;emc=edit_dk_20241104&amp;instance_id=138603&amp;nl=dealbook&amp;regi_id=27132078&amp;segment_id=182153&amp;user_id=22aa1351f691b042384fa3531e08c414">into a MAGA megaphone</a> — and then Trump won — the social media site’s real value is starting to take new shape.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From the day his Twitter purchase went through, Musk <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/elon-musk-to-acquire-twitter-301532245.html">vowed</a> to make free speech central to the platform’s future. He purged the company’s trust and safety staff, setting a precedent that <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-trust-safety-industry/">other social media companies followed</a>. Since then, however, Musk has been willing to let authoritarian regimes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235213/x-brazil-suppression-speech-elon-musk-india-turkey">dictate how X will work</a> in their countries. In the United States, more free speech on X meant more misinformation and an <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/elon-musk-ron-desantis-2024-twitter/674149/">embrace of right-wing politics</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">X is certainly not the biggest social media platform, but as other major platforms <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/17/us/politics/trump-disinformation-2024-social-media.html">continue to shy away from policing content</a> and Trump heads back to the White House, X certainly looks more influential than it did last week.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You might not like this. Since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/27/technology/elon-musk-twitter-deal-complete.html">buying the platform</a> in 2022, Musk has helped turn X into an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/wrong-claims-by-musk-us-election-got-2-billion-views-x-2024-report-says-2024-11-04/">epicenter of election misinformation</a>. With 203 million followers, Musk has the biggest reach on X and is the platform’s <a href="https://www.edisonresearch.com/the-infinite-dial-2024/'">most prominent pusher of anti-immigrant conspiracy theories</a> and right-wing propaganda. At Musk’s request last year, X <a href="https://www.platformer.news/yes-elon-musk-created-a-special-system/">changed the site’s algorithm</a> to put his posts in more people’s feeds — posts that increasingly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/technology/elon-musk-x-election.html">urged people not to trust the outcome of the election</a>. The nonprofit <a href="https://counterhate.com/about/">Center for Countering Digital Hate</a> estimates that Musk’s misleading posts about the election have been viewed <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/04/media/elon-musk-election-x-misinformation-trump-harris/index.html">more than 2 billion times</a> this year. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gone are the warning labels that Twitter <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/9/10/21430895/twitter-voter-suppression-policies-trump-civic-integrity">once used</a> to flag false or misleading information. Musk replaced that system with a crowd-sourced fact-checking program called Community Notes. He called it “the best source of truth on the internet.” Unfortunately, the new system <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/10/30/elon-musk-x-fact-check-community-notes-misinformation/">doesn’t work very well</a>.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GettyImages-2182521573.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.729549760201,100,78.540900479598" alt="Elon Musk and Melania Trump stand with Musk’s young son at a Trump rally.

<p class="has-text-align-none">So if your feed feels as though it’s especially full of right-wing voices and conspiracy theories, that’s because it probably is. It’s not exactly a coordinated effort by Musk’s lieutenants to push your views to the right. It’s just how X is designed these days. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s way too soon to tell just how big a role X played in Trump’s reelection. We also don’t know what, if anything, Musk will do differently with the platform as he eyes <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-adopt-musks-proposal-government-efficiency-commission-wsj-reports-2024-09-05/">some sort of role</a> in the new administration. You can count on continuing to question everything you see on social media, though.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The problem will get worse because there are no guardrails in place right now,” said Darrell West, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “All the trends are moving in the wrong direction.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, thanks to the apathy of social media platforms <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/17/ai-fake-news-misinformation/">and the rise of AI</a>, lying on the internet <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/353958/online-lies-invisible-rulers-book-successful-misinformation">has never been easier</a>. And if you’re on X, it’s part of the appeal.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The right will continue to rule X</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Leading up to the election, opinions on the fate of X were grim. There were <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/elon-musk-twitter-misinformation-timeline-1235076786/">plenty</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2dpj485nno">of</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/misinformation/musk-election-misinformation-x-officials-twitter-voting-rcna176938">reports</a> on the dangers of election misinformation on the platform or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285681/x-elon-musk-everything-app-bank-fail">Musk’s broken promises</a> about what X would do by now. Bloomberg columnist Dave Lee argued that the platform was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-08-14/musk-s-x-reeks-of-failing-social-network-syndrome?sref=qYiz2hd0">simply failing</a>, losing users and relevance. That seems less likely now.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite <a href="https://www.edisonresearch.com/twitter-x-usage-sees-sharp-decline/">rumors of its demise</a>, X is still quite big. X told advertisers as recently as September that it has <a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/x-claims-to-advertisers-that-it-has-a-reach-of-570-million-monthly-active-users/">over 570 million monthly active users</a>, dwarfing right-wing platforms like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/18/technology/truth-social-right-wing-apps.html">Truth Social</a> and <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/02/why-rumble-is-the-only-successful-right-wing-social-platform.html">Rumble</a>, whose users are in the hundreds of thousands. It is also much bigger than platforms <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12613">like Mastodon and Blue Sky</a>, which progressives fled to after Musk bought Twitter. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, Meta recently said that its Twitter-replacement platform, Threads, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/threads-users-how-many-meta-twitter-instagram-2024-11">has 275 million monthly active users</a>. A big difference between the two platforms? Meta <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/9/24067742/instagram-threads-meta-political-content-recommended-feeds">limits</a> the amount of political content you see on Threads. It looks like people are either staying on X or flocking to it for unfiltered politics news.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Political news on Twitter <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/09/our-study-found-little-evidence-that-twitter-is-biased-against-conservative-opinion-leaders/">used to be marginal</a>, where celebrities were the main draw. The celebrities <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/shonda-rhimes-celebrities-leave-twitter-elon-musk-takeover-social-media-2022-10">have left</a>, and now X is the most popular major social media platform for keeping up with politics, according to a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2024/06/12/how-americans-navigate-politics-on-tiktok-x-facebook-and-instagram/">Pew survey</a> published in June. There has also been a major partisan shift. Democrats historically dominated political discussion on the platform, but X has become <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/elon-musk-ron-desantis-2024-twitter/674149/">dominated by right-wing voices</a> in just the last couple of years. Posts from Republicans are far more likely to go viral on X, and once-popular Democrat accounts have seen their audiences disintegrate, according to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/10/29/elon-musk-x-republican-democrat-twitter-election/">a recent Washington Post investigation</a>.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GettyImages-2176089209.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Elon Musk, onstage with Trump at a rally, jumps in the sir with his arms over his head." title="Elon Musk, onstage with Trump at a rally, jumps in the sir with his arms over his head." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Elon Musk jumped onstage at an  October 5 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and became a meme in the process. | Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Republicans have also changed their minds about the platform’s impact on democracy. While Twitter was once <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/release/the-cover-up-big-tech-the-swamp-and-mainstream-media-coordinated-to-censor-americans-free-speech-%EF%BF%BC/'">framed</a> as the platform that censored conservative voices, X has become the right’s favorite place for freedom. Only 17 percent of Republicans thought Twitter was good for democracy in 2021, but 53 percent said X was good for democracy in 2024, according to the Pew study.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Democratic users are much more likely to think people getting harassed is a major problem on the platform, and on the flip side, Republicans who post about politics are especially likely to do so because their views feel welcome there,” Colleen McClain, one of the authors of the Pew study, told me this week. McClain added that “in recent years, we haven&#8217;t seen any mass exodus or flocking to or from X in our data, either overall or by party.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of this should come as a huge surprise if you’ve spent any time on X. But the partisan split took on new dimensions leading up to this year’s election, if only because the Republicans who felt like their voices were heard on X also felt heard at the ballot box.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Their guy won, and maybe <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/donald-trump-far-right-supporters-violent-memes/">the weird, violent memes on X</a> helped.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Elon Musk is just getting started</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We don’t know if X will grow or change — or just stay its same problematic self — as Trump prepares to take office again. We do know that Elon Musk isn’t done with politics. Musk was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-election-night.html">at Trump’s side</a> at Mar-a-Lago as the results rolled in on election night, and there’s good reason to believe we’ll see the SpaceX owner in DC soon enough.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As far as politics go, Musk says <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/11/06/elon-musk-trump-victory/">he’s not done funding political races</a>. In a livestream on X, the billionaire said his America PAC would “keep going after this election, and prepare for the midterms and any intermediate elections.” Trump, meanwhile, said in his victory speech, “We have a new star,” Trump said. “A star is born — Elon!”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In September, Trump <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-05/trump-vows-15-corporate-tax-and-taps-musk-for-federal-audit?sref=qYiz2hd0">promised Musk a role</a> heading up a task force to review federal expenditures, one that would make “drastic reforms” to the federal government. This makes sense because Musk had been the one who pitched the idea for such a task force to the president-elect. Trump even <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-musk-secretary-of-cost-cutting-1235132825/">suggested a new job title</a>, “Secretary of Cost Cutting,” while Musk suggested he&#8217;d be head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which does not exist and whose acronym is a reference to <a href="https://dogecoin.com/">a dog-themed cryptocurrency</a>. Musk later said at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally that he <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-06/what-trump-election-means-for-elon-musk-tesla-tsla-and-spacex?sref=qYiz2hd0">wanted to cut $2 trillion</a> from the federal budget, which would be very difficult.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s easy, however, to see how Musk’s many companies <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/11/06/2024/elon-musk-is-techs-big-winner-in-the-us-election">stand to benefit immensely</a> from a close relationship with the Trump administration. SpaceX is already one of NASA’s primary contractors, pulling in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/spacex-wins-nasa-contract-for-iss-reentry-destruction.html">hundreds of millions</a> if not <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/nasa-awards-spacex-more-crew-flights-to-space-station/">several billions of dollars</a> with every contract. Musk’s contact with Vladimir Putin <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/musk-putin-secret-conversations-37e1c187">reportedly put these contracts in jeopardy</a>, although knowing what we know about <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-putin-talked-many-7-2021-new-book-claims-rcna174528">Trump’s affinity</a> for the Russian autocrat, the president-elect might not mind this.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tesla also stands to benefit, which explains why the company’s stock soared after Trump’s victory was secured. The EV company wants to roll out a massive fleet of robotaxis, a tall order that comes with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-promises-paid-robotaxis-next-year-significant-hurdles-remain-2024-10-24/">significant regulatory challenges</a>. Tesla’s self-driving car program in general has faced pushback from federal authorities, including a recently announced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/18/business/tesla-self-driving-investigation.html">investigation into the system</a>. Regulatory approval and investigations can be easier, of course, if you bankrolled the president’s final push to reelection. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Musk’s bet on developing artificial general intelligence, xAI, can also look forward to more cooperation from the federal government. The second Trump administration could pave the way for xAI to get access to cheap energy, especially as it faces heat <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/musks-xai-operating-gas-turbines-without-permits-data-center-environmental-group-2024-08-28/">for running gas generators without permits</a> to power its data center in Memphis.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GettyImages-1244262469.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.8035109331691,100,92.392978133662" alt="Elon Musk carries a bathroom sink into Twitter headquarters." title="Elon Musk carries a bathroom sink into Twitter headquarters." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="The image of Elon Musk carrying a sink won laughs online but did not endear the billionaire to his new employees at Twitter. | Twitter/AFP/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Twitter/AFP/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">On top of these lucrative potential deals, the idea that X might win new relevance and influence must feel like a bonus to Musk. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For its right-wing users, though, X is finally the digital town square they were promised so many months ago. It seems like just yesterday, Elon Musk was carrying a sink into Twitter’s headquarters on his first day as the company’s owner. (“Let that sink in” is supposed to be the joke there.) </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Musk paid tribute to that post on X just after midnight on election night. Except this time, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1854034776815972649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1854034776815972649%7Ctwgr%5E3f290c51ad8b92a6fcfa382339e553573cafc99c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.moneycontrol.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Flet-that-sink-in-as-trump-gains-elon-musk-posts-iconic-throwback-picture-with-oval-office-background-12859253.html">in a doctored photo</a>, he was carrying a sink into the Oval Office.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Among the many questions that will be sure to plague Democrats in the months following Kamala Harris&#8217;s defeat in the 2024 presidential election: What is happening with Gen Z men?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Could it be that growing up in a fundamentally different media environment than generations before them, one populated by individual influencers who often preach the values of entrepreneurship, self-improvement, and, ultimately, self-interest over everything else, galvanized the youngest voters to vote for a man who shared that same spirit? Or could it be that young men have helped make this content popular because they like what it says?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s clear is that Donald Trump catered to the bro vote and won. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Early <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-elections/exit-polls">exit poll data from swing states </a>shows that 18- to 29-year-old men favored Trump 49 percent to 47 percent, while 18- to 29-year-old women favored Harris by 24 points — the largest gender gap within any age group, and one that defies conventional wisdom that once painted young people as broadly progressive. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s worth noting that exit poll data can be unreliable and it will take weeks for a clearer picture to emerge. But even as we wait for a more comprehensive demographic breakdown of the election, it’s fair to say that Trump’s campaign was uniquely attuned to Gen Z bros. He appeared on a succession of extremely online streams and podcasts targeting young men, an unusual media strategy that some second-guessed but ended up being vindicated.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That Trump would attempt such an outreach shouldn’t come as a shock. Gen Z is leaning more right than its predecessors. This fall, a <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/09/28/gen-z-men-conservative-poll">Harvard Youth Poll showed</a> 18- to 24-year-old men saying they were more likely to identify as conservative than liberal, while men and women of the same age group said they were more conservative than 25- to 29-year-olds. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A <a href="https://www.theupandup.us/p/gen-z-teens-conservative-shift-gallup-data">Gallup and Walton Family Foundation study showed</a> that Gen Z teens are twice as likely to identify as more conservative than their parents in comparison to millennials and their parents 20 years before. This was especially true for male Republican teenagers. Younger people <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/23/gen-z-republican-polling/">are also more skeptical</a> of major American institutions, including political parties, the government, and the media.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s campaign directly spoke to this demographic: He echoed that same mistrust in institutions, and did so while stopping at seemingly <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/380008/harris-trump-podcast-interviews-appearances-joe-rogan-shannon-sharpe-theo-von-call-her-daddy-flagrant">every podcast</a>, Twitch stream, YouTube channel, and TikTok page whose viewership is dominated by Gen Z men and boys. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/us/politics/trump-adin-ross-livestream-gifts.html">He joined</a> Adin Ross, a now 24-year-old streamer who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/zasgiz/adin_ross_tries_to_figure_out_what_fascist_means/">once famously looked up</a> and struggled to read the definition of “fascism” on camera, for an interview during which Ross presented him with a Rolex and <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/373990/heterodoxy-anti-woke-libertarian-tech-bro">a Cybertruck</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He went on the mulleted comedian <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/368563/theo-von-trump-interview-podcast">Theo Von’s podcast</a>, where they discussed cocaine, golf, and UFC.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He palled around with YouTube millionaires like the Paul brothers and the Nelk Boys, known for their distasteful pranks and crypto scams.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And, of course, he talked to Joe Rogan, the most famous podcaster in the world; the two men <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2024/11/joe-rogan-endorses-donald-trump-election-harris.html">rambled to each other</a> for three hours. For this, he received Rogan’s much-coveted endorsement. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Where the Gen Z bro media diet came from</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A source of endless recent debate has been young men’s rightward turn, despite the fact that the answer may be in plain sight. Young men are seeing the strides women have made in the last several generations — <a href="https://aibm.org/research/male-college-enrollment-and-completion/">out-earning men</a> in college degrees and nearly <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/04/13/in-a-growing-share-of-u-s-marriages-husbands-and-wives-earn-about-the-same/">tripling the share of women</a> who earn as much or more than their husbands since the mid-70s — and feeling <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/24/upshot/trump-polls-young-men.html">left behind and demonized</a> by the left. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nearly half of men between 18 and 29 say there is “some or a lot” of discrimination against men in America, up from a third in 2019, according to the <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/newsletter/why-young-men-are-turning-against-feminism/">Survey Center on American Life</a>, which is affiliated with the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank. They believe the <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23581859/me-too-backlash-susan-faludi-weinstein-roe-dobbs-depp-heard">Me Too movement was an overreach</a> and that many women are simply lying about being abused.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not exactly surprising they’re drawn to media that speaks to these grievances — and more often than not, that media comes in the form of individual influencers who are unaffiliated with existing media institutions. Like <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2009/02/03/limbaugh-holds-onto-his-niche-conservative-men/">Rush Limbaugh in the ’90s,</a> these creators have tapped into an enormous swath of men who want to be told they can still aspire to be the head of household, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/fault-lines/whats-the-matter-with-young-male-voters">even if they can’t afford rent or find a girlfriend</a>. </p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Social media platforms, of course, incentivize this kind of content. Though it fits into a specific niche, it’s provocative and engaging, and therefore users will continue to see more if they watch or share it. That’s also why the bro influencer world remains such a mystery to older people, women, or anyone outside of that particular algorithm: The social media landscape is atomized and personalized to each user, yet a lot of men are getting funneled into the same one. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Part of the issue for Democrats is that the most popular content on the internet is either entirely nonpolitical (consider Alex Cooper’s <em>Call Her Daddy,</em> which only briefly stepped into politics for its Kamala Harris interview) or is right-leaning and geared toward men. While plenty of podcasters and influencers espouse leftist and liberal views, they don’t command nearly as much influence <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2024/11/podcasts-politics-right-spotify-tucker-carlson-charlie-kirk-candace-owens-joe-rogan.html">as those on the right.</a> </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/hasan-piker-twitch-profile.html">Hasan Piker</a>, perhaps the left’s sole answer to this brand of charismatic, attractive, and explicitly political young male influencer, <a href="https://x.com/HasanabiProd/status/1854179361265459629">explained it like so</a>: “If you’re a dude under the age of 30 and you have any hobbies whatsoever, whether it’s playing video games, whether it’s working out, whether it’s listening to a history podcast or whatever, every single facet of that is just completely dominated by … the center-right to Trumpian right.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One branch of this network is what writer Max Read dubbed “<a href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/hawk-tuah-and-the-zynternet">the Zynternet</a>,” which he covered this summer when Haliey Welch went massively viral for her “<a href="https://www.vox.com/internet-culture/357813/hawk-tuah-girl-meme-tiktok-explained">Hawk Tuah” joke</a>. It’s fratty and reactionary, and it’s held together by a love of college sports and the <a href="https://www.vox.com/23641580/draftkings-fanduel-sports-betting-gambling-problems-march-madness">gambling industry</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also worth noting that the rightward shift among young people isn’t limited to men, nor is it exclusively the domain of male influencers. Digital researcher Jess Rauchberg <a href="https://x.com/JessRauchberg/status/1854155396237185094">pointed out on X</a> that the influx of tradwife content may be shifting “the way young white women are imagining their roles in political participation” (though I’d argue <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/nara-smith-lucky-blue-smith-tiktok-mormon-tradwife-1234979241/">this extends</a> beyond <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/12/11161942/tiktok-black-tradwives-burnout-marriage-capitalism">just white women</a>). Creators like <a href="https://www.vox.com/23960702/big-family-ballerina-farm-hannah-neeleman-dougherty-dozen-instagram-tiktok-influencers">Ballerina Farm</a> and reality shows like the <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/374143/secret-lives-mormon-wives-momtok-utah"><em>The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives</em></a><em>,</em> she argues, “are endorsing a form of political engagement that reinforces separate (economic, political) spheres for women and men.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The seeds of this media landscape sprouted a decade ago, when the social justice movements <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/27/opinion/sunday/twitter-social-media.html">abetted by the rise of social media</a> were met with a swift backlash in the form of harassment campaigns <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/1/20/20808875/gamergate-lessons-cultural-impact-changes-harassment-laws">like Gamergate</a>. Those tactics were then mobilized in ways that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/9/2/6096815/4chan-explainer-questions">mystified the non-extremely online back then</a> to help elect Trump the first time around.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ten years later, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/opinion/trump-gen-z-men-harris.html">men are even lonelier</a>, more likely to be single, more skeptical, and more afraid than ever. They find solace and community online, in places that older folks still don’t understand, where they see idealized versions of masculinity winning. They cheer on <a href="https://www.vox.com/sports/357984/ufc-303-fight-trump-maga-periera-prochazka">UFC fights </a>and boxing matches, use <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/376401/r-word-slur-return-euphemism-treadmill-cycle">“edgy” slurs</a>, trade in <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/371597/crypto-politics-spending-2024-elections-trump">risky crypto investments</a>, bootlick Silicon Valley billionaires, listen to <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23978325/dating-advice-shera-seven-tiktok-sprinkle-sprinkle">toxic dating advice</a>, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/23318861/andrew-tate-tiktok-instagram-youtube-banned">denigrate women</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They vote for a man <a href="https://x.com/TalbertSwan/status/1854018390806921315">who has done</a> everything you’re not supposed to do — steal, lie, rape, idolize Hitler — because his election fulfills their fantasy that men really can get away with whatever they want.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For now, it seems they’re right.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though it’s already been overshadowed in the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382945/kamala-harris-lost-donald-trump-why">deluge</a> of <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383208/donald-trump-victory-kamala-harris-global-trend-incumbents">post-election</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy">analysis</a> of Donald Trump’s victory, Tuesday also marked a serious escalation of Russia’s global campaign of sabotage and intimidation targeting the US and other Western powers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Polling sites in several states received bomb threats — later determined not to be credible — which the FBI said in a statement “appear to originate from Russian email domains.” The threats <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/05/us/georgia-non-credible-bomb-threat-russia/index.html">forced several polling places to close</a> temporarily in the swing state of Georgia. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger told reporters on Tuesday, “We identified the source, and it was from Russia.” Polling sites in the swing states of Michigan and Arizona <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/pollls-voting-bomb-threats.html">also received threats</a>, though it’s unclear if these was part of the same campaign.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other officials have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/pollls-voting-bomb-threats.html">suggested</a> that someone could have been spoofing Russian email addresses, and the Russian government was quick to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-denies-it-was-behind-us-bomb-hoaxes-or-incendiary-devices-planes-2024-11-06/">deny any involvement</a>. The US intelligence community <a href="https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/11/russia-pushing-election-fraud-lies-swing-states-us-intelligence-community-says/400814/?oref=d1-homepage-top-story&amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=The%20D%20Brief:%20November%2006%2C%202024&amp;utm_term=newsletter_d1_dbrief">had warned prior</a> to the election that the Russian government was promoting disinformation via social media in the US in order to “undermine the legitimacy of the election, instill fear in voters regarding the election process, and suggest Americans are using violence against each other due to political preferences.” US authorities say the Russian government had been behind smear attacks targeting Democratic <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/22/nx-s1-5161376/russia-tim-walz-video-disinformation">vice presidential candidate Tim Walz</a> and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/russia-and-iran-ramping-up-influence-campaigns-targeting-us-voters-federal-agencies-say">false allegations of voter fraud</a>, among other examples of disinformation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As anyone following American politics over the past decade knows, the Russian government has tried to meddle in US campaigns before. As was the case in the past two elections, the Russian government <a href="https://www.state.gov/briefings-foreign-press-centers/2024-elections-fpc/30-day-election-security-update-from-intelligence-community">was believed to prefer Trump</a>, who speaks frequently of his good relationship with President Vladimir Putin and has been critical of both NATO and US support for Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This time, though, it ultimately may not have mattered that much. Though Russian disinformation was widely spread, including by <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/elon-musk-shared-tenet-content-thought-part-russian-plot-rcna171520">X owner and Trump backer Elon Musk</a>, nothing the Kremlin allegedly orchestrated in this election cycle appears to have had anywhere near the political impact of the hacking of the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/how-the-russians-hacked-the-dnc-and-passed-its-emails-to-wikileaks/2018/07/13/af19a828-86c3-11e8-8553-a3ce89036c78_story.html">Democratic National Committee in 2016</a>, which US intelligence agencies also believe Russia orchestrated.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Andrei Soldatov, an investigative journalist and analyst who has written several books on Russia’s security services, says this year’s campaign targeting the US election differed from past efforts. It was also different from recent alleged campaigns of fraud to help Moscow’s preferred candidates in elections in the former Soviet states of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/01/nx-s1-5175108/accusation-of-kremlin-inspired-election-fraud-sparks-protests-in-country-of-georgia">Georgia</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7w9dglzzlo">Moldova</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The goal was not actually to change the results of the election,” Soldatov told Vox. “It was about posturing, about reminding Americans what’s at stake, and sending a message about what might happen if America continues its support for Ukraine.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though the election is over, Russia’s efforts to transmit this message are not, and they ultimately might take forms that are more violent and destructive than empty bomb threats.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Out of the gray zone and into the blue</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Two days before the election, the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/russia-plot-us-planes-incendiary-devices-de3b8c0a">Wall Street Journal<em> </em>reported</a> that Western security services believed two incendiary devices seized on board planes in Europe over the summer were a test run for a Russian operation to start fires on US-bound planes. The devices detonated without injuries at logistics hubs in Germany and the UK, but the head of Poland’s intelligence agency said, “I’m not sure the political leaders of Russia are aware of the consequences if one of these packages exploded, causing a mass casualty event.” The Russian government has denied involvement.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This follows a campaign of arson and sabotage across Europe that intelligence officials say demonstrates an increasing recklessness on the part of the Kremlin. As the head of <a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2024/10/13/vladimir-putins-spies-are-plotting-global-chaos">Britain’s foreign intelligence service MI6 put i</a>t, “Russian intelligence services have gone a bit feral, frankly.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/olympics/362512/olympics-paris-isis-russia-terrorism-security">In recent months</a>, Russian agents have been accused of plotting sabotage attacks against US and German military targets, arson attacks in the UK and Lithuania, and the attempted assassination of a major German defense contractor, among other plots.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Notably, Soldatov said this campaign goes beyond anything the KGB has attempted in Europe or the United States during the Cold War and should be seen as an attempt by Moscow to raise the costs of Western support for Ukraine, an effort that is separate from but complementary to Putin’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/369035/kursk-nuclear-escalation-zelenskyy-putin">periodic threats to use nuclear weapons</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“People sometimes think the only way Russia can escalate is with nuclear weapons,” Soldatov said. “But what we’ve seen in 2024 is that there are actually many more ways to escalate.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Disinformation and sabotage are the kinds of tactics often referred to as “gray zone” or “hybrid” warfare: inflicting costs on an adversary while maintaining plausible deniability. The aim here is to cause just enough damage to get the point across without leaving an opening for an all-out military war. But that line is a narrow one, and some officials say Russia’s behavior is pushing the gray zone’s limits.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the NATO summit in Washington in July, Lithuania’s foreign minister <a href="https://www.vox.com/olympics/362512/olympics-paris-isis-russia-terrorism-security">said on a panel</a>, “I’m not sure it can be called hybrid events or gray zone events any longer. It’s quite clear that [these are] terrorist attacks by a hostile neighboring country against NATO countries.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Moscow gets its man</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump, after all, has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/06/politics/trump-election-ukraine-war-russia-intl/index.html">promised</a> to immediately end the war in Ukraine, presumably by pressuring Kyiv to accede to at least some of Moscow’s demands. Could the Kremlin dial back the campaign now that its preferred candidate is returning to the White House? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s possible. Russian leaders reacted with <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37928171">open jubilation to Trump’s victory in 2016</a> but were largely disappointed with <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/us-election-russia-reaction-trump-biden-putin/30922669.html">his administration</a>, which, for all his kind words for Putin, also saw a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/on-the-record-the-u-s-administrations-actions-on-russia/">raft of new sanctions</a> against Moscow and the sale of <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-admin-approves-sale-anti-tank-weapons-ukraine/story?id=65989898">anti-tank weapons to Ukraine</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Moscow is being much more cautious this time around. In a <a href="https://mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/news/1979574/">statement Wednesday responding</a> to Trump’s victory, the Russian foreign ministry credited him with countering the “globalist” course of America’s current administration. It also added, “We have no illusions about the president-elect, who is well known in Russia &#8230; the US ruling political elite adheres to anti-Russia principles and the policy of ‘containing Moscow.’ This line does not depend on changes in America’s domestic political barometer.”   </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the risks of engaging in gray zone tactics is that you can’t always be sure how your opponent will react, and it’s difficult to know when a red line is finally crossed. Trump, for one, has prided himself on his unpredictability. Like everyone else after what happened on Tuesday, Putin is likely waiting to see what comes next.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Donald Trump <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy">rode his way to a comeback</a> with a quintessential law-and-order campaign: He exaggerated crime trends, talked about American cities as <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/356269/falling-crime-trends-public-perception-voter-concerns">though they were war zones</a>, and directed his ire at migrants, flooding the Republican National Convention with “Mass Deportation Now!” signs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s hard to know exactly how Trump’s harsh immigration policies will play out, but his campaign press secretary <a href="https://x.com/axios/status/1854167037586595937?s=46&amp;t=LVLwPwruc4koXd6hdIOe8Q">said</a> that his new administration will start its mass deportation operation on day one.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump won’t take office until January, but if you’re wondering whether he’ll make good on his promise to arrest, detain, and deport migrants, here’s one chart that paints a grim picture of what might be ahead:</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Private prison giant Geo Group —which already has over a billion dollars in ICE contracts to manage immigration detention facilities—sees its stock soar on Trump&#039;s win. <a href="https://t.co/QOy2L5S8np">pic.twitter.com/QOy2L5S8np</a></p>&mdash; Avi Asher-Schapiro (@AASchapiro) <a href="https://twitter.com/AASchapiro/status/1854186618535497869?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">GEO Group, a private prison corporation that has had <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/immigrants-rights/unchecked-growth-private-prison-corporations-and-immigration-detention-three-years-into-the-biden-administration">billions of dollars</a> worth of <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2024/07/private-prison-giant-geo-group-ramps-up-lobbying-on-immigrant-surveillance/">contracts</a> with the US Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE), saw a steep rise in its stock price on Wednesday —&nbsp;about 38 percent by the afternoon — after Trump was declared the winner of the presidential race. While that doesn’t translate to policy, it does show that the markets are betting that the private prison industry will likely flourish under the next Trump administration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This kind of market behavior is to be expected, since investors <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/spencerykwon/files/extreme_news_overreaction.pdf">often overreact</a> to news events. But even if today’s movement is a temporary price spike, that doesn’t change the fact that the company itself has been betting on a Trump presidency to make a fortune. GEO Group’s spending on its lobbying efforts <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2024/07/private-prison-giant-geo-group-ramps-up-lobbying-on-immigrant-surveillance/">peaked during the Trump administration</a>, and slowed down after President Joe Biden <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-race-and-ethnicity-prisons-coronavirus-pandemic-c8c246f00695f37ef2afb1dd3a5f115e">announced</a> that he would phase out the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) contracts with private prisons. The company had <a href="https://www.context.news/surveillance/trump-election-win-could-fuel-us-private-prison-boom">also donated to Trump’s inauguration</a> in 2017 and even hosted one of its annual events at one of his properties. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This time around, GEO Group’s PAC <a href="https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/private-prison-behemoth-is-first-corporation-to-max-out-to-trump/">maxed out on its contributions</a> to Trump’s campaign and gave a pro-Trump super PAC a $500,000 contribution.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The reason is obvious: The company views a second Trump term as a boon to its business, which relies on government contracts. And since Trump is planning a mass deportation campaign, that would likely mean the federal government will arrest and detain more migrants. In a recent earnings call with its investors, GEO Group&nbsp; executives <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/31/trump-deportation-company-profits/75732590007/">suggested</a> that if Trump won, his policies could bolster the amount of money being sent to its detention facilities that have contracts with ICE.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While Trump liked to tout <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/what-first-step-act-and-whats-happening-it">his bipartisan criminal justice reform bill</a>, which was enacted in 2018, signs like today’s market response to his victory show that private, for-profit prisons are expecting to see big returns when he returns to the White House. That’s an alarming reality because conditions in private prisons, including <a href="https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/geo-group-centurion-covid-19/">ones run by GEO Group</a>, tend to be worse than in federal facilities, as <a href="https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2016/e1606.pdf">a 2016 DOJ report pointed out</a>. The problem was so bad that in 2016, the Obama administration <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/08/18/justice-department-says-it-will-end-use-of-private-prisons/?postshare=9221471534255226">announced it would phase out</a> contracts with private prisons after the DOJ determined that they were less safe for inmates than federally run facilities. (Trump swiftly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-prisons/u-s-reverses-obama-era-move-to-phase-out-private-prisons-idUSKBN1622NN/">reversed that policy</a>.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The markets don’t always predict policy. But when it comes to where investors are putting their money and who private prison companies like GEO Group supported for president, the bet they are making is clear: A second Trump term is lucrative if you’re in the business of incarcerating people. It’s a pretty good bet.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Support independent journalism that matters —&nbsp;</em></strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/support-now"><strong><em>become a Vox Member today</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kamala Harris lost the presidential election and Democrats lost control of the Senate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But when you zoom in on the details of that result, there’s a striking pattern: Democratic Senate candidates are outperforming Harris. Or, put another way, Republican Senate candidates are doing worse than Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent years, the outcome of a state’s US Senate race has increasingly matched the outcome of its simultaneous presidential race. <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/17/13666192/voting-congress-presidency">Ticket-splitting</a> has decreased in our era of polarization and partisanship. The vast majority of people voting for a presidential candidate also vote for their party’s Senate candidate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But not everyone does that. And there’s still some variation in how much better or worse Senate candidates do compared to the top of the ticket. Looking at that variation can provide clues about what sorts of candidates overperform (even if they don’t actually win).</p>

<iframe frameborder="0" height="200" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP2548082156" width="100%"></iframe>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It can also help shape our understanding of national trends. Was there a nationwide backlash against all Democrats? Or was the backlash mostly limited to the presidential candidate?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2020, Republican Senate candidates overperformed Trump in <a href="https://x.com/awprokop/status/1324406190533738497">most swing states</a>, suggesting that Trump was a drag on the GOP. This year, Democratic Senate candidates overperformed Harris in almost every key race — though often it wasn’t by enough for Democrats to win.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s how the Senate candidates in key races performed compared to Harris. The counts aren’t yet finalized so the margins are subject to change, but this is <a href="https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2024/">how things looked</a> as of early Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nebraska</strong>: Independent Dan Osborn’s vote share is about 7 points higher than Harris, but he lost.</li>



<li><strong>Montana</strong>: Sen. Jon Tester’s vote share is also about 7 points higher than Harris. He also lost.</li>



<li><strong>Ohio:</strong> Sen. Sherrod Brown’s vote share is about 4 points higher than Harris. He lost.</li>



<li><strong>Arizona</strong>: Rep. Ruben Gallego’s vote share is about 4 points higher than Harris and he’s currently leading even though Harris seems on track to lose there.</li>



<li><strong>Texas</strong>: Rep. Colin Allred’s vote share is about 3 points higher than Harris, but he failed to unseat Sen. Ted Cruz.</li>



<li><strong>Nevada</strong>: Sen. Jacky Rosen’s vote share was about 2 points higher than Harris. Her race is too close to call.</li>



<li><strong>Wisconsin: </strong>Sen. Tammy Baldwin’s vote share was less than 1 point higher than Harris’s, but Baldwin defeated her challenger, Eric Hovde, while Harris lost the state.</li>



<li><strong>Michigan and Pennsylvania</strong>: Both Democratic Senate candidates in these states (Rep. Elissa Slotkin and incumbent Sen. Bob Casey) have vote shares about 1 point higher than Harris’s. Neither race has been called.</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The pattern was also evident in less competitive races like Minnesota, New Mexico, New Jersey, and Virginia, where Democratic Senate candidates outperformed Harris.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One notable exception to Tuesday’s down-ballot overperformance trend was Florida, where Debbie Mucarsel-Powell did about the same as Harris (and lost). There’s also Maryland, where Angela Alsobrooks won but did significantly worse than Harris — but that has an obvious explanation in that the state’s popular former governor, Larry Hogan, was the Republican Senate nominee (though his popularity wasn’t enough to power him to a win in an otherwise blue state).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So why were there so many voters casting their ballots for Trump and Democratic Senate candidates?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some might argue for racism or sexism explaining Harris’s struggles, but I’d note that several of the Democratic candidates who overperformed Harris were nonwhite or female. Others might argue that she was a uniquely flawed candidate or campaigner, but President Joe Biden was on track to do much worse if he’d stayed in the race.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">My suspicion is that Harris’s electoral struggles were more about Biden’s unpopularity and her association with his administration than any newfound love of the American public for the Republican Party generally. (This is also reflected in the House of Representatives contest currently looking <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-house.html">somewhat close</a> and in Democratic success at the state level in <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/raleigh/2024/11/06/nc-democrats-break-gop-legislative-supermajority">places like North Carolina</a>.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Call them the “I don’t like Republicans much, but the economy was better under Trump” voters. Biden lost them, and Harris failed to get them back.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 1992, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/11/2/17983746/year-of-the-woman-1992">voters sent a record number of women to Congress</a>, leading the media and political scientists to call it the “Year of the Woman.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When the final votes are counted in the 2024 election, we might have a new way of referring to the 2024 election: The Year of the Man.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President-elect Donald Trump <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/exit-polls-2024-men-women-voting-key-swing/story?id=115529817" data-type="link" data-id="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/exit-polls-2024-men-women-voting-key-swing/story?id=115529817">won men by 10 points this year</a>, according to early exit polls, a result that could change once the final votes are tallied. Vice President Kamala Harris, meanwhile, seemed to win women by 10 points — but if the exit polls are correct, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/politics/2020-2016-exit-polls-2024-dg/">she lost ground with women compared to Joe Biden’s 2020 results</a>. The exit polls also suggest a rightward shift for <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/election/2024/exit-polls/national-results/general/president/20">Latino men</a>. In marshaling men’s votes, and holding on to a slim majority of white women, Trump was able to overcome his weaknesses with the broader swath of female voters and build a dominant lead, allowing him to decisively capture the presidency. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Exit polls are notoriously unreliable, and it will likely be days before we have a clear sense of how Trump won. But there’s no denying that Trump tailored his campaign to appeal to men.&nbsp;Trump spent the months leading up to Election Day engaging in <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/09/trump-bro-vote-hawk-tuah-girl-00183129">intense outreach to male voters,</a> appearing on podcasts and doing interviews with influential media figures like <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/380008/harris-trump-podcast-interviews-appearances-joe-rogan-shannon-sharpe-theo-von-call-her-daddy-flagrant">Joe Rogan</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/380008/harris-trump-podcast-interviews-appearances-joe-rogan-shannon-sharpe-theo-von-call-her-daddy-flagrant">Logan Paul,</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/368563/theo-von-trump-interview-podcast">Theo Von</a>. He portrayed himself as a strong leader capable of restoring the nation’s lost glory — returning it, in other words, to a time when men were undisputedly at the top of the social hierarchy. After a man <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/371981/trump-shooting-ryan-wesley-routh-golf-club">attempted to assassinate</a> the former president at a rally this summer in Pennsylvania, Trump stood defiantly with blood on his face and his fist raised in the air, projecting an air of strength that was praised as <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/360711/trump-fist-pump-photo-explained-expert-media-savvy-politics">iconic</a>. Throughout the campaign, Trump demonstrated the aggressiveness that has defined his life in the public arena, relentlessly attacking his Democratic opposition, the media, and anyone he deemed insufficiently supportive.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump specifically sought to get <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/us/politics/donald-trump-young-men.html">young men of all races</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/30/opinion/gender-education-gap.html">men without a college education</a> to the polls. It was a risky strategy because the voters Trump was seeking have historically been among the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-hunts-elusive-2024-election-prize-infrequent-voters-2024-09-09/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-hunts-elusive-2024-election-prize-infrequent-voters-2024-09-09/">most difficult to mobilize</a>. But in appealing to them, Trump hoped to pull off another win <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/upshot/why-trump-won-working-class-whites.html">similar to that of 2016</a>, when he won men by 11 points. In 2020, Biden was able to defeat Trump in part by erasing his large advantage with <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/">male voters.</a> This year, it seems, Trump won men back.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are many reasons why male voters have been dissatisfied in recent years and might have been receptive to his messaging. Inflation has made the cost of living <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/09/why-more-americans-are-struggling-even-as-inflation-cools.html">painful for millions of people</a> post-pandemic. Men are <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/boys-left-behind-education-gender-gaps-across-the-us/">falling behind women in education</a>. Their wages are<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/11/04/1133586707/boys-men-labor-force-jobs-gender-gap-workforce"> stagnating</a> or declining as women’s wages grow, and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/21/why-more-men-are-dropping-out-of-the-workforce.html">fewer men</a> are working. They are struggling with an <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/01/01/why-men-are-lonelier-in-america-than-elsewhere?utm_medium=cpc.adword.pd&amp;utm_source=google&amp;ppccampaignID=18151738051&amp;ppcadID=&amp;utm_campaign=a.22brand_pmax&amp;utm_content=conversion.direct-response.anonymous&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAxKy5BhBbEiwAYiW--1KIlPZ7kQLGxTAZAqP3a1sDZF_CIJWjBZE4KG4Xq77D2MihvaaOaBoCKWcQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">epidemic of loneliness</a> that doesn’t seem to be affecting women in a similar manner. Feminism has gone mainstream, making some men feel like they aren’t as valued. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What lessons should women take from this election? The polls leading up to the election showed a <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380132/gender-gap-election-harris-trump">massive gender gap</a>, with women preferring Harris by double digits and men preferring Trump by the same. Since 1980, female voters have preferred Democrats, and in general, <a href="https://cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/voters/gender-differences-voter-turnout">they have registered and voted in greater numbers than men</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s struggles with women were largely of his own creation. As a candidate in 2016, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/11/3/21544482/trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations">multiple women accused him of sexual assault</a>, and he was <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/10/7/13205842/trump-secret-recording-women">caught on tape</a> bragging about sexual assault. It wasn’t enough to dissuade voters from electing him. As president, he appointed the Supreme Court justices who helped <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-was-able-kill-roe-v-wade-rcna84897">overturn federally protected abortion rights</a>. Now, there are abortion bans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/abortion-laws-roe-v-wade.html">in more than 20</a> states, including some that don’t make an exception for victims of rape and incest. Last year, Trump was found <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-rape-carroll-trial-fe68259a4b98bb3947d42af9ec83d7db" data-type="link" data-id="https://apnews.com/article/trump-rape-carroll-trial-fe68259a4b98bb3947d42af9ec83d7db">legally liable </a><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/07/19/trump-carroll-judge-rape/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/07/19/trump-carroll-judge-rape/">for rape.</a> He has repeatedly criticized women he doesn’t like, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/trump-nancy-pelosi-liz-cheney-women.html">including Harris and Rep. Nancy Pelosi</a>, in crude, sexist, and vulgar terms. In the days leading up to the election, recordings of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/382550/jeffrey-epstein-tapes-donald-trump-friendship">convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein calling Trump his closest friend</a> became public. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of it was enough to convince voters not to give him another shot at the most important job in the country. It seems that his winning coalition included white women, a majority of whom voted for him in 2024, according to exit polls, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/">just as they did four years ago</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For a very real moment, it looked as though female voters, as a broader, multiracial group, might help send a Democrat to the White House, like they did in 2020.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the end, it wasn’t enough. American voters have now twice chosen Trump over eminently qualified women.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The last time Trump won, women took to the streets in a historic protest. In the next election cycle, the United States <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/7/18024742/midterm-results-record-women-win">elected more women to Congress than ever before</a>. That helped pave the way for a new generation of women leaders, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/us/elections/female-candidates-president.html">the six women who ran for president as Democrats</a> in 2020. It’s possible that will happen again.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, it will take several more days to tally the final votes, and figure out what they mean. But one conclusion seems obvious. Donald Trump ran a campaign geared toward dissatisfied men. It worked.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President-elect Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 election was powered by a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382807/trump-leading-harris-2024-electoral-college">remarkably consistent nationwide trend</a> of voters turning against the Democratic ticket. Vice President Kamala Harris performed worse than President Joe Biden did in 2020 nearly everywhere: in big cities and rural areas, in blue states and red ones.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most of the conventional explanations for why a campaign fails —&nbsp;things like messaging choices, or whether candidates campaigned enough in the right places — <a href="https://goodauthority.org/news/where-to-start-to-explain-trumps-win/">cannot account for such a sweeping shift</a>. Such factors matter on the margins and among specific demographic groups, but Harris received a decisive, across-the-board rebuke.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To explain what truly happened, we need to look at global trends as a point of comparison. And when we do, a clear picture emerges: What happened on Tuesday is part of a worldwide wave of anti-incumbent sentiment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">2024 was the largest year of elections in global history; more people voted this year than ever before. And across the world, voters told the party in power —&nbsp;regardless of their ideology or history — that it was time for a change.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We saw this anti-incumbent wave in elections in the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/359363/uk-french-election-results-2024-britain-england-france-biden">United Kingdom</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/botswanas-ruling-party-loses-its-majority-this-weeks-election-mmegi-newspaper-2024-11-01/">Botswana</a>; in <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/353785/india-election-2024-modi-bjp">India</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/north-macedonia-parliament-approves-new-nationalist-dominated-government-2024-06-23/">North Macedonia</a>; and in <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/south-koreas-2024-general-election-results-and-implications">South Korea</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/355328/south-africa-apartheid-cyril-ramaphosa-anc-jacob-zuma-mk-elecitons-parliament">South Africa</a>. It continued a global trend begun in the previous year, when voters in <a href="https://protectdemocracy.org/work/poland-democracy-wins/">Poland</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/12/17/24003970/argentina-president-javier-milei">Argentina</a> opted to move on from current leadership. The handful of 2024 exceptions to this general rule look like true outliers: The incumbent party’s victory in Mexico, for example, came after <a href="https://apnews.com/article/global-elections-2024-democracy-polarization-unhappy-719d47908aca0b421ff3b9bef33e350c">20 straight defeats for incumbents across Latin America</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given Trump’s victory, we can confidently say the United States is not exceptional. Three different <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/2024-exit-polls-fears-american-democracy-economic-discontent/story?id=115529546">exit polls</a> found that at least <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/exit-poll-results-72-americans-unhappy-way-us-going-1980904">70 percent</a> of Americans were <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/05/us-news/election-exit-poll-seven-in-10-voters-say-us-going-in-wrong-direction/">dissatisfied</a> with the country’s current direction, and they took it out on the current ruling party. (While exit polls are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/exit-polls-election.html?unlocked_article_code=1.X04.ZwKX.5orIonRhVE1e&amp;smid=url-share">based on preliminary, rather than comprehensive, data</a> sets, it is notable that so many polls appear to be picking up on the same trend.) Trump registered as the change candidate despite being a former president himself, and the voters rewarded him accordingly.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Once we start thinking about the US election result as part of a global trend, rather than an isolated event, we can start to make a little more sense of what just happened here.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why you can’t understand Trump’s victory without the global trend</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Reading the American press today, you see a lot of focus on granular campaign choices. Did Harris lose because she <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14048557/Democratic-Party-blame-game-Kamala-Harris-election-loss-Joe-Biden-Tim-Walz.html">picked the wrong vice president</a>? Emphasized <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380750/harris-trump-closing-message-fascism-democracy-authoritarianism">the wrong issues</a>? Targeted <a href="https://jacobin.com/2024/11/harris-trump-election-messaging-populism-elites">the wrong kinds of voters</a>? Appeared on <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/kamala-harris-election-loss-joe-rogan-podcast/">the wrong kind of media</a>?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps one of these theories will prove to have merit. We don’t have enough data yet to be sure. But if the story were fundamentally about messaging or targeting, you’d expect her to improve on Biden’s total in some places and do worse in others. The problem is that none of them on their own can explain a truly uniform shift across the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can’t explain Harris’s defeat in terms of losses with the white working class when she also seems to have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ap-votecast-trump-harris-election-president-voters-86225516e8424431ab1d19e57a74f198">done worse than Biden with nonwhite workers and college graduates based on early data</a>. You can&#8217;t focus primarily on her stance on Gaza alienating Arab and Muslim voters when her margin of defeat was far larger than the defections in that group. Ditto with Latinos, and every other subgroup that postmortems are beginning to focus on.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Uniform swings call for uniform explanations. And the most plausible one, given global context, is anti-incumbency.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The central plot lines of the [2024 election] are already clear, and not that dissimilar from four years ago,” the political scientist <a href="https://goodauthority.org/news/where-to-start-to-explain-trumps-win/">John Sides writes at Good Authority</a>. “In 2020, an unpopular incumbent lost reelection. In 2024, an unpopular incumbent’s party lost reelection.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such an explanation makes more sense than a pure focus on ideology. In fact, the global context suggests that a Republican president likely would have also performed poorly if they were in office. While some right-wing insurgents have performed well in the past two years, most notably Javier Milei in Argentina, right-wing incumbents have often underperformed —&nbsp;with ruling conservative parties in Britain, India, and Poland all suffering notable setbacks.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If we are indeed seeing America fall in line with the global pattern, it clarifies some of what just happened. But it also raises a new, difficult question: Why are people so<em> </em>dissatisfied with their governments at this particular point in time?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One credible answer is inflation. Countries around the world experienced rising prices after the Covid-19 pandemic and attendant global supply chain disruptions, and <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2024/06/two-studies-explore-americans-perception-of-inflation/">voters hate inflation</a>. Even though the inflation rate has gone down in quite a few places, including the United States, prices remain much higher than they were prior to the pandemic. People remember the low prices they’ve lost, and they are hurting —&nbsp;hurting enough that they see <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/11/3-reasons-bidens-strong-economy-is-unpopular.html">an otherwise-booming economy as a failure</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As much sense as the inflation story makes, it remains an unproven one. We’ll need a lot more evidence, including detailed data on the US election that isn’t available yet, to be sure whether it’s right.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But we can be fairly confident, given reams of polling data showing Americans were dissatisfied with the country’s direction, that a desire for a change in leadership played at least some role in Trump’s return to power — part of a global trend away from stability and toward upheaval, however chaotic or even dangerous it will prove to be.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now that it is clear Donald Trump will become president again and will have a Republican Senate and almost certainly a Republican House to back him, it’s important to ask: What will he do with these majorities? And given <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/presidents-2021-budget-would-cut-food-assistance-for-millions-and-radically-restructure">his track record last time</a>, what will it mean for poor Americans and the programs they rely on?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The last time Trump won the presidency, in 2016, I <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/22/13641654/paul-ryan-trump-poverty-safety-net">wrote a piece predicting</a> a huge rollback of the safety net. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), with its massive expansion of Medicaid and patient protections, would be repealed; Medicaid itself would see its funding slashed and its guarantee of coverage to poor people eliminated; food stamps would be cut deep and maybe turned over to the states, much as <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/6/20/11789988/clintons-welfare-reform">welfare for single parents was in 1996</a>, largely destroying that program.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I was wrong. Trump, and especially then-House Speaker Paul Ryan, did try to <a href="https://www.crfb.org/papers/president-trumps-full-fy-2018-budget">do all of that</a>, but in the end <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/31/16055960/why-obamacare-repeal-failed">enough Republicans realized</a> repealing the ACA wasn’t viable. Medicaid and food stamps survived more or less intact. A Democratic House after the 2018 midterms and, more importantly, a global pandemic, meant that by 2020, the safety net was <a href="https://www.vox.com/22348364/united-states-stimulus-covid-coronavirus">significantly stronger</a> than in 2016.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I do not know that the same scenario will play out in 2025, and I certainly hope the pandemic part does not repeat. But despite the devastating electoral blow to Democrats, there are reasons for safety net supporters to be optimistic.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Senate is solidly Republican but not a total blowout, and four defections would be enough for a bill to fail. With Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, who <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/28/16054700/senate-obamacare-repeal-john-mccain-susan-collins-lisa-murkowski">opposed Obamacare repeal in 2017</a>, still in the chamber, it’s not difficult to imagine them and two allies blocking serious changes again.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The House results will not be known exactly for weeks but look, if anything, closer. And while House Speaker Mike Johnson <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/speaker-johnson-criticizes-obamacare-promises-massive-reform-trump-win-rcna177853">surely wants to slash the safety net</a>, he is not Ryan. Shrinking government is not his all-consuming passion the way it was for 2017’s House speaker, who once famously said he <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/3/17/14960358/paul-ryan-medicaid-keg">dreamed of cutting Medicaid while drinking out of kegs</a> as a college student.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s what Republicans might attempt to do to safety net programs, and why achieving it might be difficult.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Health care programs will shrink, but serious cuts will be challenging to pass</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On health care, Republicans have one victory that’s more or less baked in. As part of the 2021 stimulus package, Joe Biden and the Democratic Congress adopted <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22360870/american-rescue-plan-act-premium-tax-credit-health-insurance">expanded subsidies for the ACA’s marketplaces</a>. If you were an individual or small business buying private insurance, the tax credits you received to offset premiums were larger. Subsidies were no longer cut off for people making over 400 percent of the poverty line (about <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines">$125,000 for a family of four</a>), and subsidies for people below that were made more generous. These provisions were later extended through the end of 2025 as part of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/7/28/23282217/climate-bill-health-care-drugs-inflation-reduction-act">Inflation Reduction Act</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s hard to imagine a Republican Congress voting to extend these measures past next year, though insurance companies will certainly <a href="https://www.ahip.org/news/press-releases/extending-individual-market-subsidies-will-provide-much-needed-relief-for-hardworking-american-families">lobby</a> for it. Trump’s past budgets have also <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55958#:~:text=repeal%20subsidies%20for%20health%20insurance%20coverage%20purchased%20through%20the%20marketplaces%20established%20by%20the%20ACA">zeroed out</a> subsidies for private health insurance entirely, which would be a much larger shift.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But subsidies for private insurance are a relatively small part of federal spending on health care. <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/topics/health-care#:~:text=PROJECTIONS%20FOR%20MAJOR%20HEALTH%20CARE%20PROGRAMS%20FOR%20FY%202024">This fiscal year</a>, they amount to $125 billion —&nbsp;very significant, but piddling next to $858 billion on Medicare and $607 billion on Medicaid.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/aug/07/kamala-harris/kamala-harris-says-donald-trump-intends-to-cut-med/#:~:text=%22fight%20for%20and%20protect%20Social%20Security%20and%20Medicare%20with%20no%20cuts.%22">promised not to cut Medicare</a>, much as he did in <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/25/14376014/trump-social-security-medicare-mulvaney">2016</a>, and while his budgets as president did envision spending reductions, they were <a href="https://www.crfb.org/blogs/q-did-trump-propose-deep-medicare-cuts-no">mostly minor</a> and came from cutting provider payments rather than limiting eligibility.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He did, repeatedly and explicitly, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/trump-administration-budgets-and-programs-for-people-of-limited-means/#medicaid-aca">propose cutting Medicaid</a>. The most recent Trump budget to explicitly lay out its plans, for fiscal year 2020, entailed at least $1.1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and the ACA over a decade, per the <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55958#:~:text=Reduce%20Federal%20Spending%20for%20Health%20Care">Congressional Budget Office</a> (CBO). At that time, the agency was <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2019-05/55151-budget_update_0.pdf#page=16">projecting</a> $6.2 trillion in 10-year spending on non-Medicare health programs, meaning Trump was calling for a cut of over 17 percent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump waffled on how clear he wanted to be in calling for Medicaid cuts. His 2021 budget was <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56301#:~:text=Finally%2C%20some%20of,care%20system.4">too vague</a> for the CBO to even model. But when he was clear, the proposals had three steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Repeal the ACA&#8217;s Medicaid coverage expansion and replace it with a “block grant” for states to spend how they like on health programs.</li>



<li>Place a “per capita cap” on the rest of Medicaid, meaning states would only be granted a set amount per covered person by the federal government, regardless of what health care they actually received.</li>



<li>Impose a work requirement, specifically to “require able-bodied, working-age individuals to find employment, train for work, or volunteer” in order to receive Medicaid.</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What unites these proposals, especially the per-capita cap and block grant, is that they mean Congress and the White House don’t have to make granular decisions about who specifically is covered and for what. They can simply cut spending and pass decisions on how to spend what’s left to the states.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Without knowing the exact cap and block grant amounts for the future, it&#8217;s hard to say exactly how big these cuts would be, but the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities&#8217; Gideon Lukens and Allison Orris analyzed <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/changing-medicaids-funding-structure-to-a-per-capita-cap-would-shift-costs-to">how Medicaid would&#8217;ve been cut if per-capita caps had been put in place</a> in 2018. By 2020, most states would&#8217;ve had to slash spending on disabled enrollees (by 12 percent in Pennsylvania and 13 percent in Kentucky); seniors would have seen cuts in 21 states, including cuts of around 17 percent in California; children would have seen cuts in 28 states.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The point here is not the specific numbers but that the idea can, in practice, amount to significant reductions in resources for the program.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is not much room to cut Medicaid without reducing access to the program. Physicians are already paid <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00611">about 28 percent less by Medicaid than by Medicare</a>, and Medicare in turn pays <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2022-01/57422-medical-prices.pdf#page=10">roughly 22 percent less</a> than private insurers. Medicaid, in other words, pays maybe half of what private insurance pays. Further cuts to prices paid to providers would almost certainly reduce the number who accept the program, making it that much harder for poor people to find care. More likely, states would respond to federal cuts by restricting eligibility and kicking people off the program.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether Trump can make these plans a reality depends strongly on what moderate Republicans (like Murkowski and Collins in the Senate and Don Bacon and David Valadao in the House) feel about them. While we don’t know margins for sure right now, it’s looking like <a href="https://polymarket.com/event/of-republican-senate-seats-after-election?tid=1730906142830">Republicans will have 53 Senate seats</a> and <a href="https://polymarket.com/event/of-republican-house-seats-after-election?tid=1730906160388">fewer than 225 House seats</a> (they need 218 to pass a bill there). That means that even a small number of defections would be enough to defeat legislation, even legislation that is advanced through the budget reconciliation process and thus needs only 50 Senate votes plus Vice President-elect JD Vance’s tie-breaker.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Murkowski and Collins alone wouldn’t be able to sink a Medicaid cuts bill, but they would only need two other defections to help them. Remember that in 2017, the bill that Sen. John McCain famously killed with them by making a thumbs-down motion on the Senate floor was the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/28/16054700/senate-obamacare-repeal-john-mccain-susan-collins-lisa-murkowski">so-called “skinny repeal,”</a> which would have only repealed the individual mandate and a few other provisions. The idea was that this bill could then go to a conference committee with the House’s Obamacare repeal bill, where they’d hash out a compromise measure.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some Republicans who voted for the skinny repeal, like Lindsey Graham and Ron Johnson, did so only after being promised that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/us/politics/obamacare-partial-repeal-senate-republicans-revolt.html">House’s bill, which included deep Medicaid cuts, would never become law</a>. There was rather deep opposition to passing sweeping cuts, even outside the three Republicans who blocked the Senate bill. As West Virginia Republican Shelley Moore Capito <a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/7/18/15988388/shelley-moore-capito-obamacare-repeal">said that summer</a>, “I did not come to Washington to hurt people.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All this suggests to me that getting 50 votes for sweeping Medicaid cuts in the Senate will be rather difficult. More difficult still might be the House, where Republicans will have to defend a number of seats where Kamala Harris won and where candidates will not want to enter 2026 midterms with votes to shred Medicaid hanging on them like albatrosses.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Food stamps face brutal cuts</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), colloquially called food stamps, is perhaps the most important safety net program for people who are very poor. <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/research/snap/characteristics-fy22">Seventy-five percent of recipients are at or below the poverty line</a>, and over 1 in 5 report having no other source of income besides food stamps. The share of single parents living on less than $2 a day is nearly 10 percent before you include SNAP benefits. Food stamps <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/6/5/18650492/2019-poverty-2-dollar-a-day-edin-shaefer-meyer">take the number below 3 percent</a>, slashing it by over two-thirds.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because the program <a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/books/breadlines-knee-deep-in-wheat/paper">grew out of efforts to prop up crop prices</a> by redirecting “surplus” crops to poor people, it is the province of the Department of Agriculture, and is renewed every five years in a “farm bill” controlled by the House and Senate Agriculture Committees. The last farm bill, from 2018, <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12233">expired on September 30</a>, meaning that writing a new farm bill will be one of Congress’s main priorities early next year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Glenn Thompson, the Republican chair of the House Ag Committee, released <a href="https://agriculture.house.gov/farmbill/">his proposed farm bill</a> in May. Its most striking provision would <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/press/statements/house-agriculture-committee-farm-bills-30-billion-cut-to-future-snap-benefits-and">limit the ability of the Department of Agriculture to update its Thrifty Food Plan</a>, upon which SNAP benefit levels are based. This would amount to a $30 billion cut over a decade, and is a response to the Biden administration updating the Thrifty Food Plan, which resulted in a nearly 30 percent hike in benefit levels.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump&#8217;s past budgets have <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/presidents-2021-budget-would-cut-food-assistance-for-millions-and-radically-restructure">envisioned much more sweeping cuts</a>. His last one proposed a nearly 30 percent cut to the program, including new work requirements on top of those already in the program and a plan to shift a big share of the program into a &#8220;Harvest Box,&#8221; a plan in which households would not get to choose the food they buy but instead be sent a monthly box of shelf-stable foods that the government picks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Realistically, I suspect the Harvest Box plan in particular will struggle to get traction, in part because major retailers like <a href="https://www.supermarketnews.com/foodservice-retail/walmart-dominates-the-retail-field-in-snap-grocery-market-share">Walmart and Kroger</a> rely on revenue from customers using food stamps and will fight efforts to redirect funds from them to government provision of food. What’s more, farm bills usually go through regular order, meaning that they’re subject to the filibuster and will need Democratic support in the Senate, which will not be forthcoming for sweeping cuts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, Trump has been consistent about wanting to restrict SNAP as a program and will have Ag Committee chairs in both houses who are broadly on his side. The potential for sharp cuts is definitely present.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The 2021 child tax credit is gone, but the credit might improve all the same</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">An area where Trump is unlikely to sign sweeping cuts and might even oversee modest expansions is the child tax credit.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/370753/taxes-debate-trump-harris-irs-tariffs-child-tax-credit">ran on reviving the 2021 version of the child tax credit</a>, which expanded it from $2,000 to as much as $3,600 per child and for the first time made it fully refundable, so poor Americans could benefit even if they were out of work. She also <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/15/nx-s1-5077776/kamala-harris-child-tax-credit-housing">proposed a “baby bonus” of $6,000</a> to families with newborns.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those dreams are dead for at least the next four years. But with the 2017 Trump tax cuts expiring next year, including their doubling of the child credit from $1,000 to $2,000, changes are likely coming to the credit all the same. While returning to 2021 is impossible, it’s likely that the end result will direct more money to poor Americans than the credit does under current law.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Republicans have been insistent that any credit include a “phase-in,” or a provision stating that families must have some earnings to receive the child tax credit. But within that framework, they’ve expressed openness to increasing the amount working families receive.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance notably <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jd-vance-child-tax-credit-5000-what-to-know/">called for a $5,000 baby bonus</a>, only to be one-upped by Harris’s $6,000 bid. This past year, Republican Jason Smith, the chair of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, cut a deal with Democrat Ron Wyden, the outgoing chair of the Senate Finance Committee, to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/1/16/24035922/child-tax-credit-wyden-smith-deal">expand the child credit</a> by altering the way it phases in. Smith will still be the head tax-writer in 2025 and is likely to push for this provision to stay in.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The complication is that Republicans face a wide array of expiring tax provisions next year, and while some, like <a href="https://rollcall.com/2024/09/18/chief-senate-gop-tax-writer-floats-alternative-cost-estimate-for-2025-package/">incoming Senate Finance Committee chair Mike Crapo</a>, suggest they don’t want to pay for extending those provisions, the reality of higher interest rates (meaning government deficits are now more costly to run) suggests that they probably can’t pass everything they want. Given a wish list that runs from extending those cuts to <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/366680/no-tax-on-tips-trump-harris-subminimum-wage">exempting tips</a> and <a href="https://www.crfb.org/blogs/what-would-trump-campaign-plans-mean-social-security">Social Security income</a> from taxation to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/trump-says-hell-make-interest-car-loans-tax-deductible-if-domestically-built-2024-10-22/">letting people deduct interest on car loans</a>, that means that expensive provisions like child tax credit expansions will likely get squeezed. It’s hard to say what exactly will make it into the final package.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the least-trumpeted changes of the past half-century is the steady growth of America’s safety net. <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59510">In 1979</a>, the average lower-income American got $5,300 from government programs aimed at poor people. In 2019, that number was $15,800. America&#8217;s commitment to poor people more than tripled, and the result was a <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/3/10/23632910/poverty-official-supplemental-relative-absolute-measure-desmond">marked reduction in poverty</a>. Trump’s reelection threatens that trend. But his first term, and those of Presidents Bush and Reagan before him, were not enough to reverse it. There are reasons to think it could continue even through the next four years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President-elect Donald Trump was <a href="https://www.vox.com/trump-investigations/2023/8/17/23832734/trump-indictment-democracy-paradox">indicted four times</a> — including two indictments arising out of his failed attempt to steal the 2020 election. One of these indictments <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/352465/trump-convicted-felon-elections">even yielded a conviction</a>, albeit on 34 relatively minor charges of falsifying business records.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the extraordinary protections the American system gives to sitting presidents will ensure that Trump won’t be going to prison. He’s going to the White House instead.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The federal charges against Trump are doomed</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Two of the indictments against Trump are federal, and two were brought by state prosecutors in New York and Georgia. The federal indictments (one about Trump’s role in <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/8/1/23810131/trump-indictment-charges-jan-6-jack-smith-supreme-court">fomenting the January 6 insurrection</a>, and the other about his <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360735/trump-classified-documents-case-cannon-dismissed-indictment">handling of classified documents</a>) are the most immediately vulnerable. Once Trump becomes president, he will have full command and control over the US Department of Justice, and can simply order it to drop all the federal charges against him. Once he does, those cases will simply go away.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The White House does have a <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/restoring-integrity-independence-u-s-justice-department/">longstanding norm of non-interference with criminal prosecutions</a>, but this norm is nothing more than that — a voluntary limit that past presidents placed on their own exercise of power in order to prevent politicization of the criminal justice system. As president, Trump is under no constitutional obligation to obey this norm. He nominates the attorney general, and he can fire the head of the Justice Department at any time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, Trump is reportedly considering Aileen Cannon, a judge who has consistently tried to sabotage one of the Justice Department’s prosecutions of Trump, to be <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/judge-tossed-trumps-classified-docs-case-list-proposed/story?id=114997807">the US attorney general</a>. Cannon, who oversees Trump’s federal classified documents’ trial, even tried to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/6/13/23757893/aileen-cannon-donald-trump-jack-smith-indictment-mar-a-lago-maga">disrupt the Justice Department’s investigation into Trump</a> before he was indicted. There’s no indication that her apparent loyalty to Trump would diminish if she becomes the nation’s top prosecutor.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The fate of the state charges is a little more uncertain, but they are unlikely to amount to anything either</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The fate of the state charges against Trump is a little more uncertain, in large part because there’s never been a state indictment of a sitting president before, so there are no legal precedents governing what happens if a state attempts such a prosecution (or, in the case of New York, to impose a serious sentence on a president who was already convicted).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is highly unlikely that the state prosecutions can move forward, however, at least until Trump leaves office. On the federal level, the Department of Justice has long maintained that <a href="https://www.justice.gov/file/146241-0/dl?inline">it cannot indict a sitting president for a variety of practical reasons</a>: The burden of defending against criminal charges would diminish the president’s ability to do their job, as would the “public stigma and opprobrium occasioned by the initiation of criminal proceedings.” Additionally, if the president were incarcerated, that would make it “physically impossible for the president to carry out his duties.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s little doubt that the current Supreme Court, which recently held that Trump is <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf">immune to prosecution for many crimes he committed while in office</a>, would embrace the Justice Department’s reasoning. The Court’s decision in <em>Trump v. United States</em>, the immunity case, rested on the Republican justices’ belief that, if a president could be indicted for official actions taken in office, he “would be chilled from taking the ‘bold and unhesitating action’ required of an independent Executive.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The kind of justices who favor such “bold and unhesitating action” over ensuring presidential accountability to the law are unlikely to tolerate a prosecution of a sitting president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These same practical considerations would apply with equal force to a state prosecution of a president, and there’s also one other reason why a constitutional limit on state indictments of the president makes sense. Without such a limit, a state led by the president’s political enemies could potentially bring frivolous criminal charges against that president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This argument may not seem particularly compelling when applied to a convicted criminal like Donald Trump. But imagine if, say, Ron DeSantis’s Florida had attempted to indict, try, and imprison President Joe Biden. Or if the state of Mississippi had indicted President Lyndon Johnson to punish him for signing civil rights legislation that ended Jim Crow.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In constitutional law, the same rule that applies to liberal democratic presidents like Biden or Johnson must also apply to an anti-democratic president like Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One open question is whether Trump could be incarcerated during the lame-duck period before he is sworn into office. The only state that could conceivably do this is New York, the only place where Trump has been convicted. Trump is currently <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/06/politics/judge-delays-trumps-sentencing/index.html">scheduled for a sentencing hearing on November 26 in that case</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The question of whether an already-convicted president-elect can be incarcerated is unique — this situation has thankfully never arisen before in US history, so there’s no definitive law on this subject. But it’s worth noting that neither the New York prosecutors nor the judge overseeing this case have pushed for a quick sentencing process. Judge Juan Merchan chose to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/06/politics/judge-delays-trumps-sentencing/index.html">delay sentencing until after the election</a>, and the prosecution did not oppose this move. Merchan may decide to delay matters even further now that Trump has won the election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And even if the sentencing does move forward, the charges against Trump in New York are relatively minor, and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/06/politics/judge-delays-trumps-sentencing/index.html">could only result in him being fined or sentenced to probation</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Again, there’s never been a state prosecution of a sitting president before, so there are no precedents to rely on here. It’s possible that, once Trump leaves office, New York or Georgia (the other state with an open case against Trump) may try to resume its long-pending prosecutions against him — although that assumes that the 78-year-old Trump survives his second term in office, and that these states still have the will to prosecute him four years from now.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The bottom line is that these prosecutions are likely dead. And they are almost certainly going nowhere for the next four years.</p>

</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ranked choice is an electoral reform that felt like a pipe dream only a few years ago, but has been becoming mainstream over the past decade or so. <a href="https://www.elections.alaska.gov/election-information/#RankedChoice">Alaska</a>, <a href="https://fairvote.org/hawaii_passes_ranked_choice_voting_legislation/">Hawaii</a>, and <a href="https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/upcoming/rankedchoicefaq.html">Maine</a>, have adopted it for some elections to Congress or statewide office. While a small handful of municipalities like <a href="https://www.sf.gov/ranked-choice-voting">San Francisco</a> and <a href="https://vote.minneapolismn.gov/ranked-choice-voting/details/">Minneapolis</a> have used it for decades, they were recently joined by <a href="https://vote.nyc/page/ranked-choice-voting">New York City</a>, <a href="https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/elections/ranked-choice-voting-in-seattle">Seattle</a>, and <a href="https://www.portland.gov/transition/portland-transition-election-code/ranked-choice-voting-election-code">Portland, Oregon</a>. Alongside DC, the states of <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Colorado_Proposition_131,_Top-Four_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Initiative_(2024)">Colorado</a>, <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Idaho_Proposition_1,_Top-Four_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Initiative_(2024)">Idaho</a>, <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Nevada_Question_3,_Top-Five_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Initiative_(2024)">Nevada</a>, and <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Oregon_Measure_117,_Ranked-Choice_Voting_for_Federal_and_State_Elections_Measure_(2024)">Oregon</a> all voted Tuesday on adopting the system, and <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Alaska_Ballot_Measure_2,_Repeal_Top-Four_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Initiative_(2024)">Alaska</a> voted on whether to keep it. Interestingly, only in DC did the system pass.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Full disclosure: I voted yes on the DC initiative. I think it probably does more good than harm in the context of our city. First-past-the-post voting clearly has deep flaws, which is why so many places are jumping on the RCV bandwagon. But I also think RCV’s benefits have been oversold and that we should experiment with other ways to make our elections more proportional.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ranked choice voting, explained</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In ranked choice voting (also called “instant runoff”), voters rank candidates in order. All the first-choice ballots are counted. If no candidate has a majority of first-choice votes, then the candidate with the smallest share is eliminated; their votes are then redistributed based on who their supporters ranked second. This continues until a candidate has an outright majority.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I first encountered the idea after the 2000 election. In Florida, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_United_States_presidential_election_in_Florida#Results">97,488 people voted for Ralph Nader</a>; of whom only 537 would have had to vote for Al Gore to give him the win in the state and thus the presidency. What if those Nader voters — who were overwhelmingly liberal — had been able to rank Gore second? Then this would&#8217;ve happened naturally, and the failure of left-of-center voters to coordinate wouldn’t have resulted in George W. Bush’s presidency, the war in Iraq, etc.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This rationale is also why I support the idea in DC. Here, like a lot of coastal cities, almost all the political competition occurs in the Democratic primary, which is often incredibly crowded. Every four years, good-government folks here try to unseat <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/04/27/anita-bonds-dc-council/">Anita Bonds</a>, our notoriously <a href="https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/645055/anita-bonds-new-bill-threatens-to-scramble-the-councils-already-inadequate-response-to-the-john-falcicchio-scandal/">ineffective</a> <a href="https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/177365/atlarge-councilmember-anita-bonds-outed-a-whistleblower-during-a-public-hearing/">and</a> <a href="https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/553561/anita-bonds-says-shes-never-heard-of-d-c-s-massive-housing-voucher-waitlist/">incompetent</a> at-large city councilor, and every time, multiple challengers wind up dividing the anti-Bonds vote. <a href="https://electionresults.dcboe.org/election_results/2022-Primary-Election">Two years ago</a>, she won renomination with 36 percent of the vote, while two challengers each got 28 percent. RCV would make it harder for unpopular incumbents to get renominated by dividing the opposition.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a narrow tool to avoid spoiler effects, RCV works quite well. But its supporters also have grander ambitions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Katherine Gehl, a wealthy former CEO who has <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23412858/nevada-question-3-final-five-voting-katherine-gehl">bankrolled many recent RCV initiatives</a>, argues that her particular version (called “final five” voting) will almost single-handedly make politicians work together again. <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2022/11/02/katherine-gehl-alaska-has-a-voting-solution-for-a-nation-torn-apart/">Gehl wrote two years ago</a>: </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">Barriers to cooperation fall. Senators and representatives are liberated from the constraints of negative partisanship. They are free to enact solutions to complex problems by reaching across the aisle, innovating and negotiating.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The theory is elegant. In <a href="https://finalfiveelections.org/">final five voting</a>, all candidates&nbsp;— regardless of party — participate in a primary. The top five contenders are then placed on the general election ballot, where voters can rank them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The hope is that this eliminates the dynamic where partisan primaries push party nominees to ideological extremes, and where fear of such a primary prevents incumbents from compromising or defying their party (see the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/with-cheneys-loss-just-2-house-republicans-who-voted-to-impeach-trump-are-on-the-ballot-in-november/">of whom four lost renomination</a> when challenged by a pro-Trump Republican). Then, ranked-choice voting in the general election means candidates compete for No. 2 and No. 3 votes, reducing the incentive to negatively campaign.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The case(s) against RCV</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sounds great! So why would someone oppose RCV?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One possible reason is the finding by political scientist Nolan McCarty that under RCV, <a href="https://electionconfidence.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/FINAL-RCV-study-1-10-24.pdf">precincts with more ethnic minorities see more “ballot exhaustion”</a> (failing to rank as many candidates as one is allowed to). That means, McCarty has argued, that the <a href="https://electionconfidence.org/2024/01/11/ranked-choice-voting-hurts-minorities-study/">reform tends to “reduce the electoral influence</a> of racial and ethnic minority communities.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Work by Lindsey Cormack, an associate professor at Stevens Institute of Technology, has similarly found that “<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1532673X231220640">overvoting</a>” (using the same ranking more than once, which means ballots can’t be counted accurately) is more common in minority communities, while University of Pennsylvania’s <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4670677">Stephen Pettigrew and Dylan Radley</a> have found that ballot errors in general are much more common in ranked choice than traditional elections.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Anything that raises the specter of reducing electoral influence for minority communities in the US is worth worrying about. That said, I’m not sure this case is disqualifying either. Ranked choice is a significant change that takes time for an electorate to understand and adjust to. I’m not sure that higher error rates for a newly adopted approach to voting indicate these error rates will persist as the practice becomes normalized.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To me the more compelling counterargument is that RCV seems unlikely to do anything to reduce partisanship and encourage cross-party compromise. The reason why has to do with the classic case against instant-runoff voting, which you might have heard if you’re friends with <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/social-choice/">social choice theory</a> nerds (as, alas, I am).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One thing you’d want a voting system to do is elect the person who would win in a one-on-one race against every other candidate. This is called the “<a href="https://electowiki.org/wiki/Condorcet_winner_criterion">Condorcet winner</a>,” and while there isn’t always one in an election, when there <em>is</em> one, it seems like a good election system should give them the win, as the person the electorate prefers to all alternatives.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ranked choice voting does not always pick the Condorcet winner, and we’ve now seen multiple real-world elections in which the Condorcet winner (which you can figure out from ranked-choice ballot records) lost. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2303.00108v2">Alaska’s US House special election in 2022</a>, which used ranked choice, the Condorcet winner was Republican Nick Begich, but Democrat Mary Peltola won. Something similar happened in the <a href="http://vermontdailybriefing.com/?p=1213">2009 Burlington, Vermont, mayoral race</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Importantly, in both cases the Condorcet winner was the most moderate of the three main candidates. Begich was to the right of Peltola, but to the left of Sarah Palin (!), the third candidate. In Burlington, the left-wing Progressive Party nominee beat both the Democratic and Republican nominees, though the Democrat (a centrist in Burlington terms) was the Condorcet winner.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">RCV advocates note that these are two cases out of thousands of RCV elections, and that <a href="https://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4874&amp;context=wlulr">in practice, Condorcet failures are rare</a>. I’m not so sure about that.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Research from <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4411173">Nathan Atkinson, Edward Foley, and Scott Ganz</a> used a national ranked choice survey of American voters to simulate what elections would look like under the system nationwide. For each state, they simulate 100,000 elections with four candidates. They find that in 40 percent of cases, the Condorcet winner loses, which suggests that the rarity of Condorcet failures in practice may just be an artifact of RCV being relatively new, and that such outcomes would become more common in time as the method spreads.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Worse, the simulation paper finds that the system results in much more extreme winners (that is, winners who are farther away from the median voter) than one that picks the Condorcet winner. Indeed, &#8220;the states where [the system] performs worst (including Arizona, Nevada, and Georgia) are among the most polarized, whereas the states where [it] performs the best (including Massachusetts, North Dakota, and Vermont) are among the least polarized.&#8221; The system seems to actually encourage polarization, not avoid it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">DC aside, voters themselves on Tuesday mostly opposed RCV. In <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2024/11/05/colorado-proposition-131-results/" data-type="link" data-id="https://coloradosun.com/2024/11/05/colorado-proposition-131-results/">Colorado</a>, <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/11/06/election-2024-idaho-proposition-1-ballot-initiative-trailing-in-early-unofficial-election-results/" data-type="link" data-id="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/11/06/election-2024-idaho-proposition-1-ballot-initiative-trailing-in-early-unofficial-election-results/">Idaho</a>, <a href="https://nevadacurrent.com/2024/11/05/nevada-voters-reject-open-primaries-ranked-choice/" data-type="link" data-id="https://nevadacurrent.com/2024/11/05/nevada-voters-reject-open-primaries-ranked-choice/">Nevada</a>, and <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2024/11/05/oregon-ballot-measure-117-ranked-choice-voting/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.opb.org/article/2024/11/05/oregon-ballot-measure-117-ranked-choice-voting/">Oregon</a>, electorates all voted down ballot initiatives that would have introduced some form of RCV. In <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2024/11/05/preliminary-2024-alaska-general-election-results/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.adn.com/politics/2024/11/05/preliminary-2024-alaska-general-election-results/">Alaska</a>, a ballot initiative to repeal that state’s RCV is currently slightly ahead. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">New America political scientist Lee Drutman was once such a great fan of RCV that he <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/breaking-the-two-party-doom-loop-9780190913854?cc=us&amp;lang=en">wrote a book</a> calling for it, but has in recent years come to think it&#8217;s <a href="https://leedrutman.substack.com/p/how-i-updated-my-views-on-ranked">hardly the cure for polarization and dysfunction</a> he once viewed it as, in part due to findings like Atkinson, et al. A better solution, he argues, is to <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/political-reform/reports/more-parties-better-parties/">strengthen parties</a> and encourage more of them to form.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">States should allow “fusion voting,” in which candidates can run on multiple parties’ lines (New York already does this), and for legislatures, seats should be allocated proportionally: If there are 100 seats, and Democrats and Republicans each get 45 percent of the vote and Greens and Libertarians each get 5, then they should get 45, 45, 5, and 5 seats, respectively.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is a much more radical change than ranked choice voting, and requires a real rethinking by politicians. It’s hard to imagine a DC with multiple functional political parties, or where anyone important isn’t a Democrat. But it’s worth trying it and experimenting. We have learned a lot from trying RCV, and we can learn even more.</p>

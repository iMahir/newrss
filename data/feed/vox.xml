<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>This story originally appeared in&nbsp;</em><strong><em><a href="https://www.vox.com/family/369020/kids-children-generation-alpha-gen-school" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kids Today</a></em></strong><em>, Vox’s newsletter about kids, for everyone.&nbsp;</em><strong><em><a href="https://www.vox.com/pages/kids-today-newsletter-policy-childhood-policy-culture" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sign up here for future editions</a></em></strong><em>.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The day after the presidential election, LaToya Bufford’s 16-year-old daughter got a text saying she had been “selected to pick cotton at the nearest plantation.” The text came from a number Bufford’s daughter didn’t recognize, but it addressed her by her full name. The teenager told her mom that some of her friends had gotten the message, too, but only those who, like her, are Black.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bufford said her daughter didn’t have much visible reaction to the text. But Bufford herself was left frightened and on high alert.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I was just shocked and so angry,” Bufford, who lives in Sacramento, California, told me. “If this could happen to my 16-year-old child,” she said, “I’m just scared about what could also happen.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bufford’s daughter was one of the middle school, high school, and college students in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/07/us/racist-text-messages-post-election/index.html">more than 20 states</a> who received similar racist texts in the days following the election. The attacks have continued and broadened in the weeks since, with Latino and LGBTQ+ recipients getting messages threatening them with deportation or being sent to “reeducation camps,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/11/18/election-texts-fbi-investigation/">according to the FBI</a>. Some messages purported to be from “the Trump administration,” though the Trump campaign <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/11/18/election-texts-fbi-investigation/">has said</a> it had nothing to do with the messages. The FBI is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/11/18/election-texts-fbi-investigation/">still investigating</a> the wave of harassment, leaving kids and families wondering who got their names and phone numbers and sent them terrifying, personalized messages.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, other children across the country encountered hate speech and harassment at school immediately following the election, from a racist note left in a <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/school-leaders-confront-racist-texts-harmful-rhetoric-after-divisive-election/2024/11">Wyoming high school bathroom</a> to a spate of anti-immigrant and other discriminatory incidents in a <a href="https://www.wcax.com/2024/11/12/vt-school-district-reports-uptick-post-election-harassment-complaints/">Vermont district</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s not much comprehensive data yet on how many kids have been harassed in the wake of last month’s election, but experts and school officials say the incidents documented so far, like the texts Bufford’s daughter and others received, reflect a continuation of a disturbing pattern.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After the 2016 election, Donald Trump’s xenophobic rhetoric about immigrants and other groups <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/albertsamaha/kids-are-quoting-trump-to-bully-their-classmates">made its way to high school</a>, middle school, and even elementary school campuses, and children began shouting <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/13/17107034/trump-border-wall-mexico">“build the wall”</a> and threatening their classmates with deportation. News reports between 2016 and 2020 document more than 300 incidents of students or school staff using Trump’s words or name to harass children, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/local/school-bullying-trump-words/">according to a 2020 Washington Post analysis</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/this-week-in-hate">reported on hate crimes and harassment</a> in 2016 and 2017. Schools, unfortunately, were a big part of the story, with swastikas and racist slogans defacing the places where children, one parent reminded me, are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/opinion/a-high-school-defaced-with-trump-and-swastikas.html">supposed to be safe</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kids, especially teenagers, don’t always open up to adults about how harassment makes them feel. But hate speech can cut deep, particularly when the target is a child whose brain and sense of self are <a href="https://developingchild.harvard.edu/resources/racism-and-ecd/">still developing</a>. Kids can <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/local/school-bullying-trump-words/">experience physical symptoms</a> like stomach pain and headaches; others can have <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/albertsamaha/school-is-starting-soon-will-the-trump-inspired-bullying">panic attacks</a> or insomnia.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harassment can also deprive young people of their legal right to an education, making them too afraid to stay in class or even to come to school at all, said Erin Maguire, director of equity and inclusion for Vermont’s Essex Westford School District, which experienced a steep increase in harassment reports the week of the election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While complaints there have leveled off, some experts remain concerned about the impact a second Trump administration could have on kids across the country. Kids continued lobbing Trump-inspired insults at their peers throughout his first term, according to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/local/school-bullying-trump-words/">Washington Post analysis</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Schools can make a big difference in supporting students who have been targeted and creating environments free from discrimination, experts say. But they may face an uphill battle in an administration that’s already broadcast its <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/11/15/trump-dei-cabinet-nominees">opposition to equity and inclusion initiatives</a>, as well as its intent to <a href="https://www.vox.com/education/384779/department-of-education-trump-musk-betsy-devos">dismantle government education agencies</a> that enforce civil rights.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now some parents are left preparing their children on their own for what they see as a new reality.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There’s always been hate and racism in this country, but now people are feeling like they can come out from behind closed doors and show that hate,” Bufford said.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hate speech at schools spiked after the election</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the 1990s, hate crimes have tended to increase during election cycles because public dialogue becomes increasingly heated and divisive, said Nadia Aziz, senior program director of the fighting hate and bias program at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a 75-year-old coalition of rights organizations. But the first Trump candidacy “empowered white nationalists” in a new way, she said. Since 2015, reported hate crimes have nearly doubled, <a href="https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/2024-the-state-of-hate-updated/">according to a report</a> released by the Leadership Conference Education Fund earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kids and schools have not been insulated from these larger trends. In Essex Westford, a majority-white district of about 3,800 students near Burlington, Vermont, reports of harassment <a href="https://www.wcax.com/2024/11/12/vt-school-district-reports-uptick-post-election-harassment-complaints/">jumped from the usual two or three</a> a week to 12 the week of the election. Some of the incidents, which spanned age groups from elementary to high school, specifically referenced Trump’s proposed policies around <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies">immigration</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/transgender-people-prepare-donald-trump-second-term-rcna180906">gender identity</a>, Maguire said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At Arapaho Charter High, a small Wyoming school whose students are almost all Native American, a note written on a paper towel and hung on a bathroom mirror read “I hate” followed by a racial slur and a swastika, said Katie Law, the school’s principal. A few days later, a student used the same slur in class. “It was disheartening to see that it continued,” Law said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The texts aimed at Latino Americans were also mostly sent to young people, Juan Proaño, CEO of the League of United Latin American Citizens, a civil rights group, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/11/18/election-texts-fbi-investigation/">told the Washington Post</a>. “Our expectation is that we’re going to see more of this as we get closer to Jan. 20,” he said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bufford, meanwhile, has had a conversation with all her children about “looking out for their backs,” she said. “We live in a very diverse neighborhood,” she said. “But you can never be too careful, especially now.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to help kids who have been harassed</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Families shouldn’t be on their own to protect kids from hate speech; political leaders have an important role to play, experts say. “Any message that public officials send can trickle down to children,” Aziz said. “The more public officials that denounce hateful things,” she said, “the more examples our children have to look up to.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Educators, too, “are looked to across communities to really offer a way forward,” said Liz King, senior program director for education equity at the Leadership Conference. “It is meaningfully important when they get up and say, ‘This is awful.’”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">School leaders can also counter hate speech and discrimination by using curricula that are inclusive of all students, King said. The <a href="https://www.ed.gov/about/ed-offices/ocr">Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights</a> also offers resources for preventing and responding to discrimination in schools.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has pledged to <a href="https://www.vox.com/education/384779/department-of-education-trump-musk-betsy-devos">eliminate that department</a>, but the laws that protect kids’ right to an education aren’t changing, King said. “These laws are not going anywhere, and so each of us has a responsibility to ensure that this administration meaningfully protects all of us from discrimination and enforces our civil rights laws.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Schools need to find ways to hold all students in a way that helps them feel safe and supported,” Maguire said. “It&#8217;s our job to figure that out.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What I’m reading</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Schools and districts are <a href="https://apnews.com/article/immigration-school-deportation-9747be35d2eb109693930f114f148b94">preparing for what might happen</a> if Trump is able to follow through on his promise to enact <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies">mass deportations</a>. Leaders are worried that even the threat of such a policy could make kids too afraid to come to school.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/life/369953/skibidi-tweens-gen-alpha-brainrot-ipad-kids">“Brain rot”</a> is the Oxford University Press <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/arts/brain-rot-oxford-word.html">word of the year</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The 2021 <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/21/23882353/child-poverty-expanded-child-tax-credit-census-welfare-inflation-economy-data">expanded child tax credit</a> lifted families out of poverty — and then it ended. Now, a <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/12/02/nx-s1-5193032/federal-expanded-child-tax-credit-pandemic-child-poverty-kids-rx-basic-income-flint-michigan">program in Michigan</a> is experimenting with its own version, giving parents $1,500 during pregnancy and $500 a month for a baby’s first year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">My older kid and I are revisiting the <a href="https://www.scholastic.com/site/branches/the-notebook-of-doom.html">Notebook of Doom series</a>, an old favorite in which three resourceful kids face off against unusual monsters like “balloon goons,” which are basically evil versions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tube_man">these guys</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">From my inbox</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A couple of weeks ago, I wrote about why <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/386286/kids-reading-literacy-crisis-books">kids aren’t reading for fun</a> as much as they used to, and why that has experts worried. Several of you wrote in with tips for getting kids excited about books. “I advise parents that when they go to the library, don’t get one book, get a basket of books,” wrote one reader. “Keep the receipt on the refrigerator, because it can get expensive if returned late.” (I can confirm this from experience.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Do not nag your children to read,” she continued. “Put the basket near the breakfast table, or near the couch, with the only rule being ‘no phones, no screens.’ If the child doesn’t pick up a book, say nothing. Just get a new basket of books the next week.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In an old cabinet, stashed away at the back of my closet, there are not one, not two, but three drawers full of old cables and devices. Every generation of USB is represented as is every major brand of gadget. I know that I won’t use these cables again, but I also know they don’t belong in the trash. I have no excuse for not recycling them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’m not the only one. Globally, a paltry 12 percent of small electronics get recycled, according to <a href="https://ewastemonitor.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GEM_2024_18-03_web_page_per_page_web.pdf">a 2024 UN report</a>. The numbers don’t get much better for larger electronics. That means billions of pounds of equipment, from old iPods to broken TVs, gets thrown away. Those discarded electronics, commonly known as e-waste, are filled with valuable metals that end up in landfills along with dangerous chemicals that can leach into the soil and groundwater. Beyond that, there’s a veritable treasure trove of critical materials that gets lost when these devices aren’t recycled.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“One of the things that I think that consumers don’t know, and they should, is that it’s way easier to recycle electronics than you might think,” said <a href="https://www.rit.edu/directory/cwbgis-callie-babbitt">Callie Babbitt</a>, a professor in the Rochester Institute of Technology’s sustainability department.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“By recycling a product, you’re able to offset the energy and the materials that it would take to manufacture a new one,” Babbitt added. “And that means we don&#8217;t have to mine as many materials from sometimes vulnerable and ecologically sensitive parts of the world.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Recycling e-waste is not as straightforward as recycling aluminum cans. It’s not exactly rocket science, either.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many big-box stores will recycle your old electronics for you, as will <a href="https://earth911.com/recycling-center-search-guides/https://earth911.com/recycling-center-search-guides/">a growing list of recycling centers</a>. But that fact won’t solve <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/e-waste-recycling-cant-keep-up-precious-metals/">the global e-waste crisis</a>. Humans created 137 billion pounds of e-waste in 2022, which makes e-waste <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/electronic-waste-(e-waste)">one of the fastest growing solid waste streams</a> in the world. Finding a place to put all that trash isn’t the only problem. It’s extremely energy intensive to mine for the critical metals needed to manufacture electronics, so reusing those components is essential in the fight against climate change. And we can all do our part to help address it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It might sound like an exaggeration to say that Americans have billions of dollars worth of world-saving materials in their junk drawers. But it’s not. It’s actually <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2024/11/demand-critical-metals-e-waste-recycling-clean-energy-climate-vince-beiser-book-power-metal/">more like $60 billion</a> worth of stuff.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now that the holiday season is fully upon us, consider giving those materials back to the world. If you just bought a new phone, for instance, don’t throw the old one in the trash. Definitely don’t put it in that drawer in the back of your closet. Someone will probably pay good money to take it off your hands.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The surprisingly complex e-waste crisis</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The term e-waste might make you think of boxes full of old circuit boards, and that’s partially correct. Old circuit boards, cables, and screens all contain small amounts of valuable elements like copper, gold, and silver that can be extracted and reused. However, as microchips have found their way into more and more products, the definition of e-waste has expanded to include everything from light-up kids’ toys to toasters.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The world’s e-waste problem is getting bigger, in part because we’re just making and consuming more electronics, including products that can’t be repaired or were designed to have short lifecycles. (<a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/9/16/23875582/apple-airpod-repair-battery-right-to-repair-act">Looking at you, Apple AirPods</a>.) That 137 million pounds of e-waste created by humans in 2022 breaks down to 17 pounds of e-waste per person. Only about 22 percent of it was formally collected and recycled. Compare that to the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/aluminum-material-specific-data">more than 50 percent of aluminum cans</a> that get recycled and it’s easy to see we have some work to do.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ramping up e-waste recycling would make us less reliant on the destructive and energy-intensive mining operations around the world. In addition to their significant greenhouse gas emissions, mining for the types of metals we need to build electronics also <a href="https://www.unep.org/topics/energy/renewable-energy/critical-energy-transition-minerals#:~:text=While%20the%20growth%20of%20minerals,intensive%20mining%20and%20processing%20activities.">damages local ecosystems and hurts biodiversity</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many of the critical minerals needed for things like smartphones and clean energy tech, including solar panels and EVs, also come from countries with <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-rights-minerals-renewable-abuse-fa0699bddd5ac076377ddedbd20fac50">records of abusive working conditions in mines</a>. Those metals, which include indium (used in touchscreens), tantalum (for capacitors that store energy), and germanium (for semiconductors like microchips), typically <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/0167/gip167.pdf">aren’t found in the US</a>, so recycled electronics are a key way to build up a domestic supply chain for these elements.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There is a global effort right now — almost a race, if you want to say it that way — for countries to have access to rare earth elements,” said Nena Shaw, director of the Resource Conservation and Sustainability Division at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). “And so the US wants to keep what we have.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We’ll need a lot more of those critical materials in the years to come, too. Demand for cobalt, which is essential for EV batteries, will <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/cobalt">grow fivefold</a> by 2050, according to the International Energy Association. Demand for lithium, also a key battery ingredient, <a href="https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/publications/lithium-in-the-energy-transition-roundtable-report/">could grow tenfold</a> by 2050.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You probably have some lithium in a drawer somewhere, maybe inside an old phone’s battery. Throwing that phone in the trash is a bad idea, if only because lithium-ion batteries have an unfortunate tendency to catch on fire and then <a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2021-08/lithium-ion-battery-report-update-7.01_508.pdf">set entire landfills on fire</a>. Recycling is a better idea but only if done right.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The scramble to recapture <a href="https://unitar.org/about/news-stories/press/global-e-waste-monitor-2024-electronic-waste-rising-five-times-faster-documented-e-waste-recycling">an estimated $62 billion</a> worth of unclaimed materials has created an informal e-waste recycling market with harmful consequences. That includes the rise of urban mining, where electronics <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/canary-urban-mine-environmental-and-economic-impacts-urban-mining">are recycled and refined on the streets</a> of low-income countries. This leads to toxic fumes harming local workers and residents and corrosive chemicals being dumped in rivers. The UN estimates that <a href="https://ewastemonitor.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GEM_2024_18-03_web_page_per_page_web.pdf">about half</a> the world’s recycled e-waste goes through informal channels.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So how can you make sure that phone ends up in the right place? The short answer is to go through a big-box retailer, like Best Buy. The longer answer is to seek out certified e-waste recyclers in your area, which requires a tiny bit of knowledge about how the industry works.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>How to recycle anything with a power switch</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The world of formal e-waste collection and recycling is booming. After all, the stuff being recycled is literally full of gold and other very valuable minerals. E-waste recyclers face two big challenges, however. One, recycling old electronics is notoriously complex. Two, not enough people recycle old electronics.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Let’s start with the complex bit. In order to get at the reusable parts of an old phone or TV, recyclers have to tear the thing down to its most basic components. That means ripping off the plastic shell, tearing out the circuit board, and so forth. Recovering the valuable material from those components is more difficult, as it usually involves either melting down the components or bathing them in acid.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This process could work better, and plenty of people are trying to figure out how. One of them is <a href="https://directory.statler.wvu.edu/faculty-staff-directory/terence-musho">Terence Musho</a>, an associate professor of engineering at the West Virginia University. Musho led <a href="https://wvutoday.wvu.edu/stories/2022/09/29/wvu-engineers-bring-new-life-to-electronics-recycling-address-supply-chain-shortfalls-affecting-national-defense">a DARPA-funded project</a> to develop a modular e-waste recycling system.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The holy grail of e-waste recycling is if you could shred your whole iPhone, run it through some process, and get out select metals,” Musho told me. “We&#8217;re not quite there yet.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One thing that would help: More people need to recycle e-waste. Figuring out exactly where to go can be a challenge.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All you really need to know is how to find certified e-waste recyclers. Just look for one of these two main certification programs out there: <a href="https://sustainableelectronics.org/find-an-r2-certified-facility/">R2</a> and <a href="https://e-stewards.org/about-community/">e-Stewards</a>. (Click through those links to find recyclers near you.) Certified R2 and e-Steward recyclers will know how to handle your e-waste in a safe, environmentally friendly way, and they’ll also be mindful of your data security, since you don’t want a scavenger discovering an old hard drive with your banking info on it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You don’t have to hunt down an e-waste specialist to recycle your old gadgets, though. You can actually drop off most old electronics at big-box stores, including <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/services/recycling/pcmcat149900050025.c?id=pcmcat149900050025">Best Buy</a> and <a href="https://www.staples.com/stores/recycling">Staples</a>. You can take batteries, fluorescent light bulbs, and plastic bags to <a href="https://ecoactions.homedepot.com/blog/projects/recycle-rechargeable-batteries-the-home-depot/">Home Depot</a>. Everything else can go to certain <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/lp/dt/dell-reconnect">Goodwill</a> locations that have a partnership with Dell to recycle e-waste. If you’re still at a loss for drop-off sites, <a href="https://earth911.com/recycling-center-search-guides/">Earth911</a> and <a href="https://www.call2recycle.org/locator/">Call2Recycle</a> have handy hyperlocal guides.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are also plenty of ways to get rid of your old electronics and get something back. Big-box retailers, including <a href="https://tradein.bestbuy.com/client/#/catalog">Best Buy</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Trade-In/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=9187220011">Amazon</a>, have trade-in programs for certain devices, as does the popular refurbished electronics marketplace <a href="https://www.backmarket.com/en-us/buyback/home">Back Market</a>. There are also smaller sites like <a href="https://www.decluttr.com">Decluttr</a> and <a href="https://swappa.com">Swappa</a> that accept old gadgets and give you credit on refurbished ones, kind of like a used book store would for your old books.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If all else fails, there’s bound to be an e-waste recycling event in your town or county at some point in time. The New York City Department of Sanitation, for instance, <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/dsny/what-we-do/programs/community-reuse-recycling-events.page">had one</a> at my local library last month.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I regret missing it. After all, those drawers full of cords and old gadgets aren’t going to recycle themselves.</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The war in Syria was supposed to be over.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Over</em>, of course, didn’t mean <em>peace</em>: During the past few months, the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and its Russian backers have <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/7/relentless-bombing-and-constant-death-a-bleak-start-to-2024-for-syria">launched periodic airstrikes</a> on rebel-held areas in the country’s northeast; the US and its Kurdish allies have <a href="https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/PRESS-RELEASES/Press-Release-View/Article/3951025/us-central-command-conducts-airstrikes-against-several-isis-camps-in-syria/">continued to wage an ongoing campaign</a> of airstrikes and special forces operations targeting the remnants of the militant group ISIS; while Israel has continually — particularly since the October 7, 2023, attacks — <a href="https://www.vox.com/israel/378404/gaza-israel-hamas-hezbollah-sinwar-netanyahu-united-nations">struck Hezbollah and targets linked to Iran</a>, both of which are Assad allies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But with <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/388407/ceasefire-lebanon-israel-hezbollah-biden-netanyahu-us" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/388407/ceasefire-lebanon-israel-hezbollah-biden-netanyahu-us">unprecedented conflicts erupting elsewhere in the Middle East,</a> the war in Syria, which has been fought since 2011 and may have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/syrian-observatory-says-war-has-killed-more-than-half-a-million-idUSKCN1GO13M/">resulted in the deaths</a> of more than half a million people and displaced millions more, had become an afterthought.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The front lines were fixed: Sunni militant groups controlled the country’s northeast, US-backed Syrian Kurds dominated the Northwest, and Assad held the rest, including his capital, Damascus. Regional governments like the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia that had spent years backing a revolution to overthrow Assad, <a href="https://authory.com/app/content/aac980a0a94fd4cb088ac55c457c93166">had begun to welcome</a> him — with tacit US support — back to regional summits and gatherings. To the degree Syria was still considered a security threat outside its borders, it was at the nexus of a <a href="https://authory.com/app/content/abc4b4a76d1a04d86adadffe5f34fb04e">flourishing regional drug trade</a> — promoted and facilitated by the regime. The active phase of the war, in which territory regularly changed hands and Assad’s regime faced a serious threat from foreign-backed rebels, seemed to be over. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All that changed last week when a coalition of rebel groups swept into the city of Aleppo, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/12/01/syria-rebels-assad-aleppo-hama/">rapidly pushing back government forces</a> and taking control of most of the city. Aleppo, which had been Syria’s largest city before the war, fell to the rebels in the early days of the uprising, and Assad spent roughly four years fighting to take it back, annihilating much of it in the process. Now, he has lost it again in the span of about four days.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While international governments called on all sides to “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/12/01/syria-rebels-assad-aleppo-hama/">deescalate</a>,” the rebel coalition took control of much of the city, as well as <a href="https://x.com/Charles_Lister/status/1863985683519406132">more than 200 surrounding towns</a>, pushing south toward the government-held town of Hama where the regime has been scrambling to set up a new defensive line. Rebels <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/1262217175052190">have freed inmates</a> from the regime’s jails, where many political prisoners had been held, some for years. In response, Syrian and Russian jets <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/syrias-president-vows-to-defeat-terrorists-as-us-calls-for-de-escalation-13264340">have launched airstrikes</a> on the city, including some that hit hospitals.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vox spoke by phone on Monday with Abdulkafi Alhamdo, an English teacher and opposition activist from Aleppo who gained an <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-38299172">international following</a> for his video reports, posted on social media, in the early days of the Syrian civil war. Alhamdo had been living in rebel-held Idlib for the past eight years, after fleeing Aleppo when it was taken by the Assad regime. He returned to his hometown for the first time over the weekend, reuniting with family members, some of whom he hadn’t seen since the war began 13 years ago.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Eight years I waited, dreaming every day to go back,” Alhamdo told Vox by phone from Syria. “The whole whole world said that we were over, that the season of revolution is over, that we had no chance. But we made it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though the rebels had reportedly been planning their operations for months, it took Washington and other Western capitals by surprise. “It goes to show that sometimes there&#8217;s a tendency in Washington for people to sit there and say, ‘Oh, well, you know, the conflict is frozen. We don&#8217;t worry about it anymore,’” said Brian Carter, an analyst who tracks militant groups in the Middle East for the American Enterprise Institute’s Critical Threats project. “This offensive shows how flawed that sort of thinking is. It’s going to have big impacts for the region and for US policy.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The second fall of Aleppo is also a warning that the conflicts proliferating around the world should not be considered in isolation. Syria had become overlooked because of the much more active wars in Ukraine, the Palestinian territories, and Lebanon, all of which heavily engaged international attention and energy, from high-level arms shipments to global street protests. But the effects of those wars likely provided an opening for the rebels’ stunning advance, and constrained Assad’s ability to respond to it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And in turn, the latest revival of the Syrian civil war is likely to have reverberations that will be felt far beyond the country’s borders.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Will the Syrian regime hold on?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The conflict began in 2011 as an outgrowth of the regional Arab Spring movement, with protests against the Assad regime that quickly mutated into an insurgency after the regime’s brutal crackdown. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Randa Slim, a fellow at Johns Hopkins University’s Foreign Policy Institute who has participated in backchannel negotiations on Syria, told Vox the rapid pace of the offensive reminds her of the momentum the rebels had in the early days of the war in 2012 and 2013. “The opposition was winning, winning, winning, winning, and we were saying, ‘Oh my God, they&#8217;re going to get to Damascus soon,’” Slim said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The tide started to turn in 2013 when the rebels were defeated in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_of_al-Qusayr">battle at the town of al-Qusayr</a> by Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese militia, which had entered the war the previous year on Assad’s side.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/gettyimages-2186933614.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="A billboard bearing a picture of Syria&#039;s President Bashar al-Assad" title="A billboard bearing a picture of Syria&#039;s President Bashar al-Assad" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A billboard bearing a picture of Syria&#039;s President Bashar al-Assad and a national flag are torn by anti-government fighters in Aleppo on November 30, 2024." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, however, Hezbollah is reeling after more than a year of war with Israel that has resulted in the targeted deaths of much of its <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/372772/hezbollah-israel-pagers-radios-lebanon">senior leadership</a>, including <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/10/28/23935157/hezbollah-lebanon-israel-hamas-palestine-gaza-iran-militia-group">longtime head Hassan Nasrallah</a>. “Hezbollah has been dealt a devastating blow in Lebanon, and they have seen many of their fighters leave Syria,” Slim said. Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, the group does not appear to be involved in the regime’s efforts to retake Aleppo.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Assad’s other most vital ally has been Russia. It was Russian airpower that <a href="https://authory.com/JoshuaKeating/What-the-horrors-of-Syria-and-Chechnya-can-tell-us-about-Russias-tactics-in-Ukraine-adaf94e4b9c6948b6a8efbec463c67047">reduced Aleppo to rubble</a> and allowed the regime to retake the city in 2016, another crucial turning point in the war. But Russia has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/19/world/middleeast/russia-syria-israel-ukraine.html">moved much of its military hardware and personnel</a> out of Syria since the start of the war in Ukraine in 2022. As this week’s bombardment shows, the Russians aren’t gone entirely, but President Vladimir Putin may be less willing, this time around, to devote significant resources to bailing out Assad at a time when the Ukraine conflict is at a critical juncture.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mouaz Moustafa, executive director for the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a US-based lobbying group backing and coordinating with the Syrian opposition, told reporters in Washington this week, “I believe that the war in Ukraine and the war in Syria is the same war for the same aims against the same authoritarians, and so I know that I many Syrians are grateful for the brave Ukrainians that have been fighting against the Russians, which gave us the breathing space of not having a full Russian air force in Syria.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The international context is vital to understanding how the Syrian military’s defenses collapsed so quickly, Robert Ford, former US ambassador to Syria, told Vox. “The key thing to know is that the Syrian government has long depended on the Russians and the Iranians to provide hard fighting power because the Syrian army itself is really hollowed out after so many years of fighting and defections and corruption,” Ford said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Assad may not be totally helpless, however. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iraqi-militias-enter-syria-reinforce-government-forces-military-sources-say-2024-12-02/">Hundreds of fighters</a> from Iran-backed militias in Iraq have reportedly crossed the border to fight the rebels in recent days.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Syria is a large country in a strategic location on the sea, between Turkey and Israel, and Iran views it as vital for its regional ambitions. “Do not underestimate the will of the Iranians to throw the kitchen sink at this going forward in order to keep Assad in power,” Slim said.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who are the rebels?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You might think that a major strategic defeat for Iranian and Russian proxies would be enthusiastically cheered by Washington. Instead, the administration has been treating the rebel offensive cautiously, mainly because of who makes up the rebels. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The United States has nothing to do with this offensive, which is led by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a designated terrorist organization,” National Security Council spokesperson <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/11/30/statement-by-nsc-spokesperson-sean-savett-on-syria/">Sean Savett said in a statement</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">HTS, which is indeed the main rebel group involved in the offensive, was, under its former name, Jabhat al-Nusra, an affiliate of al-Qaeda. The group’s leader, Muhammad al-Jolani, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/who-is-syrian-rebel-leader-hts-jawlani-9b157eff">spent five years in an American prison</a> in Iraq for taking part in that country’s anti-US insurgency and has a <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/washingtondc/news/press-releases/up-to-10-million-reward-offered-for-information-on-the-leader-of-the-al-nusrah-front">$10 million price on his head from the FBI</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But supporters of the Syrian opposition say the situation is more complicated than that. The group formally broke with al-Qaeda in 2016, when it changed its name to HTS. It is opposed to both ISIS and <a href="https://www.dni.gov/nctc/ftos/hurras_fto.html">al-Qaeda’s remaining Syrian affiliate</a>. HTS still adheres to and promotes an austere and strict Islamist ideology, but observers say religious minorities, including Christians, have been permitted to exercise their religion in the areas of Idlib they control.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/gettyimages-2187028037.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.687031085813,100,78.625937828374" alt="Armed groups in Aleppo&#039;s city center in Syria" title="Armed groups in Aleppo&#039;s city center in Syria" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Armed groups opposing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad&#039;s regime seized control of much of Aleppo&#039;s city center in Syria on November 30, 2024." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Since taking Aleppo, HTS has “said all the right things,” said Ford, noting that Christian services were held on Sunday. The group has published a statement proclaiming “<a href="https://x.com/azelin/status/1863565507481264597">diversity is our strength</a>” and calling for solidarity with Aleppo’s Kurdish population.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Alhamdo, the activist from Aleppo, told Vox he was not a supporter of HTS’s ideology, but gave them credit for their tactical leadership on the battlefield and felt that “they are developing their mentality.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ford, who spearheaded the move to designate the group — under its former name — as a terrorist organization when he served in the Obama administration, told Vox he “would be hard-pressed now, in 2024, to legally justify a listing” for the group in its current incarnation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, not everyone is likely to buy the group’s rebranding effort. That includes the Biden administration as well as regional governments, like the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, which used to staunchly back the Syrian opposition, but are fearful of the overtly Islamist turn some opposition groups have taken. These are the governments that have also been reaching out to try to normalize relations with Assad.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“For the UAE especially, HTS is Islamist. It is the Muslim Brotherhood. It is evil incarnate, no matter how many permutations it has undertaken,” Slim said. “This group was al-Qaeda, and it’s going to take a lot of change to convince the US, or the Saudis, or the Egyptians that it really has changed.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How do the Kurds fit in?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another group involved in the rebel coalition is the Syrian National Army (SNA), which despite its name is a Turkish-backed proxy militia. Turkey has a more wary relationship with HTS, but reportedly gave the green light to the SNA’s involvement in the operation due to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b62e834d-e8fe-45a7-be18-3221b3d05515">Assad’s unwillingness to engage in talks</a> earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Turkey’s bigger concern, though, is the Kurdish-dominated statelet that has emerged in Syria’s northeast. The Syrian Kurdish forces, known as the SDF, have been America’s primary allies in the ongoing campaign against ISIS, but Turkey views them as a branch of the PKK, the Turkey-based Kurdish militant group that has fought a decades-long insurgency against the Turkish government. The Turkish military and its proxy forces have launched several incursions over the border into Syria to push the Kurdish forces back.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The SDF also controlled some pockets of territory in and around Aleppo but has withdrawn from these as the rebels have advanced. Sinam Mohamad, the representative in Washington for the Syrian Democratic Council — as the predominantly Kurdish government in northeast Syria is known — said she believes Turkey is “planning to occupy some Syrian lands in order to destroy the autonomous administration of northeast Syria.” Despite the HTS’s assurances that Kurds have nothing to fear from Aleppo’s new rulers, she told Vox the group is a “terrorist organization” and that “we are really afraid about the minorities, especially the Kurdish people, in Aleppo city.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Will this be Trump’s first foreign crisis?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mustafa, the Syrian American activist, argues that the US ought to see the events of the past week as a victory for its interests. “What&#8217;s actually happening on the ground is that Syrians are finding our enemies,” he said. He expressed frustration with the Biden administration’s calls on all sides to deescalate the situation. “It makes no sense for me,” he said. “They should ‘deescalate,’ what, the liberation of towns from the Iranians, the Russians and the Assad regime?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Syria has not been a major priority for the Biden administration, as it was for the Obama and Trump teams, and despite national security adviser Jake Sullivan’s pledge on Sunday that the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-december-1-2024-n1311152">US would “stay deeply engaged”</a> in the crisis, it’s unlikely this White House will make any major moves on the issue in its remaining month and a half in office. (The <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/us-strike-hits-weapons-in-eastern-syria-pentagon-83972902">US did launch a strike against Iran-backed militia groups in Syria</a> on Tuesday, though such attacks have taken place repeatedly this year.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What about the next administration? During his first term, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/13/us/politics/mark-esper-syria-kurds-turkey.html">Trump attempted</a> — but was eventually dissuaded by his advisers — from withdrawing the remaining US troops from Syria. (About 900 American military personnel are still in the country as part of the ongoing counter-ISIS mission, operating from Kurdish-held territory in the northeast and from a base near the Jordanian border in the south.) Trump’s selection of former US Rep. Tulsi Gabbard as his director of national intelligence — she’s known for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/26/tulsi-gabbard-bashar-al-assad-syria-democrats">meeting with Assad in 2017</a> and has <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/tulsi-gabbard-claims-met-syrian-president-bashar-al/story?id=45050615">described</a> the entire Syrian opposition as “terrorists” — does not indicate much sympathy for the rebels.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the other hand, Trump and his team are also known for their extremely hawkish views on Iran, a close ally of Assad. Mustafa said he had met with Richard Grenell, a former acting director of national intelligence and an influential Trump adviser, to discuss the situation, and <a href="https://x.com/RichardGrenell/status/1863676856832020978">Grenell’s recent posts on X</a> indicate at least some sympathy to their position.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But as always with Trump and foreign policy, the actual policies he pursues in office are <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/386680/trump-foreign-policy-rubio-hegseth-waltz-gabbard">difficult to predict</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What happens next?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite the Syrian regime’s recent setbacks, Ford told Vox, “I strongly doubt that Damascus, 2024, is going to be Kabul, 2021,” referring to the Afghan capital’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/8/15/22626082/kabul-capital-fall-afghanistan-government-taliban-forces-explained">rapid fall to the Taliban</a> after the withdrawal of US troops. “I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re going to see the HTS militants rampaging through the president&#8217;s office,” Ford said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For one thing, the rebel forces may simply not be large enough. For another, Iran and Russia — even in their diminished capacity — are unlikely to completely abandon a regime they see as strategically vital.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But even if the rebel offensive does not get much farther than the area it currently controls, their rapid success demonstrates a couple of important lessons. One, the war in Syria is not over. Many of the fighters who entered Aleppo this week were young children when the uprising against Assad began more than a decade ago, and there could well be years more fighting to come.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Second, it’s a mistake to consider conflicts like Syria in isolation. The Syrian conflict is often called a “civil war,” which generally means a war fought by factions existing within one country. But at the conflict’s height, it drew in countries from around the region, as well as the United States and Russia, presaging similar lines of conflict in Ukraine. Through the <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2014/01/the-rise-of-isis.html">rise of ISIS</a>, the <a href="https://www.unrefugees.org/news/syria-refugee-crisis-explained/">massive global refugee crisis</a>, and the <a href="https://authory.com/app/content/abc4b4a76d1a04d86adadffe5f34fb04e">spread of illegal drugs</a>, it has had truly global ripple effects. Like a feedback loop, events abroad — particularly in Lebanon and Ukraine — are now helping drive events on the ground in Syria.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The latest offensive will have its own ripple effects. Optimistically, it could allow for refugees from Aleppo living abroad and elsewhere in Syria to return home, and weaken or even topple a truly odious regime, one that has <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/emerging-trends-chemical-weapons-usage-middle-east">used chemical weapons on its own people</a> and is believed to have <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-35806229">killed tens of thousands of civilians</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pessimistically, it could lead to more chaos and displacement. HTS may yet go back to its former jihadist ways, the <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/syria-war-death-toll-over-507-000-13-years-on-32a62fe9">horrific levels of violence</a> we saw years ago could return, more regional actors could be drawn in, and jihadist groups like ISIS could take advantage of the chaos to reconstitute themselves.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The world may have thought it was done with Syria. But Syrians themselves are not done, and the world has no choice but to pay attention again.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">France’s government collapsed Wednesday following a vote of no confidence in the country’s prime minister, pushing the country’s political future into chaos and exacerbating its budgetary and looming economic crises.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The successful vote means center-right Prime Minister Michel Barnier will be out of a job, and that French President Emmanuel Macron will need to find someone to replace him. That’s not expected to be an easy task: While the president nominates prime ministers in France, his picks can be ousted at any time by no confidence votes, like Barnier was. And the National Assembly, the lower house of France&#8217;s parliament, is almost evenly divided between the far right, a loosely united and contentious left wing, and centrists including Macron’s allies. Few candidates will please all three factions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Disagreement about who should be prime minister following surprise elections this past summer led to Barnier’s rise. He was seen as a capable, if not popular, choice for the job, and won enough approval to win the prime minister’s post. But he faced a significant challenge of trying to govern without a majority. His recent attempt to push through a 2025 national budget without a vote in the lower house of parliament infuriated lawmakers on both the right and left. As a result, France’s far-right party and its left-wing alliance each put forward no-confidence motions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, France is stuck. Without a prime minister,&nbsp; the government’s ability to pass laws is hampered. In the long term, Barnier’s removal could deepen France’s ongoing budget crisis and is a reflection of an unprecedented polarization in French politics, for which a solution seems far out of reach.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Who are the players involved?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are three key figures in the no confidence drama: Barnier, the prime minister; Macron, France’s president; and Marine Le Pen, the ideological architect and former leader of the far-right National Rally party, who was instrumental in toppling Barnier.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Barnier, a fairly traditional French conservative, has a long career that includes stints in the French government and the European Commission, most notable as the chief Brexit negotiator on the European side. He lost Wednesday’s no-confidence vote and must resign his post. Macron could reappoint him, but he has indicated that he would not accept the job. His tenure is the shortest in modern French history.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Macron is a beleaguered, highly unpopular president. He will need to appoint another prime minister quickly to pass the government’s budget and, hopefully, prevent an economic crisis from engulfing France. (More on that below.) However, his options are limited given the dysfunction in the National Assembly.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Le Pen is Macron’s chief rival. She has long coveted the French presidency but has failed to secure it three times thus far. She could try again during the next presidential election in 2027, but may be blocked from running, depending on the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/12/04/france-no-confidence-vote-government-collapse/">outcome of a corruption trial next spring</a>. If Macron were to resign and an early election were to happen this year, there would be nothing to bar her from entering the race — and that has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-12-04/france-no-confidence-vote-what-next-for-macron-barnier-le-pen">led to some speculation</a> that deposing Barnier was part of a larger plan to force Macron to quit. (He’s said he’s not going anywhere, however.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Regardless of what Macron decides, Le Pen was able to maneuver her party’s power in the National Assembly and exercise her own influence to bring down Barnier and cause chaos in the French government. She marshaled her party to vote with the left wing coalition’s no confidence motion —&nbsp;even after she <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-02/france-s-barnier-offers-final-hour-budget-concession-to-le-pen?embedded-checkout=true&amp;sref=qYiz2hd0">pushed Barnier to align with her party on key issues</a> in exchange for her party’s approval for his budget.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“She’s annoyed with the political elites and … wants to exercise her vengeance,” <a href="https://fsi.stanford.edu/people/patrick-chamorel">Patrick Chamorel</a>, senior resident scholar at the Stanford Center in Washington, told Vox.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why is the government in trouble now?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">France’s political turmoil didn’t exactly start with Barnier; to understand what’s happening now, we need to go back to July.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That was when France held snap parliamentary elections, following the disastrous defeat of Macron’s party in June’s European Parliament elections. Macron’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/explainers/359421/france-elections-new-popular-front-macron-le-pen-melenchon">decision to hold the election was a surprise</a>, and he hoped voters would reject the far right at home. Instead, those elections saw Le Pen’s National Rally party (or RN) gain ground, as did far-right parties across Europe. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/explainers/359421/france-elections-new-popular-front-macron-le-pen-melenchon">Going into election day</a>, it seemed all but certain that RN would trounce the various left-wing parties and Macron’s centrists. But a last-ditch effort to keep the right wing out of power <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/08/nfp-new-popular-front-france-election-winner-melenchon">formed the New Popular Front</a>, an uneasy alliance of four left-wing parties. Now, <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/france/20240707-france-s-leftist-new-popular-front-wins-a-shock-victory-%E2%80%93-but-now-the-hard-part-begins">they have the largest bloc in the National Assembly</a>, but not enough power and support to get their <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/05/nx-s1-5101536/france-prime-minister-michel-barnier">chosen prime minister candidate approved</a> by the National Assembly. Those left-wing parties<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1l51y6p171o"> </a>have threatened <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1l51y6p171o">a no-confidence vote against Barnier</a> since he took office.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The fractious parliament has a major problem it needs to deal with: An enormous budget deficit, which is tied into the political crisis.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As of now, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/business/france-budget-debt-deficit-macron.html">country’s budget deficit is 6.1 percent of its output and rising, and debt is at 3.2 trillion Euro.</a> Multiple <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/business/france-economy-government-collapse.html">serious crises</a>, including the Covid-19 pandemic and energy crisis caused by Russia’s war in Ukraine —&nbsp;combined with slow economic growth and low tax revenues —&nbsp;have put the country in this position. French <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/business/france-economy-government-collapse.html">companies have begun layoffs</a>, and workers are growing increasingly agitated.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Simply put, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/business/france-economy-government-collapse.html">France’s economic outlook isn’t good</a>, and if the country wants to change that, it needs a real budget that will both start bringing money into government coffers, not to mention a government that can enact policies to strengthen the overall economy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Barnier was tasked with finding a way out; his proposed budget was supposed to save around 60 billion euros by levying large taxes on corporations and the wealthy, as well as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/business/france-budget-debt-deficit-macron.html">cutting public spending including on pensions and healthcare reimbursements</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given the French tradition of a strong social welfare state, an austerity budget was sure to be unpopular. It was. Unable to garner the RN’s support, he used his <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20241202-french-pm-barnier-to-force-budget-bill-through-parliament-49-3-risking-no-confidence-vote">constitutional powers</a> to pass the budget without the National Assembly’s vote —&nbsp;triggering no-confidence motions from the left- and the right-wing blocs.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What happens now that the government has fallen apart?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the short term, Barnier will have to resign as prime minister, and his Cabinet will be dissolved. He’ll <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/world/europe/france-no-confidence-barnier.html">likely stay on</a> until Macron can name his replacement. In France, the prime minister governs much of domestic policy while the president tends to handle international affairs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The government will still continue its day-to-day functioning —&nbsp;unlike a government shutdown in the US, government services will continue. But no new laws can be passed until Macron appoints a new prime minister.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That will not be an easy task; because the National Assembly is so polarized, it will be difficult to find a candidate who will have majority support there. (The prime minister does not have to be approved by the parliament, but since blocs can trigger no confidence votes at any time, the president must appoint someone who could survive one.) France cannot hold another parliamentary election until next summer.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Both RN and the far-left party France Unbowed (also known as LFI, part of the New Popular Front coalition) have called on Macron to resign, which he says he will not do. The next French presidential election is scheduled for 2027, but both RN and LFI hope to force Macron out and run their own polarizing candidates.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the longer term, France’s budget crisis isn’t going anywhere until there is a government in place to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/whats-next-frances-political-budget-crises-2024-12-02/https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/whats-next-frances-political-budget-crises-2024-12-02/">pass a 2025 budget</a>, and successfully passing a new budget likely means acquiescing to Le Pen and the RN.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For now, Le Pen and her party have exercised their power in toppling the government, but Chamorel said there are downsides for her, too. “She will keep her hardline voters,” he told Vox. “But she is going to be held responsible.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Support independent journalism that matters — </em><a href="https://www.vox.com/support-now?itm_campaign=article-header-Q42024&amp;itm_medium=site&amp;itm_source=in-article"><em>become a Vox Member today</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The twists and turns in the ongoing story of Hannah Kobayashi, who went missing in Los Angeles last month after failing to get on her connecting flight to New York, have kept the public riveted for nearly a month. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But now, amid a family tragedy that includes the death of Kobayashi’s father by apparent suicide, police have determined Kobayashi might have walked away from her life voluntarily.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Los Angeles police <a href="https://apnews.com/article/missing-woman-hawaii-hannah-kobayashi-237f5a7131079d4666aa5b0e77dd783e">announced Monday</a> that they’d reviewed surveillance video showing a woman they believed to be Kobayashi on November 12, the day her family reported her missing. Kobayashi, who is from Hawaii, had failed to complete a flight from her home state to New York City. <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/04/us-news/hannah-kobayashi-spotted-buying-bus-ticket-in-la-day-before-police-said-she-crossed-border-into-mexico/">The footage shows</a> a woman who appears to be Kobayashi at a Los Angeles bus station, buying a ticket to the border. Police say she used her passport to make the purchase, then crossed over into Mexico from San Ysidro.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The investigation is the second high-profile missing persons case in recent weeks to take an unexpected turn after the person turned up seemingly unharmed. On November 11, the day before Kobayashi’s family reported her missing, a Wisconsin man resurfaced after being missing for months to admit that he had <a href="https://apnews.com/article/missing-kayaker-ryan-borgwardt-wisconsin-240e49d59e3e69ad95f14baea9fda1d9">faked his own death</a> in a dramatic kayaking incident in order to escape his life and start over in Eastern Europe. Los Angeles investigators felt that Kobayashi had likewise walked away from her own life and that, until she decided to resurface, there was little they could do.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“To date, the investigation has not uncovered any evidence that Kobayashi is being trafficked or is the victim of foul play. She is also not a suspect in any criminal activity,” Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/02/us/hannah-kobayashi-missing/index.html">stated</a> during a news conference. “She has a right to her privacy, and we respect her choices but we also understand the concern her loved ones feel for her.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are several alarming differences between the two cases, beginning with the sharp and sudden turn in Kobayashi’s trajectory. The 30-year-old Maui resident was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/28/us/missing-hawaii-woman-hannah-kobayashi-profile/index.html">a free spirit</a> with a love of art, photography, and the outdoors before she boarded a flight to visit a relative on November 8. It was supposed to be her first trip to the New York City — something she’d had on her “bucket list” of places to see — and she had plans to see a Broadway show with a friend before traveling upstate. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She was sharing the flight with an ex-boyfriend, though they <a href="https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2024/11/16/father-flies-la-search-missing-daughter-who-took-flight-maui-vanished/">reportedly</a> sat in different parts of the plane, and he doesn’t appear to have had anything to do with her disappearance. Kobayashi didn’t join him on their connecting flight out of LAX. Instead, she left the airport. Security footage caught her getting on the Metro headed toward downtown Los Angeles. After her family reported her missing, multiple people reported having seen her at The Grove shopping mall on November 9 and 10. Eagle-eyed web sleuths spotted her appearing on camera 31 seconds into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_bthVI5rMM">a video</a> shot at a LeBron James Nike event held there. Hannah even uploaded a photo from the event <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DCOCme2x2nW/">to her own Instagram</a> — the last post she’s made there to date.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During her days spent in the city, she sent a series of alarming texts to family and friends. One text spoke of “Deep Hackers” who “wiped my identity, stole all of my funds, &amp; have had me on a mind fuck since Friday,” while another claimed she’d been “tricked pretty much into giving away all my funds. From someone I thought I loved.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She also told family she’d missed her flight to New York but reportedly <a href="https://abc7.com/post/hannah-kobayashi-family-missing-hawaii-woman-holding-rally-downtown-los-angeles-call-search-volunteers/15568549/">used language</a> that family members thought didn’t sound like her. One such suspect text, containing odd endearments she didn’t typically use, <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/29/us-news/hannah-kobayashis-friends-think-final-texts-before-disappearance-were-faked-because-they-dont-include-emojis/">said</a>, “I’m just really scared love &amp; the redwoods if calling me &amp; I know I’m meant to be there, I’m being guided there, like you have before … I risk my freedom if this goes wrong for me hun.” Another spoke of her having “just finished a very intense spiritual awakening.” In one text, Kobayashi <a href="https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2024/11/15/really-weird-text-messages-prompt-concern-maui-woman-reported-missing-los-angeles/">reportedly claimed</a> that she was scared and afraid to go home.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Even though she was in contact with us, she wasn&#8217;t in contact with us in her right mind,” her aunt, Larie Pidgeon, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/11/20/hannah-kobayashi-search-los-angeles-timeline/76437467007/">told</a> USA Today.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I just need to rest &amp; I’ll think better,” one text to her mother, sent on November 11, <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/29/us-news/hannah-kobayashis-friends-think-final-texts-before-disappearance-were-faked-because-they-dont-include-emojis/">reportedly read</a>. “But it’s very complicated Matrix underworld shit.” It was one of her final communications to her family. Her final texts indicated she was returning to the airport and promised to keep her family posted. Although she did return to the airport, she ultimately only picked up her luggage, which she’d requested to have flown back from New York to LA. That evening, <a href="https://abc7ny.com/post/family-worries-hannah-kobayashi-missing-woman-missed-flight-connection-lax-maui-hawaii-may-have-been-abducted/15560173/">according to</a> a Facebook post made by her family, she was spotted getting off the Metro near Crypto.com Arena (formerly Staples Center). Her family claimed in the post that they’d seen footage of the sighting which indicated that Hannah “does not appear to be in good condition” and she is not alone.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After November 11, her phone was turned off, and by the following week, Kobayashi had fallen off the grid — she’d stopped sending text updates, and family and friends fanned out across the city to search for her. We now know that she had already crossed the border into Mexico, but her family <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/22/us-news/missing-hawaii-woman-hannah-kobayashi-family-not-heard-from-detectives-for-ten-days/">claimed</a> they had only radio silence from LAPD about what, if anything, they had learned, leaving them to search for answers alone. After the family held a public rally on November 21, police finally got in touch with them, though it would still be another week before any answers arrived.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the middle of the family’s fear that she’d been abducted or trafficked, and amid enormous and growing public speculation about what happened to her, her father Ryan Kobayashi was searching for her.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On November 15, he <a href="https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2024/11/16/father-flies-la-search-missing-daughter-who-took-flight-maui-vanished/">told KHNL Hawaii News Now</a> that he’d experienced&nbsp;a “lot of worrying, a lot of confusion. Everything is just a blur it seems, because I haven&#8217;t slept well since I&#8217;ve heard the news.” He went on to ask Hannah to get in touch with the police or with her family.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There’s a lot of people out there that care and love you, Hannah,” he said. “If you can just get to somebody, whatever you can do … just let us know that you’re okay.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At some time around 4 am on November 24, Ryan Kobayashi died by suicide in Los Angeles.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I’m going to continue to stay strong for you,” Hannah Kobayashi’s sister Sydni <a href="https://www.wsaz.com/2024/11/25/father-missing-hawaii-woman-found-dead-los-angeles/">wrote</a> on social media. “We’re going to find Hannah.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite indications that Kobayashi may have been suffering from a mental break or another form of mental illness, Pidgeon pushed back on this possibility. “She has no record on that,” she <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hawaii-maui-woman-alarming-text-missing-los-angeles-rcna180724">told NBC</a> on November 15. “She is not on medication. Hannah&#8217;s someone that we can call and she&#8217;s going to call us back within an hour.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pidgeon further criticized the public speculation about Hannah’s disappearance for pushing her father to a breaking point. Conspiracy theories online abounded about what happened to her, everything from run-ins with <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23959800/escaping-twin-flames-netflix-jeff-ayan-twin-flames-universe-cult-soulmates">the Twin Flames new-age cult</a> to bad drug trips gone haywire. “If Ryan is looking at all this shit, imagine that weighing on him?” she <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/25/us-news/conspiracy-theories-may-have-sparked-tragic-twist-in-hannah-kobayashis-case/">told</a> the New York Post, which had previously reported sensationalized details like Kobayashi having <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/27/us-news/missing-hawaii-woman-hannah-kobayashis-family-says-venmo-payments-to-mystery-duo-being-investigated/">paid for a tarot reading</a> while she was out and about in LA.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In their announcement that they would be changing Kobayashi’s status to that of a “voluntary missing person,” the LAPD <a href="https://www.wnep.com/article/news/nation-world/police-say-a-hawaii-woman-disappeared-voluntarily/507-7930e85e-7f85-47fa-b264-1d0faf4501fc">claimed</a> that Kobayashi had evinced a desire to “step away from modern connectivity.” This included old social media posts she’d made where she seemed to want to “disconnect from her phone,” according to Missing Persons investigator Lt. Douglas Oldfield.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, the family continued to press for answers, vowing that the search for Hannah would continue. It won’t, however, be continuing as publicly as before. The burgeoning Facebook group “Help Us Find Hannah,” which grew to over 25,000 members, went private after the announcement on Monday, with family members <a href="https://www.wnep.com/article/news/nation-world/police-say-a-hawaii-woman-disappeared-voluntarily/507-7930e85e-7f85-47fa-b264-1d0faf4501fc">reportedly claiming</a> to have received “threats against their lives and the lives of their small children.” It’s unclear what if anything provoked the threats, but it is clear that public speculation and scrutiny surrounding Kobayashi’s disappearance had spiraled in the weeks since she first left LAX. On Tuesday, moderators of Reddit’s r/Hawaii subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hawaii/comments/1h5av1i/hannah_kobayashi_is_believed_to_be_in_mexico/">locked their post</a> about the disappearance because it was “starting to see a lot of baseless conspiracy theories.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However complicated Kobayashi’s story is, it seems abundantly clear that her family is right to be alarmed for her safety. It’s also increasingly evident that while the era of social media and heightened public scrutiny over police investigations can be <a href="https://www.vox.com/22684204/gabby-petito-missing-updates-internet-web-sleuthing">uniquely beneficial</a>, it can also be extremely overwhelming, obfuscatory, and frustrating to family, friends, and officials trying to find loved ones. While the huge number of eyes on Hannah as she went on her journey was undoubtedly helpful in locating her, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hannahkobayashi/comments/1h4ob9z/spotted_on_venice_beach/">false sightings</a> and far-fetched rumors may have made it harder on the family. Hannah Kobayashi’s situation, however alarming, was and is potentially resolvable. It’s impossible to know whether the tragedy of her father’s suicide could have been avoided if her disappearance hadn’t become headline-grabbing news, but it almost certainly didn’t help.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, while it’s tempting to blame Ryan Kobayashi’s death on the media and public frenzy, the real stressors might have been much closer to home. He had <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/25/us/hannah-kobayashi-father-found-dead-hnk/index.html">told CNN</a> that he and Hannah had not been close when she was growing up and that they “hadn’t had contact for a while.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I’m just trying to make up,” he said. “I’m trying to get her back. That’s my main focus.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The grim but less complicated takeaway from this series of tragic events might be just this: The mighty apparatus of true crime theorizing and crowdsourced web sleuthing can often make family tragedies into labyrinthine mysteries when they aren’t. Sometimes, the answers may be undramatic and unsatisfying — but perhaps the simpler they are, the less they lead us astray.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Support independent journalism that matters — </em><a href="https://www.vox.com/support-now?itm_campaign=article-header-Q42024&amp;itm_medium=site&amp;itm_source=in-article"><em>become a Vox Member today</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Supreme Court heard oral arguments Wednesday in <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/united-states-v-skrmetti/"><em>United States v. Skrmetti</em></a>, arguably the <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/385198/supreme-court-transgender-united-states-skrmetti">most important transgender rights case the Court has ever heard</a>. The case asks whether discrimination against transgender people can violate the Constitution — and it appears most of the justices feel it does not. The likely result is that the Court will allow states to ban health procedures that enable gender-affirming care, both for minors and, potentially, adults.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The argument went terribly for transgender Americans, as many of the justices suggested creating a carveout from the ordinary constitutional rule restricting sex-based discrimination of all kinds. Chief Justice John Roberts, for example, suggested giving the government broad authority to engage in such discrimination in the medical context — a ruling that could also have severe implications for women generally, including cisgender women.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said at one point in the argument, “I’m getting kind of nervous” that the Court is going to chip away at one of the “bedrock” principles in US anti-discrimination laws.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Skrmetti</em> involves a 2023 Tennessee law that prohibits trans youth from receiving medical treatments, such as puberty blockers and hormone therapy, if those treatments are prescribed to help them transition. Notably, the law is quite explicit that its purpose is to “<a href="https://casetext.com/statute/tennessee-code/title-68-health-safety-and-environmental-protection/health/chapter-33-health-and-welfare-of-minors/section-68-33-101-findings">encourag[e] minors to appreciate their sex</a>” and to prevent young people from becoming “disdainful of their sex.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although this particular law involves a ban on gender-affirming care for minors, Tennessee&#8217;s arguments in favor of the law could also permit the government to prohibit adults from receiving the same treatments.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At least four justices — Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Brett Kavanaugh — appeared all but certain to vote to uphold Tennessee’s law. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, meanwhile, was a bit less direct in her questioning, but she largely seemed sympathetic to Tennessee’s position. Most notably, Barrett signaled midway through the argument that she was open to Roberts’s call for a medical carveout from the Constitution’s restrictions on sex discrimination.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Justice Neil Gorsuch, a Republican who authored a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/6/15/21291515/supreme-court-bostock-clayton-county-lgbtq-neil-gorsuch">landmark opinion protecting trans rights in 2020</a>, was silent throughout the argument. That left only the Court’s three Democrats to defend the orthodox approach to laws that discriminate on the basis of sex, which casts a skeptical eye on any law that treats people differently because of their sex assigned at birth.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The biggest question in <em>Skrmetti</em>, in other words, is likely to be <em>how</em> the Court finds a way to uphold Tennessee&#8217;s law, rather than <em>whether</em> the Court does so. And it seems fairly likely that the Court’s opinion could fundamentally alter the rules governing sex discrimination by the government.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How the Court’s current precedents approach laws that draw lines based on sex</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The most important thing to understand about Tennessee’s law is that it explicitly draws lines based on a patient’s sex assigned at birth. If a child who is assigned male at birth<strong> </strong>is prescribed testosterone by their doctor, Tennessee permits that child to receive that treatment. But a child who is assigned female at birth may not.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, while Matthew Rice, the Tennessee solicitor general defending his state’s law, tried many times to deny that this law classifies based on sex, he eventually admitted that it did after being pressed by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Jackson.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jackson, for example, asked Rice whether this law would permit a boy who seeks testosterone because he wants to deepen his voice and otherwise enhance his masculinity to receive that treatment, and Rice eventually conceded that, under the specific law at issue in this case, the boy could. Rice then eventually admitted that, if a girl sought the same treatment for the same purpose — to deepen her voice and to make her body appear more masculine — Tennessee’s law would prohibit her from receiving the treatment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This matters because, in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1428365285620704265&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr"><em>United States v. Virginia</em></a> (1996), the Supreme Court held that “all gender-based classifications” are subject to “heightened scrutiny,” meaning that the law is treated as presumptively unconstitutional and the state has to prove that its law was not enacted for impermissibly sexist reasons. Some laws survive this heightened scrutiny, if those laws are grounded in real differences between the sexes and not in prejudice or stereotypes. But, under <em>Virginia</em>, any law that draws lines based on sex in any way whatsoever receives this higher level of review from the federal courts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Significantly, neither the Biden administration, which argued against Tennessee&#8217;s law in the Supreme Court, nor the ACLU, which represents families that want their transgender children to have access to care, asked the Supreme Court to definitively strike down Tennessee&#8217;s law right now. Rather, the sole issue before the Court is whether to send the case back down to a federal appeals court that previously refused to apply the heightened scrutiny required by <em>Virginia</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But many of the justices appeared determined not to apply <em>Virginia</em> to this case. Roberts, for example, warned that there are “medical nuances” in this case that weren’t present in <em>Virginia</em> or some of the Court’s other previous gender discrimination cases. And he suggested that the courts should take a more deferential approach to state lawmakers in cases involving medicine because judges are not good at making medical judgments.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kavanaugh echoed Roberts’s thinking, suggesting at one point that the Constitution does not take sides on a “medical and policy debate.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Barrett also appeared sympathetic to Roberts’s approach, asking Chase Strangio, the ACLU lawyer, whether the courts have ever applied heightened scrutiny in a case involving medical judgments.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Strangio had an excellent answer to this question: During the pandemic, several churches and other religious institutions claimed that they had a constitutional right to defy state rules prohibiting too many people from gathering in one place in order to prevent the spread of Covid. The Court <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/12/2/21726876/supreme-court-religious-liberty-revolutionary-roman-catholic-diocese-cuomo-amy-coney-barrett">eventually split 5-4 in these cases</a>, with five of the Republican justices concluding that the right to freely practice religion overcomes a state’s medical determination that large public gatherings are too dangerous.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Barrett, however, did not appear persuaded, claiming that the Covid cases, in which she ruled with the majority, did not involve “diving deep into the medical evidence.” (Roberts dissented in the Covid cases, so his position in the Covid cases is consistent with the position he seemed to lay out in <em>Skrmetti</em>.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thomas and Alito’s questions, meanwhile, were consistently hostile to the two lawyers arguing in favor of trans rights. When you add their votes to Roberts, Kavanaugh, and Barrett, that’s a majority likely in favor of Tennessee’s law.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the Court adopts Roberts’s approach, which seems likely, that’s not just a devastating blow to transgender youth and their families. It’s also a sea change in the Court’s approach to sex discrimination of all kinds. Again, <em>Virginia</em> held that “all” laws that draw lines based on sex must survive heightened scrutiny, even though some laws ultimately clear this hurdle. “All” means all. But now many of the justices seem eager to hold that only some laws that classify people based on sex are presumptively unconstitutional.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">This case arrives at the Court at the worst possible moment</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s hard to divorce this case from its political context. During his recently victorious presidential campaign, President-elect Donald Trump went <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/380861/trump-transphobic-anti-trans-ads-scapegoating">all in on anti-trans rhetoric</a> — spending literally hundreds of millions of dollars on ads that, in the Washington Post’s words, “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/11/05/election-trans-sports-trump-campaign/">paint trans people as a menace to society</a>.” Republicans control six of the nine seats on the Supreme Court, so it’s not surprising that a majority of the Republican justices seemed to align with their party’s position on trans rights (the Court’s three Democrats, for that matter, also appear aligned with their own party).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But, in their apparent eagerness to uphold this Tennessee law, the Court’s Republican majority appears likely not just to strike a blow against trans rights. They also appear poised to do considerable damage to the legal standard governing sex discrimination generally. Perhaps Tennessee could, if this case were sent back down to the lower court, offer a justification for its law that survives heightened scrutiny. But most of the justices appear ready to overrule <em>Virginia</em>’s statement that all sex-based classifications must undergo such scrutiny.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is why, near the end of Strangio’s time at the podium, Jackson said she is “suddenly quite worried” about the implications of the Court’s questions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the Court can create a medical carveout to the general rule that all sex discrimination is presumptively unconstitutional, what other carveouts might they create in the future? For that matter, will the Court also create similar carveouts for other forms of discrimination, such as race discrimination? Jackson even went so far as to compare Tennessee’s arguments to Virginia’s unsuccessful defense of its ban on interracial marriage in <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/388/1/"><em>Loving v. Virginia</em></a> (1967).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of that said, the Court most likely will not hand down an opinion in <em>Skrmetti</em> until June 2025, when the Court normally decides the biggest cases of its term. There may be time for voices like Jackson’s to convince some of her colleagues to compromise. But based on Wednesday’s argument, <em>Skrmetti</em> appears likely to not just be a historic blow to transgender Americans, but potentially a similar blow against all people who might experience unconstitutional discrimination.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Support independent journalism that matters —&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.vox.com/support-now?itm_campaign=article-header-Q42024&amp;itm_medium=site&amp;itm_source=in-article"><em>become a Vox Member today</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">South Korea is in the grip of a political crisis after President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law on Tuesday — a shocking move that sparked mass protests and drew sharp rebuke from the country’s parliament.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though Yoon has said he will reverse his declaration, that’s unlikely to end South Korea’s political problems, which go beyond Tuesday’s emergency.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yoon first made the declaration during a televised announcement on Tuesday night local time, claiming that the opposition party to his government was in the midst of an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/03/world/south-korea-martial-law/south-korea-martial-law-yoon?smid=url-share">“insurgency” and “trying to overthrow the free democracy</a>,” likely in reference to the political deadlock between himself and the parliament that has prevented him from enacting his agenda. Despite that ongoing gridlock, the move to declare martial law took Yoon’s political opponents, allies, the South Korean public —&nbsp;and the world —&nbsp;by surprise.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Shortly after Yoon’s declaration, South Korea’s parliament, known as the National Assembly, met to unanimously vote down the martial law decree.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There is no reason to declare martial law. We cannot let the military rule this country,” opposition leader Lee Jae-myung said Tuesday. “President Yoon Suk Yeol has betrayed the people. President Yoon’s illegal declaration of emergency martial law is null and void.” Martial law typically involves the suspension of civilian government and rule by military decree in a major emergency, such as intense armed conflict.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite Yoon’s pledge to lift his declaration, the country is still in limbo; on Wednesday, opposition parties in the National Assembly submitted a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/04/south-korea-martial-law-president-yoon-suk-yeol-calls-to-resign-ntwnfb">motion for Yoon’s impeachment</a>, and a vote could come as soon as Friday. What comes next is unclear.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here is what you need to know.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why did the president declare martial law?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yoon only spoke in broad strokes about his decision. However, it’s possible that his declaration was influenced by his <a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2024/11/113_387319.html">dwindling public support</a>, political gridlock, and an ongoing ethics investigation into his wife over a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/09/asia/south-korea-dior-bag-scandal-intl-hnk-dst/index.html">handbag alleged to be an improper gift</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The conservative Yoon is in the second year of his five-year term; during his tenure, his approval rating has fallen below <a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2024/11/113_387319.html">20 percentage points</a>. He’s also been <a href="https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-yoon-martial-law-997c22ac93f6a9bece68454597e577c1">deadlocked with the National Assembly</a>, which is controlled by the center-left Democratic Party, over his political agenda.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yoon “certainly is unpopular and frustrated by an inability to do politics,” Celeste Arrington, director of the George Washington Institute for Korean Studies, told Vox.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yoon “has used an unprecedented number of presidential vetoes” to try and push his agenda through, Arrington said. “He&#8217;s also launched politically motivated prosecutions of the opposition party. Meanwhile, the opposition party has tried to impeach dozens of members of this government and has launched investigations into the first lady. So this [political battle] was back and forth and back and forth, building.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yoon did explicitly claim that North Korean elements played a role in his decision to declare martial law, though there’s no actual evidence of North Korea playing a role in the present crisis. Instead, his reference to North Korea may refer to the major political divide between the country’s two main parties on whether and how to engage with their totalitarian and belligerent northern neighbor.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What does martial law in South Korea entail?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/03/world/south-korea-martial-law/south-korea-martial-law-yoon?smid=url-share">Under martial law</a>, the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/what-we-know-about-south-koreas-martial-law-declaration-2024-12-03/">executive branch is allowed to take control of the media</a>, and Yoon <a href="https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-yoon-martial-law-997c22ac93f6a9bece68454597e577c1">ordered the country’s medical personnel</a>, who have been on strike for much of the year, back to work within 48 hours. It’s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/what-we-know-about-south-koreas-martial-law-declaration-2024-12-03">not clear to what extent those measures were put into place</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Furthermore, political activity, including political party meetings and rallies, is supposed to cease. This was obviously disregarded: The National Assembly met, and protests continued through the night.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Armed guards surrounded the National Assembly building Tuesday night; 190 members of the 300-member body showed up to unanimously vote down the measure, with some&nbsp;scaling the fence around the building to do so, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/south-koreas-president-declares-martial-law-citing-threat-of-pro-north-korean-forces-a1fdc738">the Wall Street Journal</a> reported.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What has the reaction been?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yoon’s declaration has been almost <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/martial-law-south-korea-intl/index.html?t=1733247705508">universally unpopular</a> within South Korea. Citizens showed up to protest —&nbsp;even engaging in clashes with security forces.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Both the opposition leader and the leader of Yoon’s own party denounced Yoon’s decision.&nbsp;“It’s an illegal, unconstitutional declaration of martial law that does not meet the requirements,” said <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/south-koreas-president-declares-martial-law-citing-threat-of-pro-north-korean-forces-a1fdc738">Han Dong-hoon, a former justice minister and leader of Yoon’s People Power Party</a>. “South Korea is a democratic country. We will protect democracy alongside our citizens.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US, a longtime ally of South Korea, said it did not know about Yoon’s declaration before it came.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We have every hope and expectation that any political disputes will be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the rule of law,” <a href="https://www.state.gov/deputy-secretary-kurt-m-campbell-at-a-preview-of-the-usa-pavilion-at-expo-2025-osaka/">US Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell&nbsp;said Tuesday</a>.<strong> </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Wednesday, mass demonstrations called for Yoon’s resignation, and the country’s main labor union organization called for a general strike until Yoon steps down.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s next?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yoon has said he would lift the martial law declaration in accordance with the National Assembly’s vote, as he is constitutionally required to do. The cabinet agreed to lift the order early Wednesday morning local time, and protesters have begun to disperse.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, this is not the end of the crisis, Gi-Wook Shin, director of the Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center at Stanford University, told Vox.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The decision [to declare martial law] appears to be an attempt to assert authority in a climate where his favorability has been declining, but this is basically political suicide as it risks being seen as an overreach of power and might lead to him facing impeachment,” Shin said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-yoon-martial-law-25a2a7c957e77a19f771b6b7c56a2173">Opposition parties in the National Assembly have submitted</a> a formal call for Yoon’s impeachment. Together the parties hold 192 of 300 seats, and a two-thirds majority — or 200 votes — are required to pass the impeachment. Some members of Yoon’s party voted with the opposition to overturn the state of martial law, so it’s possible that the president’s own party members could also vote to impeach him. Six of the nine justices in South Korea’s constitutional court would have to approve the measure for it to pass.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Regardless of what happens to Yoon, polarization between the two main parties and high levels of public dissatisfaction with politics remain, Arrington told Vox.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Neither side is particularly popular; the public trust in both the conservatives and the progressives is low,” she said. “There&#8217;s a deep frustration with the way democratic institutions are functioning, in particular the political parties and the National Assembly.” And the end of the martial law crisis does nothing to change that reality.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>This video is presented by Bluehost. Bluehost doesn’t influence our editorial decisions, but they make videos like this possible.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When choosing a restaurant, you probably look at a few things: What<em> </em>type<em> </em>of food do they serve? How close is it? Are they allergen- or kid-friendly? You’re very likely looking at the list of entrees available to see if anything strikes you before even making a reservation. It’s a pretty typical way to choose a restaurant. After all, you want to enjoy your night out. But chef-instructor Kathryn Gordon from the Institute of Culinary Education in New York has one more suggestion: “I think you should try to look at the dessert menu more.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Desserts at most restaurants have gotten boring. You might find an incredible blend of cocktails or a wide-ranging wine list, followed by a well-curated list of sharable plates for appetizers, and of course the entrees will almost always offer some sort of wow factor. Oftentimes, dessert isn’t even on the main menu. Even the menu itself can feel like an afterthought — and when it hits the table, you’re likely staring down the same options you’ve seen hundreds of times before. There’s a reason for this. Check out the video above to learn more.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Fearless journalism needs your support now more than ever. </em><a href="https://www.vox.com/support-now?itm_campaign=article-header-Q42024&amp;itm_medium=site&amp;itm_source=in-article"><em>Become a Vox Member today</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kash Patel, Donald Trump’s pick to direct the Federal Bureau of Intelligence, has never served in the FBI. But he has hosted Steve Bannon’s podcast.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Patel is a contributor at <a href="https://americasvoice.news/">Real America’s Voice</a>, the right-wing news network that produces Bannon’s show<em> War Room</em>, and has long appeared as a guest on the show. After top Trump adviser Bannon was imprisoned for four months earlier this year —&nbsp;on charges of contempt of Congress after he <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/7/22/23274701/steve-bannon-conviction-contempt-congress-sentence">refused to comply with a January 6 Committee subpoena</a> —&nbsp;Patel stepped up to serve as an occasional guest host.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To try and understand Patel better, I listened to every episode and clip tagged with “Kash Patel” on the <em>War Room</em> website —&nbsp;and a few others that Bannon’s team missed. The overwhelming impression is that Patel is a man whose entire worldview revolves around paranoid conspiracy theories — specifically, conspiracies against both America and Trump, which for him are one and the same. It’s a specific kind of obsession that reminds me of the FBI’s first director: J. Edgar Hoover, a man who infamously abused his power to persecute political enemies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During his various appearances on Bannon’s show, Patel and/or his interviewees declared that:</p>

<ul>
<li>China is funding the Democratic Party and sending “<a href="https://warroom.org/election-infiltration-alert-chinese-communist-spies-invading-the-u-s-through-open-borders/">military-aged males</a>” across the Mexican and Canadian borders to prepare for a preemptive strike.</li>



<li>Barack Obama directs a “<a href="https://warroom.org/unveiling-the-shadow-network-barack-h-obamas-lasting-impact-according-to-lee-smith/">shadow network</a>” that is quietly directing the intelligence community and Big Tech to persecute Trump.</li>



<li>Attorney General Merrick Garland wants to throw “<a href="https://warroom.org/kash-patel-calls-for-action-holding-merrick-garland-and-gop-holdouts-accountable-to-the-constitution/">all of us</a>” — which is to say, Trump allies —&nbsp;in prison.</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And Patel is willing to go to extreme measures in response to these alleged threats.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In one episode, he called on the Republican majority in Congress to unilaterally arrest Garland&nbsp;— invoking an obscure legal doctrine called “inherent contempt” that has never been used in this fashion <a href="https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1035&amp;context=jcl">in the entirety of American history</a>. In another, he outlined a plan for a MAGA blitz of American institutions focused on <a href="https://warroom.org/sit-rep-kash-patels-roadmap-for-trumps-swift-takeover-of-d-c-power-in-the-warroom/">getting loyalists into high office</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is hard to tell whether Patel genuinely believes this stuff or is merely performing for Bannon’s audience. But it’s largely immaterial.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because it is this performance that made him a star in Trumpworld: his willingness to ape Trump’s own conspiratorial worldview making him into a person Trump wants to be in charge of America’s domestic security services. Once in power, his stated commitment to these beliefs — whatever he thinks privately — will push him to act in line with them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Patel, in short, is the kind of man who could become Trump’s Hoover: a man willing to push federal law enforcement into dangerously anti-democratic territory in pursuit of alleged domestic enemies.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The world according to Kash Patel</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Patel <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/10/kash-patel-trump-national-security-council/679566/">owes his career to Russiagate</a>: the seemingly never-ending fight over whether the 2016 Trump campaign colluded with Russian efforts to interfere in American elections.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Patel worked as a staffer for then-Rep. Devin Nunes, the Republican chair of the House subcommittee on intelligence and Trump’s chief defender during the controversy. Patel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/us/politics/kashyap-patel-nunes-memo.html">authored</a> the famous 2018 “Nunes memo” arguing that the FBI application to surveil Trump campaign adviser Carter Page was filled with errors and motivated by political bias.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The memo got <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/12/13/vindication-nunes-memo/">more right</a> than many observers (<a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2018/2/2/16965086/nunes-memo-dud-release">including myself</a>) gave it credit for at the time&nbsp;— though it did <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/about-presidential-medal-freedom-revisiting-nunes-memo">get the bigger picture about FBI bias wrong</a>. Regardless, the incident turned Patel into a Trumpworld star. He ascended to several high-level positions in the first Trump administration relating to defense, national security, and intelligence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These experiences have given Patel a worldview that I think is best defined as paranoid.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Patel believes that foreign enemies — ranging from China to Iran to drug cartels — are doing their best to infiltrate the United States and wreak havoc on its homeland. Only Trump has the strength and the fortitude to stand up against these enemies and defend American allies like Israel.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Democrats, he believes, do not just disagree with Trump&nbsp;on how to handle these threats: They are actively aligned with America’s enemies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In one <em>War Room</em> segment, for example, Patel hosted <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2015/03/why-do-people-keep-predicting-chinas-collapse/">a discredited China “expert”</a> named Gordon Chang to warn that China was “planning an attack on our facilities on our soil.” But it’s worse than that, Chang argued: China had installed Joe Biden as the president of the United States.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“They were actually able to cast the decisive vote in 2020,” Chang told Patel, claiming without evidence that China “poured money into Joe Biden’s campaign” through the Democratic crowdfunding platform ActBlue. Patel’s response was not skepticism but credulity: “I hope people are paying attention.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Democrats are not merely unwitting cat’s paws of foreign powers, per Patel: They are nefarious actors aiming to tear down American democracy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of Patel’s favorite phrases, one that he uses again and again on Bannon’s show, is “two-tiered system of justice.” In his mind, federal law enforcement employs two distinct standards — one for “the deep state’s” friends and another for its enemies. Its allies, like the Bidens, receive only limited and superficial scrutiny,&nbsp;while its enemies are constantly harassed and persecuted. The four prosecutions of Trump, for Patel, are not legitimate inquiries into wrongdoing and abuses of power, but rather agents of a corrupt system lashing out at the one man who threatens their grip on America.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For this reason, Patel has an enemies list — literally. His book <em>Government Gangsters</em>, which he is constantly hawking on <em>War Room</em>, contains <a href="https://x.com/Timodc/status/1863620081873244259">an appendix</a> listing dozens of names that comprise the “executive branch deep state.” The list ranges from names of people you know, like Vice President Kamala Harris, to people you’ve never heard of, like a former State Department diplomat named Elizabeth Dibble.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Patel’s potential power perversions</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If this all reminds you of the most infamous director of the FBI — J. Edgar Hoover — well, it should. The two men share a dangerous tendency to link enemies foreign and domestic, and a willingness to entertain dangerous abuses of law enforcement powers in fighting them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In <a href="https://www.npr.org/2012/02/14/146862081/the-history-of-the-fbis-secret-enemies-list#:~:text=Hoover%20started%20amassing%20secret%20intelligence,the%20FBI%20had%20deemed%20subversive.&amp;text=Newspapers%2FGetty%20Images-,Hoover%20saw%20Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.,%2C%22%20says%20author%20Tim%20Weiner.">his book <em>Enemies</em></a>, journalist Tim Weiner argues that Hoover’s worldview was defined by a bone-deep fear of Communist plots against the American homeland —&nbsp;up to and including physical attacks from “kamikaze airplanes” and “dirty bombs.” Hoover began maintaining a secret list of “enemies of the United States” inside of government and out, conducting illegal surveillance and other law-bending operations designed to bring them to heel. One example: a plot to <a href="https://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/11/12/7204453/martin-luther-king-fbi-letter">convince Martin Luther King Jr. to kill himself</a> by threatening to expose the civil rights leader’s sexual indiscretions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In theory, this is the kind of abuse of power that Patel is against. He rails constantly against government surveillance and abuses of power against political enemies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet at the same time, he is constantly proposing schemes —&nbsp;like Congress arresting Garland — that amount to efforts to criminalize political disagreements. This includes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/us/politics/kash-patel-fbi.html">proposals</a> to investigate prominent Democrats and even prosecute journalists.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Yes, we’re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections — we’re going to come after you,” he said in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/joyannreid/reel/DDBBgt0NnfQ/">a guest appearance</a> on <em>War Room</em> last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Whether it’s criminally or civilly, we’ll figure that out.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On October 16, Liam Payne, a former member of One Direction, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/16/liam-payne-former-one-direction-singer-dies-aged-31">fell from his third-floor hotel room</a> and died. Within days, headlines in <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/10/21/liam-payne-pink-cocaine-in-system-autopsy-reveals/">TMZ</a>, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/liam-payne-partial-autopsy-report-multiple-substances/story?id=114985701">ABC News</a>, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/22/liam-payne-cause-of-death-toxicology-reports-cocaine-methamphetamine">the Guardian</a> announced that he had “pink cocaine” in his system.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On August 10, 24-year-old Instagram model <a href="https://www.instagram.com/maecee_marie/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=6a13609b-2bea-400b-ad6b-75d46e161e2e">Maecee Marie Lathers</a> killed two people in a car crash in Miami. Topless, vomiting, and screaming, Lathers told police officers that <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/09/13/instagram-model-marie-lathers-pink-cocaine-miami/75213417007/">she was under the influence of a drug called “tusi,”</a> a pink powder that’s gaining popularity in the US. A toxicology report later found that while she hadn’t been drinking, there were several other drugs in her system — but nothing called tusi.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://energycontrol.org/sustancias/tusi/">“Tucibi” </a>— also called tusi or pink cocaine — is a Spanish phonetic play on 2C-B, a California-born synthetic psychedelic originally popular amongst Gen X psychonauts and ravers seeking a euphoric, trippy high. However, despite either of its names, pink cocaine rarely contains 2C-B or cocaine at all.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the 2000s, 2C-B made its way from European nightclubs to Colombia, where it devolved into something else entirely: a pink powdered cocktail of every type of party drug you might find at Coachella. It’s essentially a Gen Z <a href="https://www.addictioncenter.com/drugs/heroin/speedball/">speedball</a>: Rather than blending cocaine and heroin, pink cocaine mixes <a href="https://www.vox.com/first-person/2018/7/24/17603616/depression-treatment-severe-ketamine-special-k">ketamine</a> with stimulants <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/365820/mdma-therapy-lykos-therapeutics-maps-psychedelics-ecstasy">like MDMA</a> and even caffeine. It can also include <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00952990.2023.2207716">a chaotic sprinkling</a> of methamphetamine, DMT, and oxycodone, among other substances.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Largely through artful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOjAlLoXOhQ">cartel marketing</a> portraying tusi as pretty, fun, and accessible, this blend of cheap drug leftovers has become the substance of choice for Colombian DJs and Mexican rappers, a wolf in sheep’s clothing for European ravers, and a source of confusion for everyone else. Tusi is making its way across the world, and it’s increasingly important that potential users know what it is.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The global war on drugs was originally organized around the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/synthetic-drugs-could-change-the-global-drug-trade-forever-v26n3/">production and trafficking of plant-based drugs</a> like cocaine, heroin, and marijuana. But in recent years, drug manufacturers have turned to synthetic drugs like MDMA, ketamine, and fentanyl, which are easier to mass produce and smuggle across borders. Pink cocaine is everything new all at once — easy money for producers, a cheap Instagrammable high for users, and a massive headache for law enforcement. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The biggest problem: like playing a game of Russian roulette, only luck decides whether you’ll have fun — or die.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How 2C-B became tucibi&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenethylamine, or 2C-B, was first synthesized in the 1970s by Californian biochemist and psychonaut <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jun/03/alexander-shulgin">Alexander Shulgin</a>, who is best known for introducing <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-podcast/363903/mdma-medicine-ptsd-fda">MDMA</a> to the world of psychotherapy. Of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/from-the-archive-blog/2014/jun/03/shulgin-alexander-drugs-ecstasy-mdma">over 100</a> psychedelics Shulgin created, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/sihkal-shulgins-i-have-known-and-loved/">2C-B was his favorite</a> — in <a href="https://www.cognitiveliberty.org/ccle1/shulgin/adsarchive/2cb.htm">his words</a>, “one of the most graceful, erotic, sensual, introspective compounds I have ever invented.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The effects of 2C-B are <a href="https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_2CB_Glowing_Experiences.shtml">often described</a> as an MDMA-LSD hybrid, giving users both a heightened, vibrant sensory experience and a feeling of euphoria and openness. In many ways, Shulgin viewed 2C-B as a counterpart to MDMA, which has been touted for its therapeutic potential <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-podcast/363903/mdma-medicine-ptsd-fda">for 40 years</a>, well before it became popular as a club drug. Not only are the two drugs chemically similar, but their psychoactive effects complement each other. “Once the MDMA has shown you where your problems are,” <a href="https://www.cognitiveliberty.org/ccle1/shulgin/adsarchive/2cb.htm">Shulgin wrote</a>, “the 2C-B opens up the emotional, intuitive, and archetypal area of your psyche to help you solve them.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Anecdotally, <a href="https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.cgi?A=Search&amp;S1=52&amp;Sub1=&amp;DoseMethodID=-1&amp;S2=-3&amp;Sub2=&amp;S3=-1&amp;Sub3=&amp;Str=&amp;Title=&amp;AuthorSearch=&amp;A1=-1&amp;GenderSelect=-1&amp;Intensity=&amp;I2=&amp;C1=1&amp;Context=-1&amp;Lang=1&amp;Group=-1&amp;S4=-1&amp;SP=1">many people report</a> that 2C-B’s psychedelic effects are relatively mild and short-lived. Trips last a few hours, unlike the full-day trip provided by LSD. Like other hallucinogens, 2C-B generally doesn’t <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/what-is-2cb-and-its-effects/">cause a next-day hangover</a>, according to users <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/what-is-2cb-and-its-effects/">interviewed by Vice</a>. It can also have <a href="https://adf.org.au/drug-facts/2c-b/">less fun side effects</a> like anxiety, nausea, headaches, or elevated heart rate, any of which can get dangerous in situations where users are dancing — and likely not drinking enough water — in crowded, hot spaces.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the 1980s and early 1990s, 2C-B was legally manufactured and sold in adult bookstores and dance clubs <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archive/ndic/pubs0/665/665p.pdf">as a libido-enhancing drug</a>. That changed when the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archive/ndic/pubs0/665/index.htm">listed 2C-B as a Schedule I drug</a> in 1995, pushing it underground, where it remained a <a href="https://psychedelichealth.co.uk/2023/06/23/2c-b-lsd-mdma-baby/">relatively niche drug for rave-goers</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But over the past decade, it’s become an <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/what-is-2cb-and-its-effects/">increasingly popular party drug</a> in Latin America, Europe, and the US. The <a href="https://www.drugsandalcohol.ie/30537/1/Exec-Summary.pdf">2019 Global Drug Survey</a> of over 120,000 people from more than 30 countries reported that darknet purchases of 2C-B and other drugs have been on the rise since 2014.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the early 2000s, wealthy young people <a href="https://insightcrime.org/es/noticias/tusi-coctel-sicodelico-rosa-engano-latinoamerica/">smuggled small amounts of 2C-B</a> from Europe to Colombia, where it quickly became popular in <a href="https://insightcrime.org/news/analysis/2c-b-now-drug-of-choice-for-colombia-elite/">Colombia’s elite club scene</a>. By 2012, models, politicians, and actors were <a href="https://insightcrime.org/news/analysis/2c-b-now-drug-of-choice-for-colombia-elite/">shelling out 130,000 pesos</a> (about $71 at the time) for a gram of 2C-B — over 10 times the price of cocaine. “The media positioned it as an elite drug,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juli%C3%A1n-andr%C3%A9s-quintero-l%C3%B3pez-a5b28421/?originalSubdomain=co">Julian Quintero</a>, a sociologist, drug researcher, and director of the <a href="https://www.acciontecnicasocial.com/que-es-ats/">Technical Social Action Corporation</a> (ATS), a Colombian drug policy nonprofit. “Very few could access it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While 2C-B was considered high-class, it wasn’t much to look at. It was usually sold as a plain-looking pill or an <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine.jpg#/media/File:4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine.jpg">off-white, bitter powder</a> that <a href="https://www.bdp.org.uk/get-information/drugs-information/2c-b/">hurts to snort</a>. To make the drug more appealing, narcos started mixing the powder with sweet pink food coloring. Soon, demand outpaced the supply of 2C-B available in Latin America, so Colombian dealers <a href="https://insightcrime.org/es/noticias/tusi-coctel-sicodelico-rosa-engano-latinoamerica/">cut the powder</a> with cheaper, longer-lasting, and more abundant European imports like MDMA and ketamine.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">People began calling the pink powder “<a href="https://energycontrol.org/sustancias/tusi/">tusi,</a>” a Spanish spelling of the English pronunciation of “2C.” In the early 2010s, Quintero said, tusi still reliably contained about 10 percent 2C-B, mixed in with the MDMA and ketamine. But by the mid-2010s, the 2C-B component disappeared.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Removing the priciest ingredient, Quintero told me, was the “magic formula.” Today, a gram of tusi costs $10, not $100, making it accessible to just about anyone who can afford a night out.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/joseph-j-palamar">Joseph Palamar</a>, a drug use epidemiologist at New York University and deputy director of the <a href="https://ndews.org/">National Drug Early Warning System</a>, said that the homophones — “tusi” and “2C-B” — initially confused old school ’90s ravers, who only knew of the original 2C-B and likely thought that’s what they were taking. But, he said, “new school people probably don’t know the difference.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">One surprising thing</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite the flurry of headlines announcing that, according to an anonymous tip, Liam Payne’s autopsy found pink cocaine in his system, there’s no chemical test for pink cocaine. You can only test for its common ingredients, like ketamine and MDMA. If both of those substances are found at once, it <em>might </em>be pink cocaine — but there’s no way to know for sure.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none"></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>“Those who use cocaine represent the old. Those who use tusi represent the new”</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Calling the powder “pink cocaine,” or polvo rosa<em>,</em> has even less to do with the drug’s contents. “The name ‘pink cocaine’ is one of many fantasies invented by the police to name things they don’t understand,” Quintero said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Much of polvo rosa’s<em> </em>rise in the club scene can be attributed to its Instagram-ready aesthetic. “The fact that it’s a pretty color draws a lot of people in,” Palamar said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a brilliant marketing strategy: transform a bland-looking, expensive, exclusive synthetic drug into an Instagram-worthy accessory that almost any partygoer can afford — simply by changing just about everything in it. If tusi had a standard recipe — something potential users could make informed decisions about — this wouldn’t be as big a deal. But as tusi became more popular, the color told users increasingly little about what they were ingesting.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The thing is,” Palamar said, “anyone could dye any powder pink.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The initial rise of tusi in Latin America was part of a broader trend: Coca and opium production <a href="https://insightcrime.org/news/analysis/un-world-drug-report-new-drugs-new-users">declined between 2007 and 2012</a> for a number of factors, including <a href="https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/WDR2012/WDR_2012_web_small.pdf">increased seizures of heroin</a> exported to the US and evolving drug preferences. At the same time, the production and trafficking of synthetic drugs like 2C-B, MDMA, and ketamine grew. La Empreza, a street gang claiming to be the first to make and sell tusi in Colombia, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOjAlLoXOhQ">told Vice</a> in 2022 that in addition to MDMA, ketamine, and caffeine, their recipe for the drug includes synthetic methamphetamines, LSD, and fentanyl, among other chemicals.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A batch of tusi is essentially made by tossing assorted drugs into a pan, adding a dash of pink food coloring, and stirring the mixture by hand. This isn’t even a great way to make a salad — the dressing won’t be evenly distributed across the greens, and some bites will wind up with more toppings than others. When mixing a powder and liquid drug salad, it’s nearly impossible to ensure that each dose of the final product will contain the same ratio of ingredients. When preparing non-toxic food, perfectly even distribution isn’t usually a concern, but a gram of powder that may contain a mystery dose of a powerful sedative like ketamine — or even the far deadlier fentanyl — is dangerous.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The fact that tusi is so easy to make doesn’t just make it risky — it’s making it more popular. Because tusi is synthetic, lacks a standard recipe, and doesn’t require special equipment beyond kitchenware to make, nearly anyone can prepare it themselves. “Tusi not only emerged as a new drug for a new generation, but also popularized the idea that you can make your own drugs at home,” Quintero said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As of a couple years ago, tusi was the fifth most popular drug in Colombia. Pink cocaine has become synonymous with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D5mC8fXHgQ">Colombian guaracha</a>, a style of electronic house music often referencing the drug in the lyrics. In the song “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D5mC8fXHgQ">Magia Rosa</a>” by DJ Goozo, Massianello, and NesBunny, featured vocalist Paulette sings: “Quiero magia rosas que me ponga poderosa.” In English, this roughly translates to “I want pink magic to become powerful.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Quintero told me that the rise of tusi paralleled the rise of reggaeton, guaracha, small-scale drug dealers, and sexual tourism to Colombia, lending the drug a distinct cultural ethos for a younger generation. “Those who use cocaine represent the old,” he said. “Those who use tusi represent the new.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps nowhere outside Colombia is tusi more celebrated in pop culture than Mexico. While tusi isn’t often mentioned by the Mexican government or mainstream news media, it frequently appears in corridos tumbados — a genre of Mexican regional music blending the vibrant accordions, plucky bass lines, and quintessential trumpets of traditional corridos with hip-hop and reggaeton. Peso Pluma, a 25-year-old Mexican rapper, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/22/arts/music/peso-pluma-regional-mexican-music.html">skyrocketed to global stardom</a> last year with the love song “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZiaYpD9ZrI">Ella Baila Sola</a>,” a collaboration with regional group Eslabon Armado. &nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But a large swath of corridos tumbados are considered <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2023-05-22/peso-pluma-regional-mexican-ella-baila-sola">narcocorridos</a>, or songs centered around the plight of cartels or drugs. Three of his songs — “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Wnso2A4PZE">Lady Gaga</a>,” “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9If4-IhzM0">Rosa Pastel,</a>” and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jvO-GCO_Tk">Las Morras</a>” — mention using pink cocaine as part of a glamorous lifestyle, and music videos for those three songs alone have racked up over 500 million views combined. (Sometimes, the glamorous lifestyle isn’t so glamorous: Peso Pluma had to cancel and reschedule concerts last year because of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/15/arts/music/peso-pluma-postpone-concerts-threats.html">death threats from a cartel</a>.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Europe, home to hard-partying tourist destinations like Ibiza, isn’t a stranger to trippy, risky drugs. Combinations of ketamine and MDMA have been <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/new-drug-queensland-festival-pill-testing/">trending among festivalgoers</a> across the world lately, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-five-big-drug-trends-defining-summer-2024/">priming the club scene</a> for tusi’s arrival. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The drug first arrived in Europe sometime <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pink-cocaine-tusi-colombia-drug/">within the last decade or so</a>. Claudio Vidal, a director at <a href="https://energycontrol.org/">Energy Control</a>, a drug harm reduction nonprofit in Spain, told me that while the first big pink cocaine drug bust happened in 2016, Energy Control first analyzed samples of pink powder in 2011.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2022, the <a href="https://www.unodc.org/documents/scientific/Global_SMART_Update_2022_Vol.27.pdf">United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime reported</a> tusi popping up at music festivals in Austria, Switzerland, and the UK, in addition to party scenes in Spain and Italy. That same year, a <a href="https://energycontrol.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/OEC2022_INFORME_DEF.pdf">survey of nearly 1,500 recreational drug users</a> at European EDM festivals found that about 20 percent had tried tusi in the last 12 months. And this summer, pink cocaine started to gain traction in US states like <a href="https://www.marca.com/en/lifestyle/celebrities/2024/07/04/6686f9c9e2704e75298b45ec.html">New York</a> and <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/pink-cocaine-drugs-narcotics-tusi-dea-coastguard-1923902">California</a> for many of the same reasons it blew up in Colombia: it’s relatively affordable, theoretically fun, and pink.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But, Vidal said, we don’t know enough yet to tell exactly where tusi is most popular, or who exactly is using it. The biggest challenge in studying pink cocaine is that, despite its rising prevalence in pop culture, it’s hard to rigorously study a drug that’s largely defined by what it isn’t. “We do not have enough data,” Vidal said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How dangerous is it, really?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given the lack of research examining pink cocaine specifically, no one knows how many people are having bad reactions to it yet.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Drugs like ketamine and MDMA are unlikely to cause physical dependence — people aren’t generally using these substances to relieve withdrawal symptoms, like one might if they were addicted to opiates. That doesn’t mean they can’t create a kind of psychological dependence — as Palamar said, “A lot of people become accustomed to their world on ketamine,” which can make it hard to stop using it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vidal hasn’t seen a tusi-related spike in demand for treatment at addiction treatment centers in Spain — at least not yet. More research will be necessary to see whether tusi users aren’t checking into treatment centers because they don’t have a substance use disorder, or because they’re avoiding treatment out of fear, stigma, or something else.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But that may change as tusi itself changes. In <a href="https://www.echelecabeza.com/informe-2023-servicio-de-analisis-de-sustancias-sas-echele-cabeza/">its 2023 report</a>, Energy Control found that Colombian manufacturers were starting to add addictive substances like benzodiazepines to batches of tusi. Quintero suspects they are also adding opioids like heroin, morphine, and oxycodone “with the aim of creating dependency.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cases of pink cocaine being contaminated with fentanyl have yet to be reported in the US, but that hasn’t stopped Palamar from worrying about it. Over the past several years, potentially fatal doses of fentanyl have been found in samples of <a href="https://www.dea.gov/alert/dea-laboratory-testing-reveals-6-out-10-fentanyl-laced-fake-prescription-pills-now-contain">fake prescription pills</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376871623012231">methamphetamine, and cocaine</a>. Given its rising popularity, it’s reasonable to think that pink cocaine could be next.<br><br>But, at least for now, the biggest risks with pink cocaine don’t seem to be addiction or fatal overdose. Taking a mystery drug cocktail — especially if it’s mixed with alcohol on a night out — can get someone far more intoxicated than they planned for.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unlike opioids, which can cause <a href="https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bph.15580">severe, potentially deadly respiratory depression</a>, “pink cocaine and the things that are in it generally don’t stop people from breathing, which is good,” said <a href="https://www.medstarhealth.org/innovation-and-research/medstar-health-research-institute/principal-investigators/maryann-amirshahi">Maryann Amirshahi</a>, a DC-based ER doctor and co-medical director of the <a href="https://www.poison.org/">National Capital Poison Center</a>. The most risky thing, Quintero said, “is that young people making it at home don’t know chemistry, and are adding any substances or medications they find in their houses.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Imagine going to a rave for your friend’s birthday. (For the sake of this thought experiment, you’re in your mid-20s, you’ve all been drinking, and you’ve vowed to dance until the sun comes up.) While waiting in line for the bathroom, a kind stranger offers your friend a pink powder, saying it’ll be fun. She goes for it, assuming it’s an upper. Before too long, she’s throwing up and struggling to stand — and she winds up spending the rest of her birthday spaced out on a couch.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If someone uses a stimulant like cocaine or MDMA (which, despite being commonly labeled as a psychedelic, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC81503/">is an amphetamine derivative</a>), it can cause side effects ranging from mild nausea to something as potentially deadly as <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/substance-use/mdma-effects-on-heart#cardiac-symptoms">heart failure</a>. Still, people generally remain tethered to reality.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Palamar cautioned that being exposed to ketamine, a powerful drug that numbs pain and warps perception, after drinking is nothing like trying a little cocaine. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s not a happy drug,” he said. “If you do enough of it, you feel like you’re on another planet.” While it doesn’t stop breathing, it does dramatically reduce one’s awareness of their surroundings, especially when mixed with alcohol — which increases the risk of doing something embarrassing, getting injured, or being sexually assaulted.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, as we probably all learned in high school drug education, the best way to minimize these risks is to not do drugs. But if you’re going to use drugs, Palamar urges users to act with intention: Know what your drugs are made of, and dose with caution. All of the experts I spoke with strongly discourage people from trying unknown blends like pink cocaine, because intentional, risk-minimizing use is basically impossible.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The biggest thing to worry about with pink cocaine is accidentally taking too much ketamine. If you think you might be exposed to ketamine, don’t drink, and don’t place yourself in unfamiliar social situations without support. “You’ve got to be around people you trust,” Palamar said, “because you could become very vulnerable.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One common misconception is that mixing uppers and downers, like MDMA and ketamine, will balance each other out. “The problem is, you can’t always time that,” Amirshahi said. If the downer lasts longer than the upper, “you may end up on the floor in a coma,” she said. Vice versa, and you risk experiencing an “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5877453/">emergence reaction</a>” — a psychotic break upon leaving the “k-hole,” an intense out-of-body experience brought on by high doses of ketamine. “You don’t know how much or what you’re getting, so it’s really hard to titrate, or make that balance.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although according to experts, the risk of accidental fentanyl exposure appears relatively low in the US, it’s potentially deadly and worth taking seriously. You don’t have to be a professional chemist to run basic drug safety tests — harm reduction organizations like <a href="https://fentcheck.org/">FentCheck</a> and <a href="https://dancesafe.org/">DanceSafe</a> work with bars, nightclubs, and festivals to distribute relatively low-cost drug tests to potential users. Low-cost paper <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/stop-overdose/safety/index.html">fentanyl test strips</a> can detect fentanyl in drug samples. They work like at-home <a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/covid-19-test-basics">Covid-19 antigen tests</a>, where you place a nasal swab on a strip of paper and wait for a line to appear if the virus is detected. For a fentanyl test, instead of a nasal swab, you’d add a few milligrams of your drug of choice. While these tests are relatively effective, they don’t work as well when MDMA is present, and can report false positives when testing an MDMA-containing drug blend like pink cocaine.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://dancesafe.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DS_Instructions_Reagents_v17Spring24.pdf">Liquid reagent kits</a>, like those provided by DanceSafe, contain chemicals that change colors in the presence of a range of different drugs. However, Vidal cautions that these tests also don’t work very well on tusi. Because the reagent usually provided for ketamine also reacts to MDMA, if both drugs are present (as they usually are), it’s hard to interpret the results. And as a general rule, Amirshahi recommends <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/353129/you-can-help-reverse-the-overdose-epidemic">always having naloxone</a>, an opioid overdose-reversing nasal spray, on hand — and being prepared to administer it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Spain, Vidal said the drug is continuing to evolve — not just chemically, but aesthetically. Powders with other colors and flavorings — not just pink — made of the same general stuff are also being marketed as “tusi.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pink cocaine appears to be riding on the back of <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-five-big-drug-trends-defining-summer-2024/">ketamine’s meteoric rise</a> in popularity, mostly because it’s cheap and easy to make. But it may also be the case that pink cocaine offers both social capital and a means of escape. With this powder, anyone can project an image of enviable glamour on social media, and take an affordable trip to another planet, if only for a couple hours — at least, that’s the image cartels are projecting. In reality, it’s a bottom-of-the-barrel powder that’s not that special. It’s just pink.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Former President Donald Trump could soon make an announcement about his pick for vice president, a choice that could prove to be uniquely consequential this cycle.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In past elections, a nominee’s running mate has been closely watched for a variety of reasons. They may bring experience to balance a nominee’s lack of it (think Barack Obama’s choice of Joe Biden), or they may appeal to a region or demographic that the nominee would like to reach (think Donald Trump’s pick of Mike Pence), or they may amplify a presidential campaign’s message (think Bill Clinton with Al Gore).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The importance of the VP can be overstated, with researchers finding that they typically <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/7/30/21346478/joe-biden-running-mate-vice-president">affect general election outcomes only if they’re extremely popular or polarizing</a>. But as <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/350310/why-trumps-running-mate-could-be-the-most-important-vp-pick-of-our-time">Vox’s Andrew Prokop has explained</a>, Trump’s choice could have particular significance since they may have to step in given his age and legal baggage. Additionally, there are pressing questions about whether the VP Trump names would stand up to him — like Pence did — if he tries to challenge the democratic transfer of office again.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Increasingly, Trump has hinted that he could announce his decision shortly. He <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-says-knows-presidential-selection-will-rcna158457">recently told reporters</a> he had his choice set “in my mind,” and that the person would “most likely” be in the audience for his Thursday debate with Biden.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thus far, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-narrows-vp-search-his-short-list-is-nearly-all-men-2024-06-07/">sources say his top contenders</a> include Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, who famously criticized the former president and then changed course, as well as <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4737404-trump-vp-pick-potential-candidates/">presidential rivals turned allies</a> Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and North Dakota Gov. Doug Bergum. A number of other names have also been floated, everyone from&nbsp; Trump’s former HUD Secretary Ben Carson to House Conference Chair Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although the VP choice may be a moot point for many voters, particularly given how well Trump is known, each of these options would bring something slightly different to the ticket. With the caveat that other names may still come out, here’s what we know about the potential running mates Trump is considering and what they have to offer.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/gettyimages-2152430348_fd8a96.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Governor Doug Burgum, center, of North Dakota listens as former US President Donald Trump speaks to reporters at the end of the day&#039;s proceedings in his criminal trial for allegedly covering up hush money payments at Manhattan Criminal Court on May 14, 2024, in New York City. | Justin Lane/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Justin Lane/Getty Images" />
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Doug Burgum</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Burgum, 67, is North Dakota’s current governor, a former 2024 presidential candidate, and a businessman. He previously founded a successful software company that he went on to sell to Microsoft for $1.1 billion, and now has an estimated net worth of roughly $100 million, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/doug-burgum-money-how-rich-business-trump-1917110#:~:text=Business%20magazine%20Forbes%20estimated%20last,for%20his%20three%20grown%20children.">according to Forbes</a>. As governor, he’s known for supporting the state’s production of fossil fuels and for signing multiple anti-trans bills into law.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Like several of the people on this list, Burgum has criticized Trump in the past and since changed his tune. He also previously said that Biden won the 2020 election, though he hasn’t directly condemned Trump’s role in January 6 riot.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Burgum has said that he can bring his business expertise and outsider mentality to the ticket, both qualities that Trump has touted about himself. He’s also got a substantial personal fortune that he can contribute to the race. And he’s already taken to the airwaves as a Trump sycophant in an apparent attempt to demonstrate his loyalty. “This guy is tireless, he’s committed, he’s smart, he’s funny. He’s nothing like he’s portrayed in the press,” <a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/potential-trump-vps-sycophantic-claim-092441870.html">Burgum said in a recent Fox News appearance</a>.&nbsp;</p>

Plowman/NBC/Getty Images" />
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">J.D. Vance</h2>

<p><strong>Who is he? </strong>Vance, 39, is a first-term Ohio senator, onetime Trump opponent, and now vocal Trump supporter. He’s also known as the author of <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em>, a memoir that chronicled his experience growing up in a working-class family in the Midwest.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What’s the case for him?</strong> Vance would fully embrace the MAGA agenda as one of Trump’s ardent defenders, as well as add a younger perspective. He would also bring his brief experience in the Senate and some business expertise from his background working in venture capital. Similar to others on this list, he’s a pick that could resonate with the base.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25246679/1946322296.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Tim Scott smiles and waves, wearing a navy suit and red tie.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tim Scott</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he?</strong> A three-term, relatively conservative South Carolina senator, Scott, 58, is also the only Black Republican serving in the upper chamber. Scott is known for his own 2024 presidential run, which floundered early on, and his efforts to find a compromise on police reform in Congress. He previously framed much of his candidacy around pushing back against Democrats’ views on race, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/8/25/21400661/tim-scott-rnc-speech-republican-trump">citing his own success</a> as negating the idea that Black Americans are disadvantaged by systemic racism.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him?</strong> Scott is a religious social conservative with political views broadly in line with Trump’s, though his establishment credentials — including refusing to contest the 2020 election results — might assuage some Republicans wary of the former president. Trump has praised Scott, noting that he <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/02/04/trump-vp-pick-tim-scott-kristi-noem">told the South Carolina lawmaker</a>, “You’re a much better candidate for me than you are for yourself.” Choosing Scott could also be an attempt by the Trump campaign to cement the gains that it made in 2020 with a small number of Black voters.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Marco Rubio</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Rubio, 53, is a three-term Florida senator and former presidential candidate. He entered Congress as a Tea Party conservative, but framed himself as more of a “moderate” option when he unsuccessfully ran for president in 2016. Prior to serving in the Senate, he also served in the Florida House of Representatives. Across these roles, Rubio has focused on foreign policy as well as immigration reform.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the past, Rubio has criticized Trump and dubbed him a “con artist,” but in recent years he’s become an ally and adviser.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Rubio could bring legislative expertise in the Senate as well as the relationships he’s built, providing policy chops that Trump lacks on issues like the Ukraine war.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He’d offer a different generational perspective as well as Latino representation, as a Cuban American. In 2020, Trump made some <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/24118911/biden-trump-2024-election-polls-latino-hispanic-voter-outreach">marginal gains with Latino voters</a> in Florida and Texas, and choosing Rubio could potentially help him reach more members of this community.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/gettyimages-2153411839.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.72964951479,100,78.540700970421" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) speaks with reporters as he leaves the US Capitol on May 17, 2024, in Washington, DC. | Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images" />
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Byron Donalds</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Donalds, 45, is a two-term House lawmaker from Florida and was a state representative for a few terms before that. Donalds is one of just a handful of Black Republican members currently in Congress <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/byron-donalds-house-speaker-political-views-rcna64368">and has described himself as</a> “​​everything the fake news media says doesn’t exist: a Trump supporting, liberty loving, pro-life, pro-2nd Amendment black man.” He was recently criticized for comments he made that suggested that <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/byron-donalds-defends-comments-jim-crow-fiery-exchange-joy-reid-rcna155969">Black families were were more “together” during the Jim Crow era</a>, when policies segregated white and Black Americans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Donalds could contribute the legislative experience he’s garnered and add fresh energy to the ticket as a conservative rising star. He could also increase representation on the ticket as the campaign continues to work on its appeal to Black voters.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/gettyimages-2158636685.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.729628998337,100,78.540742003326" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) speaks at the Faith and Freedom Road to Majority conference at the Washington Hilton on June 21, 2024, in Washington, DC." data-portal-copyright="" />
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Elise Stefanik</h2>

<p><strong>Who is she? </strong>Stefanik, 39, is a five-term House Representative and member of House Republican leadership. Once more moderate, she’s pivoted hard to the right in recent years after her upstate New York district swung in favor of Trump. Stefanik has raised her profile in congressional hearings pushing back against <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/11/19/20966940/elise-stefanik-impeachment-hearing-donald-trump-adam-schiff">Trump’s impeachment</a> and in a recent appearance questioning elite university presidents <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/12/15/24001823/antisemitism-college-harvard-penn-mit-free-speech">about antisemitism on campus</a>. She’s also long advocated for growing Republican women’s representation in Congress and backed fundraising and recruitment initiatives to do so.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What’s the case for her? </strong>Stefanik has had about a decade of legislative experience and has increasingly established herself as a prominent conservative voice who could potentially energize base voters. She’s signaled staunch fealty to Trump and would bring gender and age diversity to the ticket, along with strong rhetorical skills.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her stated views are also pretty much consistent with Trump’s. Stefanik was among the House Republicans who voted to overturn the <a data-source="encore" href="https://www.vox.com/2020-presidential-election">2020 election</a> results and has embraced many of the same extreme positions as the former president on issues like immigration.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/gettyimages-2157097098.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,12.243254128071,100,75.513491743858" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Ben Carson speaks at Turning Point Action&#039;s &quot;The People&#039;s Convention&quot; on June 15, 2024 in Detroit, Michigan. | Bill Pugliano/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Bill Pugliano/Getty Images" />
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Ben Carson</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Carson, 72, is the former HUD Secretary and a renowned neurosurgeon. Carson is perhaps best known for performing the first successful procedure to separate conjoined twins. He also ran for the presidency in 2016 and went on to back Trump after dropping out. As HUD Secretary, Carson was criticized for lacking the housing policy expertise needed for the gig, and later <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/178952/trump-hud-housing-policy-disaster">called for budget cuts</a> that would have gutted the work the agency was doing on issues like affordable housing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Carson is known for his medical expertise and more even-keeled persona, which could serve as a complement to Trump. The Trump campaign also saw <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/11/4/21537966/trump-black-voters-exit-polls">marginal gains with Black voters</a>, particularly men, in 2020 and Carson could increase representation and outreach to build on these wins.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Update, June 26, 6 pm ET:</strong> <em>This story was originally published on February 9 and has been updated to include new reports of candidates on Trump’s vice-presidential list.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the second time in two years, a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-26/us-supreme-court-poised-to-allow-emergency-abortions-in-idaho?srnd=undefined">major Supreme Court abortion decision leaked</a> before the justices officially released it. This time, however, the most likely explanation is a clerical error by someone who manages the Court’s website.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Two years ago, an early draft of Justice Samuel Alito’s opinion in <em>Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization</em>, the case overruling <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/5/3/23054543/supreme-court-roe-wade-abortion-samuel-alito-overruled-draft-politico">leaked to the press</a>. The identity of the leaker remains unknown, as does the leaker’s motive. About two months after the leak, the Supreme Court released its final opinion in <em>Dobbs</em>, which was <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/6/24/23181720/supreme-court-dobbs-jackson-womens-health-samuel-alito-roe-wade-abortion-marriage-contraception">substantially similar to the leaked draft</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Thursday, another significant abortion opinion leaked — although this time the leak appears to be an accident. According to Bloomberg, the justices’ <a href="https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/rJo5436tVr08/v0">opinions in <em>Moyle v. United States</em></a> were “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-26/us-supreme-court-poised-to-allow-emergency-abortions-in-idaho?srnd=undefined">briefly posted on the court’s website</a>” before being taken down. A Supreme Court spokesperson said that “the court’s publications unit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/26/us/politics/supreme-court-abortion-idaho.html">inadvertently and briefly uploaded a document to the court’s website</a>,” and that the final decision will be “issued in due course.” Bloomberg posted the text of the leaked document <a href="https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/rJo5436tVr08/v0">at this link</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Moyle</em> asks whether states can ignore a federal law which requires most hospitals to provide emergency care to patients who need it — <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2024/4/9/24112845/supreme-court-abortion-emtala-moyle-united-states-idaho-life-health">including abortions</a> if that is the appropriate medical treatment. Specifically, whether Idaho’s near-total ban on abortions prevents doctors from providing medically necessary abortions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Assuming that the leaked document resembles the Court’s final decision, a majority of the justices have decided not to decide the <em>Moyle </em>case. Though the Court has seemingly splintered into four separate concurring and dissenting opinions, none of which garnered a majority of the justices’ support, five justices apparently decided that the Court was wrong to take up this case using an expedited process that bypassed an intermediate appeals court.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The leaked document does contain some good news for abortion rights advocates. Last January, the Court temporarily <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2024/1/5/24027273/supreme-court-trump-abortion-emtala-idaho-emergency">blocked a lower court decision</a>, which held that the state of Idaho cannot enforce its strict abortion ban against patients who need an abortion to save their life or to ward off catastrophic health consequences. In the leaked document, six justices voted to reinstate the lower court’s order — at least for now — which means that Idaho patients who require medically necessary abortions will no longer need to be airlifted to other states.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, the primary effect of the decision, assuming it closely resembles the leaked draft, will likely be to punt the final resolution of this case until after the election. That means that patients outside of Idaho — who may have been hoping a decision in this case would set a precedent requiring ER doctors across the country to follow the federal law requiring care in the event of an emergency — may not be able to obtain abortion care that they need to save their life or to ward off very serious health consequences.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s at stake in <em>Moyle</em></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The federal <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1395dd">Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act</a> (EMTALA) requires all hospitals that accept Medicare funds — which is nearly all hospitals — to provide “such treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical condition” of “any individual” who arrives at the hospital’s ER with an “emergency medical condition.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">EMTALA, moreover, defines an “emergency medical condition” to include not just conditions that threaten a patient’s life, but also conditions that risk “serious impairment to bodily functions,” or “serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part,” among other things. Thus, if a patient’s uterus would be destroyed if they do not receive an abortion, EMTALA generally requires hospitals to provide that abortion even if the patient is likely to survive without it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This federal law conflicts with an Idaho statute, which bans all abortions except when “<a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/title18/t18ch6/sect18-622/#:~:text=Search%20Idaho%20Statutes&amp;text=18%2D622.,the%20crime%20of%20criminal%20abortion.">necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When a federal law conflicts with a state law, the Constitution provides that the federal law “<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/supremacy_clause">shall be the supreme Law of the Land</a>” — and thus the state law is “preempted.” EMTALA also contains a provision stating that state and local laws must give way “<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1395dd">to the extent that the [state law] directly conflicts with a requirement of this section</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So this should be an easy case. EMTALA imposes a broad requirement on nearly all hospitals to provide emergency care, and it does not include an exception for abortions. The statute, moreover, explicitly says that state laws must give way when they directly conflict with EMTALA.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But, in this Court, nothing involving abortion can ever be easy.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How <em>Moyle</em> seems to have divided the justices</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Court’s three Democratic appointees, Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson, all argue in two separate leaked opinions that EMTALA means what it actually says — though they appear to have split on a procedural question.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ordinarily, the Supreme Court waits until at least one appeals court has weighed in on a case before taking it up. In <em>Moyle</em>, however, the Court invoked an unusual process known as “certiorari before judgment” to bypass the appeals court that was supposed to hear this case. Kagan, joined by Sotomayor, argues that the case should be sent back to the appeals court that should have heard <em>Moyle</em> in the first place.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jackson, meanwhile, argues that the Court should rule immediately that EMTALA means what it says. As she writes in the documents Bloomberg published, doctors “observing the different legal thresholds for action under state and federal law” will “surely be cowed into not providing abortion” that is required by federal law — especially because of the risk that they could be prosecuted under state law. A decision by the Supreme Court holding that EMTALA trumps state law would allow doctors to perform medically necessary abortions with certainty.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the Court’s rightward extreme, Alito, in a leaked opinion joined in whole by Justice Clarence Thomas and in part by Justice Neil Gorsuch, argues for an abortion exception to the EMTALA statute. Alito primarily points to several provisions of the law which use the phrase “unborn child” (these provisions primarily require hospitals to offer stabilizing care to a pregnant patient’s fetus), suggesting that a statute which uses that phrase must not be read to permit abortions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Alito also makes a <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2024/4/9/24112845/supreme-court-abortion-emtala-moyle-united-states-idaho-life-health">novel constitutional argument</a>, claiming that the state of Idaho must consent before its abortion ban can be preempted by EMTALA.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That leaves Justice Amy Coney Barrett, writing for herself, Chief Justice John Roberts, and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, in the middle.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Barrett’s opinion, as it’s published in the Bloomberg leak, leaves nearly every important question raised by <em>Moyle</em> unresolved. She agrees with Kagan that the case should be sent back down to the lower court, thus creating a majority for that result. And she writes that Alito’s constitutional argument is “difficult and consequential” without taking a position on that argument.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The thrust of Barrett’s opinion is that there is no longer a need to bypass the appeals court and decide this case on an expedited basis because of concessions made by lawyers on both sides. The Biden administration, which argues for EMTALA to be read according to its plain text, conceded that EMTALA could not be used to authorize abortions because a patient has a mental health condition. And it also conceded that federal laws permitting hospitals or doctors with moral objections to abortion to opt out of providing them still apply even under EMTALA.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Idaho’s lawyers, meanwhile, claimed that its state law permits abortions for some medical conditions “even if the threat to the woman’s life is not imminent.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to Barrett, the “parties’ positions are still evolving” in this case, and thus it makes sense for those positions to be refined in a lower court before the Supreme Court has the final word.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So the good news for abortion rights supporters is that emergency room patients in Idaho will have the full benefit of EMTALA, at least while this case is working its way through the appeals court and back up to the justices. The bad news is that the leaked <em>Moyle</em> decision does nothing to help those same patients in the other 49 states.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And that’s a serious problem for abortion rights generally. As Jackson notes in her opinion, one problem that’s emerged since <em>Dobbs</em> is that, while even the most anti-abortion states typically permit abortions in some cases — such as if the life or health of a patient is threatened — there are often <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/12/12/23998301/kate-cox-texas-supreme-court-abortion-ken-paxton">no court precedents</a> explaining when abortions are allowed and when they are not. That means that doctors cannot know, and their lawyers cannot advise them, on when it is legal to perform a medically necessary abortion.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And that has created a reality where those exceptions are “exceptionally difficult — in some states, nigh impossible — to qualify for,” <a href="https://www.vox.com/explainers/356314/abortion-laws-roe-wade-dobbs-decision-mifepristone-supreme-court">as my colleague Nicole Narea reported</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">Kate Cox, a Texas woman, was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/06/politics/kate-cox-texas-abortion/index.html">notably denied</a> an abortion even though her fetus was diagnosed with a rare and terminal genetic condition and forced to travel out of state to obtain one. Other women have been <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/02/health/florida-abortion-term-pregnancy/index.html">forced to carry to term</a> fetuses doctors know will die shortly upon birth, or been <a href="https://link.vox.com/click/35616768.71438/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9wdWJsaWMtaGVhbHRoLzIwMjQvMDYvMDQvaG93LWEtY291cGxlLWZvdW5kLXRoZW1zZWx2ZXMtdGFuZ2xlZC1pbi10ZXhhcy1zdHJpY3QtYWJvcnRpb24tbGF3cy1hZnRlci1taXNjYXJyaWFnZS8_dWVpZD03MmRmM2EwM2IzMzFmNDQyZDllZjQ2M2VhMGVhYzE2OQ/60917b99ac7e007ef63c6b67Bd5b18d70">denied abortion care even after experiencing a miscarriage</a> that leaves them in medical distress. The Texas Supreme Court also ruled against a group of 20 women who claimed that they had been <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/05/31/texas-supreme-court-zurawski-abortion/#:~:text=The%20court%20ruled%20against%2020,the%20law%20were%20broad%20enough.">denied medically necessary abortions</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <em>Moyle</em> lawsuit was an effort to solve this problem by allowing federal courts to develop precedents stating when EMTALA creates a right to an abortion. But that process cannot begin until the courts agree that EMTALA means what it says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thus, if the leaked <em>Moyle</em> decision proves to be authentic, that means it may be months or even years before the federal courts can start generating the precedents that hospital lawyers need to advise their clients — and that’s assuming that Alito doesn’t ultimately have the votes to write an abortion exception into EMTALA.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When a fan asked Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/4/24166297/nvidia-jensen-huang-computex-signing">sign her chest</a> earlier this month, that might have been a sign that the hype around the chipmaker may have reached unsustainable heights.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the past few years, Nvidia’s computer chips — which have some technical capabilities that make them well suited to AI applications — catapulted the company to new echelons of profitability. Last week, Nvidia briefly became the world’s most valuable company; three days later, it lost that title amid a days-long sell-off of its shares. While its stock price has since recovered somewhat, it’s now the world’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/25/tech/nvidia-stock-fall-worlds-third-biggest-company/index.html">third most valuable</a> company with a market capitalization of <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/nvda">$3.1 trillion</a>, after Microsoft and Apple. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The sell-off came amid concern that Nvidia is overvalued. Recently, financial research strategist Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank warned of “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/25/tech/nvidia-stock-fall-worlds-third-biggest-company/index.html">signs of over-exuberance</a>” about Nvidia, and Nvidia executives have <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/as-nvidia-executives-sell-stock-heres-what-investors-need-to-know-58761d64#:~:text=Chief%20Executive%20Jensen%20Huang%20and,shares%20NVDA%2C%20%2D1.64%25%20.">even sold off</a> some of their holdings in the company.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are still many reasons to be excited about Nvidia: The company has established itself as an industry-leading chipmaker, reaping the benefits of an early bet on AI that has paid off as chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT have brought broader public attention to the technology. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It&#8217;s very early in the AI race,” said Daniel Newman, CEO of the Futurum Group, a tech research and analysis firm. “But everyone who has been building AI up to this point probably has done at least some of their most important work on Nvidia.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The stock market has responded accordingly. Nvidia is part of the so-called “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/wall-street-stocks-magnificent-seven-a6e1da1a8c85c0a56f9e9c85e001ebff">Magnificent Seven</a>” tech stocks that accounted for a majority of stock market growth last year. Its stock price had risen <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/nvda">nearly 155 percent</a> since January as of the market closing on Wednesday.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But whether Nvidia can continue to replicate that kind of growth depends on advancements in AI, as well as to what extent — and how quickly — businesses will adopt it. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">How Nvidia became one of the world’s most important chipmakers</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nvidia has long been considered the premier producer of graphics cards for gaming. However, its graphics processing units (GPUs), the main component of graphics cards, gained popularity amid a rise in cryptocurrency mining, a process that involves solving complex mathematical problems to release new cryptocurrency coins into circulation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s because Nvidia GPUs are highly optimized for what’s called “parallel processing” — basically, dividing up a computationally difficult problem and assigning the various parts to thousands of processor cores on the GPU at once, solving the problem more quickly and efficiently than traditional computing methods.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As it turns out, generative AI also relies on parallel processing. Whenever you query ChatGPT, for example, the AI model has to parse big data sets — the sum total of the world’s text-based online content as of ChatGPT’s last knowledge update — to answer you. To do so in real time and on the scale that companies like OpenAI hope to build out requires parallel processing performed at data centers that house thousands of GPUs. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nvidia realized what it stood to gain from the GPU needs of generative AI early on. Huang has referred to 2018 as a “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/nvidia-ceo-we-bet-the-farm-on-ai-and-no-one-knew-it/">bet the company moment</a>” in which Nvidia reimagined the GPU for AI, well before ChatGPT came on the scene. The company structured its research and development and mergers and acquisitions strategies to benefit from a coming AI boom.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“They were playing the game when nobody else was,” Newman said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition to offering GPUs optimized for that purpose, Nvidia created a programming model and parallel computing platform called the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) that has become the industry standard. This software has made the capabilities of Nvidia GPUs more accessible to developers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So even as Nvidia’s competitors like AMD and Intel have come to introduce similar offerings, even at lower price points, Nvidia has retained the lion’s share of the GPU market for businesses, in part because developers have gotten used to CUDA and don’t want to switch.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“What [Nvidia] understood very early on is if you want to win in hardware, you got to win in software,” Newman said. “A lot of the developers that are building apps for AI have built them and been comfortable building them using CUDA and running it on Nvidia hardware.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of that has positioned Nvidia to capitalize on the ever-growing needs of generative AI.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Can Nvidia keep the good times rolling?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nvidia’s competitors likely don’t pose any immediate threat to its status as an industry leader.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“In the long run, we expect tech titans to strive to find second sources or in-house solutions to diversify away from Nvidia in AI, but most likely, these efforts will chip away at, but not supplant, Nvidia’s AI dominance,” Brian Colello, a strategist for Morningstar, wrote in a recent report. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, Nvidia’s ability to sustain the level of growth it has seen in the last year is tied to the future of generative AI and to what extent it can be monetized.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Anyone can currently access ChatGPT for free, though a $20 monthly subscription fee will give you access to its latest and greatest version. But individual subscribers are not currently where the real money is. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rather, it’s with businesses. And at this point, it’s anyone’s guess how companies will integrate generative AI into their business models in the coming years.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Nvidia’s growth to be sustainable, major companies like Salesforce or Oracle — which sell software to enterprises — will have to offer new software that will “consume tons of AI” to the point that these large companies are signing annual contracts that give them access to the greatest amount of computing power, Newman said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Otherwise, that central thesis of standing up these massive megawatt data centers all over the world full of GPUs becomes a bit of a risk.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So should you buy Nvidia stock? It depends on how bullish you are about AI and its ability to penetrate the economy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We think Nvidia’s prospects will be tied to the AI market, for better or worse, for quite some time,” Collelo writes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On a 6-3 party-line vote, the Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that state officials may accept “gratuities” from people who wish to reward them for their official actions, despite a federal anti-corruption statute that appears to ban such rewards.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote the opinion in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-108_8n5a.pdf"><em>Snyder v. United States</em></a> for the Court’s Republican-appointed majority. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote the dissent on behalf of the Court’s three Democratic appointees.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Snyder</em> turns on a distinction between “bribes” and “gratuities.” As Kavanaugh writes, “bribes are payments made or agreed to <em>before</em> an official act in order to influence the official with respect to that future official act.” Gratuities, by contrast, “are typically payments made to an official <em>after</em> an official act as a token of appreciation.” (Emphasis added.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If that seems like a negligible difference, the facts of this case will probably only underscore that sentiment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The case involves James Snyder, a former mayor who accepted a $13,000 gratuity from a truck company after the city purchased five trash trucks from that company for $1.1 million. Snyder claims that the money was a consulting fee, but federal prosecutors nonetheless charged him with violating an anti-corruption statute.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That statute prohibits state officials from “corruptly” accepting “anything of value from any person, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-108_8n5a.pdf">intending to be influenced or rewarded</a>” for an official act.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Jackson writes in her dissent, the most natural reading of this statute is that it targets both bribes (payments that “influenced” a future decision) and gratuities (payments that “rewarded” a past decision). As Jackson writes,</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">Everyone knows what a reward is. It is a $20 bill pulled from a lost wallet at the time of its return to its grateful owner. A surprise ice cream outing after a report card with straight As. The bar tab picked up by a supervisor celebrating a job well done by her team. A reward often says “thank you” or “good job,” rather than “please.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jackson argues that the statute should be read to prohibit “rewards corruptly accepted by government officials in ways that are functionally indistinguishable from taking a bribe,” much like the payment at issue in this case appears to be.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kavanaugh’s majority opinion, meanwhile, relies heavily on policy arguments and other claims that go beyond the statute’s text. He does attempt to make a textual argument — Kavanaugh notes that the statute at issue in <em>Snyder</em>, like a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/201">different statute that only concerns bribes</a>, uses the word “corruptly” — but his best arguments are atextual.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kavanaugh’s strongest argument is that the law makes it a very serious crime, punishable by up to 15 years in prison, for a federal official to accept a bribe, but federal officials who accept gratuities only risk two years in prison. Meanwhile, the statute at issue in <em>Snyder</em>, which only applies to state officials, applies a 10-year sentence across the board. So Kavanaugh argues that it would be odd to read the law to draw a sharp distinction between bribes and gratuities given to federal officials but to make no distinction when state officials accept a gift.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In any event, the decision in <em>Snyder </em>is narrow. It does not rule that Congress could not ban gratuities. It simply rules that this particular statute only reaches bribes. That said, the Court’s Republican majority also has a long history of <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/558/310/">imposing constitutional limits</a> on the government’s ability to fight corruption and restrict money in politics.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also notable that neither Justice Clarence Thomas nor Justice Samuel Alito, both of whom have <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/samuel-alito-luxury-fishing-trip-paul-singer-scotus-supreme-court">accepted expensive gifts</a><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-harlan-crow-private-school-tuition-scotus"> </a><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-harlan-crow-private-school-tuition-scotus">from politically active Republican billionaires</a>, recused themselves from the case. Thomas and Alito both joined Kavanaugh’s opinion reading the anti-corruption statute narrowly.</p>

Missouri</em></a> was 6-3, with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett joining the Court’s three Democratic appointees in the majority. Justice Samuel Alito dissented, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Barrett’s majority opinion lays out, this lawsuit never should have been filed in the first place, and no federal court should have entertained it. Her opinion holds that the <em>Murthy </em>plaintiffs, who raised vague allegations that the government tried to censor them, could not even show that the government did anything to harm them in the first place.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Murthy</em> involves a wide range of communications among the White House, various federal agencies, and major social media platforms like Facebook and X (the website formerly known as Twitter). Some of these communications <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/9/22/23883888/supreme-court-social-media-first-amendment-netchoice-paxton-murthy-missouri-twitter-facebook">urged platforms to remove content</a>, such as speech seeking to recruit terrorists, to spread election disinformation, or to promote false and potentially harmful medical advice — including false claims about Covid-19 and vaccines.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The plaintiffs in <em>Murthy</em> are two red states plus an array of individuals who had content removed or suppressed by at least one of the social media platforms. They claimed that platforms censored them because of pressure from the government, and that this pressure violates the First Amendment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That is a highly dubious claim. While the First Amendment forbids the government from coercing media outlets into removing content, <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/9/22/23883888/supreme-court-social-media-first-amendment-netchoice-paxton-murthy-missouri-twitter-facebook">nothing prevents the government from <em>asking</em> a platform to do so</a>. Indeed, at oral arguments in <em>Murthy</em>, both Justices Elena Kagan and Kavanaugh recounted times when, during their service as White House officials, they pressured journalists to <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2024/3/18/24104880/supreme-court-brett-kavanaugh-murthy-missouri-vullo-nra-first-amendment-jawboning">remove or correct editorials or other content that contained factual errors</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/12/27/23496264/supreme-court-fifth-circuit-trump-court-immigration-housing-sexual-harrassment">far-right</a> US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit did not simply embrace this claim, it issued a vague and sweeping injunction forbidding the Biden administration from having “<a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/9/22/23883888/supreme-court-social-media-first-amendment-netchoice-paxton-murthy-missouri-twitter-facebook">consistent and consequential</a>” communications with social media companies — whatever that means. As a practical matter, this difficult-to-parse injunction made it virtually impossible for the administration to have any communications whatsoever with the platforms.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the Supreme Court held that the Fifth Circuit was wrong to even consider these plaintiffs’ dubious First Amendment arguments, ruling that federal courts lack jurisdiction over this case.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why the Supreme Court tossed this case out</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In order to file a federal lawsuit of any kind, a plaintiff must show that they’ve been injured in some way by the defendant — a requirement known as “<a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/6/17/22538462/supreme-court-obamacare-california-texas-stephen-breyer-standing-individual-mandate-constitution">standing</a>.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Barrett lays out in her opinion, this standing requirement has several components. Among other things, a plaintiff must show that the defendant’s actions actually caused their injury, and that the injury is “redressable” by a court order — meaning that the court could actually do something to fix the damage allegedly caused to the plaintiff.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Additionally, when a plaintiff seeks an injunction — a court order requiring the defendant to change their behavior in the future — it is not enough to show that the defendant harmed the plaintiff in the past. Rather, as Barrett writes, the plaintiff must show that it is “likely” the defendant will cause them the same harm in the future.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Notably, these plaintiffs sued the federal government, and not the platforms themselves, for the platforms’ decision to remove or demote some of the plaintiffs’ content. That decision, to target a defendant with only an attenuated connection to the alleged censorship, made the <em>Murthy </em>plaintiffs’ case even weaker.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, some of their claims that they were injured by the government were embarrassingly thin. One plaintiff, for example, claimed that Twitter suspended his brother’s account in response to pressure from the FBI. But even setting aside the lack of evidence that the FBI played a role in Twitter’s decision, a plaintiff does not have standing to sue if their brother was harmed — only the brother may file such a lawsuit.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-411_3dq3.pdf">did find some vague links</a> between Facebook’s decision to moderate content by one of the plaintiffs, an anti-mask and anti-vaccine mandate activist named Jill Hines, and the government’s actions. Facebook deleted one of Hines’s posts three months after a White House official suggested that the platform should “end group recommendations for groups with a history of COVID–19 or vaccine misinformation.” And Facebook warned Hines against reposting content from a particularly notorious anti-vaccine advocate, third-party 2024 presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., two years after the White House included Kennedy on a list of prolific spreaders of Covid misinformation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But, as Barrett writes, these links are weak: “Facebook was targeting [Hines’s] pages before almost all of its communications with the White House and the CDC, which weakens the inference that her subsequent restrictions are likely traceable to ‘government-coerced enforcement’ of Facebook’s policies.” And even if the links were stronger, Hines can’t show that she will face future injury because of the government’s actions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Among other things, Barrett notes that the Biden administration has largely halted its efforts to persuade social media platforms to remove Covid misinformation now that the acute phase of the pandemic has ended. So even if Hines could somehow show that some of her content was removed in the past due to government pressure, she has no reason to believe that it will be removed in the future due to similar pressure.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Fifth Circuit is a rogue court</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s notable that three Republican justices, including two Trump appointees, joined the <em>Murthy </em>majority. This is less a sign of those justices’ moderation than it is a response to an increasingly partisan Fifth Circuit.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Fifth Circuit, which is dominated by far-right judges, routinely <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/12/27/23496264/supreme-court-fifth-circuit-trump-court-immigration-housing-sexual-harrassment">hands down decisions that no reasonable judge could support</a> — and the Supreme Court spends an increasing amount of time correcting these decisions. Earlier this term, for example, the Supreme Court reversed the Fifth Circuit’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/24158216/supreme-court-cfpb-clarence-thomas-community-financial">declaration that an entire federal agency is unconstitutional</a>. It also reversed the Fifth Circuit’s holding that domestic abusers have a right to own guns (although, in fairness, the Fifth Circuit’s decision in that case was <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/356267/supreme-court-us-rahimi-domestic-abuse-guns-second-amendmen">more defensible</a> under the justices’ own incompetently drafted opinion in the 2022 case <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-843_7j80.pdf"><em>New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association v. Bruen</em></a>).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Fifth Circuit’s order in <em>Murthy</em> fits this pattern. That court took a bunch of vague allegations, involving decisions by private companies that had only a tenuous connection to anything done by a government official, and used those vague allegations to try to shut down the Biden administration’s ability to communicate with those companies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Barrett even faults the Fifth Circuit, and the right-wing trial judge who first heard this case, for misrepresenting many key facts. In her words, “the Fifth Circuit relied on the District Court’s factual findings, many of which unfortunately appear to be clearly erroneous.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the moment, at least, the Supreme Court appears to be holding the line against this uniquely partisan court -— but it is far from clear that this line will hold if Trump wins the 2024 election. <em>Murthy</em>, after all, was a 6-3 decision. So, if Trump gets to appoint two more justices, the Fifth Circuit’s values could soon be imposed on the entire nation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Inflation and the economy are still the biggest issues on many <a href="https://d3nkl3psvxxpe9.cloudfront.net/documents/econTabReport_0NJUiMQ.pdf">voters’</a> <a href="https://iop.harvard.edu/youth-poll/47th-edition-spring-2024#key-takeaway--id--1564">minds</a> heading into the 2024 election, even though inflation has come down from its dizzying height in June 2022, when prices were climbing at almost <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1pv2L">9 percent</a>. Last month, it was a much more manageable 3.3 percent.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it’s still not entirely clear what brought inflation down.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a recent episode of <a href="https://www.vox.com/unexplainable"><em>Unexplainable</em></a>, we looked at why this is still such a difficult mystery to crack.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the jury is out on the exact reasons, there are two basic theories that explain why inflation has abated in the last couple of years.</p>

<iframe frameBorder="0" height="200" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?p=VMP9331026707" width="100%"></iframe>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Theory 1: It was the Fed</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In mid-2022, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, and soon after that, inflation started falling. Case closed, the rate hike is what did it. Right?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The issue is that the normal way interest rates influence inflation is by raising unemployment. Interest rates go up, businesses struggle to hire more workers, and unemployment goes up. But in 2022, unemployment barely changed. Something else was going on.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead, economists like Adam Posen of the Peterson Institute for International Economics argue that inflation came down because of people’s expectations. As Posen explains, “If people are sure that the central bank or society somehow will get inflation down in the future, they don’t tend to react very much to movements in inflation today.” People don’t feel the need to ask for raises, and businesses stop raising prices. Essentially, it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Posen points to the fact that after the pandemic kickstarted the latest round of inflation, inflation didn’t fully spiral out of control. That’s because the Fed had built up trust with the American public over the years, convincing them that it would act when necessary. When the Fed finally raised interest rates in 2022, it essentially functioned as a reminder that it was in control, which calmed people’s anxieties about rising inflation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The most powerful evidence for this is that we had the set of common shocks across the major economies, across Europe, Japan, US, UK, Canada,” says Posen. “But in all of them, once the central banks are raising rates, it all just came back down.”</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Theory 2: It was the end of the pandemic</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Economist Claudia Sahm isn’t sold on the theory that expectations are the main thing that brought inflation down in 2022. “A key piece of this is the person on the other side has to be listening,” says Sahm. “Regular people are not listening to the Fed.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead, Sahm thinks the answer is a lot more concrete: “To me, the very obvious explanation is we are healing the supply problems that the pandemic caused.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sahm says that after the pandemic essentially shut down the economy, it took years for the supply chain to fully come back online. When that happened, there was more production, which meant more stuff for people to buy with their excess cash, which ultimately brought down inflation.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Why this is so hard to figure out</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Fed hiked interest rates around the same time that the supply chain got back up and running, which makes it hard to assign credit. But there’s an even more fundamental issue here. “Anything in macroeconomics is very hard to empirically test,” says Vox senior correspondent Dylan Matthews. “You can’t run experiments with the Fed.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, Matthews says that inflation — and our economy as a whole — is still so hard to understand because of the nature of money. “Money feels like this very hard thing, but money is also a psychological idea. Money is this idea that we can put numbers on what we owe to each other, even as we understand that these numbers are kind of made up.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Inflation, in a sense, is a psychological phenomenon. “So understanding inflation, I think, is ultimately about understanding people and how they relate to each other. And that’s the ultimate mystery.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It turns out seasonal affective disorder (SAD), <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20364651" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20364651">a form of depression</a> usually associated with the darker winter months, can take hold in the summer, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While its symptoms can be different from its winter counterpart — cold-weather SAD typically makes people lethargic, while summer SAD makes them more agitated — it’s also a condition triggered by seasonal changes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That makes it an issue of particular concern amid the surge of extreme heat in 2024 and the spikes of temperature yet to come. As hot as June has been in the US, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/06/21/july-temperature-outlook-us-heat-waves">temperatures are only expected to rise in the next few months</a>. These spikes underscore the effects of climate change and how rising temperatures worldwide are leading to hotter, longer, summers. That reality is likely to exacerbate summer SAD, and could make it more common.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The hot environment is only getting hotter,” <a href="https://www.normanrosenthal.com/about/">Norman Rosenthal</a>, the Georgetown University psychiatrist who first described SAD, told Vox. “So that is what&#8217;s going to make this more important than ever, as a factor to reckon with in terms of mental health.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fortunately, there are things you can do to mitigate the effects of summer SAD, which can include feeling down, less productive, and wanting to be left alone. It can also makes people feel overstimulated and, in some cases, increases the risk of suicide. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The key to fighting summer SAD is to understand its triggers, including the influx of heat and light that come during this part of the year. That means finding shade, cool areas, and more. Here’s what you need to know about summer SAD, and what to do to overcome it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What is summer SAD? And why does SAD happen in summer?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similar to winter SAD, summer SAD is prompted by unique seasonal developments.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Just as lack of light can affect people’s mood in winter, an overabundance of it, along with heat and humidity, can also affect people in the summertime.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/mental-health-experts-warn-against-prolonged-exposure-to-extreme-heat/3319215/">Researchers have found</a> that heat <a href="https://adaa.org/learn-from-us/from-the-experts/blog-posts/consumer-professional/heat-and-mental-health">can make people more fatigued, irritable, and aggressive</a>, and that excess light can do the same. Both of these variables can also interfere with people’s circadian rhythms and their sleep schedules, which can have mental health effects, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The heat depletes you, takes your energy away,” Rosenthal told Vox. “The light agitates you.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.uvm.edu/cas/psychology/profiles/kelly-rohan-clinical">Kelly Rohan</a>, a University of Vermont psychology professor who studies SAD, says there isn’t a lot known about why these attributes specifically trigger seasonal depression and that more work needs to be done on this front more generally. Because summer SAD is less common than winter SAD, it hasn’t yet been scrutinized to the same degree. About 10 percent of people who experience SAD do so in the summer, <a href="https://news.arizona.edu/news/beat-summertime-sadness-these-cool-tips">experts estimate</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rosenthal notes that people who experience summer SAD typically have a genetic predisposition toward depression that can be triggered by seasonal developments. Rohan adds that seasonal allergies could also play a role because they increase people’s discomfort in the summertime and cause inflammation, which is linked to <a href="https://news.arizona.edu/news/beat-summertime-sadness-these-cool-tips">depression as well</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although people who experience SAD in winter and summer share feelings of being withdrawn and gloomy, the other symptoms they have can be markedly different.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“In the summer, people feel agitated,” says Rosenthal. “And even though they&#8217;re depressed, they&#8217;ve got this excess internal energy.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The combination of energy and agitation is linked to a higher risk of suicide. People in summer may be more activated and inclined to take action, for instance, while people in the winter are less energized and inclined to pursue it.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="How summer and winter SAD often differ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/W1xUd/1/" frameborder="0" height="393"></iframe>!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r&lt;e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][t]+&quot;px&quot;;e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you suspect you might have summer SAD, the best thing to do is to speak with a doctor about the symptoms you’re experiencing. As one way to evaluate the pattern of symptoms, Rosenthal recommends that people think back through the last few years and try to recall if they had negative mood changes tied to the start of the season.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>How to combat summer SAD</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Again, it’s important to note that seeing a medical professional is vital to address mental health concerns — and that this guidance is not a substitute for that.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of the recommendations that experts have suggested, however, are possible ways to curb certain symptoms of SAD.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Cool down</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cooling the body down using tools like air conditioning and 15-minute cold showers is one way to ameliorate the negative effects of heat.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1176/ajp.144.12.1602">In one 1987 study</a>, Rohan notes, one patient took multiple cold showers a day while also staying in an air-conditioned home. That approach helped improve their mood considerably, but it was tough to maintain when they went outdoors and were exposed to heat shortly after the study.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If options like that are inaccessible, other ideas for cooling down include visiting public spaces like libraries and museums, and bodies of water like rivers and lakes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Shady areas, under trees and umbrellas, can be helpful, too.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Reduce light</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cutting down on light exposure using devices like blackout curtains can also help.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Reducing light in a room can be calming, says Rosenthal, allowing people to wind down a bit if they’re feeling agitated. “If you're understanding that the temperature is a problem, that the light is a problem, you can adjust your environments to minimize these irritations,” he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/blackout-curtains-sleep-health-benefits">Researchers have found that the use of items like blackout curtains</a> can help improve sleep quality, too, ensuring that people feel better rested and less anxious. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Establish a routine&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Feelings of anxiousness and agitation can be related to how disruptive extreme heat can be to a person’s typical routine including sleep, exercise, and other regular activities.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Setting up a consistent daily routine can help maintain a sense of stability and structure <a href="https://news.arizona.edu/news/beat-summertime-sadness-these-cool-tips">despite these disruptions</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Talk to a doctor&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Experts emphasize that treatments that are used for depression more broadly — including antidepressant medication and cognitive behavioral therapy — also apply to SAD and can be used to address it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“All antidepressants currently in use for general depression can be used for summer depression as well,” Rosenthal writes in his 2023 book, <em>Defeating SAD.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rohan echoed this point. She cautioned, however, that some <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heat-health/hcp/heat-and-medications-guidance-for-clinicians.html">antidepressants could interfere with the body’s ability</a> to regulate temperature, and that it’s important to be aware of that when pursuing this route.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Reality TV is experiencing some growing pains. During last year’s WGA and SAG strikes, former <em>Real Housewives of New York City</em> star <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2023/9/11/23864621/bethenny-frankel-real-housewife-reality-tv-union-bravo">Bethenny Frankel</a> ignited an industry conversation about the lack of protections and fair pay for reality performers. Since then, Bravo and its network spokesperson Andy Cohen have been hit with a stream of lawsuits alleging discrimination and sexual harassment. At the same time, Netflix has seen its fair share of alarming complaints around its <em>Love Is Blind</em> franchise. One of the latest reports of misconduct came from <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/05/27/is-love-is-blind-a-toxic-workplace">New Yorker television critic Emily Nussbaum</a>, who spoke with former cast members about the dating competition’s allegedly toxic workplace and manipulative production tactics.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, Nussbaum isn’t really concerned with opining about these issues — or finding a solution to them — in her new book, <em>Cue The Sun! The Invention of Reality TV</em>. When I asked her whether she felt reality shows could be made with a moral conscience, she answered bluntly, “I’m not in the industry, so my answer is, I don’t care.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She followed up by saying that she feels reality stars are “very unprotected” and deserve fair compensation. But unlike her Pulitzer Prize-winning book about scripted TV, <em>I Like To Watch</em>, her latest book is decidedly not a work of criticism. Rather, she set out to explore the idea of “reality as craft.” While the genre is more popular than ever, what goes into the process of developing shows, finding talent, and creating new cinematic techniques is generally taken for granted. With <em>Cue The Sun!</em>, she credits the genre with the same level of creativity we normally ascribe to filmmaking and writing music.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/CUE-THE-SUN-Cover-Art.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,31.337438217073,100,34.640160724315" alt="The cover of Emily Nussbaum&#039;s latest book &quot;Cue The Sun!: The Invention of Reality TV.&quot;" title="The cover of Emily Nussbaum&#039;s latest book &quot;Cue The Sun!: The Invention of Reality TV.&quot;" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Emily Nussbaum’s &lt;em&gt;Cue The Sun!: The Invention of Reality TV&lt;/em&gt;, came out on June 25, 2024." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">“The goal with this book was not to say ‘thumbs up’ or ‘thumbs down’ on reality TV,” Nussbaum says. “It was to try to tell it through the voices of the people on both sides of the camera. It&#8217;s the story of a lot of experiments. It&#8217;s about people inventing jobs that didn&#8217;t exist.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In that regard, <em>Cue The Sun!</em> is a required text for anyone who wants to understand how reality TV — or as Nussbaum calls it, “dirty documentary” — arrived at its current tipping point. The almost 400-page book includes interviews with former reality television participants, producers, editors, and assistants. It’s a riveting chronicle of the low-budget, “guilty pleasure” genre, beginning in the 1940s and concluding in the early 2000s with the truly culture-shifting program, <em>The Apprentice</em>. What <em>Cue The Sun!</em> ultimately exposes is the paradoxical and queasy nature of reality TV, a boundary-pushing artform that often relies on a lot of depravity to keep the wheels turning.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The most riveting chapter in Nussbaum’s book focuses on the lore of the long-running CBS hit <em>Survivor</em>, starting with its odd beginnings as a Scottish radio experiment. This inspired the controversial Swedish television show <em>Expedition: Robinson</em>, which premiered in 1997 and raised serious ethical questions after the series’ first eliminated contestant committed suicide. Undeterred by this incident, producer Mark Burnett brought the series to America in 2000 in the form of <em>Survivor</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I wasn’t that interested in <em>Survivor </em>when I started the book,” says Nussbaum. “But by the time I finished writing about it, I was convinced that the<em> Survivor</em> format was an invention on the level of the telephone or the car.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It was a few years after the arrival of <em>Survivor</em> that Nussbaum felt inspired to write a book. In 2003, she could feel reality TV becoming its own sort of movement, like the New Hollywood era.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I discovered reality TV had roots all the way back to World War II on radio,” she says. “There was already a burst of programming featuring regular people and the moral outrage that always accompanied it.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those programs included the radio show <em>Candid Microphone, </em>which premiered in 1947, and its televised equivalent <em>Candid Camera</em>, which aired the following year. Both series were created and hosted by pioneering prankster Allen Funt. His elaborate tricks on his oblivious subjects using hidden cameras precedes the work of “reality auteurs” like Nathan Fielder and Sacha Baron Cohen.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While modern docu-comedies like <em>The Rehearsal</em> and <em>Jury Duty</em> have been described as experimental “prestige” takes on the unscripted genre, Nussbaum presents these types of shows as the purest form of reality TV, a style that prevailed before audiences’ demands for salaciousness and melodrama made it a lot more complicated.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She draws similar parallels between the ’60s game show <em>Queen For A Day</em> and 1970s PBS docuseries <em>An American Family</em> with modern programs like <em>Real Housewives</em> and <em>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</em>. Both shows gave TV its first taste of melodramatic, slice-of-life reality programs. On <em>Queen For A Day</em>, women would essentially compete for who had the worst life in order to win prizes, like household appliances. The image of host Jack Bailey surrounded by a group of women trading in — and oftentimes, exaggerating —&nbsp; their personal woes for the audience’s sympathy feels reminiscent of a <em>Real Housewives </em>reunion.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nussbaum writes that the producer interference that goes into creating these unscripted soap operas can be directly traced to PBS’s <em>An American Family,</em><em> </em>which followed the upper-middle-class Loud family. On paper, the California suburbanites represented the American dream, until the show revealed some cracks in their family portrait, culminating in the divorce of the central couple, Bill and Pat Loud. What was originally designed as an elevated, experimental documentary by filmmakers Alan and Susan Raymond quickly became tainted by creator Craig Gilbert, who interfered with the show’s subjects and edited footage to make interactions appear much more salacious than they actually were.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nussbaum analyzes the subsequent years of TV when documentaries became “dirtied,” as reality shows proved to be inexpensive and easy to make. In several cases, they’ve served as <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2023-04-10/writers-strike-reality-tv-unions#:~:text=In%20past%20strikes%2C%20networks%20turned,the%20workers%20are%20speaking%20out.">ratings generators in times of network crises</a>. By the time the ’90s rolled around, Nussbaum’s definition of reality TV — “cinema verité filmmaking that has been cut with commercial contaminants, like a street drug, in order to slash the price and intensify the effect” — is extremely accurate. The “street-drug” quality is especially apparent in a chapter about late ’90s Fox, which broadcasted fake journalism shows like <em><a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/fox-1995-alien-autopsy-hoax">Alien Autopsy</a></em> and lazily packaged clip shows, most famously <em>Cops</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When it comes to the manipulation of reality subjects for an “intensified” effect, though, <em>The Bachelor</em> franchise reigns supreme. Since its premiere in 2002, the competition show has become infamous for its devious production tactics. “I could sort of trace the moment that shows started using tools to create more contrived, more extreme distortions of what had happened on camera,” Nussbaum says. “A lot of that had to do with [the newly available] technology,” she says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of those techniques was the “Frankenbite,” which involved deconstructing a quote and stitching it back together to form a new, unsaid soundbite. The book’s chapter on <em>The Bachelor</em> also explores the still-common practice of recording participants without their knowledge — otherwise known as the “hot mic” — taking quotes out of context, and pressuring people into providing usable quotes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the book, season one contestant Rhonda Rittenhouse recalls being badgered to the point of tears by producers about her reasoning for coming on the show. After multiple rounds of questioning, she finally said, “I’m not here to make friends, I’m here to meet Alex [Michel].”&nbsp; The question of whether a contestant was “there for the right reasons” ultimately became a motto for the franchise, as well as later dating competitions, like <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2024/3/7/24093858/love-is-blind-season-6-jeramey-trevor-drama-explained-clay-gravesande"><em>Love Is Blind</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One striking part of that chapter is an interview with Ben Hatta, the former assistant of <em>The Bachelor</em>’s creator Mike Fleiss. While his former co-worker, producer Sarah Shapiro, would go on to create the Lifetime series <em>UnREAL</em> based on <em>The Bachelor</em>’s corrupt practices, Hatta told Nussbaum that he wasn’t interested in reality reform. In fact, he viewed it as “inseparable from — and, in fact, defined by bad working conditions.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“He was basically like, ‘I don’t want it to change because the entire genre would disappear,’” Nussbuam says. “I don’t think that’s crazy. Because the truth is, the shows are greenlighted&nbsp;because they are profitable. And the reason they’re profitable is because the people who make them, on both sides of the camera, make nothing.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, we can see the effects of being on reality TV shows in the way many of its stars narrativize and gamify their own lives to the point of complete inauthenticity. Arguably, its most harmful effect is the way the people making these shows have come to accept a twisted moral code in order to produce the best product.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“People really bond over doing things in production that would make much of the outside world’s jaw drop because it’s so insidious, manipulative, and unethical,” says Nussbaum. “But the truth is, if you’re working hard with a team of people who encourage you to do those things, I think it’s easy to start seeing them as normal.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While network executives and producers continue to fight for the status quo, former and current reality stars are boldly speaking out about what should and should not be tolerated at work. A unified code of conduct, let alone a union specifically for reality stars, has yet to be established. For now, though, fans can at least appreciate that reality TV is being taken seriously as an art form, most recently in Nussbaum’s work.&nbsp; Whether that change in perception will result in a better workplace is yet to be seen.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“That pearl-clutching, finger-pointing, outrage, can’t-look-away quality is embedded in reality TV,” Nussbaum says. “It’s what drives it and is often what makes it popular.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One strange thing about the American <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/policy-basics-unemployment-insurance">unemployment insurance</a> (UI) system — which provides weekly payments to jobless people who meet certain criteria — is that it’s not insurance against being unemployed. More accurately, it’s insurance against losing a job “through no fault of your own,” which makes UI more like “getting laid off insurance.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Aside from <a href="https://www.nelp.org/insights-research/good-cause-quits/">a few exceptions</a> in some states for things like escaping domestic violence or hostile workplaces, voluntarily leaving your job disqualifies you from receiving unemployment benefits. Allowing people who quit to receive those payments would be “contrary to one of the fundamental tenets of the UI program. The idea is that we want to incentivize people to work,” said Doug Holmes, president of <a href="https://www.uwcstrategy.org/">Strategic Services on Unemployment &amp; Workers’ Compensation</a> (UWC), an association that has represented the interests of businesses in matters of UI reform since 1933.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So the point of the American UI system is not to make it easier to quit a job. But a few economists are now beginning to ask: Should it be?</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why I reported this story</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">A few weeks ago, I was reporting a broader story on the status of unemployment reform now that the dust is settling from <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/3/24/21188470/coronavirus-unemployment-benefits-senate-stimulus">the pandemic’s temporary UI boosts</a>. Buried in my list of questions was one that I worried was a little naive. Sheepishly at first, I began asking experts: How ridiculous would it be, really, to extend unemployment benefits to people who quit? Turns out, there&#8217;s a pretty serious (and growing) case to be made.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A safety net program that would encourage more Americans to quit their jobs has <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23965898/child-poverty-expanded-child-tax-credit-economy-welfare-phase-ins">generally been seen as a bad thing</a>. Quitting takes someone out of the labor market, sapping energy away from the economy. Giving quitters unemployment benefits is like paying them to stay out, bankrolled by taxes that fall on businesses. The result can look a little strange: Businesses could effectively be paying people not to work.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But that story assumes that people who quit stay unemployed. A different story is starting to rack up empirical evidence: Boosting UI generosity <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20160613">doesn’t affect overall employment rates</a> one way or the other. Instead of loafing around in subsidized unemployment, more generous benefits can support people to quit their jobs <a href="https://www.economicpossibility.org/insights/stockton-basic-income-employment">in search of better ones</a>, which benefits workers through higher wages and better job satisfaction, and the economy through enhanced productivity as people find better uses for their skills.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Put simply, more quitting can be good for the economy. If UI made it easier for more workers to quit their jobs, people would still look for work and the economy could be better off overall. The real losers would be lousy jobs, which would struggle to retain workers with a greater cushion to quit and go looking elsewhere.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Even if one still believes in the core logic of a free market, inadequate unemployment insurance can break it</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It&#8217;s pretty novel,” <a href="https://tcf.org/experts/michele-evermore/">Michele Evermore</a>, the former deputy director for policy in the Department of Labor’s Office of Unemployment Insurance Modernization, said about the idea. “There is a really solid old guard that protects the system as is, but it’s starting to feel like a crumbling retaining wall in some ways at this point.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Late last year, the question of whether UI should cover quits finally made its way into the bastion of American unemployment research. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis <a href="https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/the-great-resignation-and-optimal-unemployment-insurance">published one of the first papers</a> to test how extending UI benefits to people who quit would impact the American economy. On squarely economic grounds, <a href="https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2024/should-you-get-unemployment-insurance-if-you-quit-your-job#_ftnref5">they concluded</a> that “giving nothing to quitters is unlikely to be the optimal policy.” That is, their model predicts that giving benefits to people who choose to leave their jobs would grow the economy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Extending UI to people who quit has hardly been discussed in the 89 years since the program was launched during the Great Depression. There’s now a growing consensus that America’s UI system has been <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2021/01/unemployment-insurance-and-the-failure-to-reform.html">broken</a> for decades, <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/economy/unemployment-insurance-system-unprepared-for-another-recession">cannot handle</a> another recession, and is in urgent need of a <a href="https://research.upjohn.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1029&amp;context=up_policypapers">major overhaul</a>. There’s even something of a consensus around <a href="https://uiworkerbenefit.niskanencenter.org/">what needs fixing</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A major barrier facing lasting reform has been that most people do not care about improving the unemployment system long enough to build the kind of political momentum that gets laws through Congress. Even during major economic downturns, it’s rare to see unemployment rise above 10 percent. If UI were to become a true safety net for all unemployment, covering any American who wants to quit their job rather than mostly people who get laid off, the political base of potential beneficiaries would balloon from a transient and difficult-to-engage minority to, well, how many people in the US do you think are <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/03/30/how-americans-view-their-jobs/">unhappily</a> employed? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Among the <a href="https://jainfamilyinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/reweaving-the-safety-net-12.15.20.pdf">many frayed threads</a> that make up America’s safety net, unemployment insurance is one of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2022/12/6/23495045/unemployment-insurance-jobs-report-recession-layoffs-fed">most neglected</a>. Reconsidering the airtight conventional wisdom around excluding quitters could turn the program into an engine that nudges the entire economy toward higher wages, better jobs, and the kinds of freedom that capitalism is supposed to create. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Capitalism runs on the freedom to quit — in theory</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Scottish philosopher Adam Smith’s 1776 book, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3300/3300-h/3300-h"><em>The Wealth of Nations</em></a>, Father Economics himself describes a society “where there was perfect liberty” as one “where every man [sic] was perfectly free both to choose what occupation he thought proper, and to change it as often as he thought proper.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nearly 250 years later, millions of Americans are still a ways off from that kind of liberty. Without financial support, quitting in search of better work just isn’t always a viable option, especially for the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/2023/12/04/wealth-gaps-within-racial-and-ethnic-groups/#:~:text=2019%20to%202021.-,Households%20with%20no%20wealth%20or%20in%20debt,households%20were%20in%20this%20position.">more than one in 10</a> US households that have zero wealth to fall back on. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the idea is still baked deep into the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12142-008-0105-z">justifying logic of market economies</a>. If people don’t like something, they’re free to choose otherwise. Capitalism, in the words of economist Milton Friedman and his wife Rose, is the “<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Free_To_Choose/F5z1B5SwGUEC?hl=en">freedom to choose</a>.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This was the beauty of capitalism, particularly as seminal economists like Friedrich Hayek saw it. Without a central planner dictating prices or doling out jobs, markets process information produced by the huge variety of voluntary transactions made across the entire economy. Whether you’re buying a carton of organic eggs for $8, accepting a new job, or quitting a crummy one, you’re sending a signal to the market about your preferences. Markets, in Hayek’s view, aggregate these signals across a huge diversity of contexts and coordinate them into a sort of “<a href="https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/1992/hayeks-legacy-of-the-spontaneous-order">spontaneous order</a>” that efficiently organizes the economy. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In theory, working a job and buying that carton of eggs are both voluntary transactions. If you don’t like your job, you’re as free to find another as you are to choose a different, cheaper carton of eggs. In practice, especially for lower-wage workers who face relentless economic pressure and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/355735/why-americans-hate-inflation-and-its-cure">lots of debt</a>, adding a job search on top of full-time work just isn’t feasible.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a result, people trapped in jobs aren’t able to send signals to the labor market that their work sucks and leaves them too drained to find something better. Let this kind of labor market evolve over the course of decades or centuries and you can wind up with an economy full of jobs that make <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2023/05/the-age-of-the-crisis-of-work-quiet-quitting-great-resignation/">too many people miserable</a>. Without enough freedom to quit, the core logic aligning labor markets with people’s preferences is flying partially blind.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Even if your sole focus is economic efficiency, the economy is much better off when people who quit receive unemployment benefits, too</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One way to see the problem is by adopting an idea developed by the economist Albert Hirschman in his 1970 book, <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674276604"><em>Exit, Voice, and Loyalty</em></a><em>. </em>He describes “exit” — literally leaving a situation — as the default mode of expressing dissatisfaction in modern economics. His framework didn’t focus on labor markets but has since been used to <a href="https://prospect.org/economy/exit-voice-and-choice-in-the-pandemic/">do just that</a>, scrutinizing how the practical realities of unemployment insurance are <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1269068">out of sync with the theoretical assumptions</a> that workers have reasonable freedom and support to exit bad jobs. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To put this all a bit more bluntly, even if one still believes in the <a href="https://casi.stanford.edu/news/exposing-big-free-market-myth-author-naomi-oreskes">core logic of a free market</a>, inadequate unemployment insurance can break it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hirschman noted that even though exit is central to the smooth functioning of a market economy, Americans have a curious tendency to sometimes just ignore it altogether. The labor market is one such situation. The virtue of work — any work — <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area/24034358/gray-area-work-labor-miserable-protestant-ethic">has been held so high</a> that the real freedom to exit lousy work has been ignored, despite that being one of the central mechanisms by which labor markets would adapt to offer better jobs.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Unemployment research has always assumed that quitting is bad for the economy. Now, that idea is under review.</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The unemployment insurance system was established during the Great Depression as part of the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/history/35act.html">Social Security Act</a> in 1935, when the unemployment rate was about <a href="https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LFU21000100&amp;series_id=LFU22000100&amp;from_year=1929&amp;to_year=1939&amp;periods_option=specific_periods&amp;periods=Annual+Data">20 percent</a>; helping those workers who still had jobs quit wasn’t exactly a policy priority. About half of American workers were <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v70n4/v70n4p49.html#:~:text=The%20Social%20Security%20Act%20of,of%20whom%20were%20African%20Americans.">excluded from coverage</a>, including agricultural and domestic workers (many of whom were Black). </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the share of American workers covered by UI has shot up above <a href="https://www.bls.gov/wrp/overview.htm#:~:text=Approximately%2096%20percent%20of%20the,covered%20by%20State%20UI%20laws.">90 percent</a> (though that figure <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/forum/unemployment-insurance-for-the-gig-economy">doesn’t count</a> the self-employed or gig economy workers), the actual share of unemployed people who receive benefits has been <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/what-share-of-the-unemployed-receive-unemployment-insurance-context-trends-and-influences/#:~:text=In%20the%201950s%2C%20the%20nationwide,differs%20considerably%20across%20the%20country.">steadily declining</a>. Being “covered” only means that you’ll get UI benefits if you meet the additional eligibility criteria. A covered worker who quits their job almost always loses their right to benefits.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2022, <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2023/most-unemployed-people-in-2022-did-not-apply-for-unemployment-insurance-benefits.htm">more than half</a> of all unemployed people didn’t apply for benefits because they didn’t think they were eligible, while the share of the unemployed who wind up receiving benefits continues trending downward.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Most unemployed Americans do not receive UI benefits" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ROlbI/1/" frameborder="0" height="558"></iframe>!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r&lt;e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][t]+&quot;px&quot;;e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although UI has gradually expanded, continuing to exclude people who quit without “<a href="https://www.nelp.org/insights-research/good-cause-quits/">good cause</a>” has remained a bipartisan consensus. It guards against what economists call “<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w13967">moral hazard</a>,” or the idea that more generous UI benefits make recipients less interested in getting a job, subsidizing what economists would call “unproductive leisure.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0304407685900685?via%3Dihub">papers</a> through the ’80s and ’90s <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w2546">found</a> that, for example, <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/9751256/Chetty_MoralHazard.pdf">increasing UI benefits</a> by 10 percent can extend unemployment spells by as much as nearly 9 percent. And this was evidence of a problem: If a government program induces people to quit and stay unemployed for longer than otherwise, it isn’t working. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That belief held for decades. Then, in 1999, economists Daron Acemoglu and Robert Shimer made the case that sometimes a UI program that leads to more quitting and longer unemployment is actually a good thing. In a paper titled “<a href="https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/efficient-unemployment-insurance.pdf">Efficient Unemployment Insurance</a>,” they argued that by reducing the risk of job searching, UI fuels economic growth by improving the job matching quality between workers and employers. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By reducing risks, UI allows workers to look for better jobs, which sends stronger signals to the market about the kinds of jobs workers want. In turn, companies begin investing in more productive jobs with higher wages, challenging the conventional wisdom about UI and economic dynamism. In the years since, further research has bolstered the idea, finding that longer unemployment spells <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w13967">raise overall economic welfare</a> and more generous UI programs <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20150528">can lead to higher-wage</a>, higher-quality jobs. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These papers challenged the idea that a UI program leading to more quits or longer unemployment spells is necessarily bad for the economy but they didn’t question the consensus on excluding quits from coverage. That went relatively unchallenged until late last year.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">So should Americans who quit get unemployment insurance?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If more generous UI really can play a role in boosting economic growth — and covering people who quit is a form of increasing the program’s generosity — it’s entirely unclear how much UI is optimal. If inadequate UI breaks the logic of free markets, how much is adequate? Since the question has never been taken seriously in the US, there’s been little by way of actual research. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That changed late last year. The surge of quits during the pandemic and the expansion of unemployment insurance created a unique dataset that caught the attention of economists Zhifeng Cai and Jonathan Heathcote. <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28470/w28470.pdf">Evidence</a> from the temporary UI boosts challenged the conventional wisdom around moral hazard. After an extra $600 was added to weekly UI checks, along with a major <a href="https://s27147.pcdn.co/app/uploads/2020/04/For-Workers-Fact-Sheet-UI-Provisions-CARES-Act-1.pdf">expansion</a> to who is eligible for the benefits, studies <a href="https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/voices.uchicago.edu/dist/1/801/files/2018/08/disincentive_effects_of_expanded_ui.pdf">found</a> <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w30315">no</a> <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28470/w28470.pdf">connection</a> between the boosted UI and laziness or joblessness (echoing <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w24337">findings around unconditional cash transfers</a> more broadly, where giving people cash doesn’t undermine their desire to work).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/15/business/unemployment-benefits-end-date.html">26 states</a>, largely Republican, pulled out of the federal expansions and rolled their UI programs back to their pre-pandemic levels, the same thing — <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28470/w28470.pdf">nothing</a> — happened. Turning down the generosity of UI payments didn’t spur people back to work. Looking abroad, Cai and Heathcote found that on <a href="https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/eligibility-criteria-for-unemployment-benefits_5k9h43kgkvr4-en#page38">a list of 36 OECD countries</a>, more than half extend some sort of UI coverage to quits (though they all come with a waiting period between quitting and collecting benefits that deters doing so too flippantly).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, the pandemic was <a href="https://www.vox.com/science/23823507/pandemic-memory-time-perception-lockdown">a really weird time</a>. So in <a href="https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/the-great-resignation-and-optimal-unemployment-insurance">a staff report</a> for the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis published in October 2023, Cai and Heathcote did as economists do: They took the unusual dataset of quits and built a model of the US economy to put alternative UI policies to the test.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Their results: Even if your sole focus is economic efficiency, the economy is much better off when people who quit receive unemployment benefits, too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Economists have historically held equality and efficiency at <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7864/j.ctt13wztjk">odds with each other</a>, with higher UI benefits seen as an equality booster that trades off against economic efficiency. But Cai explained in an interview with Vox that “if you give nothing to people who quit, it’s actually not an efficient choice, because there are too few people quitting. Our point is that even from an efficiency perspective, you still want to have some UI going to quitters.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Specifically, their model found that extending UI to cover quits did indeed raise the job matching quality that Acemoglu and Shimer <a href="https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/efficient-unemployment-insurance.pdf">theorized about</a> more than two decades earlier, translating into higher wages and economic growth overall. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, their model does find that to maximize welfare across the economy, you’d want to give lower UI payments to people who quit. For people who get fired, the optimal UI amount would be 48.5 percent of their lost wages. For those who quit, it would be 29.5 percent. Both figures are well within today’s <a href="https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/ui_replacement_rates.asp">average UI replacement rates</a>, which fluctuate between 30 and 50 percent depending on the state. And it’s worth pointing out that even the most generous states cap maximum UI benefits so people who lose high-paying jobs don’t get really high UI benefits, too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But using those split rates only gets you a very small welfare gain, and it requires the infrastructure to collect and verify information on who gets fired and who quits to ensure people get the right UI amounts. Bureaucracy imposes its own costs, so Cai and Heathcote also report that a universal UI payment set at 38.4 percent of wages — the same amount whether one quits or gets fired — would still deliver most of the welfare gains while avoiding the need to have more bureaucracy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cai explained that introducing UI for quitters raises welfare in the economy by up to 1.5 percent. “I know that sounds small,” he said, “but for many other policies that economists evaluate, the welfare gains are like 0.1 percent. So when we got 1 percent or above, we were actually pretty surprised by that. It’s a large welfare gain.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Starting with a job seekers allowance</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you go looking for research or proposals around extending UI to include quitting, there’s virtually nothing. In recent years, though, the idea has started showing up in UI reform proposals by way of a different program: a job seekers allowance (JSA). </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2016, the Center for American Progress, the Georgetown Center on Poverty and Inequality, and the National Employment Law Project came together on <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/strengthening-unemployment-protections-in-america/#:~:text=The%20JSA%20would%20offer%20a,a%20typical%20low%2Dpaid%20worker.">a proposal to modernize the UI system</a>. The first section focused on things like re-employment services, raising benefit amounts, and financing reform to rescue the program from <a href="https://www.governing.com/management-and-administration/the-fiscal-fix-our-unemployment-insurance-systems-need">chronic underfunding</a>. The second proposes establishing a new JSA to cover people who aren’t eligible for traditional UI.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The idea was simple enough: a payment of about $170 per week, for up to 13 weeks, for people who deserve UI coverage but don’t qualify. The stated intent was to cover groups like former students, self-employed people, and independent contractors. Although the report doesn’t emphasize the point, it would also cover anyone who voluntarily quits.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In total, the authors estimate the JSA would have cost roughly $10.9 billion per year (in 2016). Together, the JSA and their proposed modernization reforms would about double the number of unemployed Americans who qualify for some sort of UI or JSA benefit.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The idea of a JSA has now made its way <a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/wyden-bennet-beyer-introduce-bicameral-bill-to-overhaul-unemployment-insurance">into the bill</a> that gets re-introduced essentially every year by Sens. Ron Wyden (D–OR) and Michael Bennet (D–CO). Their 2023 version of the JSA was largely an echo of the 2016 proposal, except the payment was bumped up to $250 per week and indexed to inflation, and the benefit duration was doubled to 26 weeks. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the name suggests the JSA would go to people actively looking for work, the proposal only requires that recipients are at least 19, unemployed, ineligible for traditional UI, and don’t have a household income greater than the Social Security taxable wage base, which was $168,600 in 2024. The responsibility for enforcing things like job-search requirements would be left flexible and up to states’ discretion.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, the JSA doesn’t quite fit into the bipartisan consensus around UI reform. Most of the rest of the bill does, though. “If you look through all the various reforms that have been proposed over the years, it all goes back to the 1980 and 1996 bipartisan commissions. There’s nothing in Wyden-Bennett that hasn’t been recommended on a bipartisan basis for decades,” said Evermore.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When I asked Holmes about the JSA, he was skeptical. “I could see where there might be a need for a safety net for people that don’t qualify for UI, but you’ve got to pay attention to how it’s funded,” he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">UI benefits are funded through taxes paid by employers that increase as companies lay off more workers — a situation <a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/creating-a-more-dynamic-unemployment-insurance-system-the-case-for-eliminating-experience-rating/">that should also be reformed</a>. Any rise in UI generosity threatens to put more of a strain on an already <a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/testimony-congress-can-strengthen-ui-administration-with-finance-reform/">cash-strapped system</a>. That, in part, is reason to consider a separate program like the JSA, which could be financed entirely by the federal government, rather than placing additional costs on state UI programs (elsewhere on the list of reforms to consider is just <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Unemplyment-InsurancePP-v4.2-1.pdf">federalizing UI altogether</a>).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even so, adequate funding seems to be a lesser concern than disrupting UI in general. “We’ve got a program that has worked for going on 90 years,” said Holmes, “and we’re gonna overlay that with something new?”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Holmes doesn’t think that covering quitting through UI would lead to a major change in behavior, just that it would grate against the ethos of the program. On this, I’m not so sure. I don’t know how many Americans are working crappy jobs that they really don’t like, but I think if they all knew they could quit and receive some financial support, a not-insignificant number would. Others point out that if you’re going to do a program that gives cash to people who quit their jobs, why not avoid the incentive to quit altogether by <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/10/13/23914745/basic-income-radical-economy-poverty-capitalism-taxes">giving that cash to everyone via a guaranteed income</a>. That way, you help out low-wage workers who don’t quit, too (at the cost of a more expensive program). </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is all the more reason to proceed cautiously. We shouldn’t overhaul a major design aspect of a nearly century-old social program on the basis of a couple of papers. That would be a bit hasty. But given their findings, together with the pandemic’s successful experiments in more generous UI, it would also be a bit strange to keep ignoring the idea altogether. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On paper, low unemployment is a signal that the economy is doing well, but low-wage work <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/03/30/how-americans-view-their-jobs/#:~:text=Job%20satisfaction%20also%20differs%20by,of%20those%20with%20lower%20incomes.">can really suck</a>. Making it easier to quit, to “exit” a situation we don’t like, can help unearth some of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/1/31/24055562/economy-bill-of-rights-vibecession-progressives-freedom-fdr">signals of dissatisfaction that our statistics miss</a> and our markets are blind to. More quitting, it turns out, could be just what capitalism needs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Are your ears doing okay right now?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Do you know? I don’t. I’m wearing noise-canceling headphones, blocking out the din of traffic passing by so that instead Spotify’s Deep Focus playlist can let me do what it promises.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s awesome … but I can’t help but wonder: Is this damaging my hearing?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Our <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/content/urbanization-0#:~:text=Today%2C%20more%20than%20half%20of,around%20two%2Dthirds%20in%202050.">increasingly urban world</a> is <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/everyday-noises-can-hurt-hearts-not-just-ears-and-the-ability-to-learn/">increasingly loud</a>, and it’s <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/40937/documents/199438/default/#:~:text=The%20World%20Health%20Organization%20estimates,British%20population%20are%20exposed%20to">making us sick</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can safely listen to sounds at 85 decibels — <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/aircrew/noise.html#:~:text=A%20study%20of%20noise%20on,higher%20or%20lower%20noise%20levels.">something like</a> the whir of a food processor or the ambient noise of a plane in flight — for up to eight hours. But because of the way hearing damage works, that time drops precipitously with small increases in volume from there. “If the sound goes up to 88 decibels, it is safe to listen to those same sounds for four hours,” according to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association. “And if the sound goes up to 91 decibels, you’re safe listening time is down to two hours.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/can-airpods-pro-protect-your-hearing/">As Wirecutter notes</a>, “a rock concert that registers at 110 decibels could damage your hearing in just two minutes.” Yikes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rock concerts are one thing —&nbsp;it might be irresponsible, but I’m willing to suffer some minor damage to hear <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4Q33YYfUDcYv76wbI98Z4Q?si=3ca3b85dae284fdf">my favorite New York band</a> live in all their glory. But I can only afford live music every now and then; I’m more worried about what I do every day. And while some hearing damage might be slight enough for your body to heal, if the sounds are too loud, or last too long, it can cause permanent irreparable damage. My colleague Edward Vega on the video team was concerned too.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This [worry] led to a full-on spiral,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXk8CoMdxD8">he says in Vox’s latest video</a>, “where I learned the horrifying statistic that over a billion young adults are at risk of permanent, avoidable hearing loss.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We wear our headphones all the time — is that part of the problem? Are they destroying our hearing?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Quick pause: How your hearing can be damaged</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Not to go too Science 101, but loud noises and sounds damage your hearing because sound waves are pressure waves — <a href="https://www.scienceworld.ca/resource/sound/#:~:text=When%20an%20object%20vibrates%2C%20it,molecules%20run%20out%20of%20energy.">it’s vibrating the air</a>. And in your ear, those vibrations hit your eardrum and reverberate it, the bones around it, and the inner ear.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Past your eardrum, in your inner ear, you have hair cells that absorb that energy and convert it into information to convey to your brain — letting you translate that energy into the sounds you hear. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“When your hair cells are healthy, they stand up kind of like a field of wheat,” Dr. Amy Sarow, a clinical audiologist, told Vega. And when a sound wave that’s too strong, too loud, comes through, “it looks like a tornado has come through and they’re all twisted up. If you’re lucky, they’re able to sort of rebuild themselves back straight up, nice and tall, within 48 hours or so afterward. But if you do that often enough, or if the sound is loud enough, the damage is permanent.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And here’s what scared me:&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“In graduate school we would actually have students come into our clinic and we would have them bring their favorite headphones, and play their favorite song on their phone,” she said. And then the research team would measure the sound levels that had been playing — “a lot of times it was 110 decibels or it was over 100 decibels.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Who among us hasn’t turned the volume up for our favorite song — especially if you’re trying to overpower a loud environment around you?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do noise-canceling headphones actually help?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here was my Luddite fear: that somehow, when I was in those loud environments, my noise-canceling headphones weren’t <em>really </em>canceling noise, it was just drowning it out in a different way. One that could cause different — or even more — damage.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For once, I’m happy to admit I was wrong.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Active noise cancelation — the kind where microphones on the headphones listen to the sound of the environment and work to mitigate it, like in Apple AirPods or Bose’s QuietComfort headphones — protects your ears, too. They generate sound waves that are the exact opposite of what the ambient environment is producing, and the two actually cancel each other out.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It doesn&#8217;t amplify the stuff hitting your ear. It actually reduces it,” Brent Butterworth, who’s spent eight years researching headphones as part of his job at Wirecutter, told Vega.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To really understand this, check out the video; its visuals really helped me. And for more on how to responsibly use that noise cancelation tech, and why it won’t work as well to protect you at, say, those rock concerts, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/can-airpods-pro-protect-your-hearing/">check out Butterworth’s article here</a>. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div><div><iframe title="Are headphones destroying our hearing?" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TXk8CoMdxD8?rel=0&#038;start=81" allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></div></div>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But one last thing Ed told me I found super interesting about this: With the most powerful noise-canceling headphones, some people can get something that Butterworth coined “the eardrum suck problem.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vega experienced this when he bought his first pair of noise-canceling headphones in 2017. Within an hour of trying them out, “my throat started to hurt,” he said, “and I felt a lot of pressure in my ears.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The noise cancellation was perhaps <em>too strong. </em>This, apparently, is a real thing — or at least it feels real to your body. It’s psychosomatic.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Basically, “we&#8217;re so used to experiencing sound a certain way, it’s disorienting for your head,” Vega summed up. Noise canceling mostly affects the low frequencies, but high frequencies are still getting through. “So your brain thinks that there’s something wrong, and so it’s sending all these signals that are making you feel like there’s pressure but actually there’s no pressure.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is maybe too much of a good thing? Just kidding — protect your ears. If you have or can afford to buy noise-canceling headphones (even cheap ones work relatively well!), use them to mitigate loud environments. And go check out Vega’s video!</p>

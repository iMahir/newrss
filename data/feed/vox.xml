<p class="has-text-align-none">Americans have never been more polarized, and we <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03307-w">dislike each other on partisan grounds</a> <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/09/polarization-democracy-and-political-violence-in-the-united-states-what-the-research-says?lang=en">now more than ever</a>. Perhaps that’s not shocking, but what may come as a surprise is the way it’s hurting our health.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Political polarization is harming our health in just about every way,” says <a href="https://www.bu.edu/sph/profile/matthew-motta/">Matthew Motta</a>, a political scientist and health law scholar who studies anti-science attitudes at Boston University — and “pretty much all aspects of health have become politicized.” That leads elected officials and other authority figures to <a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/news/political-polarization-poses-health-risks-new-analysis-concludes">make bad health policy decisions</a> and communicate with the public in ways that link health behavior with partisan ideology. A public that sees everything through a red-or-blue lens is more likely to <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-misinformation-and-trust/poll-finding/the-covid-19-pandemic-insights-from-three-years-of-kff-polling/">distrust experts</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/5/12/5709866/kentuckians-only-hate-obamacare-if-you-call-it-obamacare">dislike policies with clear health benefits</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/18/upshot/pandemic-school-closures-data.html">embrace policies</a> with <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10569389/">clear health risks</a>, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/4/26/22403599/biden-red-meat-ban-burger-kudlow">make self-destructive choices</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These dynamics aren’t exclusive to a single party, says <a href="https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/jay-van-bavel.html">Jay Van Bavel</a>, a psychologist at New York University who studies social identity and morality: Nobody is immune from the tricks polarization plays on the brain.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That makes this a particularly interesting time to be thinking about how polarization affects the decisions we make about our health. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Trump’s pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) — one of the US’s most influential leadership roles in health — isn’t just an anti-vaccine advocate with a shaky grasp on science. He’s also a <a href="https://www.vox.com/health/385541/rfk-jr-trump-hhs-vaccines-fluoride">partisan shapeshifter</a>: A scion of one of America’s most consequential Democratic dynasties, he ran for president as a Democrat, only to endorse Trump as the Republican candidate later in the campaign.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Furthermore, his distrust of institutions is something Americans across the political spectrum share, and his concern about chronic diseases and the deleterious influences of the agriculture and pharmaceutical industries on health is something many health authorities agree with.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Experts say elevating Kennedy’s platform lifts up his worst ideas, and that may prove to be true. But given polarization’s threats, it’s worth considering whether his nomination could also depolarize public health — for good and for ill.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Polarization leads us to make bad health choices</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/socialmed/directory/jonathan-oberlander/">Jonathan Oberlander</a>, a political scientist and health policy scholar at the University of North Carolina, recently published an <a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/jhppl/article/49/3/329/387231/Polarization-Partisanship-and-Health-in-the-United">essay</a> explaining how political polarization degrades people’s health through its effects on both individuals and elected officials.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Political polarization <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03307-w">shapes how people interpret risk</a> and who they trust and listen to, which shapes what health services they access and what behaviors they partake in or don’t. This dynamic was a big reason Covid death rates so <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2807617">dramatically diverged</a> between Republicans and Democrats: Party affiliation determined people’s willingness to get vaccinated, wear masks, social distance, and take other preventive measures, says Oberlander. Republicans were less likely to take these measures, and more likely to die of Covid as a consequence.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2<strong> ways to depolarize your mind</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>1) Unfollow hyperpartisan people on social media.</strong> Jay Van Bavel’s research suggests <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/384601678_Unfollowing_hyperpartisan_social_media_influencers_durably_reduces_out-party_animosity">removing the most inflammatory voices from your feed</a> will make you hate people with opposing political views less. In his experiments, unfollowing outrage-mongers was&nbsp;such a positive experience that most participants opted not to refollow them after the trial period was over. “It’s like removing a tumor,” he says.<br><br><strong>2) Do less </strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/3/11/21172064/politics-is-for-power-eitan-hersh-the-ezra-klein-show"><strong>political hobbyism</strong></a><strong> and more IRL engagement. </strong>Rather than treating politics as a sport — cheering for your “team” online, trolling people, making memes to post to social media — do some of the face-to-face work of politics, says Van Bavel. Knock on doors, talk to voters, and generally move away from emotional catharsis and toward cooperation and collaboration. It helps remind you that, behind our politics, all of us are just people.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Highly polarized individuals are more likely to make self-sabotaging health choices just because “their guy” tells them to. This was true when right-leaning Americans embraced taking the antiparasite drugs <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2809985">ivermectin and hydrochloroquine</a> for Covid (despite their adverse effects and cost) and <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/719918">refused Covid vaccines</a> (despite evidence they were safe and saved lives), and when left-of-center Americans leaned into social distancing (despite concerns it was <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9180779/">harmful to mental health</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Polarized people are also more likely to reject policies that they feel might help people on the opposing side. The rise in what Motta calls “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pops.12922">partisan schadenfreude</a>” means that people are increasingly taking pleasure in the suffering of people in other parties. During Covid, he explains, “Republicans took joy in Democrats losing their jobs as a result of stay-at-home orders, whereas Democrats take joy in Republicans getting sick as a result of being infected.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although left-wing Americans were more likely to take Covid’s risks seriously, Van Bavel notes Republicans outpaced Democrats on Ebola fears throughout the 2014 outbreak, during Barack Obama’s presidency. “It&#8217;s not that Democrats in America have a unique capacity to be attuned to the science and the risks of epidemics and pandemics,” he says; it’s that polarized people on the left and the right distrust the other party’s ability to handle any health threat.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Polarization is also creeping into our relationships with health care providers. A recent <a href="https://www.edelman.com/trust/2024/trust-barometer/special-report-health">survey</a> by communications firm Edelman found people feared the politicization of medical science as much as they feared the cost of medical care; 41 percent of respondents aged 18 to 34 said they wouldn’t trust medical advice from a provider who had a different political persuasion than they did, or would stop seeing them entirely.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Health care workers — <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/608903/ethics-ratings-nearly-professions-down.aspx">nurses</a> in particular, as well as dentists, doctors, and pharmacists — have historically been among the most trusted sources of health information for Americans. What happens when politics disrupts that bond, especially when health care workers are in <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/23753724/physician-doctor-shortage-primary-care-medicare-medicaid-rural-health-care-access">short</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/22934992/covid-19-pandemic-doctors-nurses-public-health-shortages">supply</a>?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the most essential level, polarization just makes people feel sick. Whether people are conservative or liberal, the mere perception of being politically distant from the average voter in their state raises their risk of developing <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953621003087">depression and anxiety disorders, sleep problems</a>, and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36712795/">poor physical health</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Politicians and institutions could help depolarize public health&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We’re trapped in a perilous feedback loop with our elected officials that only amplifies our polarization. When politicians espouse views on the extreme ends of their party’s platforms, it helps the public figure out their own stances on the issues, says Motta, “because they know which party they like, they know which candidates they like, and they take up their positions on the issues.” If a politician you like favors an extreme approach to policing, to firearms regulation, to health insurance, you might too without even knowing why.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Our tendency to take up the most radical opinions of popular elected officials has an enhancing effect. “Very perniciously and kind of paradoxically, once the public starts to polarize, that then creates an incentive for elites to polarize even further,” Motta says. That’s how we get into the kind of runaway polarization cycle we’re in right now.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the most powerful ways elected officials could reduce polarization is to publicly change their minds on high-profile health issues, says Motta. “If you can get partisan elites who normally hold positions at odds with the science to admit they&#8217;re wrong, to change their minds,” he says, people depolarize, “but it&#8217;s so hard to do because our elected officials never want to admit that they&#8217;re wrong.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">People often can’t agree on which messengers they trust to communicate that it’s possible to change your mind, but that’s a barrier that can be overcome with some creativity. In a 2022 working paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, political scientists attempting to convince right-leaning Americans to take Covid vaccines compiled a 27-second video of <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w29896">Donald Trump’s positive comments</a> about the vaccine and circulated it as a YouTube ad in low-vaccination counties. Vaccination in those counties increased.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The example shows “there’s no one-size-fits-all” when it comes to public health messaging, says <a href="https://www.bu.edu/sph/profile/timothy-callaghan/">Tim Callaghan</a>, a political scientist who studies health policy at Boston University with a focus on overcoming vaccine hesitancy. Public health authorities need to use different health communications — and different trusted messengers — to target Democrats and Republicans.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Could a polarizing pick for HHS Secretary depolarize public health?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And then there’s Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes, he has leaned heavily into deeply unscientific takes on vaccines, fluoride, and the causes of gender dysphoria, mass shootings, and AIDS. However, his Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) platform also correctly calls out the US’s <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2023/jan/us-health-care-global-perspective-2022">terrible record</a> on preventing diabetes, heart disease, and unhealthy weight.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Much as <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/4891813-robert-kennedy-jr-chronic-disease/">nutritional experts</a> do, he blames these problems on too-cozy relationships between the agriculture sector and the federal government, resulting in permissive policies and dietary guidelines that promote easy access to lots of ultra-processed foods.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A recovering addict himself — Kennedy used heroin for 14 years and says he attends a 12-step meeting daily — he also speaks credibly about the challenges of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2024-06-20/robert-kennedy-addict-reform-plans">substance use disorders</a> and has advocated for increasing Medicaid funding for rehabilitation programs, much as the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/02/26/biden-harris-administration-announces-new-funding-to-increase-capacity-for-behavioral-health-services.html">Biden-Harris administration did</a>. He is also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2023/presidential-candidates-2024-policies-issues/robert-kennedy-jr-abortion/">in favor of abortion rights</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although people who work in public health might see their goals as nonpartisan, the general public <a href="https://harvardpublichealth.org/policy-practice/public-health-needs-to-reform-heres-the-way-forward/">correctly</a> perceives public health as an <a href="https://sandrogalea.substack.com/p/whos-left">exercise in progressive politics</a>. Since rolling out his Make America Healthy Again platform in September, Kennedy has been trying to position himself as a true independent: An early graphic on his now-revamped website read, “Left isn’t better. Right isn’t better. Better is better.” Now that he’s been anointed by Trump, Kennedy’s nomination could present an opportunity to de-link public health from any one political party’s identity.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That could be a good thing if he advocates for changes that benefit the public’s health but that have historically had more support from the mainstream left than the right, like increasing access to health care and decreasing environmental contamination. However, it could be a bad thing if his support for anti-vaccination and anti-fluoridation, associated with both far-right and far-left ideology, legitimizes those causes in the eyes of more moderate members of the public.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Health communicators have a role to play in that, whatever their politics, says <a href="https://hlanthorn.com/">Heather Lanthorn</a> of the <a href="https://qualityhealthcommunication.org/">Council for Quality Health Communications</a>, a nonprofit advocacy group. “On the numerous points where we disagree with MAHA, we need to do a better job of leveraging scientific evidence and addressing their specific concerns honestly, openly, and head-on,” she wrote in an email to Vox.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jared Polis, the Democratic governor of Colorado, may have had bridge-building in mind when he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/opinion/jared-polis-robert-kennedy-democrats.html">praised</a> Trump’s choice of Kennedy last week, applauding Kennedy’s activism against vaccine mandates and, in particular, his willingness to take on the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Not everyone is as optimistic. Seeing Kennedy’s selection as an “olive branch” suggests a complete misunderstanding of his value to Trump, says Motta.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Kennedy is in Trump&#8217;s orbit,” he says, “because they speak the same anti-intellectual language.” Some Democrats may fantasize that Kennedy’s presence at HHS would raise trust in science and government among Republicans.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, there’s at least as big a risk his leadership would instead affirm conservatives’ misgivings while also seeding new distrust among Democrats and centrists who typically have higher levels of confidence in these institutions — just furthering the polarization health doom loop.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah is set to take effect in Lebanon at 4 am local time Wednesday, President Joe Biden announced today.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The temporary pause in hostilities, negotiated by the US and France, could lead to a permanent ceasefire in Lebanon. Israel invaded its northern neighbor in late September to fight Hezbollah, the Shia militant group based in Lebanon’s south. Hezbollah is an ally of Hamas, Israel’s foe in Gaza, and launched attacks against Israel in retaliation for Israel’s war in Gaza (which itself began in retaliation for the October 7, 2023, incursion into Israel by Hamas, in which the group killed roughly 1,200 Israelis and captured more than 200 others).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The announcement comes amid intensive bombing in the Lebanese capital Beirut, including in heavily populated areas. And it comes more than a year into Israel’s war in Gaza, which has killed more than 44,000 Palestinians and rendered much of the territory uninhabitable. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><br>Netanyahu’s cabinet accepted the deal on Tuesday; Lebanese lawmakers are set to discuss the agreement on Wednesday morning. Hezbollah leadership, which was not party to the negotiations, indicated last week that the group would accept a ceasefire agreement if Israel stopped striking Lebanon and respected the country’s sovereignty (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/26/world/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-cease-fire/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-cease-fire?smid=url-share">Lebanon’s speaker of Parliament</a> served as the go-between for the Lebanese caretaker government and the militant group.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here is what you need to know:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Where does the conflict stand now?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tuesday’s ceasefire comes after at least one false start, when the US and France attempted to mediate a short ceasefire at the end of September.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since then, Hezbollah has been severely diminished. A September attack using <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/372399/pager-explosions-lebanon-syria-hezbollah-israel-gaza">explosives hidden in pagers</a> and other electronic devices killed large numbers of Hezbollah fighters as well as Lebanese civilians; though Israel has not claimed responsibility for that attack, it is widely believed to be responsible. Israel also killed senior Hezbollah leadership, including longtime head Sayed Hassan Nasrallah, in bombings near Beirut. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tuesday represented a crescendo in Israel’s Lebanese offensive; heavy bombing rocked densely populated parts of Beirut and <a href="https://apnews.com/live/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-ceasefire-updates">24 people were killed</a> across the country, according to Lebanese authorities.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah has <a href="https://apnews.com/live/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-ceasefire-updates#00000193-6a52-d02c-a99f-fad7e8730000">killed more than 3,500 Lebanese so far and around 75 Israeli civilians</a>. (Lebanese death tolls, taken from the country&#8217;s Health Ministry, combine civilian and military deaths.) About 60,000 Israelis have been displaced from the Israel/Lebanon border region since October 8, 2023. That’s when Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Hamas, after the militant group attacked Israel.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s in the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire deal?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The deal is for a 60-day cessation of hostilities, though Biden suggested that the agreement lays the groundwork for a permanent ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The negotiation, brokered by the US and France, stipulates that Israel and Hezbollah are not to attack each other and that Israeli troops are to gradually withdraw across the Blue Line —&nbsp;the internationally recognized border between Israel and Lebanon — over the two-month period. Hezbollah is to move its forces above Lebanon’s Litani river.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite the promising development, any peace appears delicate. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned in a televised speech Tuesday, “If Hezbollah violates the agreement and attempts to rearm, we will strike. If they attempt to rebuild infrastructure along the border, dig a tunnel, launch rockets, or bring in trucks loaded with missiles, we will strike.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A spokesperson for Hezbollah <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-lebanon-hezbollah-ceasefire-3ed296f8317ecaa89c4e3548c75c9602">reportedly said</a> that the group will wait to “see if there is a match between what we stated and what was agreed upon by the Lebanese officials” before committing to the ceasefire. The group also suggested it would respond to any attack by Israel. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thousands of Lebanese forces and UN peacekeeping troops will surge to southern Lebanon as part of the agreement. A <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/what-does-us-brokered-truce-ending-israel-hezbollah-fighting-include-2024-11-26/">monitoring body headed by the US</a> will be responsible for ensuring all parties’ adherence to the agreement.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden assured reporters in his Tuesday briefing that no US troops will be committed to Lebanon, though a senior administration official later clarified in a press briefing that, “If we need folks on the ground, they will be based, I assume, in the embassy. The president was clear that no troops would be deployed to the south, and we are not going to be engaging in, don&#8217;t expect anybody to engage in, any kind of combat operations of any kind. This is all in security assistance.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s next for the deal?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ideally, a framework for a lasting peace will be the next step for Israel and Lebanon.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, an additional hurdle remains before the ceasefire is implemented. As the agreement now stands, Israel has the right to strike back should Hezbollah violate its end of the bargain. As Netanyahu explained in his speech, there seems to be a broad range of actions that would constitute a violation. He also said <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/what-does-us-brokered-truce-ending-israel-hezbollah-fighting-include-2024-11-26/">Israeli drones would monitor Lebanese territory</a>, which Lebanese officials maintain they did not agree to. Lebanese officials will meet to discuss the ceasefire deal Wednesday morning.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In his remarks, Biden mentioned that a renewed push for a Gaza ceasefire was on the table in the waning days of his presidency. Hezbollah had previously tied its ceasefire agreement to a ceasefire in Gaza (Hezbollah and Hamas are both aligned with Iran and its affiliate groups.) Advancing those stalled peace talks would be a logical next step.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Welcome to Know-It-All. In the age of intellectual property grabs, docudramas, and so very many sequels, it can be difficult to find a way into the complicated worlds we see on screen. In this series, Vox experts explain what you need to know to get into the latest hot release.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Human existence is full of an unfathomably infinite number of things — real and fake, abstract ideas and actual physical objects, past and present and future — to consider, fixate on, learn about. Still, for many men, there’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2023/09/14/roman-empire-trend-men-tiktok/">one thing</a> they specifically think about constantly: <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2018/6/19/17469176/roman-empire-maps-history-explained">the Roman Empire</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Director Ridley Scott, a man, very clearly thinks about it a lot. But maybe not in exactly the same way others do.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Scott’s new movie <em>Gladiator II</em> officially hit theaters this past weekend, and made $55.5 million domestically and <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt9218128/">$220 million worldwide</a>. The sequel stars Paul Mescal, a man with the most adored side profile in Hollywood, and is set within the same world — with many of the same characters — as <em>Gladiator</em>, <a href="https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2001/memorable-moments">Scott’s Oscar-winning film from 2000</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many things happen in the movie. Mescal’s character, Lucius, bites a CGI baboon and chokes it with handcuffs; Denzel Washington’s Macrinus flounces around in caftans, terrorizing Roman senators about loyalty. There’s also a lot that doesn’t seem quite based in history: a naval battle in the Colosseum where sharks eat human competitors,&nbsp;at least one domesticated battle rhino, and what seems to be a newspaper despite Ancient Rome predating the printing press.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While your mileage may vary on the movie, there’s something entertaining about how Scott imagines Ancient Rome to be more exciting than it was. Maybe one day our descendants will imagine our mundane lives with as much anachronistic gusto as Scott.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To get a better understanding of what Scott was aiming for in this movie and what he was inspired by, I chatted with <a href="https://www.vox.com/authors/christian-paz">Vox senior politics writer Christian Paz</a>, another man who thinks about Ancient Rome often. Since middle school, Paz tells me, he was obsessed with the Roman Empire and that fixation has only grown stronger in adulthood. Paz is also slightly fascinated by Paul Mescal and, now, Ridley Scott’s off-kilter version of Ancient Rome. We talked about Roman naval battles, the egos of emperors, and what is, really, so endlessly fascinating about this period in history.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>How often do you think about the Roman Empire?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think about it quite a lot. Its influence and legacy are everywhere. I see reminders of it when I walk around DC, when I scroll TikTok and get videos about the Galactic Senate, the Galactic Republic, and the Empire, and when I watch videos about what ancient and historical peoples <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/vqJai-flawE?si=_nRuAufBj30uLwK0">used to cook and eat</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Also I took Latin in high school.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>How often do you think Ridley Scott thinks about the Roman Empire?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Insofar as he thinks about big battles, big historical events, and believes in the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/non-fiction/napoleon-ridley-scott-great-man-myth-history/">Great Man theory of history</a>, probably often enough to want to recreate the magic of the original <em>Gladiator</em>. And he probably wants an Oscar, no?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>If his movies reflect his personal desires and needs, I believe that man wants a lot of things. And sometimes I think this world simply does not have enough to offer Ridley Scott, so he sensationalizes. It feels like he is constantly tarting up the world he lives in or learned about.</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>For example, in </strong><strong><em>Gladiator II</em></strong><strong>, Paul Mescal bites a baboon in one of the arenas. Were there actual baboons in Roman gladiator fights?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lol, most definitely not. I was trying to track down where he got this idea for baboons, and apparently it came to him from a trip he took to South Africa where he saw some <a href="https://www.avclub.com/ridley-scott-gladiator-ii-baboons">tourist approach a baboon in a parking lot</a>. The baboon, naturally, freaked out when the man tried to pet it, and attacked — and that seems to be Scott’s inspiration for wanting this group of captives and future gladiators to fight something “formidable.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But how would [the Romans] capture and release these, like, 12 baboons?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Well, obviously one would need to train and house the baboons too!&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Also, if these are based on the baboons Scott saw in South Africa — the Roman legions never got that far!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>There’s also a moment where they fill the Colosseum with water and stage a naval battle with sharks.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Right, and to prep for that battle, Paul’s character is forced to practice rowing a boat until his hands bleed and blister. God,<strong> </strong>this Colosseum scene was actually ridiculous because, where are they finding these sharks? How would they catch them and transport them back to Rome?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Modern-day aquariums have a tough time </strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/7/26/16033996/white-shark-aquarium"><strong>keeping sharks alive</strong></a><strong>. But Ridley Scott believes Ancient Rome could.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sharks can’t really survive in freshwater, so where are they holding these massive amounts of salt water and tanks and sharks? Flooding the Colosseum with water was actually <a href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/encyclopaedia_romana/gladiators/naumachiae.html">a thing</a> that was done <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/ancient-rome-once-filled-the-colosseum-up-with-water-and-staged-epic-mock-sea-battle">a few times</a> earlier in the Roman imperial period — but that was fresh water transported through aqueducts and diverted from the Tiber River. On every level, that’s actually an insane decision to make.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GL2-FF-087K.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=9.6777777777778,0,80.644444444444,100" alt="The Roman Colosseum full of spectators watching a mock naval battle taking place in the flooded center." title="The Roman Colosseum full of spectators watching a mock naval battle taking place in the flooded center." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="The simulated naval battle in &lt;em&gt;Gladiator II&lt;/em&gt;. You can’t see them but there are sharks in the water. | Paramount Pictures" data-portal-copyright="Paramount Pictures" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">But mock naval battles were once actually fought in the Colosseum, or in bigger locations around Rome, as early as <a href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/encyclopaedia_romana/gladiators/naumachia.html">Julius Caesar’s reign</a> toward the end of the Republic. They were a hugely extravagant and expensive thing to do, so they didn’t happen too frequently. Even gladiatorial games were an irregular occurrence —&nbsp;happening like three to four times a year at most&nbsp;— because they were just so expensive to hold. And that’s the bottom line of why they went out of commission. It was just too expensive to run an empire, and to keep these circuses going contributed to the empire’s resource drain<strong> </strong>—&nbsp;and the gradual spread of Christianity finished the games off<strong>.</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>How do they get the sharks in and out?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Movie magic.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>There’s also one gladiator who rides a trained rhino. I’m guessing that’s a bit of embellishment too.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yup, another wild decision — made for great cinema action, but it’s not likely that Romans would train and ride a rhino into battle. There are records of rhinoceroses being brought into the Colosseum — like during the celebrations for when it was <a href="https://www.tertullian.org/fathers/martial_on_the_games_of_domitian_01_text.htm">inaugurated</a> and when the emperor Commodus, the inspiration for Joaquin Phoenix’s villain from the first <em>Gladiator</em>, <a href="https://ancienthistorybulletin.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AHBReviewsHopeOnToner.pdf">killed a rhinoceros</a> with spears and arrows from an elevated platform <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Day_Commodus_Killed_a_Rhino/gIKCoAEACAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;printsec=frontcover">in 192 AD</a>. When used, rhinos would fight other animals instead of gladiators.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Could you imagine all that effort to bring a rhino into the Colosseum, telling all your friends about it, getting the gladiators set, and then have it just run around killing a lion — a lion that may have been hanging around in the bowels of the Colosseum for ages because everyone was out trying to find a rhino? So then the rhino waits for another crew to find a hippo or something and the cycle repeats itself!&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">God, I’d hate to be a rhino and just be killed because of ego.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the whole point of having rhinos and other exotic animals in the Colosseum was to represent and demonstrate the power, wealth, and reach of the empire, and more specifically, of the emperor.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Another surprising thing: the Roman newspaper that one of the senators is reading.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This was one of the more ridiculous things in the film; it has been <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/gladiator-ii-fact-fiction-ai-1236047785/">ridiculed</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/19/gladiator-ii-ridley-scott-historical-inaccuracies-rhinos">extensively</a>. It was actually in two scenes, if I recall — in the pseudo-cafe in which a senator is having a beverage (which I will assume is wine, or a spiced wine, because the Romans didn’t really have tea or coffee yet) and then at the senator’s home when Macrinus shows up.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For those who need clarification: Paper, of the mass-produced variety, has not been invented yet, never mind the printing press.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Sadly, the Ancient Romans never knew the font that is Times New Roman.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Romans did have a version of, like, important announcements and news that were <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Acta">inscribed</a> into a stone tablet and which was primarily placed in public places — the Acta Diurna, or “Acts of the Day.” But it wasn’t very widely circulated to people&nbsp;— it might have been sent to some senators but was primarily shared with governors and administrative government officials.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Was the gladiator system — that wins could make you a celebrity and eventually a free man — real?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes and no.&nbsp; It was absolutely a system with schools and cells, and sponsors and teachers, and funding and people who fed you and tended to you; you were specially trained, and became a master essentially of a particular kind of weapon and armor and dress usually based on your ethnic or national origin —&nbsp;like Gauls, Thracians, Britons. Gladiators lost personhood and became a form of property — prisoners of war, enslaved people, people with significant debts who sought to repay those debts, and poor, lower-class people who volunteered. So the whole operation that Denzel Washington’s character is running was very real.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yes, you could essentially become a celebrity, and aristocratic women, of high society, would take them as lovers —&nbsp;but even if you got discharged or won your freedom after winning or surviving matches, there wasn’t much you could do in society —&nbsp;so they would return to teach other gladiators or fight again as free men.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>The real gladiator “system” feels more like an </strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area/24115013/pyramid-scheme-america-mlm-multilevel-marketing-wellness"><strong>MLM</strong></a><strong> than whatever’s happening in Scott’s movie. Why do you think Scott is so obsessed with it?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Honestly, I was thinking that too. When you’re in, you’re kind of stuck. You get nice perks on occasion but it was a nasty, brutish, short life. And I think that is probably part of his fascination — to trade up freedom for something greater, or to make the most of the hellish lot life has cast you.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I feel like you and Ridley Scott think about different things when thinking about the Roman Empire. What is it about the Roman Empire that fascinates you?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think we think very differently about the Roman Empire. Scott loves the battles and the concept of great men — and don’t get me wrong, me too! My favorite games are Rome Total War and Empire Total War. In middle school I recreated a Roman camp in Gaul in my school’s cafeteria for a class project and made a set of armor like what Julius Caesar’s legionaries probably wore.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GL2_29680RC2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.568687156345,100,78.86262568731" alt="Denzel Washington in blue and gold Roman dress sitting on a golden throne-like chair." title="Denzel Washington in blue and gold Roman dress sitting on a golden throne-like chair." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Denzel Washington in &lt;em&gt;Gladiator II&lt;/em&gt;. Washington is a gladiator owner, which seems like a very predatory MLM by today’s standards. | Paramount Pictures" data-portal-copyright="Paramount Pictures" />
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Did this make you popular? Like, did you have a lot of friends?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Um. First of all, that’s rude. And second of all, I didn’t go there to make friends. I came to win and put on a spectacle.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But also, I was fascinated by the politics of the Roman Republic, specifically — the concept of the senate, the idea of the “Senate and the People of Rome” being the source of power and legitimacy, of consuls and of aediles and of quaestors, of a civil service. And I was fascinated by its fall, the rise of a rag-tag system of tyrannical government in the form of the empire —&nbsp;which, for most people, didn’t really mean anything different in their lives but changed the world.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And so I think specifically of the tenuousness of democracy, the appeal of strongmen, and the fact that what binds so many nations today — representative democracy and imagined community —&nbsp;has its roots in Rome’s centuries of existence. I think what fascinates me the most is the “fall” of Rome —&nbsp;something that <em>Gladiator II </em>delves into with its talk about the “dream” of Rome, the threat of “tyranny,” and the idea of “civitas” or Roman citizenship. They were all such amorphous, delicate concepts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What do you think men who think about the Roman Empire a lot will think about </strong><strong><em>Gladiator II</em></strong><strong>?&nbsp; Will the historical inaccuracies and sensationalizing turn them off?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">True Roman history nerds will probably be annoyed and laugh at the inaccuracies and sensationalizing. But let’s be honest. We’re going to see this movie either because of the nostalgia, because we want to see battles and fights on the big screen, because of Denzel Washington’s stunning performance (which will be noted in my Letterboxd review because he’s basically the main character), or because we want to admire Paul Mescal’s … everything.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>In the next life, may you be reborn as a baboon in Paul Mescal’s Ancient Rome.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I am ready to be bitten, Paul.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Measles, mumps, and polio are supposed to be diseases of the past. In the early to mid-20th century, scientists developed <a href="https://www.vox.com/vaccines">vaccines</a> that effectively eliminated the risk of anyone getting sick or dying from illnesses that had killed millions over millennia of human history.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vaccines, alongside sanitized water and antibiotics, have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38798-z#:~:text=Vaccines%20have%20revolutionized%20modern%20medicine,their%20impact%20on%20disease%20prevention.">marked the epoch of modern medicine</a>. The US was at <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27375/w27375.pdf">the cutting edge of eliminating these diseases</a>, which helped propel life expectancy and economic growth in the postwar era. Montana native <a href="https://hillemanfilm.com/dr-hilleman">Maurice Hilleman</a>, the so-called father of modern vaccines, developed flu shots, hepatitis shots, and the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine in the 1950s and ’60s, which became virtually universally adopted among Americans.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p class="has-text-align-none">Smallpox, the most common form of which has <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK221063/#:~:text=There%20are%20five%20known%20classifications,97%20percent%20case%20fatality%20rate.">a 30 percent fatality rate</a>, has been <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/index.html">eradicated</a>. Mitch McConnell, Republican titan of the Senate, may be the last major public figure <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-29908203">still afflicted by a childhood case of polio</a>, less than a century after <a href="https://www.fdrlibrary.org/polio">it paralyzed</a> a sitting American president. Measles likely infected millions of people annually in the US in the 1800s, although precise estimates from the era are hard to come by. In the early 1900s, thousands of people <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6878996/#:~:text=In%20the%20early%20decades%20of,reported%20in%20the%20United%20States.">died</a> from the disease every year. It was still infecting <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/209448">more than half a million and killing hundreds per year on average</a> in the 1950s and ’60s, before the vaccine debuted. Diphtheria, a deadly respiratory infection, killed more than 1,800 people annually between 1936 and 1945 as the vaccine against it was still being rolled out. It has not killed anybody in the United States in decades.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The vaccines that made this possible are among the most important achievements in human history. And yet many Americans appear to be losing faith in them, a worrying trend that could accelerate if President-elect Donald Trump succeeds in handing control of the top US health agency <a href="https://www.vox.com/health/385541/rfk-jr-trump-hhs-vaccines-fluoride">into the hands of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a>, the country’s foremost vaccine denier.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kennedy has spent much of his public career pushing the thoroughly <a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccines-and-other-conditions/autism">debunked</a> theory of a link between autism and childhood vaccines. He has <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/07/how-rfk-jr-falsely-denied-his-connection-to-a-deadly-measles-outbreak-in-samoa/">supported</a> an anti-vaccine group in Samoa, where measles vaccination rates have since fallen off; a 2019 outbreak <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/11/15/rfk-jr-global-health-samoa-kennedy/">killed</a> 83 people just a few months after Kennedy visited the island and met with anti-vaccine advocates. He has likewise <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/15/politics/robert-kennedy-covid-vaccine-antisemitism/index.html">cast doubt</a> on the safety and efficacy of the Covid vaccines, a position that helped nudge the lifelong Democrat toward Trump. After Kennedy dropped his own presidential campaign this year, he became Trump’s most influential health adviser and last week was nominated by the president-elect to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The day after Trump’s election, Kennedy <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-win-rfk-jr-says-wont-take-away-anybodys-vaccines-rcna178955">insisted</a> he would not “take away anybody’s vaccines.” Instead, he said, he planned to compile vaccine safety information so that people could make their own decisions. But vaccine safety has been extensively studied — and the negative effects Kennedy claims <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/autism/faq/index.html">remain undetected</a>. (Others in Trump’s orbit have <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-10-31/rfk-jr-wants-federal-health-data-so-he-can-show-vaccines-are-unsafe-trump-transition-co-chair-says">stated</a> that Kennedy will nevertheless use whatever information he finds to try to pull vaccines from the market.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Experts fear that his appointment will validate his anti-vaccine attitudes —&nbsp;and exacerbate the public’s growing ambivalence toward these vital public health measures.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As long-accepted, lifesaving public health measures increasingly become politically polarized, routine vaccination rates are <a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline-as-trump-heads-for-a-second-term/?utm_campaign=KFF-Covid&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_3P_iz266TOhPvf-NtGUHduQ39FGNRP47RiDP28gQOeYEbGXlMjpVZMTzhgEu_YcqZbEGDvcQz7M1-R2LmpLWUdPHOMQ&amp;_hsmi=334423251&amp;utm_content=334423251&amp;utm_source=hs_email">rapidly declining in much of the US</a>. In the 2019–2020 school year, three states had less than 90 percent of K–12 students vaccinated against measles, mumps, and rubella. By the 2023–2024 school year, 14 states had fallen below that threshold. The number of states with more than 95 percent of schoolchildren vaccinated — the preferred level of coverage to prevent outbreaks — dropped from 20 to 11 during that same period.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is no surprise then that the number of US measles cases <a href="https://abc7.com/post/global-measles-cases-rise-health-officials-tell-us-what-la-county-is-doing-right-vaccine/15546618/#:~:text=The%20World%20Health%20Organization%20reports,compared%20to%20four%20in%202023.">more than quadrupled</a> from 2023 to 2024. Nobody has died of measles in the US <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-cases-states-2024-more-than-2023/">since 2015</a>, but if vaccination rates continue to decline, this highly contagious disease (one person can infect <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28757186/#:~:text=For%20measles%2C%20R0%20is,in%20a%20totally%20susceptible%20population.">more than a dozen other people</a>) will spread with increasing ease, which raises the risk that American kids could die.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We know how to prevent that. We’ve had remarkably safe, effective shots for decades. We just need to keep using them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/6/24/23181720/supreme-court-dobbs-jackson-womens-health-samuel-alito-roe-wade-abortion-marriage-contraception">the fall of <em>Roe v. Wade</em></a>, Democratic lawmakers and reproductive rights advocates have maintained a clear strategy: Win a more progressive Democratic trifecta in 2024, eliminate the Senate filibuster, and pass comprehensive federal protections. When reporters asked about contingency plans — particularly given polls suggesting full Democratic control was unlikely — such questions were dismissed, cast as premature or defeatist.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, with Donald Trump&#8217;s return to power and Republicans set to control Congress, that strategy is drawing fresh questions. The GOP has signaled some openness to compromise: While campaigning, Trump said <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/19/politics/trump-abortion-ban-rape-incest/index.html">he supported abortion exceptions</a> in cases of “rape, incest, and protecting the life of the mother,”<strong> </strong>and he promised to mandate insurance coverage for in vitro fertilization (IVF). Several Republican lawmakers have <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/02/27/congress/maces-ivf-alternative-00143590">backed</a> <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/opinion/2024/03/11/congressman-mike-carey-says-hes-working-to-make-ivf-affordable/72886283007/">their own</a> <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/dave-mccormick-pa-senate-race-family-policies-20240626.html">fertility treatment</a> bills. Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY) <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7056/cosponsors">backed a Democratic-led IVF measure</a> and speaks openly about <a href="https://midhudsonnews.com/2024/08/04/rep-lawler-wants-to-help-families-conceive-children/">his family&#8217;s consideration</a> of the procedure. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) has <a href="https://www.ernst.senate.gov/news/press-releases/ernst-works-to-promote-access-to-safe-effective-birth-control">pushed legislation</a> to expand over-the-counter contraception.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But reproductive rights organizations are doubtful. &#8220;We are not willing to compromise when it comes to our ability to make decisions about our bodies, lives and future,&#8221; Gretchen Borchelt, of the National Women&#8217;s Law Center (NWLC), said on a press call the day after the election. “What is the compromise that would provide relief for Amber Nicole Thurman&#8217;s family who&#8217;s grieving her every single day?&#8221; added NWLC’s president Fatima<strong> </strong>Goss Graves, referring <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/georgia-abortion-ban-amber-thurman-death">to a patient who died from sepsis</a> after being denied care.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vox asked six major advocacy groups if they would consider pushing for new federal protections under a Republican-led Congress, be it for IVF, birth control or abortion. Most avoided giving a direct answer, instead directing the conversation to Republican accountability and the harm caused by abortion bans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The stance reflects a deeper calculation: that accepting anything less than people deserve —&nbsp;meaning access to the full spectrum of reproductive health care for any reason —&nbsp;would legitimize restrictions and undermine the broader fight for bodily autonomy. When asked about pursuing partial protections versus holding out for more Democrats, groups choose waiting.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We are really looking at this from a defensive position,” said Ryan Stitzlein, the vice president of political and government relations at Reproductive Freedom for All, the group formerly known as NARAL. “We <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/373485/project-2025-abortion-ban-trump-comstock-mifepristone">read Project 2025</a>, we are very familiar with the folks in leadership on the Republican side … and are preparing for them to levy attacks on reproductive freedom at all levels of government on the administrative side.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Polling suggests there may be political opportunities</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite the Biden era&#8217;s surprising bipartisan deals on thorny issues from <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/6/23/23180893/senate-gun-control-bipartisan-bill-2022-pass">gun control</a> to <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/7/28/23281757/whats-in-climate-bill-inflation-reduction-act">climate change</a>, there were never similar attempts to forge bipartisan compromise on reproductive rights. When a small group of Republican and Democratic senators introduced legislation in 2022 to codify elements of <em>Roe</em>, abortion rights groups <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/8/22/23306142/kaine-collins-codify-roe-abortion-congress">quickly rejected the idea</a>, arguing in part that it did not go far enough. Even on issues like IVF and birth control, where Republican support seemed possible and anti-abortion groups held less sway, there were no serious efforts to find common ground.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To be sure, while many Republicans have sought to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/01/anti-abortion-movement-ivf-war-00149766">reassure voters that they support IVF</a>, their voting record thus far tells a different story. Many of those same lawmakers co-sponsored the Life at Conception Act, which could severely restrict fertility treatments by granting <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/24090347/alabama-ivf-ruling-fetal-personhood-abortion-embryos">legal personhood</a> from the moment of conception. Republicans have largely <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/17/republicans-block-ivf-bill-00179626">voted against Democratic IVF legislation</a>, while claiming they&#8217;d support narrower fertility treatment bills and criticizing Democrats for not being open to working on amendments.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, polling suggests potential political opportunities. About <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/26/us/politics/republicans-birth-control-ivf.html">80 percent</a> of voters say protecting contraception access is &#8220;deeply important&#8221; to them, and 72 percent of Republican voters had a favorable view of birth control. IVF is even more popular: <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/4507514-overwhelming-majority-americans-support-keeping-ivf-legal-for-women-poll/">86 percent of Americans</a> think it should be legal, <a href="https://www.iwv.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/executive-summary-KAConsulting-poll-contraception.pdf">including 78 percent</a> of self-identified &#8220;pro-life advocates&#8221; and 83 percent of evangelical Christians. Americans&#8217; support for abortion rights <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/support-for-abortion-access-has-risen-since-supreme-court-overturned-roe-v-wade-poll-finds">has intensified</a> since the fall of <em>Roe</em>, and this reality shaped some Republicans’ rhetoric on the campaign trail. Newly elected Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Dave McCormick <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/dave-mccormick-pa-senate-race-family-policies-20240626.html">ran on a platform</a> of fighting restrictions on fertility treatments and proposing a $15,000 tax credit for IVF.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some policy strategists have suggested that, regardless of Republican sincerity, Democrats and abortion rights groups might benefit from pushing votes on new IVF and birth control bills, even if they offer limited protections or codify certain provisions that advocates oppose.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such moves could either win new concrete protections or expose Republican resistance. But Democratic leadership and abortion rights groups for now seem uninterested in this approach, preferring to maintain pressure for comprehensively restoring rights.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We haven&#8217;t seen a genuine effort from Republicans that they engage in this conversation,” Stitzlein said. “We’ve seen them propose bills to try to save face in response to <em>Dobbs</em> and the <a href="https://www.vox.com/24080428/alabama-ivf-embryo-abortion-women-fertility">Alabama IVF ruling</a>.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Should Democrats keep their red line on abortion exceptions?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The political math around abortion exceptions would seem straightforward. Trump ostensibly supports them. Most Americans, including many Republicans, believe abortion should be legal in cases of <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-poised-reverse-roe-americans-support-abortion/story?id=84468131&amp;cid=social_twitter_abcn">rape, incest, and threats to the</a><strong><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-poised-reverse-roe-americans-support-abortion/story?id=84468131&amp;cid=social_twitter_abcn"> </a></strong><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-poised-reverse-roe-americans-support-abortion/story?id=84468131&amp;cid=social_twitter_abcn">parent’s life</a>. And women are being demonstrably harmed by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/01/21/us/abortion-ban-exceptions.html">lack of workable exceptions in state bans</a> today. One recent study estimated that more than 3 million women in the US will experience a pregnancy from rape in their lifetime.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet when asked whether they would consider seeking federal protections for abortion exceptions during Republican control as a harm reduction measure, established advocacy groups showed no interest, pointing to <a href="https://www.vox.com/23997727/kate-cox-texas-abortion-ban">patients like Kate Cox</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/3/12/23631278/supreme-court-abortion-texas-medically-necessary-sepsis-zurawski">Amanda Zurawski</a> who almost<strong> </strong>lost their lives or fertility<strong> </strong>despite state bans with exceptions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&#8220;As we are seeing across the country, exceptions often don&#8217;t work in practice, so people should not take comfort in those or rely on them,&#8221; Rachana Desai Martin, chief government and external relations officer at the Center for Reproductive Rights, told Vox.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This position stems from a core belief: that any engagement with exceptions would validate the broader framework of restrictions. Some doctors on the ground in states with restrictive bans have bemoaned the lack of support they’ve received for carving out exceptions. “I worry that reproductive rights advocates may be digging into untenable positions and failing to listen to those affected most by the current reality,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/16/opinion/medical-exceptions-abortion-tennessee.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">wrote one</a> maternal-fetal medicine physician in Tennessee.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the question of codifying emergency medical protections, Planned Parenthood Action Fund stressed in an email that, &#8220;narrow health exceptions or those that focus only on emergencies are a disservice to patients and their health care providers because every pregnancy is unique.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The position is particularly notable given these <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/supreme-court-refuses-to-say-whether-emtala-requires-hospitals-to-provide-stabilizing-abortions/">same groups&#8217;</a> <a href="https://reproductivefreedomforall.org/news/reproductive-freedom-for-all-statement-on-supreme-court-decision-on-emergency-abortion-care-case/">strong</a> <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/planned-parenthood-statement-on-leaked-supreme-court-decision-in-emtala-case">defense</a> of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) at the Supreme Court this year. The groups argued that EMTALA — which requires hospitals to provide “stabilizing treatment,” including emergency abortion care — represents a crucial federal protection for women in medical crises. Yet when asked about codifying the Biden administration’s interpretation of EMTALA or similar protections through legislation, the groups demurred.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Internationally, exceptions have served as imperfect stepping stones to broader rights. Colombia&#8217;s journey from total ban to full decriminalization began with three abortion exceptions in 2006 — for health risks, fatal fetal conditions, and rape. Over 16 years, advocates used these flawed measures to help build public support and legal precedent for expanding access, ultimately leading to <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2022/05/10/1097570784/colombia-legalized-abortions-for-the-first-24-weeks-of-pregnancy-a-backlash-ensu">decriminalizing the procedure up to 24 weeks</a> in 2022.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">India and Spain followed similar trajectories. India&#8217;s 1971 Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act initially permitted abortion for married women in cases of rape or health risks, including mental health risk when contraception failed. This framework allowed for significant access, and advocates used it to gradually build broader rights — first emphasizing public health arguments around unsafe abortions, then expanding to gender equality concerns. This incremental approach led to significant expansions <a href="https://prsindia.org/files/bills_acts/acts_parliament/2021/Medical%20Termination%20of%20Pregnancy%20Amendment%20Act%202021.pdf">in 2021</a> and <a href="https://www.scobserver.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/X-v-Principal-Secretary-Health-and-Family-Welfare-Department-Govt.-of-NCT-of-Delhi-Anr.pdf">2022</a>, including extended gestational limits and broader access for unmarried women. Spain&#8217;s path from its restrictive 1985 law to <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2010/03/spain-expands-legal-access-abortion">its 2010 legalization</a> up to 14 weeks followed a similar pattern, with advocates particularly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/11/world/europe/11spain.html">leveraging Spain’s mental health exception</a> to create de facto broad access.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These tensions — between principle and pragmatism, between long-term strategy and immediate needs — have taken on new urgency as patients in the US encounter the limitations of state-level abortion exceptions. In Louisiana, which has exceptions for protecting life, health, and fatal fetal conditions, almost no legal abortions <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/new-orleans/2023/06/26/abortion-rate-louisiana-post-roe">have been reported</a> since its ban took effect. Doctors say <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/3/12/23631278/supreme-court-abortion-texas-medically-necessary-sepsis-zurawski">ambiguous laws and criminal penalties</a> make them unwilling to test the rules.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But rather than pursue clearer federal standards around exceptions, advocacy groups are betting on abortion rights becoming more prominent as restrictions continue.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Americans will continue waking up to stories of women who died preventable deaths because they were denied access to essential health care and voters will continue to see these bans wreak havoc on their families and communities,” declared a post-election strategy memo from Emily’s List, National Women’s Law Center Action Fund, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, and Reproductive Freedom for All. “With anti-abortion politicians in power, abortion rights will only grow in salience for voters in elections to come.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Working with Republicans on even limited protections could also undercut the narrative of GOP extremism — a message advocacy groups see as crucial for winning in 2026 and 2028.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A high-stakes political bet</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite abortion rights proving less galvanizing in the most recent election than Democrats had hoped, reproductive rights groups are betting that voter attitudes will shift as restrictions continue. Currently, 28 million women, plus more trans and nonbinary people of reproductive age, live in states with abortion bans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&#8220;We have no interest in shrinking our vision,&#8221; Kimberly Inez McGuire, executive director of Unite for Reproductive &amp; Gender Equity, said, &#8220;but the politicians who will soon govern a majority pro-abortion country would do well to expand theirs.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In an interview with Vox, Democratic Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota said she will work with anyone in Congress who wants to collaborate in good-faith to protect abortion rights, but stressed that as Democrats move into the minority, “the onus will be on Republicans” to come to the table and negotiate with them in a serious way. Asked about potential deal-breakers, Smith declined to discuss specific provisions in the abstract, saying she would wait to see complete proposals.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Smith&#8217;s view captured the movement&#8217;s current predicament: “We have been saying for several years after <em>Dobbs</em> that the way to protect people&#8217;s access to abortion is to win elections for people who are willing to protect those rights. And that didn&#8217;t happen, so there is no magic solution here.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Democratic Party struggled in the 2024 elections, losing control of the Senate and the presidency, and failing to regain the House. The party is still assessing what went wrong in those defeats — but one bright spot is in southwestern Washington, where Democratic Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez pulled out a win in Trump country for the second election in a row.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2024, Gluesenkamp Perez, a moderate Democrat and member of the House’s <a href="https://www.dems.gov/coalitions-caucuses-task-forces/blue-dog-coalition">Blue Dog Coalition</a>, defeated her 2022 opponent in a rematch and widened her margin of victory in the process. She credits her win to her working-class, rural roots and authentic connection to her home district, as well as a focus on issues with bipartisan support, such as <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/7/3/18761691/right-to-repair-computers-phones-car-mechanics-apple">“right to repair” laws</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gluesenkamp Perez and her husband live in unincorporated Skamania County, a wooded region with a population of about 12,000. She co-owns an auto repair and machine shop with her husband, Dean, which he still runs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gluesenkamp Perez sat down with <em>Today, Explained</em> to discuss her win, where she thinks her party went wrong, and what she hopes to focus on in the next Congress. Below is an excerpt of our conversation, edited for length and clarity. There’s much more in the full podcast, so listen to <em>Today, Explained</em> on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/today-explained/id1346207297">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3pXx5SXzXwJxnf4A5pWN2A">Spotify</a>, or <a href="https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1319-today-explained-87205166/">wherever you get your podcasts</a>.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tell me a bit more about yourself.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Marie Gluesenkamp Perez</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I live in a really rural part of a rural county. We get our internet from a radio tower. We get our water from a well. <a href="https://gluesenkampperez.house.gov/about">My family&#8217;s been in Washington state for generations</a>. My dad immigrated here from Mexico and met my mom at Western Washington University. I&#8217;m just incredibly honored to have a heritage of people who believe in making things that last and who understand the value and the necessity of what we have in Washington state and southwest Washington and a loyalty to a place that is so necessary, and that we&#8217;re increasingly alienated from culturally.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What inspired you to go into politics?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Marie Gluesenkamp Perez</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I was not inspired by politics. My predecessor was one of the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump. And I knew everybody that had her yard signs up like clockwork. And they started putting up this guy Joe Kent&#8217;s yard signs. And I started watching his YouTube and was like, “This guy&#8217;s got good hair and bad ideas.” I remember watching a Republican primary candidate forum on YouTube and somebody asked all of the candidates to name just three lakes in southwest Washington, and he couldn&#8217;t do it. If you&#8217;re not doing this because what we have is precious and worth fighting for, why are you doing it? Having a political agenda imported from somewhere else that is so far from our values and our community and our priorities…</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Let&#8217;s talk about the place. Washington&#8217;s Third is a swing district. It was held by a Republican for 12 years before you won in 2022. Donald Trump backed your opponent, Joe Kent, in a big way. Why do you think you won?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Marie Gluesenkamp Perez</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What we want in southwest Washington is to see our priorities and our culture reflected in Washington, DC. We don&#8217;t want a national agenda or a culture from somewhere else, imported and replacing our community, our values, our priorities. And so just a real focus on what my community needs, what our values are, who we are. You know, the district went for Trump by 7 points in 2016. And last time I won by two votes in each precinct. And this time we were able to point to my record. I&#8217;m in the top 3 percent of most bipartisan voting members of the US House and I&#8217;m not here to play partisan football. I&#8217;m here because I see and value what we have, and I know it&#8217;s worth fighting for. I&#8217;ve never felt entitled to people&#8217;s votes. I&#8217;m not here for an agenda from a think tank somewhere. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Why do you think bipartisanship played so well back in Washington Third District? What were you pointing to exactly?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Marie Gluesenkamp Perez</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I was talking to the director of one of our largest labor and delivery wards, and she told me that right now 40 percent of the babies born in her hospital have at least one parent addicted to fentanyl. Forty percent — this is generational carnage and it&#8217;s everywhere. People want to stop the flow of fentanyl. I think a lot of us have felt like if this was a thing in the lives of people with more money and influence, it would have been addressed sooner.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And so [you’re talking about] immigration, right?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Marie Gluesenkamp Perez</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We&#8217;re talking about border security. For so long they&#8217;ve been married, but together there&#8217;s two issues: immigration and border security. And we&#8217;re saying we cannot wait for a perfect immigration policy to have a secure border to stop the flow of fentanyl. And so that was a big point for me.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You know, on the student student loan forgiveness, I looked at the data. My district only holds 3 percent of the federally issued debt. This was a regressive tax policy. If you support progressive tax strategies, you should do that consistently, not just when there&#8217;s party favors. And I had people protest our auto shop.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Just to clarify, you voted against President Biden’s student debt relief. People looked at you and said, “You’re a Democrat, how dare you?” Talk to me about how that affected you back home.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Marie Gluesenkamp Perez</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They were really aggressive on our online reviews. We take real pride in the quality of work we do. People were just bombing it who’d never been customers. But I was hearing from my community, “We don&#8217;t want the trades to be considered an afterthought. We don&#8217;t want to be second fiddle” — really challenging the idea that academic intelligence is the thing that we should be supporting. We want a level playing field for the trades, for all of the forms of intelligence. We want good jobs that don&#8217;t require a college degree. We want honors-level shop class in junior high. Those are the things that reflect our values and our priorities. And so that&#8217;s how I vote. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is where the pushback comes in, when you&#8217;re in national office and you vote on something that affects everybody in the country. Not many people in your district ended up in a lot of college debt. But all across the United States, many, many, many young people did. You&#8217;re in national office. You don&#8217;t just vote for this little corner of Washington because your vote — as one of 435 — affects the whole country. How do you respond to that? </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Marie Gluesenkamp Perez</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">My job is to represent my community. And I think the way that you arrive at good policy is by having everyone show up at the table with the unique perspectives of their community and loyalty there. And that is how you end up with better policy in the end. You don&#8217;t get good legislation without having people who are driving trucks and changing diapers and turning wrenches at the table — not as an afterthought, but in the inception of the legislation. There are ways that that proposal could have been much more progressive. You know, things like Pell Grants or focusing on the bigger, systemic issue of why college tuition has increased 481 percent since I was born. That&#8217;s the systemic solution that I think we need to be considering and evaluating, like how are we going to provide a level playing field for everyone? </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Let&#8217;s talk nationally. There’s another two years to look forward to, in which Democrats will be in the minority in both the House and the Senate. They lost the presidency. How do you think the party moves forward? People are looking at you as the face of a new kind of Democratic politics. Whether you like that or not, people say, “We should look at this gal because she seems to be saying something. She won in a Trump district. She seems to be saying something that people who voted for Donald Trump can get behind.” Where do the Democrats go?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Marie Gluesenkamp Perez</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, again, look, I&#8217;m not a strategist, but I think 90 percent of Americans agree about 90 percent of the issues. And they have found the 10 things we disagree about to drive a stake through the heart of our community.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Like what?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Marie Gluesenkamp Perez</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pick anything. Anything that&#8217;s in the national ads and instead, say, it is not partisan to want to be able to fix your own car; “right to repair” laws are not partisan; wanting to own a home, not partisan. One of the things I really love about living where I live — we don&#8217;t have trash service. So every six weeks, we go to the dump and take our stuff, and so you have to see everything you bought. There is nowhere else, right? You should have to see all of the tiny little yogurt cups you bought, and have accountability, and not have an idea of the woods as a terrarium or as something that&#8217;s just a recreational asset, but as something that is living, breathing and relevant. I think we&#8217;re consuming like half the lumber per capita that we were in the ’70s. And the reality is a lot of that has been replaced by petroleum-based products. By thinking about things in this hyper-local way, by seeing the trash that you bought, you are able to arrive at a better national and global solution. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Do you think that&#8217;s what Republicans did in 2024? Because whether you support Donald Trump or you’re a critic of his, one thing that you can say he successfully did is he turned local issues national. Springfield, Ohio, was struggling with an influx of immigrants. There is no reason that somebody in Maine or Florida or Texas should have cared at all about Springfield, Ohio. That was a local issue. Donald Trump took that little local issue, made it a national issue. Some analysts say that is what helped him win. It seems counter to what you&#8217;re saying, which is that a local issue is a local issue, and we shouldn&#8217;t make it national because it won&#8217;t let us win.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Marie Gluesenkamp Perez</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">People want to be heard. I had a lot of people, colleagues, saying, “How do we get people to understand that the economy&#8217;s actually great?”</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This was a Democratic line.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Marie Gluesenkamp Perez</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Don&#8217;t do that. People are putting their groceries on a credit card. You go to Albertsons or whatever, your grocery store, and you feel like you&#8217;re in a game of chicken with the CEO. Nobody cares about your spreadsheets. I don&#8217;t know that any political party is doing this very well. But I think there&#8217;s a lot of work to be done on conveying cultural respect and regard for the people that are building our country, that are growing our food, that are keeping the wheels on the bus and conveying that respect sincerely and thinking and listening with curiosity. That is how we get our country back, how we build community again. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We are all very lonely and feeling isolated. Some people think it&#8217;s their civic duty to unfriend somebody on Facebook [over how they voted] — that is such an impoverished view of the world. It&#8217;s isolating, and it&#8217;s lonely. I think getting back to a place where we are finding nonpolitical ways of conveying our values — that&#8217;s progress, that is how you grow the field of people who feel real, that is how you build a coalition that can actually pass useful legislation. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Do you think there&#8217;s a kind of snobbery within the Democratic Party where maybe the heroes that the party is choosing are the wrong heroes?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Marie Gluesenkamp Perez</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It feels like everybody [in Washington, DC] is under 40 and has at least two degrees. And, you know, that&#8217;s not what the country looks like. That&#8217;s not what the value system is everywhere. There are fewer than five members of Congress who actually have a child in day care. That&#8217;s why there&#8217;s not a sense of urgency around the affordability crisis. I was talking to a constituent. She works in child care. She told me she is not legally allowed to peel a banana or an orange, [because] that is considered food prep. They are not a licensed food prep facility. So they can open a bag of chips [but] can&#8217;t peel a banana. And I went round and round and round for like four months and I had my office talking to local regulators and licensors and elected officials. And they kept saying, “She&#8217;s dumb, she doesn&#8217;t understand the rules.” </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Does she understand the rules?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Marie Gluesenkamp Perez</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes. Their licensors said they would need six more sinks before they were legally allowed to be engaged in food prep. And I don&#8217;t think this is a small thing. I have a toddler. I know how durable food preferences are. So I introduced a bill that creates a positive right to serve fresh fruits and vegetables. It says, if your state is taking federal dollars for child care, you will not infringe on the right to serve fresh fruits and vegetables. And this is the long work of building strong local agriculture and national health.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is also, if we&#8217;re being honest, in a tradition that more closely hews to what Republicans think. You&#8217;re pointing to overregulation and you&#8217;re saying this is ridiculous. And I can imagine Democrats saying, but what about listeria? Every time you turn on the news these days, there is listeria in something, there&#8217;s E. coli in something, you&#8217;re going to give it to the kids. How do you square the party that you&#8217;re in and the historical positions that it&#8217;s taken on things like regulation? </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Marie Gluesenkamp Perez</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s necessarily partisan. Parents know that food preferences and children are very durable, so my experience as a young mom is what&#8217;s driving that, not a partisan agenda. But I think that this is absolutely one of the reasons that there&#8217;s one licensed day care facility in my entire county. Think about the overhead of installing six different sinks. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Do you look at legislation like that legislation as something that bridges a partisan divide? The thing that you&#8217;re looking at for the next two years is Democrats either work with Republicans or get nothing done. And I&#8217;m wondering if what you&#8217;re saying here is that, if we have some compromise ideas, at least we can get some things done.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Marie Gluesenkamp Perez</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yeah, I think these issues are too urgent to be delayed. We have got to find some common ground here to work and deliver value to our communities. And so I think there&#8217;s a lot of work that can be done that is not partisan. That&#8217;s good for the country.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fifty years ago, policymakers worried that welfare benefits were encouraging too many births outside of marriage. Today, some conservatives are making nearly the opposite argument: that government assistance programs are contributing to too few births by penalizing marriage.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&#8220;Congress should seize the opportunity to eliminate the greatest injustice in the federal income tax code: marriage penalties,&#8221; Jamie Bryan Hall, director of data analysis at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, wrote <a href="https://eppc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Tax-Teams-Comment-on-Working-Families.pdf">in a letter to a House committee in October</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the last several years, leaders have wrung their hands over two demographic trends. Marriage rates in the US have declined dramatically — they’re the focus of recent books like <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/T/bo205550079.html"><em>The Two-Parent Privilege</em></a> by economist Melissa Kearney and <a href="https://ifstudies.org/brad-wilcox"><em>Get Married</em></a> by Brad Wilcox, of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia. Meanwhile, fertility has hit record lows, prompting growing concern about demographic decline and spawning an emerging &#8220;pronatalist&#8221; movement that sees shrinking birth rates as an existential threat.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But conversations about these trends have largely remained separate. Marriage researchers tend to focus on relationship formation, family stability, and child outcomes. Pronatalists concentrate on the reasons for delaying or forgoing child birth, and the consequences that may bring. Lately though, more conservatives have argued that marriage penalties in the tax code connect these two issues — and fixing these penalties could help boost the population. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The argument has particular appeal on the right: Fiscal conservatives generally favor reforming existing policies over creating costly new programs, while social conservatives view ending marriage penalties as supporting both wedlock and childbearing. But like the welfare debates of the past, it raises empirical questions about whether benefits actually influence family formation decisions, as well as broader ethical considerations about the government&#8217;s role in shaping personal choices.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The math on marriage</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The statistical case for connecting marriage and fertility appears relatively straightforward at first. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr73/nvsr73-02.pdf">Married women have significantly higher birth rates</a> than unmarried women, and while both groups have had fewer children in recent decades, married birth rates have declined much less. Ergo, marriage penalty critics argue that policies discouraging marriage — by pushing families above subsidy thresholds or into higher tax brackets — may indirectly suppress birth rates.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Take the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/10/3/20895338/earned-income-tax-credit-2019-henrik-kleven">Earned Income Tax Credit</a>, designed to help low-income workers. When two working people marry, their combined income can push them above eligibility thresholds or reduce their benefits. Similar <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ofa/hmrf_marriagepenalties_paper_final50812_6_19.pdf">marriage penalties exist</a> in other means-tested programs like Medicaid and housing assistance. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These penalties were not intentionally designed to disadvantage married couples, but emerged from efforts to target benefits to the neediest while treating similar households fairly. Still, as a result, &#8220;if the typical single mom marries a typical working man, they will lose their means-tested government benefits,&#8221; Hall explained.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some policies, like the <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23056876/expanded-child-tax-credit-poverty-american-families-impact">child tax credit</a>, largely avoid this problem by setting income thresholds high enough that most married couples keep their benefits. Food stamps take a different approach — treating <a href="https://thefga.org/research/married-to-a-myth-debunking-marriage-penalty-food-stamps/">all households the same</a> whether couples are married or just living together.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While research is mixed on how well people understand these various penalties, there is some evidence they influence behavior. An <a href="https://csed.byu.edu/0000017e-2634-db2d-a1ff-6e7c6f290001/american-family-landscape-topline-final-pdf">American Family Survey from 2015 </a>reported that 31 percent of Americans said they know someone who did not marry for welfare-related reasons. A more recent survey from the Sutherland Institute in Utah found that 10 percent of safety net program recipients <a href="https://sutherlandinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Strengthening_the_American_Dream.pdf">reported deciding not to marry to avoid losing benefits</a>. A 2022 analysis from the <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w30159/w30159.pdf">National Bureau of Economic Research estimated</a> that, without marriage penalties, 13.7 percent more low-income single mothers would marry each year, and 7.5 percent more would be married by age 35. The study suggests these women typically do marry, but penalties might delay tying the knot.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Testing the theory</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of the strongest evidence for the marriage-fertility connection comes from European programs in the 1970s and 1980s. Studies of <a href="https://docs.iza.org/dp6704.pdf">policy experiments in Austria</a> that involved cash payments to married couples and in <a href="https://su.figshare.com/articles/preprint/_Does_Marriage_Matter_Revisited_The_stability_fertility_and_mortality_of_the_Swedish_1989_Marriage_Boom_cohort/5580166?file=9703294">Sweden</a> with broader access to widow pensions revealed how government incentives could influence marriage rates and subsequent fertility patterns.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The subsidies proved successful at getting couples who might otherwise have postponed or forgone marriage to make it official. Importantly, these &#8220;incentivized&#8221; marriages were roughly as stable as unsubsidized ones, suggesting that policy was able to influence timing for couples already oriented toward commitment. As Lyman Stone, a conservative pronatalist demographer, <a href="https://x.com/lymanstoneky/status/1853471993091265013">put it</a>, &#8220;Turns out people just need a nudge to say &#8216;yes&#8217; to the person they&#8217;re probably gonna marry anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The fertility effects were nuanced. While marriages influenced by government subsidies had lower fertility rates than traditional, unsubsidized marriages, they still saw significantly higher birth rates than unmarried couples.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But these European examples stand in contrast to American experience, where US programs aimed at promoting marriage have historically <a href="https://www.mdrc.org/work/publications/family-strengthening-program-low-income-families">shown little</a> <a href="https://www.bgsu.edu/content/dam/BGSU/college-of-arts-and-sciences/NCFMR/documents/FP/FP-14-02_HMIInitiative.pdf">success</a>. And even if policymakers could effectively encourage more marriage, the relationship between marriage and fertility isn&#8217;t straightforward everywhere. India has maintained nearly universal marriage rates, even as fertility rates have sharply declined. Dean Spears, the director of the Population Wellbeing Initiative at the University of Texas at Austin, notes that India&#8217;s marriage age has also remained relatively stable, with birth rates shrinking even among women who marry before age 25.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Spears is far more skeptical that we can <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/2/26/21154466/research-education-behavior-psychology-nudging">“nudge” people into getting married</a>, and suggests we might be confusing cause and effect entirely. In an interview with Vox, he compared it to mistaking reduced exercise as a cause rather than a symptom of poor health. Both declining marriage and fertility rates might instead be responding to deeper social and economic shifts — from rising opportunity costs for mothers to shifting beliefs about family life.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Alice Evans, a gender inequality scholar at King’s College London, studies how <a href="https://www.ggd.world/p/why-is-fertility-collapsing-globally">economic independence and reduced stigma around being single</a> have transformed modern relationships. Her research shows people have become more selective about romantic partners, with some choosing to stay uncoupled if compatible partners prove elusive. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Evans believes we need better research not only on how modern life — such as social media and video games — affects relationship formation, but also on how marriage and marriage-related policies affect decisions to have children.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The price of reform</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Conservatives see marriage penalty reform as a practical path forward, even though there isn&#8217;t decisive research showing that it would significantly affect marriage rates, let alone fertility.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The proposal appeals partly because it could advance multiple goals at once. For those already wanting to see more marriage and childbearing on cultural and religious grounds, fixing the penalties offers a way to promote both. That it appears less expensive than creating new programs like universal child care makes it doubly attractive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The political challenges, however, are still substantial. Conservative economist Robert Cherry, who has worked on marriage penalty proposals for two decades, told Vox that truly eliminating these penalties could cost between $100 billion to $150 billion. More modest reforms to reduce but not entirely eliminate marriage penalties might still cost upward of $40 billion, he said. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some progressive policy experts see a solution that lies in deprioritizing traditional family structure. Matt Bruenig, founder of the left-wing People’s Policy Project, argues the technical fix is to just tax everyone on their personal income rather than using household income. While he supports eliminating marriage penalties to keep things fair for everyone, he&#8217;s skeptical they play a major role in declining birth rates.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps more fundamentally, there&#8217;s been little evidence of political will to address these penalties. When Republican lawmakers first considered proposals for the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), they explored eliminating the head of household filing status, another benefit that carries significant penalties for married couples. But the prospect of <a href="https://taxpolicycenter.org/publications/families-facing-tax-increases-under-trumps-tax-plan-0">making some single mothers worse off</a> proved too unpalatable for lawmakers to move forward with the idea.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The political landscape may shift as lawmakers prepare to revisit the expiring TCJA next year. Donald Trump ran for president on boosting birth rates, and has already elevated prominent pronatalists like Elon Musk into his new administration. His incoming vice president, JD Vance, has also placed falling fertility rates high on the conservative agenda.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pronatalism gaining influence in conservative politics could lead not only to removing existing marriage penalties but also to actively incentivizing marriage through new subsidies, as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/hungary-government-scheme-sparks-marriage-boom-will-babies-follow-idUSKBN1Y01X8/">Hungary did</a>. Any policy response will need to address not only billion-dollar price tags but also deeper questions about whether the government should, or even can, try to steer such personal decisions in modern America.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Editor’s note: </em></strong><em>This story was originally published on November 22, 2023, and reflects events that took place that year. We’re republishing it in its original form this week in advance of Thanksgiving.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Late into the night on November 2, a few <a data-source="encore" href="https://www.vox.com/animal-welfare">animal rights</a> activists opened an unlocked barn door and stepped foot into a sea of turkeys living in gruesome conditions. It was one of several barns at a sprawling factory farming operation in Owatonna, Minnesota, that raises turkeys for Jennie-O, the country’s second-largest turkey producer and <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2023/11/17/minnesota-turkeys-headed-to-white-house-for-presidential-pardon">this year’s supplier</a> to the annual White House turkey pardon ceremony.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8HvoxdpQQ">documented</a> a lot of really horrific health issues,” activist Kecia Doolittle, one of the investigators, told Vox. “It was about as bad as you can imagine.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>They found numerous turkeys who were dead and rotting, Doolittle said, and many who had trouble walking. There were also live birds pecking at dead birds, and dozens of birds with visible wounds — each a <a href="https://extension.psu.edu/poultry-cannibalism-prevention-and-treatment">sign of cannibalism</a>, a <a href="https://www.merckvetmanual.com/poultry/miscellaneous-conditions-of-poultry/cannibalism-in-poultry">persistent problem</a> in turkey farming.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube alignnone"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>

<p>Doolittle also alleges there were a number of turkeys who were immobilized and unable to access food and water. In a letter to Steele County’s attorney and local law enforcement, Bonnie Klapper — a former assistant US attorney advising Doolittle — said the conditions are a violation of <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/343.21">Minnesota’s animal cruelty law</a>, which stipulates that “No person shall deprive any animal over which the person has charge or control of necessary food, water, or shelter.” (Minnesota is <a href="https://www.animallaw.info/article/state-animal-anti-cruelty-statutes-overview-0#:~:text=Minnesota%2C%20Mississippi%2C%20and%20Oklahoma%20do,to%20their%20animal%20cruelty%20laws.">one of the few</a> states that don’t <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/3/9/22967328/animal-cruelty-laws-state-federal-exemptions-pennsylvania-martin-farms-dairy-calves-dehorning">exempt</a> agricultural practices from their animal cruelty statute.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It smelled terrible,” Doolittle said. The air made her throat burn, likely due to high ammonia levels from the turkeys’ waste, which gives the birds <a href="https://www.poultryworld.net/poultry/harmful-effects-of-ammonia-on-birds/">eye and respiratory issues</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The activists found a sign on the property that read, “Jennie-O Turkey Store cares about turkeys — you should, too!”</p>

<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-1 wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"><img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25102640/IMG_8732.JPG?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="A sign inside the Jennie-O turkey facility, which reads “Jennie-O Turkey Store cares about turkeys — you should, too!”" title="A sign inside the Jennie-O turkey facility, which reads “Jennie-O Turkey Store cares about turkeys — you should, too!”" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A sign inside the Jennie-O turkey facility. | Courtesy of Kecia Doolittle" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Kecia Doolittle" />

<p>“Jennie-O Turkey Store takes the welfare of the animals under our care seriously and has robust animal care standards throughout our supply chain,” a spokesperson from Hormel Foods, Jennie-O’s parent company, told Vox via email. “We conduct routine audits at our facilities to ensure that our standards are being met with animal-handling practices and policies set forth by the National Turkey Federation and the American Veterinary Medical Association.”</p>

<p>Doolittle rescued two of the birds — whom she later named Gabriel and Gilbert — and took them to veterinarians in Wisconsin, who urged her to euthanize Gilbert. “They both had really severe infections, they both had parasites,” Doolittle said, but Gilbert was in especially bad shape, with a wound under his wing, an infection on his face, and pecking wounds on part of his genitalia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But Doolittle wanted to give him a chance to recover. Both birds were treated and given a combination of antibiotic, pain relief, and antiparasitic drugs; Gabriel is on the mend, while Gilbert’s condition remains touch and go.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sherstin Rosenberg, a veterinarian in California and executive director of a <a href="https://www.happyhen.org/">sanctuary for rescued poultry birds</a>, wrote in a veterinary opinion that Gabriel and Gilbert’s condition “suggests serious animal welfare problems” in Jennie-O’s facility.</p>

<p>The findings, while disturbing, are common across the turkey industry. Numerous animal welfare groups have <a href="https://support.peta.org/page/1867/petition/1?locale=en-US">found</a> similar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5LM06ZvCk4">conditions</a> at <a href="https://pardonaturkey.com/?utm_campaign=20231101spare-a-turkey-herodevelopment&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=insert-website&amp;utm_content=hero-image&amp;utm_term=&amp;_ga=2.198248108.2045868908.1700598426-694279810.1688662591#video">operations</a> run by Jennie-O’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBmVvzVpXqw">competitors</a> — even the ones that brand themselves as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jvjqO9I9LI">more humane</a>. That’s because turkey farming is incredibly uniform, with companies using generally the same practices and the same breed — the Broad Breasted White turkey — that’s been bred without regard for their suffering.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How the poultry industry broke the turkey</h2>

<p>Like everything else in the US — <a href="https://www.vox.com/videos/2023/7/25/23807518/cars-suvs-americans-big-automobiles-travel">cars</a>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/09/american-houses-big/597811/">homes</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/small-cruises-surprising-advantages-over-mega-ships-2023-10">cruise ships</a> — the turkey has become supersized.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25102307/BE1tR_turkeys_have_nearly_doubled_in_size_since_1960__1_.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,11.356270256794,100,77.287459486412" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p>The poultry industry has made turkeys so big primarily through <a href="https://www.thepoultrysite.com/news/2008/11/why-did-turkeys-grow-so-big">selective breeding</a>. The Broad Breasted White turkey, which accounts for <a href="https://www.psu.edu/news/research/story/probing-question-what-heritage-turkey/">99 out of every 100 grocery store turkeys</a>, has been bred to emphasize — you guessed it — the breast, one of the more valuable parts of the bird. These birds grow <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/11/turkeys-are-twice-as-big-as-they-were-in-1960/546104/">twice as fast</a> and become nearly twice as big as they did in the 1960s. Being so top-heavy, combined with <a href="https://www.thepoultrysite.com/articles/predisposing-factors-that-affect-walking-ability-in-turkeys-and-broilers">other health issues</a> caused by rapid growth and the unsanitary factory farming environment, can make it difficult for them to walk.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25102305/AnnieNg_Vox_ThanksgivingTurkey_V1.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4613147178592,100,93.077370564282" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Turkeys have been bred to grow twice as fast and become nearly twice as big as they did in the 1960s. | Annie Ng for Vox" data-portal-copyright="Annie Ng for Vox" />
<p>Another problem arises from their giant breasts: The males get so big that they can’t mount the hens, so they must be bred artificially.</p>

<p>Author Jim Mason detailed this practice in his book <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/593428/the-ethics-of-what-we-eat-by-peter-singer-author-of-animal-liberation-and-jim-mason/"><em>The Ethics of What We Eat</em></a>, co-authored with philosopher Peter Singer. Mason took a job with the turkey giant Butterball to research the book, where, <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Ethics_of_What_We_Eat/fRtZDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=turkey+inseminator&amp;pg=PA28&amp;printsec=frontcover">he wrote</a>, he had to hold male turkeys while another worker stimulated them to extract their semen into a syringe using a vacuum pump. Once the syringe was full, it was taken to the henhouse, where Mason would pin hens chest-down while another worker <a href="https://animaloutlook.org/investigations/hargin/">inserted the contents</a> of the syringe into the hen using an air compressor.</p>

<p>Workers at the farm had to do this to one hen every 12 seconds for 10 hours a day. It was “the hardest, fastest, dirtiest, most disgusting, worst-paid work” he had ever done, Mason wrote.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25102748/IMG_7570.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,26.626776364996,100,46.746447270007" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Wren was rescued from a factory farm and now lives at Poplar Spring Animal Sanctuary in Poolesville, Maryland. She must be carted around because she has difficulty walking. | Amruza Birdie" data-portal-copyright="Amruza Birdie" />
<p>In stressful, crowded environments, turkeys can be aggressive and peck one another, and even commit <a href="https://www.merckvetmanual.com/poultry/miscellaneous-conditions-of-poultry/cannibalism-in-poultry">cannibalism</a>. Instead of giving turkeys more space and better conditions, producers mutilate them to minimize the damage. They cut off a <a href="https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/resources/beak_trimming_bgnd.pdf#:~:text=Beak%2Dtrimming%20is%20currently%20considered,and%20physiologic%20stress%20in%20birds.">quarter to a third</a> of their beaks, part of their <a href="https://poultry.extension.org/articles/poultry-behavior/toe-trimming-of-turkeys/">toes</a>, and their <a href="https://vetext.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/sites/g/files/dgvnsk5616/files/local_resources/pdfs/pdfs_animal_welfare/turkeyCarePrax.pdf">snoods</a> — those fleshy protuberances that hang over their beaks — all without pain relief.</p>

<p>Turkeys are <a href="https://awionline.org/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/FA-AWI-LegalProtections-AnimalsonFarms-110714.pdf">excluded</a> from federal laws meant to reduce animal suffering during transport to the slaughterhouse and during slaughter itself, so you can imagine — or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRPROLLXu6I">see for yourself</a> — how terribly they’re treated in their final hours. According to the nonprofit Animal Welfare Institute, the Jennie-O slaughter plant near the farm Doolittle investigated was cited <a href="https://awionline.org/sites/default/files/publication/digital_download/20TheWelfareBirdsSlaughter.pdf">nine times</a> in 2018 by the US Department of Agriculture for turkeys who’d been mutilated by malfunctioning equipment.</p>

<p>Strangely, despite the horrific reality of turkey farming, we still use the animal as a symbol of giving thanks. Nowhere does the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/11/20/1213891148/turkey-pardoning-white-house-biden-thanksgiving">song and dance</a> of celebrating turkeys while we torture them feel more disconcerting than at the White House’s annual turkey pardon.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The mixed message of the White House turkey pardon</h2>

<p>Every Thanksgiving, the US president “pardons” a turkey or two in what is essentially a PR stunt for the turkey industry, as the birds are <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/4319835-five-fun-facts-about-the-annual-turkey-pardon/#:~:text=The%20National%20Turkey%20Federation%20chairman,House%20to%20present%20the%20turkeys.">selected</a> by the chair of the National Turkey Federation, an industry trade association. This year, that was Steve Lykken, president of Jennie-O.</p>

<p>The two turkeys selected for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc58Z7qDPmI&amp;t=">this year’s pardon</a> — named Liberty and Bell — could have ended up among the <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/today-turkey-traditions-explained-many-170000619.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGozOb9YAIDI5xHJZS9CAHyZWKUFEfoBKTTTvH9G1HV9gkaUzO5yE5-YsGPxCPo66WzWX_qP78-BRkHkrkqhfEyXR3WCJiIEY3YmSgWmOlicInNxvkkpQOQbFiDPe2suRZ_cbCPLgK9QZb9PKAKnCTrer3Oja-M3rliDUifW90Tz">46 million or so birds</a> on Thanksgiving tables this year. Instead, they were transported from Minnesota, the country’s top turkey-producing state, to Washington, DC, in a stretch black Cadillac Escalade. “They’re on their way in a pretty lavish coach,” Lykken <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2023/11/17/minnesota-turkeys-headed-to-white-house-for-presidential-pardon">told</a> Minnesota Public Radio.</p>

<p>The annual story makes for feel-good if <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/21/us/politics/biden-thanksgiving-turkey-pardon.html">hammy</a> coverage by the nation’s largest news organizations, but it papers over the darkness of American factory farming — including not just the animal cruelty but also the <a href="https://slate.com/business/2016/11/turkey-plants-are-harsh-on-workers-in-the-weeks-before-thanksgiving.html">dangerous working conditions</a> at slaughterhouses, <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/13102021/north-carolina-commercial-poultry-farms-justice-communities-of-color/">environmental pollution</a>, and <a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/state/north-carolina/article267895632.html">unfair treatment</a> of turkey contract farmers.</p>

<p>The White House did not respond to a request for comment about the Jennie-O investigation video.</p>

<p>This year, industry is <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2023/11/17/minnesota-turkeys-headed-to-white-house-for-presidential-pardon">especially</a> looking forward to the pardon amid the devastating bird flu. The disease, which has been resurging this fall, has resulted in the killing of <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-2022/2022-hpai-commercial-backyard-flocks">11.5 million</a> potentially infected turkeys since early 2022. Increasingly, producers are killing the birds in the most brutal fashion imaginable, deploying a method called “ventilation shutdown plus” that <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23963820/bird-flu-surge-us-ventilation-shutdown-veterinarians">uses</a> industrial heaters to kill them via heatstroke over the course of hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“To have something that’s fun, that can draw positive attention to our industry, is very welcomed” in light of the outbreak, Ashley Kohls, executive director of the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association, <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2023/11/17/minnesota-turkeys-headed-to-white-house-for-presidential-pardon">told</a> Minnesota Public Radio about this year’s pardon.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.startribune.com/president-biden-pardons-minnesota-raised-turkeys-annual-white-house-thanksgiving-tradition-jennie-o/600321201/">This week</a>, Liberty and Bell will be moved to the University of Minnesota to live out the rest of their lives. If the turkeys knew what went on there, they might not want to go: The university <a href="https://www.startribune.com/turkeys-minnesota-rank-number-one-producer/600320510/">helped build</a> the state’s turkey industry and still <a href="https://maes.umn.edu/poultry-research">conducts research</a> on turkeys to ensure the industry’s <a href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/news-events/keeping-minnesota-poultry-safe-and-successful">success</a>. The university’s <a href="https://president.umn.edu/about">interim president</a> formerly served as the president of Jennie-O and the CEO of Hormel, its parent company.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Doolittle’s pardoned turkeys, Gabriel and Gilbert, assuming both survive, will spend the rest of their lives at an animal sanctuary, showing humans what these birds can be like when allowed to live on their own terms. “They’re just the most curious, loving, intelligent guys,” Doolittle said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>This story is the final feature in a Vox special project, </em><a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/372001/changing-with-our-climate">Changing With Our Climate</a><em>, a limited-run series exploring Indigenous solutions to extreme weather rooted in history — and the future.</em></p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">On a freezing January morning in 1863, American soldiers attacked a Northwestern Shoshone camp along the Bear River in what is now Idaho and slaughtered hundreds of Shoshone people in what is most likely the largest massacre of Native people in the US on a single day. The massacre was horrifically brutal. “[The soldiers] would grab the small children by their braids and crush their heads and bodies into the frozen ground,” Rios Pacheco, a Shoshone tribal elder, said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pacheco told me that, for generations, Shoshone people passed down stories about some parents being forced to let their babies float down the river that day so that their crying would not alert the soldiers to where a group was hiding along the riverbank.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After losing their territory over the course of decades to Western expansion and violence, the tribe went generations without collectively owned land.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But in 2018, more than 150 years later, the Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation bought back over 500 acres of land at the site of the Bear River Massacre.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since European colonization, Indigenous nations across North America have <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/native-tribes-have-lost-99-their-land-united-states">lost nearly 99 percent</a> of their land. That seizure of Native territory and the development of American industry led to a devastating loss of life, culture, and community. It also set humanity on a course that was harmful to the environment. Western development has led to habitat and biodiversity loss and fueled climate change, spurring more extreme weather, such as drought, wildfire, and floods that have grown worse and more frequent.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Bear River land purchase was part of a growing movement, generally referred to as Land Back, that’s empowering Native people to address generational trauma and restore landscape health.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent years, hundreds of thousands of acres of ancestral territories have been returned to tribes. The movement is part of a larger reckoning, too: Last year, the US government concluded its <a href="https://www.doi.gov/buybackprogram">Land Buy-Back Program for Tribal Nations</a>, a decade-long effort to acknowledge historical wrongs and return land to tribal ownership. Over the course of the program, <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/three-million-acres-land-returned-tribes-through-interior-departments-land-buy-back">nearly 3 million acres</a> in 15 states were consolidated and restored to tribal trust ownership.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Land Back success stories often come with splashy announcements, but what tribes do afterward isn’t as well-publicized. And it’s in these often overlooked stories that tribes are doing work that doesn’t just help heal the injustice they suffered, but creates meaningful steps to adapt to climate change and build a more resilient environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation plans to embark on an ambitious restoration project at the massacre site, which they call Wuda Ogwa. The project will help make the area more climate resilient through the planting of native trees and the restoration of a wetland complex, which will add an estimated 10,000 acre-feet of water or more to the Great Salt Lake, which is disappearing because of extreme heat and drought.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After the Shoshone were displaced from the land, the massacre site was looted, and in the following years, the site was used by settlers for everything from cattle grazing and farming to a railroad and a failed resort. During the Great Depression, Russian olive trees were planted to help reduce soil erosion, but those trees are now considered an invasive species that sucks up water.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the years, this all took its toll on the land. It also reduced one of the key water sources that feeds the Great Salt Lake. Now, drought is making the situation worse.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As they work to overcome years of oppression and violence, the Northwestern Shoshone are also focused on healing the land. “We’re going to start to use that land as a place to regenerate not just the Earth, but also the people,” Pacheco said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Indigenous communities, land has never been about simple ownership, but instead is about building a deep, complex relationship with the land. Now, as they begin to reclaim more and more ancestral territory, tribes are demonstrating that Indigenous communities can lead the way on climate adaptation through creative partnerships and ambitious restoration projects.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of this means that Land Back is not only an important cultural story, it could also prove to be a key part in the fight to build climate resilience.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What is the Land Back movement?</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although Indigenous people have been fighting for and regaining their seized land for hundreds of years, the modern concept of Land Back, sometimes backed by social media campaigns and well-heeled nonprofit groups, has only emerged more recently. The #LandBack hashtag, in particular, has found its own cultural niche thanks to moments like the viral social media posts shared by groups like the <a href="https://ndncollective.org/landback/">NDN Collective</a> or influencers like Blackfoot meme creator Arnell Tailfeathers from Manitoba.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Throughout the 20th century, many tribes steadily built up the funds to buy back their land. In the <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2023-3-fall/feature/land-back-movement-unravels-manifest-destiny">21st century alone</a>, dozens of tribes and Indigenous organizations have reclaimed tracts of land that total hundreds of thousands of acres across the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Increasingly, tribes are finding new allies in conservation and environmental spaces, who recognize the positive impact that tribal land stewardship can have on the environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Land Back can come about in different ways. Sometimes, tribes are able to directly buy back land with their own funds, as the <a href="https://modernfarmer.com/2023/10/tribes-buying-farmland/">Winnebago Tribe in Nebraska</a> did. A nonprofit group can buy land for a tribe before donating it back to them, as the Trust for Public Land is doing with 30,000 acres it is returning to the <a href="https://themainemonitor.org/penobscot-nation-katahdin-landback/">Penobscot Nation in Maine</a>. In 2018, an <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2019/09/13/land-reparations-san-luis-ute-tribe/">individual</a> gave a couple acres of land back to the Ute Tribe just a few years after buying it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then there are more nuanced co-management situations, such as <a href="https://www.doi.gov/ocl/tribal-co-management-federal-lands#:~:text=Park%20Specific%20Tribal%20Co%2DManagement%20Agreements&amp;text=Canyon%20de%20Chelly%20National%20Monument%20is%20located%20entirely%20within%20the,to%20provide%20some%20visitor%20services.">Canyon de Chelly</a>, which is a National Monument under the purview of the federal government, with the Navajo Nation maintaining some land and mineral rights. Most tribes, however, say that full ownership with no strings attached is the best way to uphold tribal sovereignty.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jan Michael Looking Wolf Reibach is the tribal lands department manager for the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde. “I think the most complete answer for a tribe is when they can recover the lands and have sovereignty over their lands and exercise our sovereignty,” he said. “The strongest and most powerful way for the tribe to restore our connection and bring healing to the land is when it comes back into tribal ownership.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Anne Richardson is the chief of the Rappahannock Indian Tribe, whose ancestral territory is located in what is now Eastern Virginia. Richardson, who can remember her father and grandfather fighting with the state for recognition of their sovereign rights, believes that tribes are proving across the country that everyone else should have been listening to them all along. Traditional knowledge, passed down through generations, was once derided as primitive by Western scientists, but Richardson believes acceptance of that type of knowledge is finally beginning to happen. “Scientists are amazed that we had this knowledge and we never had a degree in science,” she said. “They need that traditional knowledge because our people flourished on these lands for thousands of years.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Land Back projects are a chance for the tribes to build stronger relationships with each other and the land. Along the way, water is getting cleaner and land is becoming more climate resilient, even as the political outlook in the United States looks grim for the climate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President-elect Donald Trump has promised to withdraw (again) from the Paris climate agreement, among other actions that experts say could prove disastrous for the environment. These include opening public lands for oil drilling and resource extraction, as well as rolling back environmental regulations and undoing climate-friendly federal programs like tax credits for home energy improvements.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Under these circumstances, any climate adaptation projects could prove to be invaluable mitigation against an administration that could add an <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-trump-election-win-could-add-4bn-tonnes-to-us-emissions-by-2030/">estimated 4 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions</a> by 2030.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jason Brough, a Shoshone PhD student in anthropology and environmental policy at the University of Maine who has helped to map the Wuda Ogwa site, said that tribal Land Back projects could serve as a kind of safety net against potentially harmful federal climate policies. “If Indigenous communities and their partners can have these little niches where animals and plants are safe, that could be really important to get us through these next few years [under Trump],” Brough said. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, tribal sovereignty also means that tribes could decide to use the land they regain for something other than climate projects, per se, including for <a href="https://www.vox.com/housing/355548/housing-yigby-affordable-church-apartments">housing</a> or economic development. But although there are many different Land Back projects with a variety of goals and processes, Reibach says the ultimate goal is the same: rebuilding a healthy relationship with the land and each other based on reciprocity rather than extraction. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Regardless of the project or the reason to acquire land back into tribal ownership, the process is very healing for us because it restores our connection to the land,” he said. “We view these lands as being part of us.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Why Land Back can be a climate solution</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Across the country, tribal Land Back projects are proving, acre by acre and tree by tree, that their work is benefiting the climate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Virginia, the member tribes of the Indigenous Conservation Council for the Chesapeake Bay are engaged in Land Back and restoration projects to help blunt the impact of climate change on the Chesapeake Bay, which could see more than 5 feet of sea level rise in the next century. In 2022, for example, the Rappahannock Tribe reclaimed 465 acres of land on what is called Fones Cliffs in Eastern Virginia. The tribe’s work on the land includes herring restoration, oyster restoration, and native tree planting. Much of the land was previously a large cornfield, and chemicals like phosphorus from fertilizer have degraded the water quality in the river.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Read more from Vox’s <em>Changing With Our Climate</em> series</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Indigenous communities are leading the way in climate adaptations — from living alongside rapidly melting ice to confronting rising seas and creating community support networks. In a new Vox series, we explore a myriad of solutions. You can read them all <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/372001/changing-with-our-climate">here</a>, and we recommend you start with these great stories:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/372014/shinnecock-nation-tribe-sea-rise-hamptons">This coastal tribe has a radical vision for fighting sea-level rise in the Hamptons</a></strong><br><em>Next to some of the priciest real estate in the world, the Shinnecock Nation refuses to merely retreat from its vulnerable shoreline.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/377683/colonial-solutions-to-climate-change-arent-working">Colonial solutions to climate change aren’t working</a></strong><br><em>What Indigenous knowledge could mean in the fight to curb global warming.</em></p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Two hours south, the Nansemond Indian Nation is working to reduce invasive species, protect against erosion, and restore water quality on a piece of land they acquired earlier this year that was once the site of a cement factory. Cameron Bruce, the Environmental Program Coordinator for the Nansemond Indian Nation, says he has noticed more birds and larger herds of deer on the property since the tribe began restoring it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Oregon, the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde is working to restore the Willamette Falls area, which was recently the site of a paper mill. Lindsay McClary, restoration ecologist for the tribe, is working with her team to restore stream flow, replace culverts to create fish habitats, remove invasive species, and bring back fire to the landscape. Last year, the tribe conducted a prescribed burn on one piece of land for the first time in 100 years. McClary says that the impact of Indigenous land management is particularly clear in places like the Willamette Falls site, which was previously home to a Blue Heron Paper Company mill. “We’re helping restore some areas that were flooded by someone else’s maybe less than thoughtful decisions,” she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We see time and time again, those places become productive ecologically,” Jason Brough said of Indigenous projects on reclaimed land — meaning those lands “start having benefits for not just our own communities, but for everybody.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Brough, Wuda Ogwa carries extra personal significance. One of Brough’s ancestors was shot in the chest at the Bear River Massacre but survived.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rios Pacheco says that only one or two people from most family groups survived, but the fact that those people now have many descendants is a mark of the tribe’s resilience. Despite the pain and trauma that Brough still says exists at the site, he and the tribe are looking toward making it better for the future. Brian Andrew, the project engineer, said their approach to restoration is not simply returning the site to the way it was before the massacre. “We don’t want to put exactly what was there because we want things to flourish and can survive in today’s climate and future climate scenarios,” Andrew said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In some ways, it is remarkable that just a few years after regaining such a culturally significant piece of land, the tribe is already working on a project that could benefit the entire region by adding desperately needed water to the Great Salt Lake. “That’s what’s beautiful about it,” said Maria Moncur, the tribe’s communications and public relations director. “We did it for our people, and it just so happens to help the watershed.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I know it’s a struggle,” Brough said. “I know we’ve been trying for over 500 years. But we’re at a junction right now where they get to make that choice again … between a path of living with Earth or a path of living against Earth.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In early November, the Northwestern Shoshone organized a community planting event at the Wuda Ogwa site. Over two days, hundreds of both Indigenous and non-Indigenous volunteers came to plant thousands of new trees. Tribal leaders say that this work strengthens the tribal community and the environment, but also works to improve their ties with non-Native neighbors and community members.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“What we’re doing at that massacre site is we&#8217;re paying tribute back to those victims,” George Gover, the executive director of the Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation, said. “We’re honoring them by putting water and life back into the Great Salt Lake. That’s what this project is all about: life.”</p>

<p>As a teenager, I was really serious about doing good in the world. I volunteered at my local library and as a tutor for struggling students. When an international charity came to our school and gave a presentation about starving kids overseas, I gave them all my lunch money. I was the target audience for dozens of pitches about how I, as a child, could do good in the world — from fighting climate change to ending global hunger.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, as an adult with my own kids to raise, I have profoundly mixed feelings about how all these important moral messages were taught to me and how I see them imparted to teenagers today. I think we can do better when we talk to kids about how to do good in the world<em>.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Here are some things I wish I’d been told, which would have been incredible conversations to have with my parents and equipped me better to achieve real good in the world as an adult.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Be confused openly and out loud, but also treat confusion as something that can be solved</h2>

<p>Too often, the messages I got from adults about how to do good in the world fell into one of two camps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One camp was full of excessive, yet conflicting, certainty: obsessing over <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/10/4/6901299/plastic-bags-environment">cutting out plastic bags</a> in favor of cloth reusable bags, or telling me that I <em>shouldn’t </em>get cloth ones if I was going to lose them before I’d gotten at least 50 uses out of them. I was told never to use plastic water bottles because of the chemicals, or that the <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/04/19/opinion/20090419bottle.html?_r">metal ones were even worse for the environment</a>.</p>

<p>Obviously, this can be disorienting and ultimately disillusioning. If a situation is complex, and presented to you without complexity, then when you learn the full picture it’s easy to lose confidence even in the parts that really are simple.</p>

<p>The other camp (perhaps made up of disillusioned veterans of the first camp) tended to go too far in the other direction, insisting that nothing really mattered and it was impossible to know if any organization did any good. That’s where I heard that there was no point in giving money to homeless people as they’d just waste it on drugs, and no point in pushing for political change as no one in Washington was trustworthy, and no way of telling whether overseas charities made the world a better place for the recipients. Sometimes, people telling me those things wanted me to give up entirely. Sometimes they just wanted me to “choose with your heart!” rather than trying to figure out what worked.</p>

<p>Either way, this was alienating too. What I wanted to hear was that my questions were good questions and possible to answer. We could look up what people experiencing homelessness do with money (they <a href="https://www.today.com/news/researchers-gave-homeless-people-money-study-t193940">don’t spend it all on drugs</a>) and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21728843/best-charities-donate-giving-tuesday">which international charities are best</a>. We could research issues that were interesting and important to us. One of the most essential transitions between childhood and adulthood is the transition between being a consumer of advice, knowledge, and wisdom and being a producer of those things. It can be tremendously empowering to tell a young person, “I don’t know the answer, and it might be no one knows the answer, but let’s try to learn it.” Knowledge isn’t handed down from on high; it is produced, and kids deserve to see, and be part of, that process.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Don’t use your kids as a way to deflect your own guilt, despair, or frustration — and teach them to recognize when other adults do it</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some adult climate activists in particular <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2020/02/03/eco-anxiety-is-overwhelming-kids-wheres-line-between-education-alarmism/">relate to kids in a way that can be very damaging</a>. Often, they’re frustrated our society has done so little about climate change. So they write off their own generation as hopeless and say that the only hope is the children, putting huge burdens on the shoulders of people who are just starting to figure out their own priorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Vox guide to giving</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">The holiday season is giving season. This year, Vox is exploring every element of charitable giving —&nbsp;from making the case for donating 10 percent of your income, to recommending specific charities for specific causes, to explaining what you can do to make a difference beyond donations. <a href="https://www.vox.com/charitable-giving">You can find all of our giving guide stories here</a>.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none"></p>

<p>Sometimes, kids get exaggerated messages about climate change, like that they will personally die young from climate change, which broadly isn’t true. When I see kids holding signs that say “Why should I study for a future I won’t have?” I don’t feel inspired by their conviction; I feel frustrated that someone, probably someone grappling with their own guilt and anxiety about climate change, told children that there’s no future. This is not a good way to inspire them to fight for it or a fair way to enable them to set their own priorities.</p>

<p>Needless to say, not only is there a future, but studying is one of the best ways for a child to be positioned to tackle climate change. It’s seriously wronging kids to discourage them from the very paths that will let them make a difference in the world by telling them there’s no world to make a difference in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We all have our moments of despair and hopelessness, but kids aren’t equipped to take those expressions of frustration with an appropriate grain of salt. Don’t put that on them.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Take your kids’ moral convictions seriously&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Teenagers have deeply felt moral convictions. They may go vegan, become activists for a social cause, get passionately angry about issues, explore religion or deconvert from religion, demand to know why your family doesn’t give all its money away to charity. </p>

<p>I know this because as a teenager I became a vegetarian, became a committed effective altruist, got very worried about <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/21/18126576/ai-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-safety-alignment">artificial intelligence</a>, explored Jewish observance, came out as a lesbian, spent most of my savings trying to help a friend in a bad home situation, and — I’m sure — gave my parents quite a few gray hairs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the crucial thing is, none of that was a “phase,” best patiently waited out. I really am a lesbian, now married with a wonderful wife. We invite all our friends to our weekly Shabbat dinners. I have varied the exact details of my diet over the years, but I still avoid factory-farmed meat. I’m still an effective altruist; my wife and I donate 30 percent of our collective income to the best global health charities we can identify. If my parents had seen my radical life changes and decided to talk me out of them, or to assume I’d outgrow them, they would have missed out on connecting with me, their child who was trying to make sense of her moral priorities and personal identity in a confusing world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You might worry if your child is changing rapidly and adopting lots of new priorities you don’t understand. And they might not stick with all their new ideas. But you want to nurture a relationship with your actual child, the person in front of you, not with some extrapolated future version of them.</p>

<p>That means valuing the compassion, curiosity, generosity, and conviction that has led your child down whatever paths they’re traveling, and it means genuinely listening to them and learning both alongside and from them. That seriousness and respect will mean the world to your kids — and help them to conquer the world.</p>

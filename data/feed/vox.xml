<p class="has-text-align-none">Democrats have faced a bitterly disappointing defeat, and the debate is on about why that happened.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Amid the opportunistic finger-pointing and evidence-free assertions that Vice President Kamala Harris could have won if only she had done this or that, there is a genuine search for explanations about what happened. The answer Democrats find most persuasive could greatly influence the party’s direction as it tries to win again.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This debate will clearly go on for some time, and disentangling causality is difficult. But one way to think about it is to break up the question.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How much of the defeat was about Harris’s weakness as a candidate or her campaign strategy? How much was about Donald Trump’s strengths? How much was about President Joe Biden’s record? How much was about the Democratic Party brand generally? And how much was due to larger structural factors like a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e8ac09ea-c300-4249-af7d-109003afb893">global anti-incumbent trend</a>?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s possible that all of these played some role in the outcome, especially because issues like inflation can resonate across them all. But let’s go through them.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="was-harris-an-unusually-weak-candidate">Was Harris an unusually weak candidate?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Any candidate who loses tends to get defined, in retrospect, as an obvious loser. So naturally, lots of the Democratic finger-pointing has been pointing at Harris. But how convincing is it?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris had some real strengths: her record as a former prosecutor, her formidable fundraising, and the fact that she was a fresh face. But many had grave doubts about her prospects <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/362277/kamala-harris-donald-trump-polling">all along</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris’s political rise in deep-blue San Francisco, and later statewide in California, came by cultivating support among Democratic elites; she had never had to run in a swing state and therefore never developed a political style designed to appeal to swing voters. It was far from clear what those swing voters would make of her when she entered the 2024 race. (The one time before this year that she faced a decent Republican opponent — her first run for California attorney general, in 2010 — she barely won.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her campaign strategy was cautious and defensive. In her prior presidential campaign and during the vice presidency, she’d done several <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/06/us/politics/kamala-harris-vice-presidenct-legacy.html">high-profile interviews</a> that went poorly, which spurred her to avoid such interviews. In this bid, she was happy to prosecute the case against Trump on the debate stage, but seemed much less comfortable when it was her being grilled. She often spoke in talking points and platitudes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There was also her record. When Harris was trying to win the 2020 Democratic primary, she ran to the left, taking several policy positions (like <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2024/09/19/harris-fracking-reversal-may-have-a-sequel-00180080">banning fracking</a>) that did not seem politically tenable. Trump’s team used one clip from that campaign, when <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2024/10/harris-position-on-health-care-for-transgender-prisoners-and-detainees/">she touted</a> how she’d worked to ensure transgender inmates in California could access gender-affirming care, in a heavily funded attack ad. It <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/politics/trump-win-election-harris.html">concluded with the line</a>: “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her campaign strategy hinged on trying to tack to the center, disavowing or simply avoiding her past positions, sending out signals to the business community that she’d be friendlier to them, while using former Rep. Liz Cheney as a Republican validator. She did not break with the Biden administration or the mainstream Democratic consensus on any issue of significance. She did not run as a bold populist or progressive, either.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, there’s gender and race. Many have wondered whether the voter backlash against her was due to sexism — particularly due to preliminary numbers suggesting the swing against her was most intense among men. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/politics/trump-win-election-harris.html">New York Times reports</a> that the Trump team’s ads often showed Harris “laughing or dancing in a colorful blouse and pink pants,” because Trump’s goal was “to make her look like a lightweight.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But is Harris getting too much of the blame? Evidence suggests the guy she replaced at the top of the ticket, Joe Biden, would have done much worse. One <a href="https://x.com/YouGovAmerica/status/1854895311644172605">post-election poll</a> found Trump would have beaten him by 7 percentage points nationally. Perhaps she did a decent job of playing a bad hand: the Biden administration’s record.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="was-it-biden-s-fault">Was it Biden’s fault?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden’s initial attempt to run for reelection — before it was curtailed by his disastrous debate — limited the time and options available to Harris. But the bigger problem may have simply been that she was his vice president, and his administration was very unpopular.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Blueprint, a Democratic polling initiative, <a href="https://blueprint2024.com/polling/why-trump-reasons-11-8/">published research</a> showing that two of the three most effective arguments for pushing swing voters away from Harris were that “inflation was too high under the Biden-Harris administration” and that “too many immigrants illegally crossed the border under the Biden-Harris administration.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Polling all year has shown that inflation and immigration were Democrats’ biggest vulnerabilities. So part of the party’s second-guessing will naturally involve whether Biden should have made different policy choices to produce different outcomes in those areas.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden did not cause inflation, but his American Rescue Plan <a href="https://www.vox.com/23036340/biden-american-rescue-plan-inflation">did make it worse</a>, which resulted in higher prices and necessitated bigger interest rate hikes than would have happened otherwise.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">His administration was also slow to adjust, and though a “soft landing” without a recession eventually resulted, voters hated the enduring high prices.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the border, too, Biden only belatedly pivoted. After a huge increase in the number of unauthorized immigrants arriving at the border in 2021 and onward, Democrats in blue states and cities struggled to deal with the logistics of so many arrivals, and public backlash brewed. Late in 2023, Biden tried to pass a border security bill through Congress, but failed — in part due to <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/1/25/24050278/senate-immigration-border-ukraine-trump-mcconnell-romney">opposition from Donald Trump</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In mid-2024, the combination of a deal with Mexico and new executive orders seemed to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/investigations/border-crossings-dropped-lowest-level-biden-administration-september-rcna174574">finally cut down</a> on border crossings. But it’s possible Biden could have done more earlier, limiting the effectiveness of immigration as an attack on Harris.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, Israel’s war in Gaza bitterly divided the Democratic coalition. There was probably no way to make everyone happy here, and polling <a href="https://blueprint2024.com/polling/why-trump-reasons-11-8/">does not show it</a> as a top reason swing voters turned against Harris. But the ugly controversy over Biden’s support for Israel (and Harris’s support for Biden’s policy) may have hurt her in Michigan and cut down on the left’s enthusiasm for her. It’s unlikely to have been decisive, but it certainly didn’t help.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="was-trump-an-unusually-strong-candidate">Was Trump an unusually strong candidate?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The political conventional wisdom has generally been that Trump is a weak candidate who’s been holding Republicans back — that his 2016 win was a fluke reliant on the Electoral College; that he was quite unpopular as president; that voters rejected him and his party in 2018, 2020, and (sort of) 2022; and that the GOP was taking a massive risk by nominating him again after he tried to steal the last presidential election and was indicted four times.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Trump may have been unusually well-positioned to take advantage of dissatisfaction with the Biden administration’s record on the economy and immigration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s persona as a celebrity businessman, one who many voters view as especially savvy about the economy, has been an advantage for him in polls <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-schiller-trump-victory-economy-20161109-story.html">since his first campaign</a>. That wasn’t enough to save him amid the chaos of 2020, but given what’s ensued since, many Americans have looked back on Trump’s governing record more fondly. Voters have given him retrospective credit for the strong economy and low inflation environment of 2017 through 2019, while not really blaming him for the pandemic. Focus groups again and again <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/opinion/election-focus-groups.html">came back to the idea</a> that voters hated the Biden economy and thought Trump could fix it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383197/kamala-harris-results-underperformed-democratic-senate-candidates">Trump’s outperformance of many down-ballot Republican candidates</a> in key races — in part due to split-ticket voting, in part due to Trump voters simply not voting down-ballot — suggests there was a significant bloc of “I don’t like Republicans much, but the economy was better under Trump” voters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On immigration, too, there was a <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/351535/3-theories-for-americas-anti-immigrant-shift">stunning swing</a> of public opinion to the right during Biden’s term, as border arrivals soared, which may have played to Trump’s advantage.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="was-this-a-backlash-against-the-democratic-party-for-going-too-far-left">Was this a backlash against the Democratic Party for going too far left?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One theory floating around is that the results show the public is punishing the Democratic Party for having moved too far left.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Josh Barro made this argument in <a href="https://www.joshbarro.com/p/trump-didnt-deserve-to-win-but-we">a Substack post</a>, citing poor Democratic governance in blue states and cities as well as “woke” far-left policies on crime, schooling, and trans rights as likely causes of public frustration. Perhaps this explains some of the disproportionate shifts against Harris we saw in deep-blue states like New York, as well as progressive prosecutors losing and a tough-on-crime ballot proposition <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-11-06/tide-shifts-against-criminal-justice-reform-among-california-voters">passing in California</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A counterpoint to this is that Democrats’ swing-state Senate candidates did well — several of them won despite Harris losing their states — and that even amid the backlash in New York, Democrats <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/nyregion/democrats-house-ny.html">flipped several House seats</a> in New York. That could be read to suggest the problem had less to do with the Democratic Party and more to do with the top of the ticket.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, Democrats did likely lose the national popular vote as well as the presidency, so it’s hard to argue that the party’s political positioning is optimal.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And demographic trends could be read as quite ominous for the party. As my colleague Eric Levitz recently wrote, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/383565/2024-election-results-kamala-harris-loss-democrats-future">Democrats lost serious ground</a> with both working-class voters and nonwhite voters. If those trends continue, the party will be in deep trouble, as there simply aren’t enough college-educated white voters in the electorate to get anywhere near a majority. So some are arguing that the party has simply become too dominated by the concerns of upscale white college graduates — and that they desperately need to change that.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="was-it-just-due-to-a-global-trend">Was it just due to a global trend?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, another school of thought holds that perhaps the explanation for the outcome doesn’t lie in the United States at all. Perhaps it’s just the latest example of a worldwide trend of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e8ac09ea-c300-4249-af7d-109003afb893">incumbents doing poorly</a> in democracies holding elections in the post-pandemic years. Inflation, as a worldwide trend caused by supply-side disruptions and foreign crises, is a big part of the reason for that global struggle.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Every governing party facing election in a developed country this year lost vote share, the first time this has ever happened,” John Burn-Murdoch <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e8ac09ea-c300-4249-af7d-109003afb893">reported for the Financial Times</a>. “It’s possible there is just no set of policies or personas that can overcome the current global anti-incumbent wave.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, it is worth keeping in mind that Trump won quite narrowly, by just 2 percentage points or less in the decisive swing states. On the one hand, that could suggest Democrats did a surprisingly good job among structural headwinds, starting from behind and closing the gap as much as possible — even if it wasn’t ultimately enough.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the other hand, it could suggest that more could have been done. Was it really fated that there was absolutely nothing Democrats could have done over the past four years to improve their margin by 2 more points, however strong the headwinds?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whatever the answer, Democrats have two years until their next chance to take back a branch of the federal government — and plenty to figure out in the meantime.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last week, 43 monkeys, all of them young female rhesus macaques, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/science/escaped-monkeys-south-carolina.html">escaped</a> from the Alpha Genesis research laboratory in Yemassee, South Carolina, when an employee failed to properly secure the door to their enclosure.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It wasn’t the first time something like this happened at <a href="https://www.alphagenesisinc.com/">Alpha Genesis</a>, a company that breeds and uses thousands of <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23795087/animal-experiments-primates-mental-health-effective">monkeys for biomedical testing</a> and supplies nonhuman primate products and bio-research services to researchers worldwide. In 2018, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) <a href="https://apnews.com/article/monkeys-escape-alpha-genesis-south-carolina-640eb78119c66b88a418ccd1e361318e">fined</a> the facility $12,600 in part for other incidents in which monkeys had escaped. “We’re not strangers to seeing monkeys randomly,” a nearby resident and member of the Yemassee town council <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/science/escaped-monkeys-south-carolina.html">told</a> the New York Times.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Alpha Genesis is now working to recapture the macaques, who are each about the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/south-carolina-escaped-monkeys-latest/">size of a cat</a>; over the weekend, 25 of them were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/us/monkey-captured-south-carolina.html">recovered</a>. Meanwhile, the animal protection group <a href="https://saenonline.org/media2/news-20241108.html">Stop Animal Exploitation Now</a>, which for <a href="https://saenonline.org/res-fr-sc-ag.html">years has filed</a> federal complaints against the facility, has <a href="https://www.foxcarolina.com/2024/11/08/animal-welfare-group-files-federal-complaint-against-facility-that-lost-43-monkeys-sc/">called</a> on the USDA to prosecute Alpha Genesis as a repeat violator of its duty to keep the animals secure.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The recovery process is slow, but the team is committed to taking as much time as necessary to safely recover all remaining animals,” a Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TownYemasseeSC/posts/pfbid02WgwH7Fo78UbfJa2rn4eDiVDfdjFU5Dxq1PaPnspDPgFqesKefkDtxFbsDu8nLoTvl" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.facebook.com/TownYemasseeSC/posts/pfbid02WgwH7Fo78UbfJa2rn4eDiVDfdjFU5Dxq1PaPnspDPgFqesKefkDtxFbsDu8nLoTvl">post</a> from the Yemassee Police Department said, attributing the comment to Alpha Genesis CEO Greg Westergaard. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In one way, this is a story about what looks like a corporate failure. But there is another way to understand this situation, both legally and morally. What if these intrepid macaques, who the lab has said pose no threat to the public and carry no infectious diseases, have a legal claim to freedom? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The legal status of wild animals is more contested and malleable than ever, from the recent <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/6/21/23173019/happy-elephant-bronx-zoo-new-york-lamda-artificial-intelligence-ai-google">court case</a> arguing that Happy, an elephant living at the Bronx Zoo, was a legal person entitled to freedom to the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/364284/peta-protests-animal-rights-factory-farming-effective">phasing out</a> of animal use at entertainment venues like circuses and the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24055003/long-tailed-macaques-biomedical-testing-ozempic-covid-endangered-species-act-cambodia">end</a> of US lab experimentation on chimpanzees. While Alpha Genesis may have a strong financial incentive to recapture the escaped monkeys, longstanding legal doctrines suggest that the 18 monkeys who remain at large may not belong to the company as long as they remain free and outside of its custody. State officials, or perhaps even members of the public, might even be legally protected in rescuing these monkeys from a fate of cage confinement and invasive experimentation and bringing them to a sanctuary. Such an outcome would matter not just for these monkeys but also for the rights of captive animals more broadly.   </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>When a captive animal becomes free</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For many people, the idea of a lost animal becoming the property of another person might seem absurd. Certainly, no one would imagine forfeiting the companionship of a beloved dog or cat because the animal got out of the yard and was found by someone else. Neither law nor morality treats the escape of a domesticated animal as tantamount to a forfeiture of all claims to the animal. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But when it comes to wild animals, the law is different.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When a captive wild animal escapes, their captor generally remains liable for any damage the escaped animal creates to persons or property, but they may lose ownership of the animal, especially if the creature integrates into an existing wild population (sometimes called “reverting to the common stock”). That might sound unlikely for rhesus macaques in the US — the species is <a href="https://neprimateconservancy.org/rhesus-macaque/">native to South and Southeast Asia</a> and has been exported around the world for lab testing. But it turns out that it’s perfectly possible to live as a free-roaming rhesus macaque in South Carolina, where a more than four-decade-old population of the monkeys resides on the state’s Morgan Island, <a href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/trip-ideas/island-vacations/morgan-island-south-carolina-monkeys">also known as “Monkey Island.”</a> </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Originally relocated from Puerto Rico between 1979 and 1980, the Morgan Island macaques now <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/morgan-island">serve</a> as a kind of reservoir of lab monkeys for the US government. Last year, Alpha Genesis <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/news/alpha-genesis-takes-over-management-of-south-carolinas-monkey-island/article_fb08a7d2-ce5a-11ed-bd91-8b72f090aac4.html?fbclid=IwY2xjawGZbOlleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHYFCnOM0YaH8R9NKM1GPESXxRu2_0yPiEOUsZpelHpzWpsXMFnJkDLJ7hg_aem_wVg-y1EC5pzq9QdpOLgs2w">won a federal contract</a> to oversee the monkey colony there — in fact, the 43 escaped macaques had originally lived as “free-range” monkeys on the island before they were taken to be used for testing and research purposes, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/south-carolina-escaped-monkeys-what-we-know/">told</a> CBS News in a statement. While these monkeys may not be able to rejoin the Morgan Island colony on their own, the fact that they came from a wild population strengthens the view of them as animals who not only can live in the wild but who deserve to be free.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Our modern understanding of animals’ legal status derives from 19th-century American common law cases, which adopted the classical Roman legal approach to wild animals, or <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/ferae_naturae"><em>ferae naturae</em></a>. Under that system, wild animals were a special type of property known as “fugitive” property because they could move freely and weren’t owned by anyone before being captured by a human. This created unique legal challenges — for example, conflicts between two hunters claiming the same animal — that can help us understand the case of the escaped monkeys. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The 1805 New York Supreme Court case <a href="https://www.nycourts.gov/REPORTER/archives/pierson_post.htm"><em>Pierson v. Post</em></a>, sometimes considered the most famous property case in American law (and about which one of us has written <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/ca/universitypress/subjects/law/property-law/pierson-v-post-hunt-fox-law-and-professionalization-american-legal-culture?format=PB">a book</a>), is the starting point for understanding who legally owns a wild animal. In a dispute between two hunters, one who had been in hot pursuit of a fox and one who swooped in to kill the animal, the case held that the property interest of the latter was stronger. The court made clear that a definitive capture, and not pursuit alone, was necessary to establish and retain ownership of a wild animal. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 1898, another New York case, <a href="https://casetext.com/case/mullett-v-bradley"><em>Mullett v. Bradley</em></a>,<em> </em>went further by recognizing that capture alone is not sufficient to claim ownership of a wild animal if the animal is able to escape and regain their liberty. The court found that a sea lion who had been brought by rail from the Pacific Ocean to the East Coast and later escaped from an enclosure in Long Island Sound was legally free until he was captured by a different person two weeks later. Cases like these gave rise to a doctrine that legal scholars now call “the law of capture,” which holds that if a captive wild animal escapes and control over them is lost, they no longer necessarily belong to the party who had previously captured them.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This line of legal reasoning generally works to the detriment of animals, ensuring that each generation of law students learns that animals are ours to possess and use for our own ends. But in the case of the escaped South Carolina monkeys, the law of capture raises doubt about whether the lab retains ownership of the animals unless and until it recaptures them. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A more recent Canadian case suggests that the law of capture may indeed offer a path to rescue for escaped animals like the South Carolina lab monkeys. In 2012, Darwin, a Japanese snow macaque, became a worldwide media sensation when he was <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/stylish-but-illegal-monkey-caught-at-ikea-156237185/">found roaming through an Ontario IKEA store</a> wearing a shearling coat and a diaper. While Darwin had been kept as a pet, a Canadian court <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ikea-monkey-mom-ordered-to-pay-83k-in-legal-costs-to-sanctuary-1.2501250">ruled</a> that he was a wild animal, and his owner lost her rights to him after he escaped from her car. Toronto Animal Services <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/8650292/what-happened-to-darwin-ikea-monkey/">captured</a> Darwin inside the store and transferred him to a primate sanctuary, where he could live among other macaques.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, one could argue that the escaped lab monkeys in South Carolina are effectively domestic animals who belong to their owner. Alpha Genesis has put resources into housing and raising them, including managing the monkey population on Morgan Island. But unlike pets who have been domesticated over many generations to live safely among humans, these rhesus macaques retain their wild instincts — they’ve been described as <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/8/more-than-40-monkeys-on-the-loose-in-us-town-after-escaping-lab">skittish</a>, and food is being used to lure them into traps.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the monkeys were to return on their own, like a house cat coming home after a day of adventure, the legal case for viewing them as domestic animals would be stronger because wild animals, once they stray, must have no <em>animus revertendi</em>, or intention to return. So long as these monkeys express their desire to remain free by evading capture, they should be considered wild animals. A 1917 Ontario court case, <em>Campbell v. Hedley</em>, involving a fox who had escaped a fur farm, established a similar principle, finding that the animal remained wild and thereby became free after fleeing the farm because they belonged to a species that “require[d] the exercise of art, force, or skill to keep them in subjection.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are, to be sure, cases in which common law courts have found losing control of an animal does not result in a loss of ownership. A 1927 Colorado case, <a href="https://casetext.com/case/stephens-v-albers"><em>Stephens v. Albers</em></a>, held that a semi-domesticated silver fox who escaped from a fur farm still remained the property of that owner. And questions about the ownership of wild animals are infinitely debatable, as any good student of <em>Pierson v. Post</em> will tell you.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While these past cases offer important insight into the treatment of wild animals under common law, none of them took place in South Carolina, so courts in that state could consider them for guidance but wouldn’t be required to follow them when deciding who owns the escaped Alpha Genesis monkeys (and nothing in this piece should be construed as legal advice).&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The moral </strong>meaning of animal escapes</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet the law of capture aside, the plight of these monkeys is also interesting to us as legal scholars because it highlights one of many disconnects between the law and our moral intuitions about animals who have escaped and who are seeking or being afforded sanctuary. As journalist Tove Danovich has <a href="https://longreads.com/2018/05/17/wild-at-heart/">written</a>, there is often great public sympathy and compassion for animals who escape painful confinement or slaughter at zoos, factory farms, or research labs — even among people who might otherwise tolerate the very systems that normalize those animals’ suffering. The public’s outrage when a single cow who <a href="https://www.idahostatejournal.com/news/local/cow-fatally-shot-in-pocatello-after-escaping-from-meat-processing-facility/article_1cca0746-868b-11ef-aecb-17af9aa8cfe2.html">escapes slaughter is gunned down</a> by authorities is palpable and crosses ideological lines.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is something enchanting and powerful, even romantic, about the idea of an animal escape, especially if it results in the animal’s rescue from confinement. Yet the law generally fails to recognize the moral tug that these escapes place on our collective conscience.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a recent high-profile <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/21/nyregion/missing-cows-animal-sanctuary-newfane-ny.html">case</a> in upstate New York, two cows wandered onto an animal sanctuary after escaping from a neighboring ranch. Unlike the South Carolina monkeys, these were straightforwardly domesticated animals, and the response from local law enforcement was harsh. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The sanctuary owner, Tracy Murphy, was arrested, shackled, and faced criminal liability for taking the cows in and refusing to immediately turn them over for slaughter (one of us, Justin, was defense counsel for Murphy, whose case was <a href="https://www.niagara-gazette.com/opinion/editorial-major-conflict-in-cow-theft-case-warrants-probe/article_9ec60e46-815b-11ef-b68c-5b7d1740db84.html">dismissed</a> last month after a two-year legal battle). Her aid to two escaped cows was widely vilified by her own neighbors and by local law enforcement, because our legal system continues to treat many animals as property without any recognized rights or interests of their own. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The law is unlikely to swiftly abandon the archaic notion of human ownership over nonhuman animals. But we believe the law does implicitly recognize a right to rescue escaped animals, at least those who are lucky enough to make it on their own steam. We hope that the case of the escaped South Carolina monkeys will inspire conversations about the right of at least some animals to liberate themselves from exploitation and harm at human hands. Escapes are rare, but when they happen against all odds, we might ask ourselves, on both legal and moral grounds, whether the animals have a claim to freedom.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy">President-elect Donald Trump</a> has won his second — and final — term in office.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/18/trump-at-nra-convention-floats-a-three-term-presidency-00158786">Trump has joked about pursuing a third term</a> and has a penchant for promoting authoritarian ideas, <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/07/can-donald-trump-run-2028-presidential-election/76094187007/">he’s barred from running again</a> by the 22nd Amendment of the US Constitution. To run for a third term, he’d have to repeal that amendment, and that would be difficult. Undoing a constitutional amendment requires an overwhelming level of support from Congress and state legislatures, support he would be unable to obtain.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When asked if there were legal loopholes or other ways for a president to get around the 22nd Amendment, Stanford University law professor Michael McConnell, a specialist in constitutional law, had a definitive answer. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“No. There are none. This will be his last run for president,” McConnell told Vox.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-the-22nd-amendment-says"><strong>What the 22nd Amendment says</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The 22nd Amendment firmly limits <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/how-we-wound-up-with-the-constitutions-only-term-limits-amendment">presidents to two</a> successful runs and applies equally to those elected to consecutive terms and those, like Trump, who are elected to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-trump-run-again-2028/">nonconsecutive terms</a>. It states the following:&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">&#8220;No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The amendment <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/how-the-22nd-amendment-came-into-existence">was ratified in 1951</a> and came after years of both parties calling for term limits for the presidency.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While President George Washington set a precedent for only holding two terms in office, President Franklin D. Roosevelt later <a href="https://www.history.com/news/fdr-four-term-president-22-amendment">became the first and only commander-in-chief</a> to serve additional terms. Roosevelt was ultimately elected to four terms in office, though he passed away during his last term in 1945.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Following Roosevelt’s tenure, there were growing calls to establish term limits for future presidents, leading to Congress’s approval of the 22nd Amendment and states’ subsequent ratification.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-it-s-so-hard-to-roll-back-the-22nd-amendment"><strong>Why it’s so hard to roll back the 22nd Amendment</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The thresholds for approving a constitutional amendment and for repealing it are exceedingly high.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are two ways to go about rolling back an amendment. The first would require two-thirds of both the House — 290 members — and the Senate — 67 members — to agree to do so. Once they did so, three-fourths of all states — 38 — would then also have to agree.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These thresholds would be impossible for Trump to meet given Democratic opposition, and there would likely be some Republican outcry as well. While <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382868/republican-senate-majority-ohio-west-virginia-trump">Republicans are poised to retake Senate control</a>, they’ll fall far short of the two-thirds majority required for such a vote. If the GOP attains control of the House, they’d similarly fall far short of the two-thirds majority needed there. Additionally, at least 17 states have voted for Vice President Kamala Harris, signaling that they’d be unlikely to support any such amendment. That’s more than the one-fourth of states Trump could afford to lose should he somehow succeed in getting the amendment overturned by Congress.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A second means of repealing an amendment would require holding a Constitutional Convention, which two-thirds of states — 34 — would have to support. Any amendments proposed at such a convention would still need ratification from three-fourths of states — 38. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This option would face the same opposition from Democrat-leaning states as the first one.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the amendment was first approved, there have been numerous proposals in <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/term-limits/">Congress raised to repeal it</a>, though they have all languished due to lack of support.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-amendment-is-crystal-clear"><strong>The amendment is crystal clear</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Experts say there aren’t really any realistic options for Trump to try to bypass the 22nd Amendment.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Theoretically, <a href="https://cornerstonelaw.us/22nd-amendment-doesnt-say-think-says/">the 22nd Amendment doesn’t prevent a former president</a> who has already served two terms from becoming vice president in a subsequent term. As vice president, that person could then potentially ascend to the presidency if the president on the ticket stepped down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It could theoretically happen, but it isn&#8217;t going to happen,” says McConnell, who added that it’s a “silly thing to worry about.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Efforts to challenge the amendment in court are also moot.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Supreme Court does not have the basis to overturn the 22nd Amendment, according to legal experts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Per UCLA law professor Adam Winkler, any challenge to a constitutional amendment would likely rest on arguments that the procedure used to approve the amendment was faulty in some way.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s “impossible” in this case, says Winkler, given how this amendment has been settled for more than seven decades.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Winkler notes the Supreme Court could try to interpret the 22nd Amendment to say that it only applies to presidents who have served consecutive terms, but even that would be a stretch based on its text. Any effort to declare the amendment unconstitutional by the Court would run into the problem of the amendment being part of the Constitution, notes McConnell. “By definition, the Constitution cannot be unconstitutional,” he says.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Overall, as Georgetown law professor Abbe Smith explained when asked if Trump could vie for a third term, it’s pretty simple: “Short answer: There is no way.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As such, Trump’s recent run is set to be his final one.&nbsp;</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The relationship between Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has always been, to put it mildly, a little complicated. In 2019, there was the “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/04/politics/donald-trump-ukraine-perfect-call-defense/index.html">perfect phone call</a>,” in which Trump allegedly leveraged US aid to Ukraine to pressure Zelenskyy to investigate Hunter Biden. And the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7810y11dyjo">more recent awkward meeting </a>in New York during the 2024 presidential campaign in which Trump talked about his good relationship with Vladimir Putin in front of the man whom the Russian leader had reportedly <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-assassination-plot-russia-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-foiled/">tried to kill</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Trump has also expressed some grudging admiration for Zelenskyy, a fellow TV star-turned-politician who has demonstrated he knows how to close a deal. “I think Zelenskyy is the greatest salesman in history — every time he comes into the country, he walks away with $60 billion,” Trump <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-24/trump-says-he-d-handle-ukraine-differently-ahead-of-un-meeting?srnd=homepage-europe&amp;sref=C3P1bRLC">said at a rally in September</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But after Trump’s return to the White House, Zelenskyy may now have his toughest “sales” job yet. Zelenskyy quickly congratulated Trump on his victory and the two <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/11/08/musk-trump-zelensky-ukraine-call?utm_campaign=editorial&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">held an initial</a> phone call last week which was joined — in a likely sign of strange things to come —&nbsp;by Elon Musk, and <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/11/08/musk-trump-zelensky-ukraine-call?utm_campaign=editorial&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">described by Ukrainian officials as somewhat reassuring</a>. Trump also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/11/10/trump-putin-phone-call-ukraine/">reportedly spoke with Putin</a> over the weekend, according to the Washington Post, though the Kremlin has since, confusingly, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-will-discuss-with-trump-top-us-priorities-wednesday-2024-11-10/">denied it</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The conventional wisdom is that Trump’s election is a major setback for Ukraine, coming at a moment when it is <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/10/29/ukraine-is-now-struggling-to-cling-on-not-to-win">already losing territory and troops</a> at a slow but steady rate to Russia’s relentless advance and when its civilian population is likely in for another brutal winter due to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-launches-drone-attack-kyiv-ukraines-military-says-2024-08-26/">Russian strikes on the country’s energy grid</a>. Opposition to support for Ukraine has become a core position of the Republican Party’s MAGA wing, and GOP opposition earlier this year <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024/4/24/24138541/ukraine-russia-us-aid-congress">held up a major aid package</a> to Ukraine for months.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump himself <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-blames-ukraines-zelenskiy-starting-war-with-russia-2024-10-17/">has blamed Zelenskyy</a> for starting the war. He has also promised to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-russia-ukraine-war-un-election-a78ecb843af452b8dda1d52d137ca893">end the fighting in 24 hours</a> once in office. It’s not clear how he plans to do that, but Vice President-elect JD Vance <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=mZganHwvsp6QKDS6&amp;t=880&amp;v=HrgmwtpAsWc&amp;feature=youtu.be">has suggested</a> it would involve freezing the current front lines in place and Ukraine declaring its neutrality and giving up its ambitions to join NATO. (Though Zelenskyy has mostly avoided directly criticizing Trump, he has described Vance as “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/volodymyr-zelensky-has-a-plan-for-ukraines-victory">too radical</a>.”) </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ukraine’s government would view a “deal” like this as full surrender, and argues, with reason, that Russia shouldn’t be trusted to maintain a ceasefire: Putin could always try again to take more territory or even Kyiv itself after a pause to replenish his losses.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But while the conventional wisdom may be true that Trump’s win is a blow to Kyiv,&nbsp;Ukrainian leaders are still expressing some cautious optimism that they can work with the new administration. The pitch from “the greatest salesman in history,” however, is going to have to change.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Selling Ukraine</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One thing you likely won’t be hearing as much: talking points about defending democracy or upholding the rules-based international order, which both Zelenskyy and Joe Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/03/26/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-united-efforts-of-the-free-world-to-support-the-people-of-ukraine/">frequently used</a> over the last two years since Russia’s invasion. Such rhetoric is likely to fall flat with Trump, given his often nakedly transactional approach to foreign policy and general fondness for authoritarian leaders.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Speaking on a press call hosted by the think tank German Marshall Fund on Friday, Hanna Hopko, a former Ukrainian parliament member and co-founder of the International Center for Ukrainian Victory, an advocacy group, made the change clear. “We understand that with Trump, it’s not about philosophy,” she told reporters. “It&#8217;s not talking about a rules-based order. It&#8217;s about a very pragmatic approach.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s probably why Zelenskyy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/world/europe/trump-harris-ukraine-election.html">has lately been emphasizing</a> that Ukraine is “rich in natural resources,” including critical minerals like titanium, graphite and lithium, which could be vital for the green energy transition. It’s a line that has been echoed by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), one of the few close Trump allies who is also a staunch Ukraine supporter.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Noting that Trump <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/380060/trump-world-risks-war">has said</a> in the past that Russia should be allowed to keep the Crimean peninsula, which it annexed in 2014, Hopko argued, “It’s important to explain to Trump, who likes to be a winner, that Crimea has huge potential for <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/why-the-black-sea-could-emerge-as-the-worlds-next-great-energy-battleground/">natural gas extraction</a>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This type of logic has worked on Trump in the past: During his first term, he claimed he ultimately decided to keep US troops in Syria, despite several pledges to withdraw them, in order to “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/13/donald-trump-syria-oil-us-troops-isis-turkey">keep the oil</a>” in the region.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ukrainian officials also believe they can portray themselves as good for American business. “I’ve heard that Republicans stand for the defense industry. We’re bringing value to the defense industry of the US,” Oleksandr Kamyshin, Ukraine’s minister of strategic industries, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360160/nato-summit-allies-trump-biden-zelenskyy-ukraine">told a gathering on the sidelines</a> of the NATO Summit in Washington over the summer. <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/how-supporting-ukraine-revitalizing-us-defense-industrial-base">More than $68 billion</a> of the money allocated for Ukraine has been spent on the US companies. Hopko also noted that Ukraine’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/russia-ukraine/372726/ukraine-depot-strike-russia-drones-missiles-zelenskyy-putin-kursk-tver-taropets">advances in drone warfare and autonomous weaponry</a> can benefit the US military through technology-sharing and battlefield testing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">John Conway, director of strategy for <a href="https://gopforukraine.com/">Republicans for Ukraine</a>, an advocacy group, said that supporters of Ukraine’s cause should emphasize the threat a victorious Russia would pose to the US itself. “Just recently [Putin’s] secret operatives <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/383330/russia-georgia-bomb-threats-gray-zone">tried to blow up civilian airplanes</a> bound for our airports and called in bomb threats to disrupt our elections,” Conway told Vox by email. “When Putin loses, America wins. Ukraine can make Putin lose.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The other reason Trump may end up extending support for Ukraine rather than making a deal is that it’s not clear whether Putin is interested in peace at a time when he likely feels he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/us/politics/russia-north-korea-troops-ukraine.html">has the upper hand in the war</a>. The choice may not be between ongoing war and negotiations but between ongoing war and Ukrainian defeat — something an always image-conscious Trump may not want to see under his watch.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">David Kramer, a former US assistant secretary of state under George W. Bush, said the prospect of a full Ukrainian defeat happening as a result of his actions might give Trump pause. “The last thing that Trump is going to want there would be a chaotic collapse, a la Afghanistan 2.0,” he said. (Though Trump’s first administration negotiated the agreement that led to the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, he <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-08-26/terrorism-afghanistan-joe-biden-withdrawal">repeatedly blamed</a> the Biden administration for its handling of the chaotic pullout.)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Will Trump listen?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ukrainian officials and their Western advocates often point out that for all his kind words for Putin and tense relationship with Zelenskyy, it was Trump who <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-admin-approves-sale-anti-tank-weapons-ukraine/story?id=65989898">agreed to sell Ukraine anti-tank Javelin missiles</a> — something the Obama administration had declined to do. <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/off-duty/gearscout/2022/05/12/javelin-missile-made-by-the-us-wielded-by-ukraine-feared-by-russia/">Javelins would later play a pivotal role</a> in Ukraine’s ability to resist the initial Russian invasion in 2022. (This was likely part of the reason why <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383418/world-leaders-trump-react-putin-netayahu-zelenskyy-xi-jinping-nato">Russia’s official reaction</a> to Trump’s return was a lot less jubilant than it <a href="https://theworld.org/stories/2016/11/09/russian-leaders-literally-cheer-trump-victory">was in 2016</a>.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More recently, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-ukraine-foreign-aid-loan-natural-resources-collateral-rcna150388">Trump was convinced</a> to give his congressional allies blessing to approve a Ukraine-aid package earlier this year after the money was structured as a loan rather than a grant — a sign, perhaps, that appealing to his business instincts can be a winning strategy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether Ukraine’s new pitch will work could also depend on who ends up in Trump’s Cabinet. Ukrainians might have hoped for a return of former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us-former-top-diplomat-pompeo-visits-kyiv-underscores-support-2023-04-03/">visited Ukraine</a> and has advocated for providing it with more advanced weapons systems. Trump, though, has already <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-haley-pompeo-will-not-join-second-administration-2024-11-10/">ruled out a role</a> for Pompeo in the new administration, and <a href="https://x.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1855593982958379321">early indicators</a> are that Republican hawks may not have a home in the new administration.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Former national security adviser Robert O’Brien, who unlike his two predecessors in the first Trump administration, didn’t subsequently condemn Trump, is thought likely to return to a senior role this time. O’Brien<a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/return-peace-strength-trump-obrien"> argued in an article in Foreign Affairs</a> earlier this year that Trump’s strategy would be to “continue to provide lethal aid to Ukraine, financed by European countries, while keeping the door open to diplomacy with Russia—and keeping Moscow off balance with a degree of unpredictability.” O’Brien also advocated for increasing NATO’s military presence in Eastern Europe, close to Russia’s border — a step guaranteed to raise Putin’s ire.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not at all clear that Trump shares the views being ascribed to him by O’Brien, but it’s a sign that there is likely to be a wider range of opinion in the new administration’s foreign policy team than many might think.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">It’s not going to get easier for Ukraine</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The reality is that a reckoning on US support for Ukraine might well have taken place even if Vice President Kamala Harris had won the presidency, if only because of growing opposition in Congress as well as Russia’s undeniable battlefield progress, with Moscow willing to sacrifice tens of thousands of soldiers for its war goals. It’s not only MAGA figures who are pushing for compromise with Russia — <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/ukraine/perfect-has-become-enemy-good-ukraine-haass">some members of Washington’s foreign policy establishment</a> increasingly are as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also worth pointing out that while Biden was a staunch advocate for the Ukrainian cause, officials in Kyiv <a href="https://x.com/michaeldweiss/status/1854980759779787123">have often expressed frustration</a> with his administration’s delays in providing new weapons systems and capabilities, motivated by what they see as an unwarranted fear of escalating war with a nuclear-armed Russia.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Every time we ask for something, we get it months or a year later when it won’t make as much of a difference as it would have before,” parliament member Oleksandra Ustinova <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/353796/us-weapons-ukraine-russia-putin-escalation-nuclear">told Vox in June</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some advocates even hope Trump could take the gloves off, greenlighting tactics like long-range strikes into Russian territory with American weapons, something the Biden team was reluctant to approve. On the other hand, Trump, like Biden, has warned of the specter of “<a href="https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/trump-world-war-3-foreign-policy-putin-xi-china-russia-north-korea-20241027.html">World War III</a>.” In a <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/international/4882868-negotiate-with-moscow-to-end-the-ukraine-war-and-prevent-nuclear-devastation/">September op-ed</a>, the president-elect’s son, Donald Trump Jr., and his new ally Robert F. Kennedy Jr. advocated negotiations with Russia in order to avoid nuclear war. Those escalation fears are unlikely to disappear.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, the Ukrainians will hope for the best and try to work with Trump’s team because there’s little other option. Trump’s relationship with Putin and past statements about the war don’t give much cause for optimism, but ironically, the thing the Ukrainians now seem to be counting on is his unpredictability.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Look around: Does it seem like everyone has been pouring little packages of electrolyte into their beverages lately? Pre-workout, post-workout, without a workout at all? Powders and tablets like LMNT, Liquid I.V., and Nuun are everywhere, from TikTok ads to your office snack counter.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The concept of hardcore hydration isn’t new — athletes <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2014/10/27/357903336/gladiator-gatorade-ancient-athletes-also-had-a-recovery-drink">have been adding stuff to their water</a> for millennia. And electrolyte-filled drinks like Gatorade have been mainstays in sports culture for decades.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But today’s electrolyte supplements aren’t just for football players or ultramarathoners. Companies like Nuun <a href="https://nuunlife.com/pages/orangetheory">market their tablets</a> for everyone from aspiring endurance athletes to regular people going to yoga classes during their lunch breaks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These brands are “playing into people’s perception of what is healthy,” said <a href="https://www.unlv.edu/people/samantha-coogan">Samantha Coogan</a>, a nutrition sciences educator at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. And it seems to be working: According to Precedence Research, the <a href="https://www.precedenceresearch.com/electrolyte-drinks-market">global electrolyte drinks market</a> is worth over $40 billion and is expected to grow to nearly $75 billion in the next decade.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <span>concept of hydration has become a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/08/drinking-water-hydration-amount-importance/674926/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">point of fixation</a>&nbsp;in wellness culture, even though experts still&nbsp;<a href="https://www.physiology.org/publications/news/the-physiologist-magazine/2021/july/the-science-of-hydration?SSO=Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t entirely agree</a>&nbsp;on how much hydration we&nbsp;</span>need or the ideal way to get there. With electrolytes making their way from the world of endurance athletes to brunch cocktails, it’s tempting to believe that they might indeed be a magic cure for everything from leg cramps to hangovers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While electrolyte supplements are great for athletes and lifesaving for cholera patients, they’re not magic. Here’s what you need to know about what electrolytes can and can’t do, and whether you need them.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is an electrolyte, anyway?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Our bodies need to maintain a certain balance of essential minerals to function properly: sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, chloride, phosphate, and bicarbonate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These minerals are all electrolytes, substances that carry electricity through the body, controlling fluid balance, muscle function, and communication between the brain and the body. The “electro” in “electrolytes” comes from the electric charge produced when they’re dissolved in a fluid like blood. Without electrolytes, these electrical signals get disrupted, causing muscle spasms and cramps, headaches, and trouble thinking clearly.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sodium in particular is an important electrolyte because it aids in controlling the amount of water in your blood. Electrolytes like sodium “basically help water in the body go where it’s supposed to go,” said <a href="https://holleyfuelednutrition.com/">Holley Samuel</a>, a registered sports dietitian who works with endurance athletes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When we sweat, we lose a lot of sodium and chloride (a.k.a. salt). But if a person profusely sweating only chugs water without also replenishing the salt, it throws off the balance of sodium and water in the body, pushing too much fluid inside of cells. This can eventually <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470386/#:~:text=Hyponatremia%20is%20defined%20as%20a,to%20total%20body%20sodium%20content.">make those cells swell</a> like raisins soaking in water, a potentially dangerous condition called hyponatremia. When you drink water with electrolytes, that water <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=electrolytes+fluid+absorption&amp;oq=electrolytes+fluid+abso#d=gs_qabs&amp;t=1730327083109&amp;u=%23p%3D08GE-q5ZaZMJ">is better able</a> to stick around inside your body where it’s needed.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Electrolytes like sodium “basically help water in the body go where it’s supposed to go.”</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s important to note that “electrolytes don’t exist only in a magic packet,” said <a href="https://search.asu.edu/profile/3335553">Stavros Kavouras</a>, director of the Hydration Science Lab at Arizona State University. Beyond tablets, packets, and powders, electrolytes exist in regular foods we eat all the time, like bananas (potassium), cheese and crackers (sodium and calcium), and spinach (magnesium). Electrolytes as pre-packaged water supplements, as we think of them today, have only been around for a few decades.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the 1960s, assistant coach Dewayne Douglas noticed that his University of Florida <a href="https://research.ufl.edu/publications/explore/v08n1/gatorade.html">football players were struggling</a> to recover after practices in the swampy Gainesville heat. Athletes shed weight — Douglas recalled losing up to 18 pounds per game himself, when he played — but barely felt the need to pee.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After conducting studies with UF first-year football players as subjects, <a href="https://nephrology.medicine.ufl.edu/education/visiting-professorships/j-robert-cade/">kidney disease specialist J. Robert Cade</a> found that players felt terrible because in addition to experiencing low blood sugar after working out, they were sweating out tons of electrolytes, especially sodium and potassium. So he created a new sports recovery drink for the Florida Gators, called Gatorade: basically water, salt, sugar, and lemon juice for taste. The sodium-enriched drink helps athletes retain water while sweating, and the results were remarkable. “One Lil’ Swig of That Kickapoo Juice and Biff, Bam, Sock — It’s Gators, 8-2,” <a href="https://ufhealth.org/news/2015/uf-celebrates-50-years-gatorade">the Florida Times-Union celebrated in December 1966</a>, after Gatorade’s first season with the team.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sports drinks took off, and other companies began capitalizing on Gatorade’s success. All sports drinks are variations on Gatorade’s theme: Water for hydration, sugar for energy, and electrolytes to aid in fluid absorption, as well as flavoring to get it down. Sports drinks act as “one magic bullet” for athletes, Kavouras said. “You take one thing, and it has everything in there.” This formula is so effective it’s<a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/69227/WHO_FCH_CAH_06.1.pdf?sequence=1"> recommended by the World Health Organization</a> for rehydrating people, especially cholera patients or children experiencing diarrhea.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At first, these beverages were <a href="https://hashtagpaid.com/banknotes/gatorades-approach-to-marketing-then-and-now">primarily marketed to professional athletes</a>. Today, Powerade and Gatorade are advertised <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/history-beverage-industry-part-3-which-brands-furthered-bill-sipper/">as soft drinks</a> for anyone. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2024, <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24031385/stanley-craze-tumbler-best-water-bottle">the year of the giant water bottle</a>, there are also a bunch of new-wave electrolyte supplements like Nuun, LMNT, and Liquid I.V. in grocery and convenience store aisles, which swap sugar for alternative sweeteners like stevia leaf extract or allulose to target consumers who don’t want to drink too many extra calories. These supplements market themselves as hydration superfoods: something to help athletes, sure, but also a hangover cure and <a href="https://hashtagpaid.com/banknotes/how-liquid-iv-is-packaging-hydration-alongside-joy">overall vibe-booster</a> for regular, health-conscious people.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Coogan said, if you’re eating a balanced diet and aren’t training for a marathon, you probably shouldn’t be pounding back electrolyte packets.</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If your body needs extra electrolytes, supplements — whether a Gatorade or a Nuun — can be an efficient way to rehydrate. But, Coogan said, if you’re eating a balanced diet and aren’t training for a marathon, you probably shouldn’t be pounding back electrolyte packets. “Too much of a good thing is not always a good thing,” Coogan said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Okay, but what about hangovers? Pedialyte, an oral electrolyte solution meant for babies and children, <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/9/10/17819358/pedialyte-hangover-marketing-strategy-instagram-influencers">has become the go-to hangover cure</a> for young adults at music festivals and fraternity parties. College students are even trying to sidestep the consequences of binge drinking by swapping beers for <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/borg-gen-z-binge-drinking">BORGs (“blackout rage gallons”)</a>: a half-gallon of water mixed with a bottle of liquor and an electrolyte additive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Alas, electrolytes are <a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/hangovers">not a magic hangover cure</a> — trying to undo a night out with electrolyte supplements is “just going to be an uphill battle,” Coogan said. While pre-hydrating with an electrolyte supplement before a night out might help mitigate some of the consequences of the impending alcohol-fueled dehydration, the only real hangover cure is time.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/electrolytes.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Pink bottles of Mas+." title="Pink bottles of Mas+." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Electrolytes are great for super-sweaty times. Otherwise, meh.</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The best time to consume extra electrolytes is when you’ve been sweating a lot, or otherwise losing a lot of fluids through something like food poisoning. <a href="https://khaki-bear-ys52.squarespace.com/blog/hydration-on-the-run">Training for a long-distance run</a>? <a href="https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/FactSheet_KeepingWorkersWellHydrated.pdf">Working</a> on a construction site on a summer day in a place like Phoenix? Experts say electrolyte supplements are definitely a good call.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many people (myself included) fall somewhere in between couch potato and ultramarathoner. I asked experts how I should think about electrolytes, as someone who spends most of the day sitting in front of my computer, then goes to a CrossFit or <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/366257/pole-dancing-olympics-sport-sex-work-gymnastics-paris">pole dancing</a> class after work. Samuel says that for casual gym rats and recreational athletes, how you should rehydrate largely depends on how much you sweat, and what your sweat is made of.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some people “go to do a spin class and they’re on the bike for five minutes, and there’s a puddle around them,” Samuel said. “If that’s you, you’re a heavy sweater.” Sodium levels in sweat can also vary anywhere from <a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-healthfitness/Fulltext/2019/07000/INDIVIDUALIZED_HYDRATION_PLANS_FOR_ULTRADISTANCE.8.aspx">200 milligrams per liter to 2,000</a>, depending on the person. If your sweat tends to sting your eyes or leave white streaks or crystals on your skin and clothes, you might be a<a href="https://www.self.com/story/salty-sweat-exercise"> salty sweater</a>.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>For casual gym rats and recreational athletes, how you should rehydrate largely depends on how much you sweat, and what your sweat is made of.</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Both heavy sweaters and salty sweaters should consider electrolyte supplements before, during, and after working out. The American College of Sports Medicine recommends consuming <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8955583/#:~:text=ACSM%20recommendations%20for%20sodium%20intake,)%20%5B8%2C9%5D.">at least 300 milligrams of sodium per hour</a> if you’re going to be out sweating for more than an hour, whether you’re participating in a sport or simply working outside on a hot day. Read labels, too: Try to stay <a href="https://time.com/7020001/electrolyte-drinks-hydration-benefits/">below 14 grams of sugar</a> per 8 ounces of fluid (that’s about half of the amount in a Gatorade Thirst Quencher). </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Make sure to check the sodium content on the label of your electrolyte supplement, though: Some popular supplements, like Liquid I.V., <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/liquid-iv-reviews#products">contain 500 mg of sodium</a>, which is more than what’s necessary for all but the sweatiest endurance athletes. Those athletes <a href="https://holleyfuelednutrition.com/blog/how-much-sodium-is-too-much-for-runners">usually need to consume more sodium than other people</a>, Samuel said. For everyone else, supplements with more moderate levels of sodium (around 200 to 300 mg), should be enough to rehydrate. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">About one-third of otherwise healthy people are <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.123.17959#:~:text=For%20approximately%20one%2Dthird%20of,independent%20risk%20factor%20for%20cardiovascular">sensitive to salt</a>, meaning that consuming high amounts of sodium causes an <a href="https://www.self.com/story/electrolyte-packets-workout-recovery">increase in blood pressure</a>. “That&#8217;s why you have heard that a high sodium diet can lead to hypertension and cardiovascular disease,” Kavouras said. If you’re sensitive to salt, you’ll want to be careful. The FDA recommends Americans limit their sodium intake to 2,300 mg per day.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, for most people, <a href="https://time.com/7020001/electrolyte-drinks-hydration-benefits/">it’s next to impossible</a> to consume a dangerous amount of electrolytes. If you eat more carbs, fat, or protein than your body needs, they get stored as fat. But electrolytes aren’t stored — they’re eliminated. “If you drink too much sodium,” Kavouras said, “you will be peeing more sodium.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You don’t necessarily need an electrolyte supplement after your workout. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/17461391.2018.1534989">Low-fat milk</a> (or soy milk, for lactose-intolerant and plant-based athletes) offer enough electrolytes, carbs, and protein to rehydrate, repair muscles, and stabilize blood sugar, and <a href="https://www.self.com/story/how-to-hydrate-after-workout">smoothies</a> can incorporate protein and fats in addition to electrolyte-rich foods like bananas, dates, leafy greens, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3293068/">coconut water</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Electrolytes have another counterintuitive benefit: making you thirstier. “Electrolytes help in maintaining the thirst drive for a longer period of time,” Kavouras said. This can be helpful for those who struggle to drink enough water, because they aren’t thirsty enough to reach for it — or because they don’t like the taste of water. “If it tastes better, and if it drives thirst longer, you will be drinking more on your own,” Kavouras said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While drinking an electrolyte supplement when you don&#8217;t really need one is rarely dangerous, Samuel cautioned that consuming extra sodium without enough extra water (or sweating it out) is dehydrating — say pouring two LMNT packets into one regular-sized water bottle, although that would taste pretty bad. “You’re basically creating jerky out of yourself by salting too much,” she said. “We want to be a nice, hydrated steak.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You don’t need them all the time, but electrolytes can help rebalance a sweaty body and make drinking water a little more fun. Just remember that they’re hardly magic — they’re salts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US nuclear industry has been <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/nuclear/us-nuclear-industry.php">struggling to hold its ground</a> for decades as it contends with <a href="https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/the-uncertain-costs-of-new-nuclear-reactors-what-study-estimates-reveal-about-the-potential-for-nuclear-in-a-decarbonizing-world/">rising costs</a>, an aging fleet, a shrinking workforce, and stiff competition from <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24055711/lng-export-pause-biden-liquefied-natural-gas-climate-change">natural gas</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/372852/solar-power-energy-growth-record-us-climate-china">renewable power</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The most recent <a href="https://www.vox.com/23771809/nuclear-power-smr-small-modular-reactor-energy-climate-nuscale">US nuclear reactors to come online</a>, units 3 and 4 at <a href="https://www.southerncompany.com/innovation/vogtle-3-and-4.html">Plant Vogtle in Georgia</a>, started up in 2023. It was years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget. Meanwhile, <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46820/">more than a dozen reactors</a> have shut down since 2013. Several companies developing <a href="https://www.vox.com/science/23702686/nuclear-power-small-modular-reactor-energy-climate-change">advanced reactors</a> and small modular reactors, promising greater safety and lower costs, have seen their <a href="https://apnews.com/article/nuclear-power-nuscale-clean-energy-wind-biden-7f3a7fe754b77d8d6cbad8662b87a9c3">projects</a> and their <a href="https://www.powermag.com/major-microreactor-developer-enters-bankruptcy-amid-nuclear-industry-surge/">businesses</a> collapse.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/chart.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,9.7261377366089,100,80.547724526782" alt="Graph of nuclear electricity generation capacity" title="Graph of nuclear electricity generation capacity" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Nuclear power has been holding fairly steady for decades. | Energy Information Administration" data-portal-copyright="Energy Information Administration" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">But in the past year, some big tech companies have taken steps toward a revival.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.powermag.com/amazon-backs-massive-nuclear-smr-deployment-5-gw-with-x-energy-agreements-with-energy-northwest-dominion/">Amazon</a> has signed a $500 million deal with <a href="https://x-energy.com/">X-energy</a> to deploy 5 gigawatts worth of small modular reactors (SMRs) in Washington state. The company is also investigating new <a href="https://news.dominionenergy.com/2024-10-16-Dominion-Energy-and-Amazon-to-explore-advancement-of-Small-Modular-Reactor-SMR-nuclear-development-in-Virginia,1">nuclear projects in Virginia</a>. <a href="https://www.powermag.com/google-bets-big-on-nuclear-inks-deal-with-kairos-power-for-500-mw-smr-fleet-to-power-data-centers/">Google</a> and nuclear startup <a href="https://kairospower.com/">Kairos Power</a> agreed to develop <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/10/01/1104387/2024-climate-tech-companies-kairos-power-molten-salt-nuclear-reactors/">molten salt-cooled nuclear reactors</a>, an approach that promises greater efficiency and lower costs. Microsoft has made advanced nuclear energy, including technologies like <a href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/what-are-small-modular-reactors-smrs">SMRs</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/22801265/fusion-energy-electricity-power-climate-change-research-iter">fusion</a>, a part of its <a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RW1fApf">energy strategy</a>. These tech firms are looking to meet their climate goals while sating energy appetites that have exploded with the <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/2024/3/28/24111721/climate-ai-tech-energy-demand-rising">push for artificial intelligence</a>. Last year, new data center power demand grew 26 percent to more than <a href="https://www.cbre.com/insights/reports/north-america-data-center-trends-h2-2023">5 gigawatts</a> in North America.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The case to lean into nuclear power at this moment is compelling. It could generate massive quantities of electricity, day or night, rain or shine, without emitting greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. Nuclear fission is also <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/safest-sources-of-energy">one of the safest energy sources</a>. Coal kills more than 32 people per terawatt-hour of electricity produced while nuclear kills about 0.03. But building a new nuclear power plant from scratch, especially a new design, is an arduous, expensive process that can span decades.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, old, carbon dioxide- and soot-spewing <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61425">coal power plants are also shutting down</a>. Many states are looking to fill the void while also trying to meet their goals to decarbonize their power grids.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s why tech companies are also looking to revive shuttered nuclear plants. Progress is underway to resurrect reactors at three nuclear power plants that were slated for dismantling and could restart as soon as next year. It’s a stunning and unprecedented development for the nuclear industry.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If you told me we would’ve been talking about this 10 years ago, I would’ve laughed at you,” said Patrick O’Brien, head of government affairs and communications at Holtec International, a nuclear services company that until recently specialized in shutting nuclear plants down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Three plants are on the resuscitation list. The 800-megawatt reactor at the <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/info-finder/reactors/pali.html">Palisades Nuclear Power Plant</a> in Michigan, which <a href="https://www.powermag.com/palisades-nuclear-power-plant-closes-after-50-years-of-operation-employees-leave-with-pride/">shut down in 2022</a>, is slated to revive <a href="https://holtecinternational.com/2024/08/29/recent-milestone-achievements-keep-palisades-repowering-on-track/">by the end of 2025</a>; Holtec bought the Palisades plant in 2022 and is now leading its restart. Microsoft signed a deal with Constellation to <a href="https://www.constellationenergy.com/newsroom/2024/Constellation-to-Launch-Crane-Clean-Energy-Center-Restoring-Jobs-and-Carbon-Free-Power-to-The-Grid.html">resuscitate the 835-megawatt Unit 1 reactor</a> at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, which initially <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/mile-island-site-1979-nuclear-reactor-accident-reopening/story?id=113870404">turned off in 2019</a> and could <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/20/nx-s1-5120581/three-mile-island-nuclear-power-plant-microsoft-ai">power up by 2028</a>. NextEra Energy is mulling breathing life back into the 600-megawatt <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/23/nextera-sees-strong-data-center-interest-in-restarting-iowa-nuclear-plant-ceo-says.html">Duane Arnold nuclear power plant</a> in Iowa. The plant <a href="https://www.thegazette.com/energy/nextera-ceo-says-hed-consider-restarting-duane-arnold-nuclear-power-plant/">closed in 2020</a> after sustaining damage during a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/5/14/17353206/derecho-storm-washington-dc-rain-wind">derecho</a>, a fast, powerful thunderstorm.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Restarting these plants is a critical test for nuclear power in the US, and how they fare will bolster or erode confidence in broader ambitions for a new generation of nuclear deployment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But whether they will help keep global warming in check depends on how much they will displace dirtier energy sources as opposed to merely enabling new demand.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to restart a nuclear reactor</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Alas, restarting a nuclear power plant doesn’t involve flipping a comically large circuit breaker. The reality is much more tedious.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For a would-be nuclear resurrectionist, the main tasks are appeasing the regulators and reinvigorating the hardware.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the federal agency in charge of commercial nuclear reactors, says the reason these power plants — Palisades, Three Mile Island, Duane Arnold — are eligible to be restarted is that, from the regulator’s perspective, they’re only <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbE8E1ez97M">mostly dead</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When a reactor first gains approval from the NRC, its initial operating license runs for 40 years. At the end of the first license, the operator can then seek a 20-year extension. “The key to all of these restart efforts is the fact that the licenses that are involved have not yet hit their expiration date,” said Scott Burnell, a spokesman for the NRC.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These reactors were shut down ahead of schedule not for technical problems but because the business wasn’t panning out.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After shutting down a plant, operators remove fuel from the reactors and place it in spent fuel pools. They disassemble pipes and machinery. They drain coolants and lubricants to prevent contamination. A complete decommissioning can <a href="https://www.iaea.org/bulletin/nuclear-decommissioning-addressing-the-past-and-ensuring-the-future">cost up to $2 billion and take 20 years</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the three plants under restart consideration haven’t gotten far along in the disassembly process. Until recently, no one has sought to bring back a plant already slated for retirement, so there isn’t an established rulebook for how to go about it. “There&#8217;s never been a case up to this point where a company has come back and said, ‘Well, I&#8217;ve changed my mind,’” Burnell said. The first thing someone seeking to resuscitate a nuclear reactor must do is seek an exemption from the current rules that make shutting down a one-way street, which requires an enormous amount of paperwork.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The operator then has to put a safety plan in place and bring the plant back up to the original requirements under its operating license. Therein lies the next undertaking.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Palisades, Three Mile Island, and Duane Arnold shut down relatively recently, but they’ve still been offline for years. Imagine letting a car sit in your driveway unused for a couple of years and then trying to fire it up. Odds are, it won’t start on the first try. The motor may have seized, the fuel may have separated, the battery may have discharged completely. Even sitting unused, components like rubber hoses, gaskets, and tires can oxidize and turn brittle with time. Metal parts can rust. A shuttered nuclear power plant faces similar concerns, albeit with significantly higher consequences.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nuclear operators have to first meticulously investigate all the parts of their offline facilities before they get the thumbs-up to power up again.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, this shutdown, inspection, and resuscitation process can also be an opportunity. Holtec’s O’Brien noted that operating nuclear power plants have regularly scheduled downtime lasting a month or so to conduct maintenance and refuel. But a longer outage gives the operator more time to do more extensive upgrades and restoration.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We have parts of the turbine that have been sent out to North Carolina for refurbishment that&#8217;ll be gone for a year with the work being done,” O’Brien said. “You couldn&#8217;t have done that when you&#8217;re an [actively] operating plant.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The other challenge is the workforce. Running a nuclear power plant requires highly specialized personnel, and since the US has been so slow in building reactors, many veteran staffers have retired or left the industry while <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/shortfall-in-young-engineers-threatens-nuclear-renaissance-b63c6642">fewer new graduates are rising to replace them</a>. Palisades <a href="https://holtecinternational.com/2023/09/12/holtec-and-wolverine-ink-power-purchase-agreement-for-palisades/">employed 600 workers when operating and brought in 1,000 more</a> during refueling and maintenance periods.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When a plant is slated for shutdown, many of those workers leave the area or retire. So to restart a nuclear facility, operators need to get their teams back together, sometimes <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/eb89cbc1-2cc3-48d4-9c8c-e2c10f2b2ce0">bringing workers out of retirement</a> while recruiting and training new ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Nuclear revivals still have to prove their economics</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The biggest challenge for nuclear restarts may not be the hardware or the regulations, but competition. According to a 2021 report from the <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46820/3">Congressional Research Service</a>, “The US nuclear power industry in recent years has been facing economic and financial challenges, particularly plants located in competitive power markets where natural gas and renewable power generators influence wholesale electricity prices.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The reactor revivers say they can overcome what killed these power plants in the first place. With Palisades, Holtec is securing a power purchasing agreement with <a href="https://www.wolverinepowercooperative.com/">Wolverine Power Cooperative</a>, a nonprofit that provides electricity to 280,000 homes and businesses in rural Michigan. Rather than competing head-to-head with other generators, this guarantees the plant can sell a given amount of electricity at a fixed rate. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">O’Brien said Holtec is putting up $500 million of its own money. The company also received <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-05-08/holtec-aims-to-lead-a-us-nuclear-power-renaissance">$300 million in grants from the state of Michigan</a> and a <a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/lpo-announces-conditional-commitment-holtec-palisades-finance-restoration-and">$1.52 billion loan guarantee</a> from the US Department of Energy for its effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Holtec is also aiming to use the Palisades site to deploy two 300-megawatt <a href="https://www.vox.com/23771809/nuclear-power-smr-small-modular-reactor-energy-climate-nuscale">small modular reactors</a>, essentially becoming its own first customer for these reactors and demonstrating them for future clients. Since the site is already certified to be a nuclear power plant, it cuts out a lot of the development costs that come with building a plant on fresh soil. Holtec is aiming to <a href="https://holtecinternational.com/2023/12/04/first-two-smr-300-units-slated-to-be-built-at-michigans-palisades-site-for-commissioning-by-mid-2030/">have its first SMR up by 2030</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While a lot of the recent activity around nuclear power has been fueled by the energy-hungry tech industry, Michigan has set its own ambitious climate goals that make Palisades an even more attractive option. The state is aiming to <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/egle/about/organization/climate-and-energy/mi-healthy-climate-plan">phase out all of its coal-fired power plants</a> by 2030. Coal currently provides more than <a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/print.php?sid=MI">22 percent of the state’s electricity</a>. That’s a big hole to fill in over the next six years. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Like many states, Michigan is experiencing growing electricity demand, particularly as <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/mpsc/commission/news-releases/2024/06/24/mpsc-summer-energy-outlook-shows-lower-fuel-costs">hotter summers increase cooling needs</a>. The rise of <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24047383/winter-storm-heating-electricity-grid-power-polar-vortex">electric cars and switching from natural gas heating to electric heat pumps</a> is increasing energy appetites as well. The state also sees an opportunity to get a piece of the AI action and is instituting <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/detroit/2024/10/25/michigan-data-centers-expansion">tax breaks for new data centers</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Revived plants like Palisades can’t keep running forever though. In a car, regular oil changes, tire replacements, and inspections can keep it on the road for a long time. But if the engine block starts to wear down, it’s usually not worth the time or money to replace it. Similarly, with a nuclear power plant, ongoing fueling and maintenance can keep it operational, but if its equivalent of an engine block — the <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/ops-experience/reactor-vessel-integrity.html">reactor pressure vessel</a> around the reactor core — becomes brittle over time as neutrons from nuclear fission bombard it, that can be expensive and difficult to replace. Its integrity is often the main determinant of the overall lifespan of a nuclear plant.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Palisades was <a href="https://www.powermag.com/palisades-nuclear-power-plant-closes-after-50-years-of-operation-employees-leave-with-pride/">already 50 years old</a> when it went offline, and the NRC’s current regulations are set up to allow for two 20-year renewals after an initial 40-year license for a nuclear power plant. “We&#8217;ve had several plants that have come in for a second renewal, which would allow them to run essentially for 80 years,” Burnell said. A plant could theoretically push that further, but no one has tried yet. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And all nuclear plants have to <a href="https://www.nei.org/CorporateSite/media/filefolder/resources/reports-and-briefs/2023-Costs-in-Context_r1.pdf">deal with rising costs</a>. Maintaining a <a href="https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(20)30458-X">nuclear workforce is getting more expensive</a>, and safety regulations continue to ratchet up. Inflation is making materials more pricey and higher interest rates are increasing financing expenses. At the same time, <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/372852/solar-power-energy-growth-record-us-climate-china">photovoltaic solar panels</a> and <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3257036/historic-breakthrough-chinas-installed-wind-turbine-cost-drops-one-fifth-us-green-energy-race">wind turbines</a> have experienced extraordinary price drops and explosive growth around the world.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The nuclear industry’s challenges remain immense, but concerns about climate change might end up being the most compelling driver for new nuclear power. When it comes to ample, around-the-clock, zero-emissions power, nuclear is a strong contender in the competition. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But nuclear energy is now facing another curveball. <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382679/trump-foreign-policy-america-first-tariffs-nato-alliance">Donald Trump’s reelection to the White House</a> likely means that addressing climate change will become a lower priority, as it did <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/8/27/21374894/trump-election-second-term-climate-change-energy-russia-china">during his first term</a>. How much the federal government will continue backing nuclear restarts and new companies is unclear, and the industry might need to figure out a new pitch for more public investment. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the weeks after Donald Trump’s 2016 victory, many top tech leaders found themselves at a meeting in Trump Tower, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/technology/trump-apple-amazon-google-meta.html">frowning and quite obviously full of dread</a>. Now, the same executives sound enthusiastic when they say they’re looking forward to working with the next president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After Tuesday’s election, the congratulations from the tech elite to Trump came in fast. The day after he secured the White House, everyone from <a href="https://x.com/tim_cook/status/1854225875002396860">Tim Cook</a> to <a href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/DCCYlzUPKvy?xmt=AQGz0EQp3_zUkB0bsFvb1kwDsIStpqpxYVkY7mOxRcCcBA">Mark Zuckerberg</a> posted their well wishes for Trump’s second term. Even Jeff Bezos <a href="https://x.com/JeffBezos/status/1854184441511571765">weighed in</a>, hailing Trump’s “extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory.” This, from a man who has been in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/why-trump-went-after-bezos-two-billionaires-across-a-cultural-divide/2018/04/05/22bb94c2-3763-11e8-acd5-35eac230e514_story.html">more than</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/18/opinion/trump-amazon-jedi.html">one public feud</a> with Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The newfound praise does not, however, signal a political realignment in all of Silicon Valley. Tech executives as well as rank-and-file workers <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/workers-several-large-us-tech-companies-overwhelmingly-back-kamala-harris-data-2024-09-09/">overwhelmingly supported Kamala Harris</a> in the election, which shouldn’t be too surprising: She’s been involved in Bay Area politics for many years and has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/09/03/harris-campaign-silicon-valley-tech-policy/">deep ties</a> with the tech and venture capital industries. That allegiance continued the trends of the Obama era, which was marked by a bit of a love fest between Washington and Silicon Valley. Barack Obama, who won the White House in 2008 <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1207594/how-chris-hughes-helped-launch-facebook-and-barack-obama-campaign">with the help of Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes</a>, embraced the ethos of startup culture and celebrated tech companies as a positive force in the United States. He developed personal relationships with executives like Zuckerberg and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/magazine/barack-obama-brought-silicon-valley-to-washington-is-that-a-good-thing.html">championed tech-friendly policies</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, that era is over. In its place is something darker and dominated by <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361087/trump-silicon-valley-fundraising-musk-andreessen-horowitz">a small but very loud group of techno-libertarian Trump fans</a> whose ranks include not only Elon Musk but also the industry’s most influential investors, most of <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/07/21/paypal-mafia-silicon-valley-thiel-hoffman-botha-rabois-musk/">the PayPal Mafia</a>, and the vice president-elect. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Does that mean the tech industry has taken a turn to the right? Is Silicon Valley Trump country now?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It is neither left nor right, Democrat or Republican,” <a href="https://history.washington.edu/people/margaret-omara">Margaret O’Mara</a>, an American history professor at the University of Washington, told me after the election. She pointed out that the tech industry culture in Silicon Valley has its roots in post-Vietnam baby boomers viewing personal computers as a form of liberation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“They didn&#8217;t feel like they had anything in common with political conservatives, but they shared a libertarianism that ran its way all the way across the political spectrum,” O’Mara added. “It&#8217;s kind of a funny libertarianism.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You get a sense of Silicon Valley’s anti-bureaucratic worldview in everything from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/09/arts/television/super-bowl-apple-1984-ad.html">Apple’s famous “1984” ad</a>, which quite literally suggests tearing down the establishment, to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/16/google-20-percent-rule-shows-exactly-how-much-time-you-should-spend-learning-new-skills.html">Google’s celebrated 20 percent rule</a>, which lets employees work on side projects of their own choosing. There’s also a more extreme version of this philosophy in the tech industry, especially lately, one that leans into anti-establishment thinking, which explains their affinity for crypto. These 21st-century techno-libertarians just want to be left alone to build things and make money.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The tech executives busy kissing the ring this week are not necessarily part of this crowd. The Tim Cooks of the world are just doing business, and that requires doing business with the president of the United States, whomever it might be. After the tumultuous first Trump administration, these leaders learned that the president-elect responds best to flattery and praise. They’ve actually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/technology/trump-tech-ceos.html">been sucking up to Trump for months</a> in hopes that they might have some sway in the event of his return to office.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This would be handy for many reasons. The Biden administration, in a break from Obama, has been tough on Big Tech. He appointed anti-monopoly legal star Lina Khan to chair the Federal Trade Commission, and she mounted <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/16/tech/lina-khan-risk-takers/index.html">multiple antitrust suits</a> against the country’s biggest tech companies, including Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta. Now, Khan is currently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/technology/election-2024-ftc-lina-khan.html">waiting to see if she’ll keep her job</a>, and the targets of those lawsuits may have an ally in Trump, who gets to decide Khan’s fate. In addition to less intense regulatory scrutiny, tech companies would also enjoy lower corporate taxes, which Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/11/07/trump-taxes-republican-congress/">has promised to provide</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“​​In my mind, this isn’t a story about Silicon Valley overall and DC overall,” said <a href="https://freeman.tulane.edu/faculty-research/management/rob-lalka">Robert Lalka</a>, a professor at Tulane University. “Instead, what’s occurring now involves the influence of far fewer people: a very close-knit network of like-minded Trump supporters, especially if we focus on the PayPal Mafia, and the transformation of the Republican Party and its policy agenda.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The PayPal Mafia refers to a group of entrepreneurs who worked at PayPal in its early days before going on to found or help build hugely influential tech companies. If you had to pick a godfather of the PayPal Mafia — and hence the leader of this pro-Trump techno-libertarian political revolution — it would be Peter Thiel. The PayPal co-founder donated over $1 million to Trump’s campaign back in 2016 and <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22332045/peter-thiel-jd-vance-ohio-senate-donation">spent $10 million to help JD Vance win a Senate seat in Ohio in 2022</a>. Thiel also helped fund a project <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/24/seasteading-a-vanity-project-for-the-rich-or-the-future-of-humanity">to establish autonomous, floating nations in international waters</a>, where they would be free of all laws and regulations — one reason he has been called the “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/11/peter-thiel-2024-election-politics-investing-life-views/675946/">avatar of techno-libertarianism</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The motivations of the techno-libertarians, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/03/facebook-meta-silicon-valley-politics/677168/">also now known as techno-authoritarians</a>, are more twisted. Elon Musk, who was also a PayPal co-founder, emerged this year as Trump’s biggest supporter after <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/06/business/elon-musk-election-bet/index.html">donating nearly $119 million to his campaign</a> through his America PAC and has made the promotion of free speech one of his missions. Free speech is also <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/05/elon-musk-twitter-free-speech-first-amendment/629721/">a big part of why</a>, after accusing it of censorship, Musk bought Twitter in 2022 and turned it into X, where the promotion of right-wing propaganda and misinformation <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/383336/trump-election-elon-musk-misinformation">may or may not have helped Trump get elected</a> too. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not hard to see why Musk would benefit from a close relationship with the White House. The billionaire certainly didn’t have much of a rapport with the Biden administration, which snubbed him at an electric vehicle summit, an incident that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/how-elon-musk-broke-with-biden-and-the-democrats-4960b7d8">reportedly led Musk to embrace Trump</a>. Musk’s rocket company, SpaceX, makes billions of dollars through government contracts, while his car company, Tesla, is lobbying for fewer regulations around self-driving cars as it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24265530/tesla-robotaxi-elon-musk-features-range-price-release-date">attempts to launch a robotaxi business</a>. Musk’s company Tesla Energy, formerly SolarCity, has received <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-list-government-subsidies-tesla-billions-spacex-solarcity-2021-12#solarcity-receives-4975-million-in-grants-in-addition-to-tax-credits-by-2015-5">billions in subsidies</a> over the years and surely looks to benefit from the federal government’s continued investment in the energy transition. Meanwhile, Trump has promised Musk <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/politics/trump-economic-plans-musk-government-commission/index.html">a role in his administration</a> as the “secretary of cost-cutting” — a position that doesn’t yet exist, but one that Trump seems to be seriously entertaining.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The other loud pro-Trump voices in Silicon Valley share a web of connections to each other and to Musk. There’s former PayPal COO and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/24/us/politics/david-sacks-desantis-twitter-musk.html">Musk pal</a> David Sacks, who spoke at the Republican National Convention in July; Joe Lonsdale, who co-founded Palantir with Peter Thiel and helped launch Musk’s America PAC; and Marc Andreessen, who last year published the 5,200-word Techno-Optimist Manifesto that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/28/opinion/marc-andreessen-manifesto-techno-optimism.html">envisions tech leaders as keepers of the social order</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s worth noting that not every member of the PayPal Mafia has pledged allegiance to Trump. Reid Hoffman, another former PayPal COO and LinkedIn co-founder <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/21451481/linkedin-reid-hoffman-billionaire-democratic-party-tension-silicon-valley">is a prominent Democratic Party fundraiser</a>. He donated $7 million to pro-Harris and pro-Biden PACs, even though he’s a vocal Lina Khan critic. He was also on a list of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/technology/silicon-valley-investors-support-kamala-harris.html">more than 100 venture capitalists</a> who threw their support behind Harris leading up to the election.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GettyImages-2172973156.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Donald Trump at crowded crypto-themed bar." title="Donald Trump at crowded crypto-themed bar." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Donald Trump did a campaign stop at a crypto-themed bar in New York City’s West Village on September 18. | Spencer Platt/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Spencer Platt/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">And then there’s cryptocurrency.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Andreessen’s VC firm announced in 2022 it was going all-in on crypto, a bet that’s starting to pay off <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/andreessen-horowitz-went-all-in-on-crypto-at-the-worst-possible-time-11666769270">after two years of looking very foolish</a>. Trump <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/06/trump-claims-presidential-win-here-is-what-he-promised-the-crypto-industry-ahead-of-the-election.html">has promised</a> to create a strategic cryptocurrency stockpile for the US government in his second term. Trump’s general anti-regulation, pro-crypto stance sent Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/dogecoin-elon-musk-bitcoin-crypto-election-276ddf9a">soaring to all-time highs</a> after election night, following a widely covered <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/10/23450169/crypto-winter-ftx-binance-celsius-bitcoin/archives/11">crypto winter</a> that lasted a couple of years. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You could argue that the crypto vote was vital to helping Trump and a lot of other Republican candidates win, too. The crypto industry has emerged as <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/10/14/silicon-valley-the-new-lobbying-monster">one of the most powerful lobbying forces in the country</a>, pouring tens of millions of dollars into races against politicians they perceive to be anti-crypto — and it’s working. So far, 48 candidates backed by pro-crypto PACs have won their races this year. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-08/crypto-s-135-million-campaign-is-undefeated-in-48-races-so-far?sref=qYiz2hd0">Zero have lost</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When you think of it that way, Trump’s win on the back of techno-authoritarian billionaires seems less like a seismic shift in the politics of the tech industry and more like a bunch of one-issue voters who donated lots of money and got their way.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think a lot of it is about crypto,” O’Mara said. “Crypto is also tied in — and always has been tied in — to a broader worldview, which is one of libertarianism, deregulation, or privately regulated markets that are separate from government.” She described this ethos as “escaping the state.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, the techno-libertarians are the state. The day after Trump declared victory, he asked Musk to join him on a call <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/11/08/musk-trump-zelensky-ukraine-call">with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</a>. And in the coming months, several more members of the PayPal Mafia get to decide what US tech policy will be for the next four years. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You have to wonder if they just want to tear it all down. Or maybe they’ll get bored and move to a floating nation in international waters where there are no laws and never have been.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Americans disheartened by this year’s election results may find themselves in a 2016 redux. Facing yet another Donald Trump presidency, you might be asking yourself: How do I cope? How will I steel myself to do it all over again for the next four years? This time around, Trump and his allies have vowed to <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies">deport millions of people</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce">fire civil servants and appoint loyalists in their stead</a>, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/366495/trump-medication-abortion-mifepristone">further restrict abortion access</a>. These policies are genuinely distressing and can feel overwhelming for the many millions of people who will be affected by them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it is not 2016. Having a clear-eyed plan for how you’ll handle what lies ahead is more protective than succumbing to despair. You can take the lessons learned to buttress your coping skills and avoid psychological exhaustion to make it through the coming days — and the next four years.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to cope right now</h2>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Don’t suppress your emotions, process them</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the immediate aftermath of the election results, you may be flooded with emotions ranging from despair to rage. “You can&#8217;t suppress those emotions of fear and despair. You have to process them,” says <a href="http://www.dradrienneheinz.com/">Adrienne Heinz</a>, a clinical research psychologist at Stanford University. “When you finally accept how you feel and the reality, you can start to focus on what you can change.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Processing emotions requires <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/24042177/alone-thoughts-rumination-thinking-for-pleasure">quiet time with your thoughts</a>. It’s important in this moment to tune out distractions, like social media, and resist avoidant coping strategies, such as sleeping or doomscrolling, and sit with your feelings instead — <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24130937/indoor-person-guide-outdoors-car-camping-birding-urban-nature">whether out in nature</a> or while <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/23718805/beginner-guide-meditation-mindfulness-how-to-meditate">meditating in your living room</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Right now, we probably don&#8217;t have very high distress tolerance — we&#8217;re maxed out,” Heinz says. “But just remembering those emotions don&#8217;t last forever. They might feel like they&#8217;re going to eat you and swallow you whole, but if you can walk through them and come out the other side, you will be more emotionally intelligent.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You may want to seek out a trusted friend or a mental health professional to help you work through some of your feelings, says <a href="https://www.rianaelyse.com/">Riana Elyse Anderson</a>, an associate professor at Columbia University’s School of Social Work. However, give yourself permission to mute group chats with friends if the conversation or information shared feels overwhelming.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Stay in the moment</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead of worrying about what’s to come, hard as that may be, ground yourself in the present. Remind yourself that the tree on your lawn is still there, that the bus is still following its route, says licensed clinical social worker <a href="https://www.evercurioustherapy.com/">Jneé Hill</a>. Squirrels are still scurrying along. “Life is still going on,” Hill says. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She also recommends spending time with children who generally have other concerns&nbsp;—&nbsp;they’re more interested <a href="https://www.vox.com/life/382562/2024-election-kids-politics-voting">in the book fair they just visited</a> or the new move they learned in karate. This can bring you back into the present moment. Don’t forget to lean into joy wherever you can — this is what refills your energy stores.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Avoid fatalistic thinking</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although the country has clarity on its next president, there are still plenty of unknowns about what exactly will unfold over the next four years. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3524.epdf?sharing_token=s1g9JLVHygs4JCkLR1rc7tRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0O2p8IzUOE6gakxUh3l7QmBZ37d_L0L1lhtcpWrgu6_nHzOI3tUvvm3pzK3wfkqx87oZBtCTrEOa3CdrIGwYLMywI3nCZ13iGLMPjYF0eDTnW_bYCnrTspWQtD5uWraRikfvIqGxuf7KY-rw-Gj1OKw7-Q6LKAIYgy6M3fGuMAoxIDK9URAdaZxs2V3MGq_AD7xc7_C2fdACEkbx5ICR86MKKqGgPlPivW_2P4Ml3dtgH-HS8LbArQYKIJzSTi2q4c%3D&amp;tracking_referrer=www.bbc.com">Uncertainty breeds anxiety</a>, research shows, so it’s understandable to feel uneasy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.danielhunter.org/">Daniel Hunter</a>, founder of <a href="https://choosedemocracy.us/">Choose Democracy</a>, an organization that provides resources to help Americans prepare for an undemocratic power grab, says his experience in activism has taught him that the solution isn’t to bury your head in the sand or jump to the worst-case scenario. Try not to paint a narrative of the future based on assumptions. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Consciously engage in that uncertainty and hold there are things we don&#8217;t know,” he says. “We can grieve for the things we know, and we can grieve for the things we don&#8217;t know, the things we&#8217;re not certain about. But that&#8217;s different than telling ourselves a story.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What to do in the weeks, months, and years ahead</h2>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Curb reactionary impulses</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s first administration was a near-daily blitz of chaotic headlines, Hunter says. “Trump would announce at 3 am some new policy that had never been discussed before,” he says. “Then people would feel like we have to react and do something about that. What it meant was we stayed in a constant state, or near-constant state, of Trump setting the agenda.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This time around, try to be more measured and targeted with your reactions, Hunter says. Use moments of outrage to ask yourself what you feel inspired to do and what you’d like to accomplish, “and continue to press forward on those things, regardless of a political context,” he says. Hunter points to the effectiveness of the so-called Muslim ban protests, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-travel-ban-sparks-protests-at-airports-nationwide-seattle-tacoma/">which communicated the public&#8217;s outrage</a> over the policy at airports across the country. “The disruption that happened in the airports,” he says, “was a major piece of putting the pressure on in a material way.”</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Focus on what you can change</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a similar vein, instead of devoting your attention to things you have no power to change, like the enactment of specific policies or Cabinet appointments, Heinz says to focus on what you do have control over. Choose one issue that resonates with you and find ways to get involved locally. “It might be organizing something at the grassroots level to support new families who need child care,” Heinz says. “It could be going to a city council meeting to talk about housing.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can also consider areas where you don’t feel like you have total control, Hill says. “Are you not feeling in control of your livelihood, of your safety, your security, just being able to go out and not be attacked or injured?” The question to then ask is, what can you control to make yourself feel safer during this moment? Perhaps that’s spending more time with friends in your home. “Maybe I want to spend some time beautifying and taking care of it,” Hill says.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Find — or bolster — your community efforts</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Social isolation can <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09567976231156413">make you feel fatigued</a> and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9102031/">emotionally exhausted</a>, studies suggest. Lonely people may also be <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/09/210920121800.htm">less trusting of others</a>, another study found. Surrounding yourself with people you love can bring comfort, Heinz says. The morning the race was called, Hunter texted a few friends to make plans to get together and commiserate, cry, laugh.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Knowing your neighbors and finding local groups of people who champion the same causes as you can help you form community. Anderson recommends <a href="https://www.mobilize.us/">Mobilize</a> to find events and volunteer opportunities near you. Think about what makes you feel like you’ve made a difference in the world. Is it protesting? Working with a mutual aid organization? Making dinner for your elderly neighbor? Ask yourself what issue in your town or city matters the most to you and how you could make an impact there. “Getting people in person with each other is how we&#8217;re going to be able to show up for each other and also get the work done more effectively,” Anderson says.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">You’ve got to live</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Authoritarianism is fueled by fear, isolation, and perceived helplessness, Heinz says. “That combination ultimately leads to psychological exhaustion,” she says. But throwing yourself completely into resistance mode will ultimately lead to burnout. On the other end of the spectrum, there will be moments when you want to curl up in bed and shut out the world, but that isn’t an effective long-term strategy, either.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To keep from full emotional exhaustion, you need to set boundaries. “We need psychological boundaries,” Hunter says, “not on our phones all the time, spaces where we&#8217;re not talking about it.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Take time to rest and recuperate, but don’t disengage. Set time limits on your news consumption, but don’t avoid it completely. Balance upsetting coverage with good news, stories of progress, and examples of people who have gone through tragedy and made it to the other side. Support those you love and stand together with your community to protect others.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“How we live [is] not really a question that&#8217;s intrinsically tied to a political outcome,” Hill says. “Obviously, it has real-life impact, globally and personally, but that philosophical question of how you live your life is not something that can be dictated by other people.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is no sugarcoating it: Donald Trump’s victory on Tuesday is a major setback for many antipoverty policies. With a Republican majority in the Senate (and likely in the House as well), there’s little doubt that spending cuts will be up for debate, and tried-and-failed ideas like imposing work requirements on welfare recipients will be back on the table.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Throughout the campaign, Trump promised that he wouldn’t cut Social Security. But his proposed changes to the program — like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/14/trumps-plan-to-end-taxes-on-social-security-a-fatal-mistake-lawmaker.html">cutting taxes on Social Security benefits</a> — would likely result in <a href="https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/whats-wrong-with-trumps-pledge-to-repeal-taxes-on-social-security-benefits">reducing benefits sooner rather than later</a>. Other tax-cutting ideas, like his “No Tax on Tips” plan, would likely be a <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/366680/no-tax-on-tips-trump-harris-subminimum-wage">bigger payoff for big businesses</a> than for workers because it could push wages down.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of that means, however, that there’s only room for pessimism. As my colleague <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/383186/trump-vance-medicaid-food-stamps-obamacare-poverty">Dylan Matthews wrote</a>, Trump’s first term showed that any major cuts would have a hard time getting passed, even with a Republican majority. And there’s also reason to believe that some programs could even get passed, like some version of an expanded child tax credit that <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/blog/despite-flaws-romney-proposal-on-child-tax-credit-creates-opening-for-bipartisan-action">has had bipartisan support</a> in the past. (Vice President-elect JD Vance, for example, has supported expanding the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jd-vance-child-tax-credit-5000-what-to-know/">child tax credit</a>.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The election results on Tuesday also showed signs of hope — a roadmap for what an antipoverty agenda could look like under a second Trump presidency. Because while Democrats lost the presidential race, voters didn’t necessarily reject their policies. In various states, <a href="https://www.epi.org/blog/a-review-of-key-2024-ballot-measures-voters-backed-progressive-policy-measures/">voters supported progressive priorities</a> through ballot measures, including minimum wage hikes, paid sick leave, and expanded labor rights. If Democrats want to have a productive four years under Trump, there’s a lot they can do at the state level — if not in the legislatures, then at the ballot box.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>One positive election outcome? Voters raised the minimum wage.</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In five states, voters got to have a say in their minimum wage laws.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Missouri, for example, <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/11/05/missourians-vote-to-increase-minimum-wage-require-paid-sick-leave/">voters passed a minimum wage hike</a>, raising it from $12.30 per hour to $15 by 2026. The new law pegs the minimum wage to inflation, which means that workers don’t have to wait for another law to pass to keep up with rising costs. More than 562,000 workers will see their wages rise as a result of the law, <a href="https://mobudget.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MinWage-Earned-Sick-Leave-Analysis.pdf">according to the Missouri Budget Project</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Alaskans also voted on <a href="https://alaskapublic.org/2024/10/24/alaska-business-are-divided-over-a-ballot-measure-that-would-raise-minimum-wage-and-mandate-sick-leave/">raising the minimum wage</a> to $15 per hour, up from $11.73, and the measure is <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2024/11/05/ballot-measure-1-aimed-at-boosting-alaska-minimum-wage-passing-by-wide-margin-in-early-returns/">on track to pass</a>. It would increase earnings for nearly 10 percent of the workforce, <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/alaskas-minimum-wage/">according to the Economic Policy Institute</a>. In California, voters were asked to raise the state’s minimum wage to $18 per hour, but the results are still too close to call.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Arizona, voters protected worker pay by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-arizona-proposition-138-allow-employers-to-reduce-wages-of-tipped-employees.html">overwhelmingly rejecting</a> a measure that would have allowed employers to reduce base wages for tipped workers. In Massachusetts, however, there was a different story. Voters <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2024/11/06/tipped-workers-wages-ballot-question-5-results">didn’t approve a ballot measure</a> that would have supported tipped workers. Tipped workers in the state are now paid $6.75 per hour, but had the measure passed, they would have eventually <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2024/11/06/tipped-workers-wages-ballot-question-5-results">been paid the standard minimum wage</a>, which now sits at $15.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The benefits of a higher minimum wage are clear: Workers at the bottom automatically see their incomes rise. But efforts to raise the minimum wage often face opposition because business interests argue that they would result in job losses or increased prices. In the case of Massachusetts, the proposal was <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/10/23/business/massachusetts-tipped-worker-ballot-measure-question-5/">strongly opposed</a> by restaurant lobbying groups.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The evidence points to a different reality. In states that have increased the minimum wage, there was <a href="https://www.epi.org/blog/most-minimum-wage-studies-have-found-little-or-no-job-loss/">little to no impact</a> on the number of jobs. Some studies have <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/higher-minimum-wages-support-job-growth-economy-recovers-covid-19/">even shown</a> that a hike in the minimum wage <a href="https://sp2.upenn.edu/study-increasing-minimum-wage-has-positive-effects-on-employment-in-fast-food-sector-and-other-highly-concentrated-labor-markets/">can also lead to higher employment</a> in certain labor markets in part because they attract more workers. And states that have gotten rid of subminimum wages <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/ending-tipped-minimum-wage-will-reduce-poverty-inequality/">have seen lower poverty rates</a> among tipped workers than states that haven’t.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://irle.berkeley.edu/publications/working-papers/sectoral-wage-setting-in-california/">Recent research</a> from the Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics at the University of California, Berkeley, <a href="https://irle.berkeley.edu/publications/press-release/new-study-analyzes-impact-of-californias-20-minimum-wage-for-fast-food-workers/">found</a> that a higher minimum wage did not necessarily lead to significantly higher prices. After California <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-fast-food-20-minimum-wage-law-prices/">raised the minimum wage</a> for fast food workers up to $20 per hour earlier this year, employment remained stable and prices didn’t dramatically change. According to the study, popular menu items were about 3.7 percent more expensive — about a 15-cent increase for a $4 hamburger.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The next four years will be about the small wins</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s worth noting that during Trump’s first term, when Democrats had control of the House, the former president <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/27/politics/trump-relief-bill-christmas-eve/index.html">signed</a> some major antipoverty measures into law, including rental assistance, boosted unemployment benefits, and stimulus checks. Of course, that was prompted by a pandemic, a global disaster that we hopefully won’t see a repeat of anytime soon. So that kind of policy at the federal level is highly unlikely to pass in the next four years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s why Democratic lawmakers and antipoverty advocates have to focus on the state level to deliver meaningful improvements to people’s lives. The ballot measures on Tuesday, some of which <a href="https://www.epi.org/blog/a-review-of-key-2024-ballot-measures-voters-backed-progressive-policy-measures/">also included provisions</a> that require employers to offer their workers paid sick leave, showed that the public has an appetite for policies that would reduce poverty. And while voters in Massachusetts rejected abolishing the subminimum wage for tipped workers, <a href="https://www.masslive.com/politics/2024/11/mass-election-results-question-3-authorizing-rideshare-union-on-brink-of-approval.html">they passed a ballot measure</a> that allows rideshare drivers to unionize.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democrats should capitalize on that because it can genuinely make a big difference. Even though the federal minimum wage, which is $7.25 per hour, hasn’t changed in 15 years, <a href="https://www.epi.org/minimum-wage-tracker/">at least 30 states and Washington, DC</a>, have implemented a higher minimum wage.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sometimes, major breakthroughs don’t come from one major legislative overhaul from Congress. They can also be a series of small wins. And we should take them wherever we can.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After winning the 2024 election in part due to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383397/economy-inflation-2024-election-democrats-trump">high inflation early in President Joe Biden’s term</a>, President-elect Donald Trump wants to enact policies that would lead to the very same kind of inflation that doomed Democrats.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though Trump inherits a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383397/economy-inflation-2024-election-democrats-trump">strong economy and low inflation</a>, he’s proposed a <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/381637/elon-musk-donald-trump-2024-election-temporary-hardship">10 to 20 percent tariff on all imports</a>, and a 60 percent tariff on all imports from China. The Budget Lab at Yale estimates that this policy alone could <a href="https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/fiscal-macroeconomic-and-price-estimates-tariffs-under-both-non-retaliation-and-retaliation">raise consumer prices by as much as 5.1 percent</a> and could diminish US economic growth by up to 1.4 percent. An analysis by the think tank Peterson Institute for International Economics, finds that Trump’s tariffs, when combined with some of his other proposals such as <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies">mass deportation</a>, would lead to inflation <a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2024/how-much-would-trumps-plans-deportations-tariffs-and-fed-damage-us">rising between 6 and 9.3 percent</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Trump pushes through his proposed tariffs, they will undoubtedly be challenged in court — and, most likely, in the Supreme Court. There are no shortages of businesses that might be hurt financially by these tariffs, and any one of them could file a lawsuit.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That raises a difficult question: Will this Supreme Court permit Trump to enact policies that could sabotage his presidency, and with it, the Republican Party’s hopes of a political realignment that could doom Democrats to the wilderness?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The legal arguments in favor of allowing Trump to unilaterally impose high tariffs are <a href="https://www.cassidylevy.com/news/across-the-board-tariffs-can-a-us-president-do-that/">surprisingly strong</a>. Several federal laws give the president exceedingly broad power to impose tariffs, and the limits imposed by these statutes are quite vague.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A presidential proclamation imposing such tariffs wouldn’t be unprecedented. In 1971, President Richard Nixon <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/proclamation-4074-imposition-supplemental-duty-for-balance-payments-purposes">imposed a 10 percent tariff on nearly all foreign goods</a>, which a <a href="https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-yoshida-intern-inc">federal appeals court upheld</a>. Congress has since amended some of the laws Nixon relied on, but a key provision allowing the president to regulate importation of “<a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title50-section1702(b)(3)&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim">any property in which any foreign country or any national thereof has or has had any interest</a>” remains on the books.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The judiciary does have one way it might constrain Trump’s tariffs: The Supreme Court’s Republican majority has given itself an <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/23791610/supreme-court-major-questions-doctrine-nebraska-biden-student-loans-gorsuch-barrett">unchecked veto power</a> over any policy decision by the executive branch that those justices deem to be too ambitious. In <em>Biden v. Nebraska</em> (2023), for example, the Republican justices struck down the Biden administration’s primary student loans forgiveness program, despite the fact that the program is <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/6/30/23779903/supreme-court-student-loan-biden-nebraska-john-roberts">unambiguously authorized by a federal statute</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Nebraska</em> suggests a Nixon-style tariff should be struck down — at least if the Republican justices want to use their self-given power to veto executive branch actions consistently. <em>Nebraska</em> claimed that the Court’s veto power is at an apex when the executive enacts a policy of “<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/22-506_nmip.pdf">vast ‘economic and political significance</a>.” A presidential proclamation that could bring back 2022 inflation levels certainly seem to fit within this framework.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The question is whether a Republican Supreme Court will value loyalty to a Republican administration, and thus uphold Trump’s tariffs; or whether they will prefer to prop up Trump’s presidency by vetoing a policy that could make him unpopular and potentially invite the Democratic Party back into power.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After the Court’s decision holding that Trump is allowed to <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/366855/supreme-court-trump-immunity-betrayal-worst-decisions-anticanon">use the powers of the presidency to commit crimes</a>, it is naive to think that this Court’s decisions are driven solely – or even primarily – by what the law and the Constitution actually have to say about legal questions. But that does not mean that this Court will necessarily strike down a Republican tariff policy that could do long term damage to the GOP.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The federal laws governing tariffs give the president an enormous amount of power</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tariffs are often viewed as economic weapons that the United States can use to combat other nation’s activities that undermine US interests. For this reason, federal law gives the president significant power to impose new tariffs after an appropriate federal agency determines that deploying such a weapon is justified.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One striking thing about these laws, however, is that they focus far more on process than on substance. Federal tariff laws tend to lay out a procedure the federal government must follow before it can authorize a new tariff, but they place few explicit restrictions on the nature of those tariffs once the process is followed. The Trump administration must follow certain processes to create new tariffs, but so long as it follows that process it has broad latitude over tariff policy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Consider, for example, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/19/2411">Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974</a>. This law requires the US trade representative, a Cabinet-level official appointed by the president, to make certain findings before their power to issue new tariffs is triggered. But specific findings the trade representative must make before acting are quite vague. The power to issue tariffs can be triggered if the trade representative finds that a foreign country is engaged in activity that “is unjustifiable and burdens or restricts United States commerce,” or that is “unreasonable or discriminatory and burdens or restricts United States commerce.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So that’s not much of an explicit limit on tariffs — the government’s power to issue them is triggered if a Cabinet official determines that a foreign nation’s behavior is “unreasonable.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Once the trade representative makes this determination, their powers are quite broad. The government may “impose duties or other import restrictions on the goods of, and, notwithstanding any other provision of law, fees or restrictions on the services of, such foreign country for such time as the trade representative determines appropriate.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As my colleague Dylan Matthews <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/374102/trump-harris-tariffs-congress">notes</a>, “Trump used this power to impose <a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/row/IF10708.pdf">sweeping tariffs against China</a>. Biden has made liberal use of this power, too, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/14/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-action-to-protect-american-workers-and-businesses-from-chinas-unfair-trade-practices/">expanding tariffs</a> on steel, batteries, solar cells, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/2024/3/4/24087919/biden-tariff-chinese-ev-byd-battery-detroit">electric vehicles from China</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another statute gives the president <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/19/1862">similarly broad authority</a> to impose tariffs after the commerce secretary conducts an investigation and determines that a foreign good “is being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security.” In his first term, Trump used this to tax imports of steel and aluminum.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And then there’s the authority that Nixon used in 1971 to issue broad new tariffs on a variety of imports. In its current form, this law allows the president to act <a href="https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep468/usrep468222/usrep468222.pdf">only after they declare a national emergency</a> “to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States.” But the law <a href="https://www.cassidylevy.com/news/across-the-board-tariffs-can-a-us-president-do-that/">doesn’t define terms</a> like “national emergency” or “unusual and extraordinary threat.” And, once such an emergency is declared, the president’s power is quite broad.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is the law that also permits the president to regulate importation of “<a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title50-section1702(b)(3)&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim">any property in which any foreign country or any national thereof has or has had any interest</a>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s important to emphasize that, while these laws impose few substantive limits on tariffs, they do require Trump to jump through certain procedural hoops — and his administration struggled with such procedural barriers in his first term. In 2020, for example, a 5-4 Supreme Court rejected the administration’s attempt to eliminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allows hundreds of thousands of undocumented young immigrants to live and work in the US, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/6/18/21295518/supreme-court-daca-trump-roberts-regents-university-california-homeland-security">due to a paperwork error</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, assuming the second Trump administration is staffed with competent lawyers who can navigate procedural hurdles more deftly this time, federal law places few explicit limits on the president’s power to issue tariffs.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>How the Court could veto Trump’s tariffs, if a majority of the justices want to do so</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The strongest legal argument against Trump’s proposed tariff policy involves something called the “<a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/23791610/supreme-court-major-questions-doctrine-nebraska-biden-student-loans-gorsuch-barrett">major questions doctrine</a>,” a power that the Supreme Court gave itself in recent years, which has only ever been used to block policies handed down by the Biden administration. The Court has <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/6/30/23779903/supreme-court-student-loan-biden-nebraska-john-roberts">never explained where this major questions doctrine comes from</a>, and has never attempted to ground it in any statute or constitutional provision — although some individual justices have written concurring opinions that attempt to do so.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When summarizing this fabricated legal doctrine, the Court often quotes a line from <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/573/302/"><em>Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA</em></a> (2014), which states that “we expect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast ‘economic and political significance.’” But the justices have <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/23791610/supreme-court-major-questions-doctrine-nebraska-biden-student-loans-gorsuch-barrett">only provided vague guidance</a> on just how “clearly” Congress must write a statute if it wants to give broad policymaking authority to an agency, so it is unclear if this Court would follow a statute permitting the president to tax “any property” that “any foreign country” has “any interest” in.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The major questions doctrine is a new legal concept, which is poorly defined and which has never been used to block any policy by a Republican president — or, indeed, any president not named “Joe Biden” (some scholars argue that the Court applied an early version of the doctrine in <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/529/120/"><em>FDA v. Brown &amp; Williamson</em></a> (2000) to block a Clinton administration policy, but the Court’s reasoning in that case <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/23791610/supreme-court-major-questions-doctrine-nebraska-biden-student-loans-gorsuch-barrett">bears only a passing resemblance</a> to its reasoning in its Biden-era decisions). Because this doctrine is so ill-defined, a lawyer can only guess at whether this Court will apply it to the Trump administration at all, or specifically to Trump’s tariff policies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, there is both a principled argument for why it might apply to Trump, and a cynical one.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The principled one is that the law should be the same regardless of which party controls the White House. So, if the <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/371361/supreme-court-call-republican-justices-republicans">Republican justices</a> insisted on vetoing Biden administration policies they deemed too ambitious, they should also veto similarly ambitious Trump administration policies. Under this argument, the major questions doctrine may still be bad law that the Republican justices pulled out of thin air, but the least they can do is apply it equally harshly to presidents of both parties.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The cynical argument, meanwhile, is that Democrats got crushed at the polls, despite low inflation and a strong economy, seemingly in part because they <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383397/economy-inflation-2024-election-democrats-trump">held power during a period of high inflation</a>. If Trump gets to implement his tariffs, that would also likely trigger a period of similarly high inflation, and that would be bad for the political party that controls the Supreme Court.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>So what should the Supreme Court do?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has proposed many policies that violate the Constitution. If he follows through on his <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-suggests-re-elected-biden-indicted-rcna132810">threats to have his political enemies arrested</a>, that would violate the First Amendment and may violate the Fourth Amendment’s requirement that law enforcement must have “<a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-4/">probable cause</a>” to make an arrest. Depending on how Trump conducts his deportation policies, they may violate constitutional due process guarantees. His <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/20/trump-lgbtq-second-term-agenda/">anti-transgender policies</a> could violate <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/3/14/23635663/supreme-court-transgender-sports-constitution-stanford-kyle-duncan-protest">constitutional protections against discrimination</a>, and some of his policies targeting incarcerated transgender people could violate the Constitution’s ban on “<a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-8/">cruel and unusual punishments</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there’s nothing in the Constitution that prohibits tariffs. Tariffs are a common part of US economic and foreign policy. Federal laws that long predate the Trump administration give the president broad authority over tariffs. And there’s even a precedent, from the Nixon administration, for the kind of sweeping tariffs that Trump says he wants to implement.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The coming legal fight over tariffs presents a dilemma. A decision against the tariffs would consolidate more power in an unelected Supreme Court, and breathe more life into a legal doctrine that has no basis in law. A decision for the tariffs, however, would cause needless misery to millions of Americans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Constitution itself is pretty clear about what should happen in this case. When a duly elected president violates the Constitution or a federal law, it’s the Supreme Court’s job to step in. But when the president merely enacts an unwise economic policy, the Court is supposed to play no role whatsoever — even if this policy is likely to hurt the nation or the political party that controls the Court. Trump’s tariffs are unwise, but assuming that he implements them in compliance with federal law, they are not unconstitutional.</p>

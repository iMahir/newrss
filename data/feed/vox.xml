<p class="has-text-align-none">This past weekend, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1840409051357696324">X owner Elon Musk</a> elevated a false right-wing talking point about immigration, claiming Democrats were fast-tracking citizenship applications to rig elections in the party’s favor.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If even 1 in 20 illegals become citizens per year, something that the Democrats are expediting as fast as humanly possible, that would be about 2 million new legal voters in 4 years,” <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1840409051357696324">Musk claimed</a>. “The voting margin in the swing states is often less than 20 thousand votes. That means if the ‘Democratic’ Party succeeds, there will be no more swing states!!”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a baseless allegation, and one that advances the far-right’s racist <a href="https://www.vox.com/23076952/replacement-theory-white-supremacist-violence">“Great Replacement Theory,”</a> which suggests that Democrats are utilizing immigration policies <a href="https://immigrationforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Replacement-Theory-Explainer-1122.pdf">to replace white Americans</a> — in this case, white voters — with minorities. It’s also an argument that’s resonating broadly with Republicans, <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/10-million-illegal-aliens-newly-registered/">particularly on X</a>, where <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/370760/jd-vance-racist-cat-eating-haitian-immigrants">lies about immigration</a> have been given a large platform in recent weeks.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These falsehoods are also being amplified by far more than just right-wing social media users. A myth about the prevalence of noncitizen voting <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/370713/republican-government-shutdown-save-act-voter-disenfranchisement">briefly led to a government shutdown threat</a>. Former President Donald Trump has been key to spreading these ideas, noting in the presidential debate with <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/11/g-s1-21932/fact-check-trump-harris-presidential-debate-2024">Vice President Kamala Harris earlier this year</a> that “a lot of these illegal immigrants coming in, they’re trying to get them to vote.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These lies — given their focus on voting — could have serious consequences as the 2024 election approaches, sowing doubts about the legitimacy of election results.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With Trump <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/09/29/trump-voter-fraud-2024-election">already priming his supporters</a> for another round of election denialism in case of a potential loss, the GOP’s fixation on noncitizens and “illegal” immigrants voting is only helping him further lay that groundwork.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Republicans are fixated on lies about immigrant voting&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Musk claims:</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Very few Americans realize that, if Trump is NOT elected, this will be the last election. Far from being a threat to democracy, he is the only way to save it!<br><br>Let me explain: if even 1 in 20 illegals become citizens per year, something that the Democrats are expediting as fast… <a href="https://t.co/u3HBdd5Bv0">https://t.co/u3HBdd5Bv0</a></p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1840409051357696324?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">His claims, however, don’t match up to the facts. Here’s what we know:</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Claim: </strong>Democrats are making unauthorized immigrants citizens to tilt the election in their favor.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Reality:</strong> Unauthorized immigrants aren’t broadly eligible for naturalization — and have few paths to citizenship. To qualify for naturalization, <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship-resource-center/naturalization-statistics#:~:text=In%20general%2C%20a%20noncitizen%20must,as%20a%20lawful%20permanent%20resident.">someone generally has to have been a lawful permanent resident for five years</a>, married to a US citizen and a lawful permanent resident for three years, or a member of the military.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Additionally, the US is approving citizenship applications at its swiftest pace in years, but it’s not because regulators are trying to skew the election in Democrats’ favor. The government is doing so because there was already a backlog that got worse during the pandemic, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2024-09-26/with-an-election-looming-the-u-s-is-approving-citizenship-applications-at-the-fastest-speed-in-years">the Los Angeles Times reports.</a> Now, the Department of Homeland Security is effectively doing catch-up.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US naturalized <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship-resource-center/naturalization-statistics">878,500 people in 2023</a> and is now processing applications in roughly 4.9 months – a pace that’s comparable to how quickly the government was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/us/immigration-us-citizenship-rates.html">approving applications in 2013.</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/us/immigration-us-citizenship-rates.html">According to the New York Times</a>, processing time for naturalization applications spiked during the Trump administration as the White House sought to reduce legal and unauthorized immigration.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These new citizens also aren’t guaranteed Democratic voters. Polling has indicated that naturalized citizens lean Democrat, but both parties are likely to pick up some new voters as people undergo this process. According to a <a href="https://thehill.com/latino/4869779-naturalized-citizens-vote-november-trump-harris/">survey from the National Partnership for New Americans,</a> 54 percent of naturalized citizens said they’d vote for Vice President Kamala Harris in November, while 38 percent said they’d back former President Donald Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s worth reiterating that naturalized citizens aren’t unauthorized immigrants, and that the bulk of them — roughly 83 percent, according to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services — have been lawful permanent residents for five years. Unauthorized immigrants have <a href="https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/why-don%E2%80%99t-they-just-get-line">limited pathways to citizenship</a>, and many aren’t eligible for naturalization.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Claim: </strong>According to Musk, “the Biden/Harris administration has been flying ‘asylum seekers’, who are fast-tracked to citizenship, directly into swing states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and Arizona.”<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Reality: </strong>This Republican talking point appears to refer to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-misinformation-immigrants-parole-biden-trump-musk-dbd634820b3f8d07b859b8a05b2b20a7">a “parole” program the Biden administration</a> has approved for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans amid instability in their home countries. Under the program, people can temporarily enter the US for two years, pay for their own travel, and fly to designated places. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/01/trump-maga-misinformation/?_pml=1" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/01/trump-maga-misinformation/?_pml=1">There is no evidence</a> that people are being flown specifically to swing states, and<strong> </strong>as a US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) spokesperson told Vox, DHS does not control or choose where parolees settle down. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Additionally, parolees do not have a path to citizenship and as a result would be unable to vote in future elections.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As legal immigrants, asylum seekers do have a path to citizenship; according to <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship-resource-center/naturalization-statistics">US Citizenship and Immigration Services</a> (USCIS), 3.3 percent of those naturalized in 2023 came to the US as asylum seekers — roughly 29,000 people. While that might be enough to swing a state as close as <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/results/state/georgia">Georgia was in 2020</a>, it’s not enough to affect the outcomes in all the states Musk listed, even if Democrats were flying people there. Which, again, they aren’t.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition, most naturalized citizens have settled in states that are not swing states, with California, Texas, Florida, New York, and New Jersey topping the list, <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship-resource-center/naturalization-statistics">per USCIS</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s one other key conservative falsehood when it comes to immigrants and voting, and it’s one that appears to have touched off Musk’s tweet.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) highlighted the claim in a tweet a user responded to; Musk then responded to that post. <a href="https://x.com/BasedMikeLee/status/1840121233343689110">According to Lee</a>, “thousands of noncitizen voter files are being discovered in state after state, Democrats are trying to stop those states from removing noncitizens from their voter files.” The senator went on to claim that this is why Republicans’ failed <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/370713/republican-government-shutdown-save-act-voter-disenfranchisement">SAVE Act, which would have required proof of citizenship to vote</a>,<strong> </strong>should have passed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Claim: </strong>Noncitizens are being allowed to vote and help Democrats win federal elections.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Democrats insisted “noncitizens don’t vote”<br><br>On that basis, they blocked the SAVE Act<br><br>Now that thousands of noncitizen voter files are being discovered in state after state, Democrats are trying to stop those states from removing noncitizens from their voter files<br><br>Infuriating <a href="https://t.co/iWLWNsOdhV">https://t.co/iWLWNsOdhV</a></p>&mdash; Mike Lee (@BasedMikeLee) <a href="https://twitter.com/BasedMikeLee/status/1840121233343689110?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Reality: </strong>It is illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections, and noncitizens have very rarely been found to be illegally voting. <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/09/elon-musk-noncitizen-voting-tweet-lies-disinformation/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/09/elon-musk-noncitizen-voting-tweet-lies-disinformation/">According to the Brennan Center for Justice,</a> a left-leaning nonprofit that focuses on voting rights, election officials responsible for the counting of nearly 23.5 million votes in 2016 identified just 30 possible cases of noncitizen voting for investigation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Noncitizens are able to vote in some local elections for positions like City Council and school board in some jurisdictions in Vermont and California, but they aren’t able to vote anywhere in federal elections.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Republicans are stoking immigration fears</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Republicans are taking this approach because of how salient the <a href="https://theconversation.com/us-election-why-immigration-remains-a-major-issue-for-voters-and-why-they-trust-trump-on-border-security-238263">issue is once again proving this election cycle</a> and because more voters have said they’d do a better job on <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/first-read/poll-republicans-advantages-immigration-crime-economy-rcna117054">border security than Democrats.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/368889/immigration-border-polls-election-2024-trump-harris">As Vox’s Nicole Narea reported</a>, a majority of Americans — 55 percent, the highest proportion in years — would like to see immigration levels decrease in the US. To capitalize on these sentiments, Republicans have positioned themselves as the party with solutions on this issue, framing Democrats’ so-called laxness at the border as the cause of immigration problems.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The issue has gained new attention amid <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/10/01/migrant-encounters-at-u-s-mexico-border-have-fallen-sharply-in-2024/">record-high border crossings in late 2023</a>, which have declined since, and an influx of migrants in several major cities.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By linking existing concerns about immigration with voting, Republicans are once again using misinformation to undermine trust in the election system. Already, there’s significant <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/08/01/many-americans-are-confident-the-2024-election-will-be-conducted-fairly-but-wide-partisan-differences-remain/">skepticism about election security</a>, in part due to Trump and other prominent leaders’ <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/30/politics/fact-check-trump-election-lies-2024/index.html">emphatic election denialism</a>. An <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/thirds-americans-trump-unprepared-accept-election-outcome-poll/story?id=113246372">August ABC/Ipsos poll</a> found nearly 25 percent of Trump supporters aren’t prepared to accept the election results, regardless of outcome. Claims that something is amiss with who is voting could exacerbate these concerns, especially if they play on existing anti-immigrant biases.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since Republicans are coalescing around these lies about immigrant voting, it’s not far-fetched to believe Trump, if he loses, could try to claim that noncitizens swayed the election for Harris, especially since he <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/11/19/fact-check-claim-voting-noncitizens-2020-election-unverified/6237115002/">blamed noncitizens for his loss in 2020 and his loss of the popular vote in 2016</a>. Should he try to do so again, he’s poised to replicate the chaos and confusion that resulted from Republicans leaning into false concerns about election fraud during the last election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You wouldn’t expect to find the linchpin of the global microchip industry tucked away in a Blue Ridge Mountains town, but it’s there. Scattered across the outskirts of Spruce Pine, a series of mines has been extracting some of the purest quartz on Earth for decades. The resource is so essential that almost every advanced microchip produced today touches it during the manufacturing process.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those mines are now closed indefinitely, after Hurricane Helene dumped 2 feet of water on Spruce Pine, devastating the area. And with this singular supply of ultra-pure quartz cut off for the foreseeable future, the world’s supply of chips hangs in the balance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To be clear, Spruce Pine is not the only place on the planet with high-purity quartz. Quartz, which is mostly made of crystallized silicon, is the second-most abundant mineral in Earth’s crust. But what’s beneath Spruce Pine <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/book-excerpt-science-of-ultra-pure-silicon/">is special</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Spruce Pine lies along a ridge of the Appalachian Mountains that were formed when two paleocontinents collided to create a single landmass, Pangea, some 380 million years ago. The precise conditions around that collision meant <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2023/07/world-built-sand-ed-conway-material-world-review">few impurities mixed into the molten minerals</a> that swirled miles beneath the surface. Now cooled and worn, the rocks around Spruce Pine has the look of <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1295811956/schorl-tourmaline-in-quartz-from-spruce">a dirty snowball</a> thanks to a combination of feldspar, mica, and quartz. When ground up, it just looks like white sand, but when isolated, the quartz is perhaps the purest in the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It&#8217;s not like the silicon that comes out of the ground in North Carolina then becomes part of a silicon chip,” said Ed Conway, author of<em> <a href="https://edconway.substack.com/p/welcome-to-the-material-world">Material World</a></em>. “But you can&#8217;t make a silicon chip without it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because it needs minimal refining after being pulled from the ground, Spruce Pine quartz is also cheaper than the competition. That doesn’t mean it’s cheap. High-purity Spruce Pine quartz can sell for <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2020-11-11/sand-traps-augusta-national-masters-tiger-woods-jim-nantz">up to $20,000 per ton</a>, and the waste materials from mining are pristine enough that they’re even used to fill the bunkers at the Augusta National Golf Course, home of the Master’s tournament.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The high-silicon, low-contaminant nature of Spruce Pine quartz makes it integral to advanced chip manufacturing, where even an atomic quantity of impurity <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/inside-story-of-the-great-silicon-heist/">can jam up the circuitry etched into a semiconductor</a>. The chips themselves aren’t actually made of quartz. High-purity quartz crucibles are used to melt down polysilicon, the pure silicon needed to make computer chips and solar panels. The crucibles only last a few weeks before they need to be replaced, and the need for advanced chips is increasing at a breakneck pace. A surge in AI-powered devices is expected to increase global demand for advanced chips by at least 30 percent by 2026, according to <a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/prepare-for-the-coming-ai-chip-shortage-tech-report-2024/">a recent Bain report</a> that warned of an imminent shortage.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By some estimates, Spruce Pine <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/hurricane-helene-shockwaves-semiconductor-industry-microchips-spruce-pine-north-carolina-sand-high-quality-quartz/">accounted for 70 percent</a> of the high-purity quartz needed to produce the pure silicon used to make most advanced chips, including those needed for AI. On top of that, a single company in Taiwan, TSMC, <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/03/06/taiwans-dominance-of-the-chip-industry-makes-it-more-important">manufactures the majority of those chips</a>. And now, the disaster in Spruce Pine is drawing attention to how fragile the global chip supply chain already is.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Maybe this event gets people to think about alternatives, different crucibles, different ways to make silicon,” said Dustin Mulvaney, an environmental studies professor at San Jose State University who studies solar cell supply chains.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-2175040571.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="A photo of a railway going over a bride, much of which is destroyed and scattered with debris. " title="A photo of a railway going over a bride, much of which is destroyed and scattered with debris. " data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Hurricane Helene took out much of the infrastructure the Spruce Pine mines need to move their high-purity quartz out of North Carolina. | Melissa Sue Gerrits/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Melissa Sue Gerrits/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">We don’t yet know how bad the damage is at the Spruce Pine mining facilities. The two companies that own most of the quartz mines, Sibelco and the Quartz Corp, both halted production on September 26, as the storm was moving through western North Carolina. Images of Spruce Pine show the downtown completely flooded and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/10/01/flooding-north-carolina-sand-quartz-electronics-supply-chain/">buildings washed out near the rail lines</a> that connect the mines to the rest of the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sibelco said in a statement that it was “actively collaborating with government agencies and third-party rescue and recovery operations to mitigate the impact of this event and to resume operations as soon as possible.” The Quartz Corp is similarly assessing the situation at its three mines in the area as well as the infrastructure around them, and “its US plants are stopped for an unknown duration,” the company’s spokesperson May Kristin Haugen said in an email.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As for how much this will upend the global chip supply chain, well, we’ll have to wait and see.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even with the Spruce Pine mines offline, chipmakers should have stockpiles of polysilicon or the ultra-pure quartz they need to make it available for some amount of time. And if they run out of the Spruce Pine quartz, there are other sources of quartz in places like China and India that are viable but not as high quality or cost effective.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And, perhaps anticipating some future disaster, the mining companies in Spruce Pine don’t keep all their high-purity quartz on site. “Between our own safety stocks, which are built in different locations, and the ones down in the value chain, we are not concerned about shortages in the short or medium term,” said Haugen, who cited the pandemic as a teaching moment in supply chain resiliency.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What we might expect, however, is prices of some electronics to rise. If there’s not enough Spruce Pine quartz to go around, especially in the long term, the industry will have to come up with alternative sources of high-purity quartz. The methods for refining those minerals elsewhere are more resource intensive and potentially carry a heavier carbon footprint because the quartz used as a raw material doesn’t start out as pure as the quartz from Spruce Pine. As one expert <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/hurricane-helene-shockwaves-semiconductor-industry-microchips-spruce-pine-north-carolina-sand-high-quality-quartz/">told Wired magazine</a>, the climate-fueled flooding in western North Carolina could lead to more negative consequences for the climate, contributing to more disasters in the future.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To many casual technology users, this all comes as a surprise. After all, we’re used to thinking about chips being designed in Silicon Valley and then made in Taiwan. Of course these places aren’t safe from shocks — earthquakes and wildfires are a threat in Southern California and Taiwan is prone to earthquakes and landslides. We don’t often think about the many raw materials needed to fill the supply chain and the globalized economy’s habit of always seeking out the cheapest available option, even if it comes from a single small town in the Blue Ridge Mountains that happens to be prone to floods.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We just don’t pay much attention, or as much attention as we should, to the underbelly of our economy,” said Conway. “And this is part of the underbelly.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel has begun a military invasion of Lebanon it said <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/09/30/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas-war-news-gaza/">would be “limited,”</a> following days of bombing campaigns near and within the capital, Beirut.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Israeli military <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/01/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah/here-are-the-latest-developments?smid=url-share">said</a> that it had moved one army division, typically numbering around 10,000 troops, to the Lebanese border and told Lebanese civilians in about two dozen villages in the area to move north.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That invasion marks a dangerous new phase in the long conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Islamist militant organization and Lebanese political party that has fought Israel since its founding decades ago. Israel has recently escalated its attacks on Hezbollah, <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/10/28/23935157/hezbollah-lebanon-israel-hamas-palestine-gaza-iran-militia-group">assassinating the group’s reclusive leader</a>, Hassan Nasrallah, in a bombing in a Beirut suburb on Friday after reportedly launching a <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/372399/pager-explosions-lebanon-syria-hezbollah-israel-gaza">series of attacks on thousands of mobile devices</a> used by members of Hezbollah throughout Lebanon.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel’s latest operations have been costly: More than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/israel-strikes-yemen-lebanon-attack-hezbollah-middle-east-war-latest">1,000 Lebanese have been killed, 6,000 wounded</a>, and as many as a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgveeyrl47o">million displaced</a> in recent weeks, according to Lebanese government officials. Hezbollah’s recent attacks on Israel — largely missile strikes — have meanwhile left at least <a href="https://www.jns.org/idf-probing-cause-of-sirens-in-central-israel/">eight</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/25/g-s1-24452/hezbollah-fires-missile-tel-aviv">people</a> wounded in the last week.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although the two sides have fought on and off over the decades, Hezbollah has been engaged in more intense fighting with Israel since the October 7 attacks on Israel by Hamas last year. Hezbollah has vowed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas/here-are-the-latest-developments-on-strikes-in-lebanon?smid=url-share">continue its missile strikes</a> into Israeli territory until Israel agrees to a ceasefire in Gaza, where at least <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-death-toll-how-many-palestinians-has-israels-campaign-killed-2024-07-25/">40,000 Palestinians</a> have been killed. Israel has shown no sign it is contemplating ending its operations, either. The country’s leaders have said they want to <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-podcast/352059/why-israel-cant-destroy-hamas">completely eradicate Hamas</a>, and Israel’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/us-looks-unable-to-talk-netanyahu-out-of-planned-invasion-of-lebanon">defense minister said Monday</a> that the “next stage in the war against Hezbollah will begin soon.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Key allies also seem unable to end the fighting. The United States reportedly had a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/us/politics/us-israel-lebanon-hezbollah.html">Hezbollah-Israel peace plan that it has now abandoned</a>. While the US has publicly told Israel it should try to deescalate the situation, the US <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/30/us-israel-military-hezbollah-00181797">reportedly privately offered Israel support</a> for its Hezbollah strategy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, Iranian officials have responded to Israel’s recent attacks with a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/iran-launched-ballistic-missile-attack-israel-rcna173434">ballistic missile strike</a> on Tuesday. The regime launched at least <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-news-10-01-2024-eb175dff6e46906caea8b9e43dfbd3da">180 missiles at Israel</a>, though <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-us-prepared-israel-defend-iranian-attack/story?id=114393069">US forces in the region</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-what-to-know-hezbollah-incursion-c44358cb4c70db69bdab4b254cb2ed76">Israel’s own missile defense system </a>intercepted most.<strong> </strong>Iran’s mission to the UN suggested the country did not have further attacks in store, <a href="https://x.com/Iran_UN/status/1841162849286308106">writing on X</a> that the country’s “response … has been duly carried out,” though it added the threat: “Should the Zionist regime dare to respond or commit further acts of malevolence, a subsequent and crushing response will ensue.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here is what we do know so far about what has happened, and what’s likely to come next.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How did we get here?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The animosity between Hezbollah and Israel is decades old; in fact, Hezbollah formed in <a href="https://merip.org/1982/09/the-war-in-lebanon/">1982 in southern Lebanon</a> as a response to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2022/6/4/a-cosmic-stink-israels-invasion-of-lebanon-40-years-on">Israel’</a>s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1982/09/03/war-casualties-put-at-48000-in-lebanon/cf593941-6067-4239-a453-71bdcaf9eba0/">disastrous invasion</a>, which killed tens of thousands of Lebanese, and subsequent decades-long occupation of that area. Hezbollah <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/may/24/israelandthepalestinians.lebanon">waged guerilla warfare against Israeli troops for decades</a>, and Israel finally left in 2000 following years of brutal fighting and a UN resolution requiring it to do so.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The two sides settled into a conflict that simmered until 2006. After Hezbollah killed eight Israeli soldiers and captured two others, Israel responded with a counterattack that led to a short, bloody war in which <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/echoes-of-2006-israel-hezbollah-and-the-potential-for-regional-war/">more than 1,000 Lebanese and 160 Israelis were killed</a>.<strong> </strong>A UN-brokered ceasefire ended that conflict, but fighting continued for years — and it intensified again in the wake of Hamas’s October 7 attack.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah is allied with Hamas, and, starting on October 8, 2023, began firing major salvos into northern Israel, eventually displacing around <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cglkkrj94ldo">60,000 residents there</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Initially, with Israel focused on uprooting Hamas in Gaza, fighting along its northern border with Lebanon was limited to tit-for-tat strikes. But starting in September, Israel escalated the fighting significantly, first by attacking Hezbollah members and leadership with exploding electronics, then bombing Hezbollah’s stronghold in southern Lebanon and the outskirts of Beirut.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ever since the October 7 attack, observers have warned about the possibility that Israel’s war with Gaza might spread to encompass Hezbollah and, perhaps, the entire region.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not clear if that’s what’s happening now or what a full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah might look like. Despite Hezbollah’s previous ability to stand up to Israeli firepower, it’s also not clear how it will fare with its communication networks disrupted by <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/372772/hezbollah-israel-pagers-radios-lebanon">the recent pager and walkie-talkie attacks</a> —&nbsp;which Israel has not claimed but is widely assumed to be behind. What’s more, a significant number of mid-level and senior Hezbollah leaders were killed in that attack and <a href="https://www.vox.com/israel/373428/lebanon-hezbollah-israel-hamas-gaza">subsequent bombings</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What might Hezbollah’s next move be?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah is considered the most widely armed and powerful militia group in the Middle East. It boasts a vast weapons arsenal, including as many as <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/9/20/hezbollah-to-israel-precision-missiles-now-obtained">120,000 missiles</a>, and has deployed it with increasing success inside Israel’s borders since the war in Gaza began. Israel <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hezbollahs-tunnels-flexible-command-weather-israels-deadly-blows-2024-09-25/">claims to have destroyed thousands of the group’s rockets and shells</a>, and <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/people/natan-sachs/">Natan Sachs</a>, director of the Middle East policy program at the Brookings Institution, says Israel may have destroyed some of Hezbollah’s precision munitions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, Hezbollah has demonstrated advanced military tactics such as <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/hezbollah-introduces-new-weapons-tactics-against-israel-as-war-in-gaza-drags-on">using drones to fire missiles at key Israeli targets</a> and effective intelligence capabilities including <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/tool-of-first-resort-israel-hamas-war-in-cyber/">digital espionage</a>. And recent Israeli attacks on Lebanese mobile devices and the assassination of Nasrallah haven’t completely wiped out that capacity.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There was kind of this gleefulness about Hezbollah being completely disabled and destroyed now because all the leadership’s gone,” said <a href="https://x.com/phillipsmyth?lang=en">Phillip Smyth</a>, an independent analyst focusing on the Middle East and terrorism. “That’s not how it works.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the success of recent Israeli attacks has called into question the extent of Hezbollah’s capabilities — and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/29/world/middleeast/iran-hezbollah-israel-nasrallah.html">reportedly shaken Iranian leadership</a>. In that sense, Hezbollah may have limited options going forward, even though it had previously pledged not to relent until a ceasefire in Gaza is reached.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Hezbollah turns out to be less capable, militarily, than I expected,” <a href="https://tcf.org/experts/thanassis-cambanis/">Thanassis Cambanis</a>, a senior fellow and director of the think tank Century International, said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cambanis and other experts believed that Hezbollah had the technology to effectively strike military targets in Israel, as well as civilian infrastructure in Haifa and even Tel Aviv, a major population center. But if it was willing and able, it seems it would have done so by now.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It turns out that Hezbollah wasn’t willing to use its most powerful military options, or that it couldn’t because Israel was able to infiltrate or neutralize Hezbollah capabilities,” Cambanis said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The group’s second-in-command, Naim Qassem, sought to dispel doubts about Hezbollah’s capabilities in a speech on Monday, though he also seemed to suggest Hezbollah is currently on the defensive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Israel was not able to reach our military capabilities, and what its media says about hitting most of the medium and long-range capabilities is a dream they have not achieved and will never achieve,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCVhaCv-BSQ" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCVhaCv-BSQ">Qassem said</a>. “We will face any possibility and we are ready if the Israelis decide to enter by land and the resistance forces are ready for a ground engagement.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He added that an announcement will be <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/hezbollah-says-choose-nasrallahs-successor-at-earliest-opportunity">made in the coming days</a> about Nasrallah’s successor, who Smyth said will most likely be <a href="https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-822451">Hashem Safieddine</a>, Nasrallah’s handpicked heir and cousin. Safieddine currently oversees&nbsp; Hezbollah’s political affairs and sits on the council managing the group’s military operations.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Iran’s role here?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tuesday’s missile barrage is Iran’s most escalatory move since April, when the regime sent around 300 missiles and rockets toward Israel, nearly all of which were intercepted by US and regional partner forces, as well as Israel’s own air defenses.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel has threatened to retaliate against Iran for this latest attack. “The regime in Tehran does not understand our determination to defend ourselves and to exact a price from our enemies,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said during a meeting of the country’s security cabinet Tuesday.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not clear <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/10/02/iran-israel-missile-attacks-response?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&amp;stream=top">exactly what form that retaliation will take</a> — whether it will be an outright attack on Iranian territory, more covert actions like assassinations or disruptions to critical infrastructure, or increased attacks against Iranian partner groups. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the most part, Iran asserts its regional power and carries out foreign policy goals —&nbsp;primarily, antagonizing Israel —&nbsp;by funding and providing resources to a network of militia groups. Those include Hamas, Yemen’s Houthi rebels, Shia militia groups in Iraq and Syria, and, of course, Hezbollah.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Iran’s relationship with Hezbollah is really like two NATO allies,” Ali Vaez, director of the Iran project at the International Crisis Group, <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/10/14/23917078/israel-hamas-war-gaza-iran-hezbollah-khamenei-lebanon">told Vox</a> last October.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, while NATO allies pledge to defend one another from attacks, Iran has been reluctant to be actively involved in a war against Israel; a drone attack on Israeli territory in April, following the assassination of an Iranian military leader in an Iranian diplomatic building in Damascus, Syria, was obviously telegraphed and minimally destructive. And the July assassination of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-hamas-israel-30968a7acb31cd8b259de9650014b779">Ismail Haniyeh</a>, the former Hamas leader, while he was in Tehran prompted no obvious retaliation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s not to say that Iran has no appetite for conflict: “The appetite for them was quite high, to be perfectly frank,” Smyth said.&nbsp;“They just thought that they could micromanage this so that it wouldn’t get to this point. And the Israelis clearly called their bluff.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, it seems, Iran has offered a show of force — but there are limits to how far the country will go.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Escalation could come, but [the Iranians] need to thread a needle,” Sachs said. That involves trying to show solidarity with Hezbollah and that Iran is capable of attack, without getting into an extended war with both Israel and the US.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Is Israel’s Lebanon campaign a prelude to a larger ground invasion?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel’s plan for its “limited” ground invasion involves rooting out Hezbollah along Lebanon’s southern border with Israel to neutralize the threat to Israeli communities nearby, the <a href="https://wapo.st/3XO98KS">Washington Post reported</a>. So far, the Israeli military <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/01/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah/here-are-the-latest-developments?smid=url-share">said</a> it has conducted “limited, localized and targeted raids” along the border.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there’s a fear that Israel’s narrow mission could balloon into something bigger — much as it already has in Gaza, where Israel’s stated operational objective of eliminating Hamas has given way to widespread destruction of civilian life. If the conflict with Hezbollah does grow, that would likely spur fierce Lebanese resistance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“An invasion of Lebanon will mobilize Lebanese as a national issue to resist, including the many Lebanese who don’t support Israel but also oppose another Israeli invasion and occupation,” Cambanis said. “Perhaps in the short term Israel can achieve some of its aims by pursuing the logic of total war, but it will only make Israel and the entire Middle East less safe.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Lebanese government —&nbsp;or what passes for it, since an unelected caretaker government has been in place since 2022 — has clearly demonstrated that the country is not interested in yet another war with Israel. Caretaker <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/lebanon-hold-session-elect-president-after-ceasefire-caretaker-pm-says-2024-09-30/">Prime Minister Najib Mikati announced Monday</a> that his government is prepared to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war. That resolution would deploy the Lebanese army to the country’s south to crack down on Hezbollah and require Israel to pull out of southern Lebanon. Now that Israel has entered Lebanon, it’s unclear whether Mikati will trigger the resolution. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The conflict has already taken a significant toll on Lebanese civilians and it could only get worse from here. In anticipation, Lebanon and the United Nations petitioned for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/01/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah/23dd80ed-e9dd-5ee3-a552-622fbac870f6?smid=url-share">$426 million</a> in humanitarian aid on Tuesday to help those affected in the next three months.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lebanon has already struggled under decades of war and government dysfunction, as well as an influx of Syrian refugees that have stretched already-limited state capacity. Now, Israel’s bombing attacks and invasion have displaced around 1 million Lebanese from the south of the country, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgveeyrl47o">according to Mikati</a>, and the Lebanese government says <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-news-09-30-2024-83ea5f243688f309754ec74850de4238">at least 1,000 people have been killed in the past two weeks</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s next for the Gaza-Hezbollah-Israel conflict overall?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There seems to be no end in sight for the widening conflict, for several reasons: US unwillingness to restrain Israel by restricting weapons shipments; Hezbollah’s stated position that they will not stop attacks on Israel until a ceasefire with Gaza is reached; and the repeated breakdown of Gaza ceasefire talks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US and France did attempt to negotiate a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/26/lebanon-temporary-ceasefire-plan-hezbollah-israel">21-day ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel last week</a>, but “Israel (Netanyahu) has flat out rejected the US-French 21 day ceasefire proposal in Lebanon,” <a href="https://history.stanford.edu/people/joel-beinin">Joel Beinin</a>, a professor of Middle East history at Stanford University, said. As Hezbollah also frames its attacks as support for Gaza, it most likely won’t agree to a ceasefire as long as Gaza is still under attack.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As for the US, there seems to be almost no effort to truly restrain Israel following the failed ceasefire attempt.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The United States is just not driving events,” <a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/who-we-are/people/michael-wahid-hanna">Michael Hanna</a>, director of the US program at the International Crisis Group, said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We support Israel’s right to defend itself against Hezbollah and all Iranian backed terror groups. Of course, we know that mission creep can be a risk and we will keep discussing that with the Israelis. And ultimately, a diplomatic resolution is the only way to achieve lasting stability and security across the Israel-Lebanon border,” a spokesperson from the National Security Council told Vox in an email.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US could, however, do more to deter escalation; <a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/in-the-news/bernie-sanders-preparing-resolutions-to-block-20b-in-us-arms-sales-to-israel/">Sen. Bernie Sanders </a>(I-VT) has introduced <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-resolution-forces-vote-arms-sales-israel-gaza_n_66f5b5a4e4b0b663235fb66d">a resolution to block arms sales to Israel</a>, on the premise that the arms transfers violate international law, although that is unlikely to pass in Congress.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although Lebanon is the current site of the crisis, Israeli military operations are ongoing in Gaza, where <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20240711-more-than-186-000-dead-in-gaza-how-credible-are-the-estimates-published-on-the-lancet">as many as 186,000 people may have been killed in the past year of fighting</a>, according to some researchers. (Many media sources put that figure at 40,000, but an accurate count is difficult given that much of Gaza is destroyed and fighting is ongoing.) Medical infrastructure has been destroyed, and there are many reported instances of communicable disease and malnutrition. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“People are getting killed in Gaza daily, the humanitarian situation is dire,” Hanna said. “Life is disrupted and on hold — there are no schools, there’s no functioning society. There’s nothing.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel appears to be emboldened by its victories, and Hezbollah appears reluctant to launch large-scale attacks on Israel. The US has maintained its support for Israel and is sending <a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-troops-middle-east-israel-hezbollah-e37e2dbef573e33c0f8fb6a8103f27f1">more troops to the region</a>. Iran has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-israel-mideast-tensions-hezbollah-lebanon-analysis-5020aeed3c88790d5483fdf40c9ba392">issued some threats</a>, but hasn’t yet been much of an active participant in the fighting. All that makes it impossible to say where the war goes from here. Cambanis, however, predicts the worst.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There’s a dangerous and delusional march to war on Iran,” he said. “I would have liked to rely on the US government to restrain Israel, but it’s clear that the Biden administration supports Israel’s widening gyre of escalation.”</p>

People fall in love. <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22307700/malaria-rna-vaccines-covid-19">New vaccines</a> are getting closer to saving the roughly <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/malaria-introduction#:~:text=Only%20a%20small%20fraction%20of,children%20on%20any%20average%20day.">500,000 children</a> who die from malaria each year. And for those of us interested in the science of meditation, which promises a deeper understanding of human psychology and the upper bounds of subjective well-being, the field is entering an incredibly exciting new era.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Research from the early 1990s helped establish the therapeutic potential of mindfulness, while more recent years have seen the investigation of the actual mechanisms that connect meditation to various health benefits. Now, as <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23836358/meditation-mindfulness-enlightenment-science-contemplative-buddhism-spirituality">I’ve previously written</a>, meditation science is going even further, exploring much larger questions that can go well beyond the simple promises of mindfulness-based stress relief.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to neuroscientist <a href="https://mbb.harvard.edu/people/matthew-sacchet">Matthew Sacchet</a> — who runs a bridge project between Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital called the <a href="https://meditation.mgh.harvard.edu/">Meditation Research Program</a>&nbsp;— today’s new wave of research is characterized by probing the mechanisms that underlie <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/advanced-meditation-alters-consciousness-and-our-basic-sense-of-self/">advanced meditation</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sign up&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup">here</a>&nbsp;to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This includes a variety of techniques that don’t so much relax the mind as <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wps.21214">transform it</a>. Advanced practices lead to “states and stages of meditation that unfold with time and mastery,” but can uncover insights that are relevant for consciousness in general, Sacchet told me.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And this isn’t just for Buddhist monks. In addition to shedding light on one of humanity’s most stubbornly puzzling mysteries, deeper insights into the workings of consciousness could help us think more expansively about mental health, and how to cultivate it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The expanding field is leading cognitive scientists to study a dizzying array of strangely powerful meditative states, from absorptions into rapturous beams of pleasure <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/354069/what-if-you-could-have-a-panic-attack-but-for-joy">like the jhānas</a> to temporarily switching consciousness off through a self-induced kind of drug-free general anesthesia known as “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10548-024-01052-4">cessation</a>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the field still suffers from heavy reliance on data that shows a wealth of correlations, while falling short of demonstrating real causation. Neuroimaging studies that use tools like EEG and fMRI scan a meditator’s brain at a single point in time and give us associations between meditation and the brain’s structure or function.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So far, though, they can’t actually tell us what meditation really does to the brain, or the changes it causes. Maybe people who are drawn to meditation are predisposed to certain patterns of brain activity, and our heap of correlations tells us more about those willing to meditate than anything actually caused by meditation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sacchet explained that the neuroscience of meditation has been almost entirely informed by studies that are stuck on the correlation question. That’s why he’s so excited about a new strategy: the possibility of combining meditation research with non-invasive brain stimulation, or “neuromodulation” techniques, which use electrical currents and magnetic fields to fiddle with brain activity in ways that can help isolate the changes that meditation actually causes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In late August, Sacchet <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763424003312#:~:text=The%20inclusion%20of%20neuromodulation%20might,changes%20linked%20to%20the%20intervention.">co-authored a review</a> that looked across all the recent research combining neuromodulation with meditation, trying to organize the field and get a sense of where things stand. It’s still early days, but initial signs are promising, and next steps are emerging.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The science of electrically zapping and magnetically pulsing meditating brains</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the land of non-invasive brain stimulation, there are two giants: <a href="https://www.mcleanhospital.org/video/what-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-tms-and-how-does-it-work">transcranial magnetic stimulation</a> (TMS), and <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/brainstimcenter/transcranial-electric-stimulation-tes.html#:~:text=Transcranial%20electric%20stimulation%20(TES)%20is,limited%20to%20tDCS%20and%20tACS.">transcranial electrical stimulation</a> (tES).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During TMS, a power source pulses electrical currents through loops of copper wire, creating a magnetic field along the coil.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hold the coil right above someone’s head, and the field passes through the scalp like a ghost phasing through a wall. The process either increases or decreases targeted brain activity depending on where you’re aiming the coil, how frequently electrical pulses are being delivered, and the field’s intensity. TMS has been in use for years in the treatment of psychiatric disorders like severe depression.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, tES is a family of techniques that alter brain activity by sending weak electrical currents through electrodes placed on the scalp.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s a lot of research on neuromodulation techniques in general, with TMS dating back to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4815479/#:~:text=The%20current%20use%20of%20electromagnetic,the%20human%20brain%20in%201985.">1985</a>, and tES <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7058222/">before</a> that. There’s less that looks directly at their combination with meditation. And there’s even fewer studies that focus only on healthy participants, which was an inclusion criteria for Sacchet’s review.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s worth dwelling on for a second. Much of the existing research on both meditation and neuromodulation positions them as potential treatments for recognized illnesses, like depression. But a deeper understanding of how advanced meditation and neuromodulation affect well-being could have implications for everyone, not just people currently categorized as mentally ill.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Overall, only six studies met all the criteria for inclusion in Sacchet’s review. Across them, neuromodulation was generally found to enhance outcomes when compared with control groups. Combining tES and mindfulness meditation, for example, <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2405844017325677">improved working memory</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-02177-3">another study</a>, a single round of tES paired with mindfully walking on a treadmill temporarily reduced anxiety. Another <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1697260022000515?via%3Dihub">TMS study of 32 participants</a> found that engaging in “self-compassion” practices&nbsp;while receiving TMS pulses to the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/dorsolateral-prefrontal-cortex">dorsolateral prefrontal cortex</a> increased self-compassion compared to controls doing the practice without TMS.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Obviously, six studies don’t make a field. But the early experiments are proving a positive safety profile, and more general insights and hypotheses are beginning to emerge.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Why is it that pulsing magnetic fields or zapping particular brain networks seems to amplify meditation’s effects? One idea offered in the review is the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149763409000591?via%3Dihub">neural efficiency hypothesis</a>. If two brains both solve the same puzzle, but one shows less activity in the process, that brain could be considered more efficient, solving the same task with less energy expended. And more efficiency could support higher intelligence. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the case of brain stimulation plus meditation, it’s like running a marathon while benefiting from a tailwind. Being pushed along in the direction you’re already heading can help you progress faster while expending less energy.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The next generation of modulated meditation research</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Both fields —&nbsp;neuromodulation and meditation science —&nbsp;are still growing rapidly. As each develops new insights, they can inform new ways of more effectively combining the fields.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For example, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1112029108">a</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13415-015-0358-3">growing</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-28274-4">heap</a> of studies is establishing that a collection of brain regions known as the default-mode network (DMN) is critical to meditative experiences (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10032309/">psychedelic ones, too</a>). The DMN is associated with self-referential thinking —&nbsp;autobiographical memories, <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/abstract/S1364-6613(16)30075-4?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1364661316300754%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">mind wandering</a>, or daydreaming about yourself. Given all the <a href="https://tricycle.org/magazine/anatta-buddhism/">Buddhist talk</a> of the self as some sort of illusion, you might not be surprised to learn that meditation is often linked to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763424003312#:~:text=The%20inclusion%20of%20neuromodulation%20might,changes%20linked%20to%20the%20intervention.">reduction</a> of activity in parts of the DMN. The mind becomes less self-centric.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But neuromodulation research has yet to really take up the study of what happens when you use external means to help along the quieting of the DMN during meditation, creating a very conspicuous next step for the field.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That research is already underway. Meditation teacher Shinzen Young and neuroscientist Jay Sanguinetti work together at the University of Arizona’s <a href="https://consciousness.arizona.edu/sema-lab">Sonication Enhanced Mindful Awareness (SEMA) lab</a>. Not only are they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spukj-4sYS0">cooking up studies</a> there that target the DMN of meditators, they’re also working on a new generation of neuromodulation technology —&nbsp;transcranial focused ultrasound, or tFUS.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead of magnetic fields or electrical currents, tFUS uses very high-frequency sound waves, which offer a roughly tenfold increase over TMS and tES in their precision for targeting specific areas in the brain. In <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2024.1392199/full">a pilot study published earlier this year</a>, a group of researchers including Sanguinetti and Young showed they could successfully reduce activity in the DMN by shooting tFUS at one of its major hubs, the posterior cingulate cortex. Though participants weren’t meditating during the process, they did report increases in mindfulness and modest reductions in their sense of self. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, they’re <a href="https://crowdfund.arizona.edu/project/42862?_gl=1*1b0438y*_gcl_au*MTU4NTYzMTkzNi4xNzIzNDIyNDMw*_ga*MTUyNzQ2MDM5OS4xNzIzNDIyNDMw*_ga_7PV3540XS3*MTcyNzczNTA1NS44LjEuMTcyNzczNTQzNS4wLjAuMzUwOTY2NTQ5">crowdfunding</a> for what would be the first experiment to combine tFUS with a meditation retreat.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If ultrasound continues on its present trajectory, it’s going to make a really exciting addition to the neuromodulation arsenal. In addition to using these techniques to amplify meditation’s effects, neuroscientists will benefit from a greater ability to carry out what are known as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4528817/#:~:text=Perturbation%20is%20a%20key%20part,best%20understood%20in%20the%20brain.">perturbational</a> procedures. That means basically being able to safely, non-invasively turn activity in specific parts of the brain up and down, just to see what happens. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To date, neuroimaging studies have helped build correlations between meditation practices and changes to the brain’s structure and function. More targeted neuromodulation studies, however, will help to actually decipher causality.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This field has a lot of promise,” said Sacchet, but there’s “a lot of work to be done to do it right.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Health insurance in America is a constellation of brands and acronyms: Medicare, Medicaid, the VA, TriCare, the ACA, CHIP, United Healthcare, BCBS. I got a headache just listing them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In most rich countries, people don’t have to worry about sifting through a dozen different health plans — and they don’t live in fear of losing their health care after losing a job, <em>and </em>they receive more affordable, higher-quality care than Americans do. The paradox of <a href="https://www.vox.com/health-care/2020/1/29/21075388/medicare-for-all-what-countries-have-universal-health-care">the world’s wealthiest nation having one of the weakest health systems</a> among developed nations has long been a vexing policy problem — without an easy solution.&nbsp;</p>

</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Why does it work this way? It was more an accident of history and culture than an intentional plan. Today, the American system works <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/10/16/23894085/health-insurance-open-enrollment-medical-dental-medicare-obamacare">just well enough</a> — which is not to say it works very well — that building a better one just doesn&#8217;t rise to the level of political priority.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why does US health insurance work this way?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">American health insurance, as we think of it today, <a href="https://www.vox.com/23890764/healthcare-insurance-marketplace-open-enrollment-employer-sponsored-united-blue-cross-shield-aetna">started to take shape in the 1920s</a>, as the medical profession was being standardized and modern hospitals were being built. Some employers started offering payments for hospital-based services as a perk for their workers. Companies had large groups of employees, some in good health and some in bad, to spread the risk and make the finances work much like modern-day insurance does.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This system soon became entrenched enough that President Franklin D. Roosevelt <a href="https://www.kff.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/7871.pdf">bypassed</a> plans to include national health insurance as part of the New Deal. Then came World War II, along with <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/cwc/compensation-from-world-war-ii-through-the-great-society.pdf">government-mandated wage controls for employees in the private sector</a> to keep the war machine moving. Barred from offering raises to motivate their workers, companies started pumping up their health benefits — and the government agreed to exempt those benefits both from wage controls and taxes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By the 1950s, employer-sponsored insurance had become <a href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/us-health-care-non-system-1908-2008/2008-05">popular</a> among those who received it and progressive labor unions urged the government to make the tax exemption permanent. Congress agreed, enshrining in 1954 the subsidy for company health plans in federal law. Doctors and hospitals, whose industry was growing into the leviathan that it is today, became accustomed to working with private insurers rather than with the government directly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, these work-based health plans still cover roughly half of all Americans.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>So far, so good: But there’s a downside, right?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The problem with the employer-based system was it left out too many people because they didn’t work or didn’t have a job that offered health insurance. To start filling in the gaps, in 1965, Congress created <a href="https://www.cms.gov/about-cms/who-we-are/history">Medicare and Medicaid</a> to cover two of the biggest groups of people who lacked coverage: seniors and people in poverty.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After that expansion, we had a system that covered <em>most</em> Americans — which made it hard to change, because people feared losing what they had.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those fears, supported by the medical industry’s campaign against “socialized medicine,” doomed the health care overhauls proposed by presidents <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2017/lessons-universal-coverage-unexpected-advocate-richard-nixon">Richard Nixon</a> and <a href="https://clinton.presidentiallibraries.us/health-reform-initiative">Bill Clinton</a> that would have consolidated most Americans into a national insurance scheme. Certain tendencies in American culture — consumerism and trust in private markets — made it easier to persuade the public that they’d lose under a government-run health plan.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, the US health care system still had obvious holes. Rather than threaten the status quo, policymakers added new patches.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.macpac.gov/subtopic/history-and-impact-of-chip/">CHIP</a> was approved in the 1990s, covering children of working-class families whose incomes were not low enough to get Medicaid. (Their parents, however, were often <a href="https://www.kff.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/7662.pdf">left without any coverage at all</a>.) The 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, was designed to fill that gap by covering people who didn’t receive health insurance through their jobs but didn’t qualify for Medicaid.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet even after a half-dozen rounds of incremental health reform over five decades, <a href="https://www.aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/e497c623e5a0216b31291cd37063df1d/NHIS-Q3-2023-Data-Point-FINAL.pdf">about one in 12</a> people in the US lack health coverage and Americans are much more likely than people in other developed nations to say <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/468053/record-high-put-off-medical-care-due-cost-2022.aspx">they skip medical care because of the cost</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How do other countries provide health insurance?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other countries built their health care systems more deliberately.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After World War II, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/1/28/21074386/health-care-rationing-britain-nhs-nice-medicare-for-all">the United Kingdom</a> sought to extend medical security to all its citizens, creating the National Health Service; many other European governments followed suit.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A half-century later, another wealthy island nation made the same choice. <a href="https://vox.com/health-care/2020/1/13/21028702/medicare-for-all-taiwan-health-insurance?_gl=1*qhf50e*_ga*MTg4NDQwOTY0Ni4xNzA0MjI3NzY5*_ga_C3QZPB4GVE*MTcyNjg0OTU2OS40MDEuMS4xNzI2ODUwMTMzLjU1LjAuMA..">Taiwan</a>, building a modern democracy after decades of authoritarian rule, scrapped a fractured, inequitable health system to set up a national insurance program that would cover everyone. It was a proclamation of solidarity after a tumultuous military dictatorship had come to an end.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Not all countries have opted for a single government program, but their systems are still&nbsp;<a href="https://vox.com/covered" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">simpler than America’s and cover the entire population</a>.&nbsp;In 2006,&nbsp;<a href="https://vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/1/17/21046874/netherlands-universal-health-insurance-private?_gl=1*qhf50e*_ga*MTg4NDQwOTY0Ni4xNzA0MjI3NzY5*_ga_C3QZPB4GVE*MTcyNjg0OTU2OS40MDEuMS4xNzI2ODUwMTMzLjU1LjAuMA.." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Netherlands</a>&nbsp;opted to trade a dysfunctional two-tiered insurance system for a universal program that relied on private coverage but was nevertheless designed to insure everybody. The uninsured rate there today is less than 1 percent (some people opt out).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the US? We’ve never paused to build a fairer, simpler, uniform health system.&nbsp;</p>

</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Uwe Reinhardt, the late preeminent health care economist at Princeton, <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691192178/priced-out">put it</a>, “Canada and virtually all European and Asian developed nations have reached, decades ago, a political consensus to treat health care as a social good. By contrast, we in the United States have never reached a politically dominant consensus on the issue.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Will we ever make US health care simpler?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The 2020 Democratic presidential primary, in which <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/12/13/18103087/medicare-for-all-explained-single-payer-health-care-sanders-jayapal">several candidates released “Medicare-for-all” proposals,</a> may have been the high-water mark for Americans who want to see a streamlined health insurance system that covers everyone in one program.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First championed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Medicare-for-all would cover all Americans through a federal government insurance plan with minimal out-of-pocket costs. But moderates balked at the proposal. Joe Biden pledged to pursue his iterative reforms instead, and Kamala Harris is now taking <a href="https://kamalaharris.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Policy_Book_Economic-Opportunity.pdf">the same tack</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/7/16/20694598/joe-biden-health-care-plan-public-option">public option</a>, which would give more people the choice to participate in a government insurance program like Medicare or Medicaid, seems more attainable than single-payer. But Biden <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22422793/joe-biden-health-care-plan-obamacare-medicare-public-option">did not even try to pass that policy</a>, despite campaigning on it, because he did not want to jeopardize his other policy priorities with a politically risky health care proposal that could draw medical industry opposition.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, if you were to ask me what a path to a saner health care system might look like, that would be the model: voluntary adoption among Americans. Public option proponents have long argued that if the government could compete directly with private insurers, it could win. Three states have recently <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22535267/public-option-health-insurance-nevada-colorado-washington">implemented</a> their own public options — so we may soon get an idea of whether or not that proposition is true.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/12/14/18117917/medicare-for-all-explained-health-insurance-deductibles">my own reporting</a>, I have heard that employers are rethinking whether they want to bear the costly, burdensome responsibility of managing Americans’ access to health care. <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/larger-employers-fund-worker-obamacare-option-as-costs-spike">Some companies</a> have dropped their plans and instead opted to pay for their workers to buy insurance on the ACA marketplaces.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It could be that the flaws in American health care will eventually lead us to the same point that virtually all of our peer countries have reached, looking to start over with a universal program. More likely, at least in the near term, is that we’ll keep our needlessly complicated system, make marginal improvements, and hope for the best.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the vice presidential debate Tuesday night, Sen. JD Vance faced one fundamental challenge: How to make a radical right-wing agenda sound like middle-American common sense.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Judging by the polls, America’s voters are <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/">not enthusiastic about the Biden-Harris administration’s record</a>. And on the issues they rank highest — such as immigration and the economy — they have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/23/us/elections/times-siena-sun-belt-crosstabs.html">more trust</a> in the Republican ticket’s leadership.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But voters also do not particularly trust former President <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jd-vance-lowest-vice-president-approval-rating-republican-convention-2024-7#:~:text=JD%20Vance%20has%20a%20net-negative%20approval%20rating%20following,net-positive%20rating%20of%2019%20points%20after%20a%20convention.">JD Vance</a> as people. And they’re also wary of the GOP’s penchant for trying to <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article293251929.html">take away people’s health insurance</a> and forcing them to <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/harris-trump-abortion-stance-pennsylvania-poll-voters-20240920.html">give birth</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz first garnered national attention by spotlighting the oddity of Trumpism in general, and Vance’s version of it in particular, declaring, “<a href="https://www.msnbc.com/inside-with-jen-psaki/watch/-these-guys-are-weird-gov-walz-blasts-trump-vance-obsession-with-anti-freedom-agenda-215711813835">These guys are just weird.</a>”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democrats had little trouble substantiating that claim, as Vance had spent much of the preceding four years tailoring his political commentary to the sensibilities of reactionary Catholic converts with PhDs and proto-fascists with Twitter addictions: Vance had declared President Joe Biden was <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/when-jd-vance-accused-joe-biden-of-trying-to-kill-maga-voters-with-fentanyl/ar-BB1qX0Gf">deliberately flooding</a> red America with fentanyl to “kill a bunch of MAGA voters”; that rape victims should be forced to birth their abusers’ children because “<a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2022/oct/12/context-what-jd-vance-said-about-rape-abortion-and/">two wrongs don’t make a right</a>”; and that the Democratic Party is run by <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/30/politics/kfile-jd-vance-history-disparaging-people-without-kids/index.html">“childless cat ladies.”</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pair this persona with the more politically toxic aspects of the Republican agenda — its opposition to abortion rights, the Affordable Care Act, and tax increases on the wealthy — and you get a rich target for Democratic attacks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance’s aim Tuesday was therefore to make the GOP ticket’s aims sound moderate, and himself seem normal. I am not an amalgam of every undecided voter in the United States, so I cannot tell you whether he succeeded. But he did not obviously fail.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Certainly, Vance demonstrated (<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/29/politics/jd-vance-yale-friend-political-transformation-trump/index.html">once again</a>) that he is capable of recalibrating his messaging to better fit the tastes of whichever audience he’s currently trying to please. Compared to the version of himself who opined on the moral failings of childless cat ladies and rape survivors, Vance <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/375299/vp-debate-vance-walz-winners-losers-analysis">came across as reasonable in his showdown with Walz</a> — so much so, that the Democratic vice-presidential candidate felt compelled to express his agreement with his Republican counterpart more than once.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance achieved this through a combination of sophistry, intellectual dishonesty, and outright lies. Specifically, he deployed three distinct tactics to make Trumpism more palatable to the unconverted.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">1) Describing the GOP’s positions in terms that sound moderate — and are technically true — but are wildly misleading</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance repeatedly downplayed the radicalism of Trump’s agenda by saying things that were not strictly untrue but which conveyed a (beneficially) false impression of the ticket’s positions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He used this gambit most shamelessly when defending Trump’s commitment to democracy. Confronted with his running mate’s attempts to overturn <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/375285/vp-debate-vance-walz-democracy-2020-who-won">the results of the 2020 election</a> — in part, by fomenting <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23513019/january-6-committee-report-trump-2020-election-insurrection'">an insurrectionary riot at the US Capitol</a> — Vance declared that Trump told the protesters on January 6 to protest “peacefully,” and that he “peacefully gave over power on January 20th as we have done for 250 years in this country.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On January 6, 2021, Trump did call on his supporters to march “peacefully and patriotically” to the Capitol. But <a href="https://apnews.com/article/capitol-riot-fact-check-trump-biden-rioters-0b3406e02c86bd057e15c9d8c16ccd51">also told</a> them to “fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.” And while the former president did eventually leave office of his own volition, he first attempted to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/03/us/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-georgia.html'">coerce election officials</a> in<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/records-show-pressure-trump-allies-arizona-officials-not-certify-election-n1273034"> multiple states </a>to help him retain power by nullifying results.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similarly, in defending Trump’s proposal to put a 10 percent tariff on all foreign imports, Vance suggested that the policy was bipartisan common sense, observing that Joe Biden himself had preserved some of “the Trump tariffs that protected American manufacturing jobs.” But this was virtually a non sequitur: Imposing tariffs on a select number of goods that one deems to be of strategic importance and imposing a 10 percent duty on <em>all</em> imports, including agricultural products that the United States cannot possibly produce domestically — are dramatically different propositions. Vance’s line is a bit like suggesting that it isn’t controversial for the government to nationalize all industries because both parties support the existence of public schools and veterans hospitals.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, and most subtly, Vance muddied the waters on abortion by expressing empathy for his adversaries on the issue. The GOP vice presidential candidate said that a dear friend of his told him that she felt that she needed to have an abortion because carrying the pregnancy to term would have locked her into an abusive relationship. Vance said that he took from that conversation that Republicans needed to earn “the American people&#8217;s trust back on this issue where they frankly just don&#8217;t trust us. That&#8217;s one of the things Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To an inattentive voter, this could make it sound as though Vance was calling for the party to regain the public’s trust by rethinking its opposition to abortion rights when, in actuality, Vance was merely saying that Republicans should make life easier for the women whom they force to give birth — such as through public spending on child care, a policy Vance endorsed during the debate but which has scant support among other Republicans.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">2) Lying</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance also utilized the more straightforward and time-tested technique of making stuff up. During a <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/372635/trump-health-care-plan-vance-preexisting-conditions">recent interview on <em>Meet the Press</em></a>, Vance said that Donald Trump intended to roll back some of the Affordable Care Act’s protections for people with preexisting conditions. Asked to answer for that unpopular stance, Vance suggested that he was merely discussing regulatory changes that Trump had already implemented as president and which had actually “salvaged Obamacare which was doing disastrously until Donald Trump came along.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In fact, the Affordable Care Act was doing just fine before the Trump presidency; in December 2016, the program saw a record number of people sign up for the program <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/obama-announces-record-sign-ups-for-a-single-day-in-aca-marketplaces/2016/12/16/d59b40be-c3c5-11e6-8422-eac61c0ef74d_story.html">in a 24-hour period</a>. And once in office, Trump did everything in his power to undermine <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/06/trumps-sabotage-of-obamacare-is-working.html">the law administratively</a> while <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/jd-vance/vance-falsely-says-trump-salvaged-obamacare-program-tried-repeal-rcna173568">trying to repeal it legislatively</a>. In fact, the Affordable Care Act only survived Trump’s presidency because three Republican senators broke with the president to oppose its abolition (<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/434404-trump-attacks-john-mccain-over-obamacare-repeal/">much to Trump’s chagrin</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">3) Insisting that correlation is causation (except when it’s not)</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, Vance attempted to steer the conversation away from policy proposals and toward various good things that happened while Trump was president and bad things that happened with Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris in power. Voters may be lukewarm on Trump’s economic proposals, such as cutting corporate taxes, but many do remember his tenure nostalgically, due to the fact that his first three years in office saw relatively low unemployment and low inflation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance sought to spotlight this fact by saying that “Donald Trump delivered for the American people: rising wages, rising take-home pay, an economy that worked for normal Americans.” And he asked rhetorically, “When was the last time an American president didn&#8217;t have a major conflict break out” on their watch, before answering, “The four years Donald Trump was president.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In reality, unemployment was already trending lower and wages were trending higher for years before Trump took office, <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/feb/06/donald-trump/no-economy-didnt-suddenly-get-strong-under-donald-/">and they did not dramatically accelerate upon his election</a>. Meanwhile, Trump ordered the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-real-backstory-of-why-trump-ordered-the-killing-of-suleimani-is-becoming-more-clear">assassination of a top Iranian official</a>, thereby nearly triggering another Middle Eastern conflict.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is unclear why Kamala Harris bears responsibility for, say, the outbreak of war between Russia and Ukraine but Donald Trump does not bear any responsibility for the Covid-19 pandemic. Neither had direct agency over either of those events, and Harris was not even president when the former occurred.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, put all this together and you get Trumpism with a human face: A common-sense conservatism that wants to protect liberal democracy, regain voters’ trust on abortion, care for the sick, and make America 2019 again.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This might or might not be a winning message, but it’s surely a more palatable one than “childless cat ladies are failing America.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22834666/lead-exposure-poisoning-developing-countries">Lead poisoning</a> has, historically, been a major blind spot in the global health world. The extent of the problem is enormous: A <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(20)30278-3/fulltext">landmark study</a> found that about half of children in poor countries are exposed to very high levels of lead. At least <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lead-poisoning-and-health">1.5 million people die</a> annually from cardiovascular diseases (like heart disease) caused by lead poisoning, imposing a global cost of about <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(23)00166-3/fulltext">$6 trillion a year</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the resources devoted to preventing poisoning were minimal. One <a href="https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/global-lead-exposure-report">estimate in 2021</a> found that charities and nongovernmental organizations were spending $6-10 million a year on the problem. That&#8217;s less than two cents per child poisoned by lead.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thankfully, that number has just increased dramatically. Amid the UN General Assembly meeting in New York last week, the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and UNICEF launched an initiative they&#8217;re calling the <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/sep-23-2024-usaid-and-unicef-launch-150-million-backed-partnership-lead-free-future">Partnership for a Lead-Free Future</a>. The endeavor is backed with $150 million in initial funding from USAID, the Gates Foundation, Open Philanthropy, and other sources.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">$104 million of the funds, all from philanthropic sources, will be channeled through a <a href="https://www.leadexposureactionfund.org/">Lead Exposure Action Fund</a> (LEAF) led by Open Philanthropy, which <a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/announcing-the-lead-exposure-action-fund/">states that it intends to disperse the money</a> by the end of 2027. James Snowden, who leads the grantmaker’s lead work, explains that the money is meant to be allocated over four years, for about $26 million a year in spending. That by itself almost doubles current global philanthropic spending on lead poisoning.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This is one of the easier fundraising efforts I’ve been associated with,” Samantha Power, administrator of USAID and one of the principal organizers of the partnership, told me. The gap, it seems, was mostly knowledge: Once funders realized <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/14/23868347/lead-poisoning-death-toll-world-bank-pure-earth">just how bad</a> the lead problem is and how cheaply it could be mitigated by tackling <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/11312-lead-poisoning">causes of poisoning</a> like lead paint, contaminated spices, and industrial recycling, they got on board.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Power was persuaded the same way. When her USAID adviser Garret Lam brought her the data on the extent of the global lead problem, “My first reaction was ‘this can’t be true,’ that something that’s generating this much harm is not being addressed.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It was true; it’s less true now. Funding in the global lead world is now close to the levels needed to tackle the problem. The question now is how best to spend it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Lead, explained</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lead — atomic number 82 on the periodic table — is soft, plentiful, and easy to mine and manipulate, which is why humans have been harnessing it for various purposes for thousands of years. But it&#8217;s also toxic to many organs in the human body, not least of which is the brain, and especially children&#8217;s developing brains. It&#8217;s <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10254860/">particularly harmful</a> to what psychologists call &#8220;executive functioning&#8221;: the ability of people to choose behaviors in pursuit of conscious goals, rather than acting on impulse.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A particularly rigorous study in New Zealand found that <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2613157">children with high blood lead levels had IQs 5.8 points lower</a> than those with low blood lead levels. Lead is also associated with higher levels of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6388268/">ADHD</a>, less <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2720691">agreeableness and conscientiousness</a>, and higher levels of neuroticism. There&#8217;s compelling evidence that <a href="https://manhattan.institute/article/lead-and-crime-a-review-of-the-evidence-and-the-path-forward">lead exposure increases crime rates</a>. Contamination in childhood can permanently alter a person’s life trajectory.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Later in life, lead can be a major contributor to cardiovascular diseases, such as heart disease. Some of the best evidence here comes from a <a href="https://arefiles.ucdavis.edu/uploads/filer_public/d6/2d/d62d46a3-8558-48a7-bbdc-1c9183b47482/hollingsworth_rudik.pdf">recent study examining Nascar’s decision to ban leaded gasoline</a> from its cars in 2007. Overall, mortality among elderly people fell by 1.7 percent in counties with Nascar races after the races stopped using leaded gas. The authors estimate that leaded gas races in Nascar and elsewhere had caused, on average, about 4,000 premature deaths a year in the US.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Leaded gasoline, which the US <a href="https://www.epa.gov/archive/epa/aboutepa/epa-takes-final-step-phaseout-leaded-gasoline.html">phased out starting in 1975</a>, is no longer the major source of lead poisoning in the world; <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22650920/leaded-gasoline-eradicated-public-health">Algeria</a>, the last country to phase out lead in gasoline, did so in 2021. But there remain other significant sources of lead. Stanford researchers Jenna Forsyth and Stephen Luby have found that <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2019/09/24/lead-found-turmeric/">turmeric spice in Bangladesh is very often cut with lead chromate</a>, which is vibrant yellow, making the spice look brighter and more attractive. The problem likely spans beyond just Bangladesh. Consumer Reports has found that <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24115827/lead-poisoning-symptoms-exposure-children-cinnamon-paint-battery-pollution-global">even in the US</a>, grocery stores were <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/food-safety/your-herbs-and-spices-might-contain-arsenic-cadmium-and-lead/">selling turmeric cut with heavy metals</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Informal <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/getting-the-lead-out-why-battery-recycling-is-a-global-health-hazard">recycling of lead-acid car batteries</a> is another major contributor. In many developing countries, such recycling happens in mom-and-pop operations in backyards, with no protection for the recycling workers or neighboring residents from the resulting fumes. Cookware, both <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5135532/">ceramic</a> and <a href="https://www.naccho.org/blog/articles/metal-cookware-a-previously-unrecognized-source-of-lead-exposure-in-the-united-states">metal</a>, can become contaminated with lead thrown into scrap metal piles or used for glazing, which can then leach into cooked food. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412018314351">Lead paint</a> is still present on many homes in the US and is still sold in many parts of the world, as it offers more vibrant white colors. It can chip and contaminate small children when eaten or when it decays into dust in the air; sometimes it’s used to paint toys that children put in their mouths.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tackling the global lead problem means tackling all these sources, and potentially others too.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The plan for the partnership</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The $150 million the new lead partnership has to spend is a major resource, but arguably its biggest resource is the attention that such a high-profile team-up is able to bring to a neglected topic. Lead poisoning has long remained on the sidelines of global health and garnered less interest than, say, malaria or HIV/AIDS. At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmK230agjLg">the event unveiling the partnership</a>, A-list speakers included first lady Jill Biden, World Bank President Ajay Banga, and Malawi President Lazarus Chakwera, whose country has made notable progress on lead paint remediation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those kinds of advocates are important because progress against lead depends heavily on new regulations and on governments willing to pass and implement them. At the launch event, Power highlighted Stanford’s Forsyth, whose discovery of lead in turmeric <a href="https://time.com/6968416/jenna-forsyth/">led the Bangladeshi government</a> to ban lead chromate in spices and increase oversight of the spice production process. A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935123011325?ref=pdf_download&amp;fr=RR-2&amp;rr=8cb62dcd5e924793">follow-up survey by Forsyth and colleagues in 2023</a> found that the share of turmeric samples containing lead had fallen from 47 percent to 0 percent. The regulation worked.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lead paint exhibits similar dynamics. As with spices, the problem arises in the production process, and targeting a relatively small number of producers can lead to major progress. The <a href="https://leadelimination.org/">Lead Exposure Elimination Project</a>, a small nonprofit focused on paint, conducted a <a href="https://leadelimination.org/annual-review-2020-21/">study in Malawi</a> that found lead in common paints, which <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23357129/future-perfect-50-lucia-coulter-jack-rafferty-lead-exposure-elimination-project">led to a national ban</a>. “This measure alone resulted in the reduction of the market share of brands with lead paint by 50 percent within two years,&#8221; Malawian President Chakwera said at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/hmK230agjLg?si=QtYhDEvM61y4dldA&amp;t=3766">launch event</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Part of the partnership’s job is getting similar laws passed and implemented. That’s where USAID’s <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/mission-directory">on-the-ground presence</a> in over 80 countries can be a major help. “Fifty countries have no laws on the books regulating lead,” Power says. “That gives you a sense of an obvious place for our missions to start.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other sources may be harder to eradicate. A lot of battery recycling, for instance, happens in small backyard workshops rather than big centralized facilities that regulators can easily influence. And the green energy transition is making battery recycling more popular and lucrative, encouraging more households in the developing world to try their hand at the business.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“With the spread of these off-grid solar systems, there might actually just be a lot more disaggregated battery repair and recycling,” Rachel Bonnifield, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development who&#8217;s been very influential in making lead a major global health issue, told me. Pure Earth researcher Christopher Kinally, who <a href="https://www.pureearth.org/research-brief-how-are-malawis-rural-solar-energy-systems-and-lead-poisoning-connected/">studied the practice in Malawi</a>, found that batteries were “openly refurbished on busy market streets, often within 100 meters of food markets, community water wells and nursery schools.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We now know the playbook where it’s coming from paint. We know the playbook where it’s coming from spices,&#8221; Atul Gawande, the prominent writer-physician who is now assistant administrator for global health at USAID, told me. With batteries, by contrast, “We’re still in the learning process.&#8221; He points to Brazil as a potential model; there, <a href="https://leadbatteries.substack.com/p/how-brazil-solved-its-lead-acid-battery">informal recycling has fallen</a> in part due to a law requiring that battery manufacturers be responsible for recycling them at the end of their life cycle.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even more important than remediation may be simple fact-finding. Most countries do not conduct regular, nationally representative surveys of blood lead levels in children, and almost none have good data indicating the share of poisonings caused by specific sources of lead.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Bonnifield and colleagues put together a <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/call-action-end-childhood-lead-poisoning-worldwide.pdf#page=22">rough ideal budget for a global lead strategy</a>, the single largest category of expenses involved developing systems in each affected country to measure blood lead levels, lead sourcing, product testing, and other basic data collection and analysis.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Already the partnership has gotten commitment to regular blood testing from a number of countries. “We have 12 countries that are pursuing blood lead levels, which total more than 1 billion people,” Gawande says. Those nations include Bangladesh, Nepal, Malawi, and the Dominican Republic.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Open Philanthropy’s Snowden notes that the LEAF partnership <a href="https://www.leadexposureactionfund.org/the-plan/">splits its work into three categories</a>: measurement, mitigation, and mainstreaming. While mitigation is arguably the most viscerally compelling, all three are important. Without measurement, it’s hard for effective mitigation to get off the ground. And without mainstreaming, it’s hard for countries to even know they have this opportunity to save so many of their citizens’ lives and futures at such low cost.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&#8220;Lead, this experience for us as an agency, has changed us,&#8221; Power reflected. It offered an opportunity to look at global health in a new way, for America’s foreign aid agency to ask itself, &#8220;If you were starting from scratch and you didn&#8217;t know what flavor of money came to you, how would you prioritize what you&#8217;re doing in the world?&#8221; Much of the agency’s <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/agency/agency-for-international-development">$45 billion</a> budget, and that of global health organizations more broadly, is earmarked to specific diseases or issue areas.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Being able to look outside those silos and work with other funders let USAID find a hugely neglected issue in lead. Perhaps the biggest promise of the project is that it suggests lead might just be the start, that there may be a number of neglected areas of global health that the US foreign aid agency can start to tackle.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The vice presidential debate between Tim Walz and JD Vance on Tuesday was something of a stalemate, though it did feature several striking moments and offered an interesting preview into what presidential politics might look like once Donald Trump is off the stage.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It isn’t clear yet how genuinely undecided voters responded to the debate — a <a href="https://twitter.com/edokeefe/status/1841318799292719235">CBS poll afterward</a> showed 42 percent of debate watchers thought Vance won and 41 percent thought Walz did, while 17 percent thought it was a tie. A <a href="https://x.com/DavidWright_7/status/1841327961506492463">CNN poll</a> showed 51 percent thought Vance won and 49 percent thought Walz did (CNN didn’t offer the “tie” option).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Scored purely on affect and debating technique — without regard to factual accuracy — Vance did a bit better. He stuck to his two-pronged strategy: first, to blame Kamala Harris for everything voters don’t like that has happened under the Biden administration; and second, to put a reasonable-seeming face on Trumpism.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In doing so, though, Vance said many misleading or totally untrue things, such as that Donald Trump saved Obamacare, that immigrants caused the US housing crisis, and that Trump was merely peacefully discussing “problems” with the 2020 election rather than blatantly trying to steal that election from the rightful winner, Joe Biden.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Walz’s performance was rockier, and while he had his moments — he spoke effectively about health care, abortion, and Trump’s threat to democracy — his answers were less disciplined and more scattershot. He seemed flatfooted <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/01/politics/tim-walz-china-tiananmen-square/index.html">by a question</a> regarding his past, reportedly untrue claims to have been in Hong Kong at the time of the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989 — not exactly the most important and pressing issue of the day, but something he probably should have prepared a better answer for.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, on points, Vance may have won by a nose. But he did so in a way that is unlikely to matter very much, if at all, for the presidential contest. In general, vice presidential debates <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/us/elections/vp-debate-polls.html">very rarely impact the polls</a>. And this particular debate lacked any breakout moment likely to dominate headlines for days in what’s become a very crowded October news environment (<a href="https://www.vox.com/israel/375125/lebanon-hezbollah-israel-iran-invasion-gaza">Middle East escalation</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/374794/helene-flooding-hurricane-asheville-carolina">Hurricane Helene</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/labor-jobs/375238/dock-workers-ila-usmx-shipping-supply-chain-economy-strike">the port strike</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This debate almost certainly didn’t change the race — we may not even be talking about it for much longer — but there were some interesting moments that told us more about the candidates and the politics of 2024 as we head into the campaign’s final month.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Winner: JD Vance’s code-switching abilities</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Say what you will about JD Vance, but the man knows how to code-switch.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When he attended Yale Law School and when he promoted his book <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em>, he knew <a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/2/2/14404770/jd-vance-trump-hillbilly-elegy-ezra-klein-show">how to sound appealing</a> to liberal elites. When he tried to cultivate the far right to win the Ohio Senate primary in 2022, he <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360283/jd-vance-trump-vp-vice-president-authoritarian">went all-out</a> saying absurd and offensive things (in a way that has hurt him this year, when his <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/29/nx-s1-5055616/jd-vance-childless-cat-lady-history">remarks</a> about “childless cat ladies” resurfaced).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And on the debate stage Tuesday, he was laser-focused on <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/375316/vp-debate-vance-walz-abortion-health-care">sweet-talking swing voters</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance didn’t engage in bomb-throwing; he wasn’t an attack dog or an edgelord. He assured viewers that he felt their pain and that their pain was all Kamala Harris’s fault. (He solved the problem of how to hold Harris responsible for Biden’s record by simply rebranding the Biden-Harris administration as the “Kamala Harris administration,” pretending she was in charge of everything all along.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When abortion came up, Vance — who <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/373485/project-2025-abortion-ban-trump-comstock-mifepristone">said in 2022</a> that he “certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally” and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/07/17/jd-vance-abortion-comstock-vice-presidential-nominee/">said in 2023</a> that he wanted to prosecute people who sent abortion pills through the mail — took the unusual rhetorical tack of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/jd-vance/vance-republicans-much-better-job-winning-back-trust-abortion-rcna173566">admitting</a> the public didn’t trust the GOP on the issue and that he and his fellow Republicans needed to earn their trust.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For those worried about the whole “Trump tried for months to prevent the peaceful transfer of power to Joe Biden when he lost the election” thing? Well, let Vance set your mind at ease. Trump “peacefully gave over power on January 20th,” 2021, after all. Who cares what happened in the two months before that, anyway? The real threat to democracy, Vance claimed, was the “censorship” of Kamala Harris.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That last pivot may have been a bit too smooth because when Walz asked Vance directly who won the 2020 election, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/375285/vp-debate-vance-walz-democracy-2020-who-won">Vance dodged again</a>, claiming he was “focused on the future.” For anyone who remembers how Trump’s months-long campaign of lies helped cause the chaos of January 6, 2021, Vance’s answer will likely not be convincing. But this is a topic where he can only go so far to avoid angering the guy at the top of the ticket. —<em>Andrew Prokop</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Loser: The narrative that Tim Walz is a media phenomenon</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Kamala Harris suddenly became the Democratic presidential nominee and needed to perform an expedited running mate search, Walz stood out from the crowd of Democratic hopefuls by doing some compelling media appearances, including the one where he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/kamala-walz-vp-weird-trump-gen-z-f9d718890c3ca907f42dba5934075382">memorably dubbed </a>Republicans as “just weird.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This seemed to contrast with both Biden’s and Harris’s tendencies to be extremely cautious about doing unscripted press, and made some Democrats overjoyed that they had found a politician who was out there putting forward a message in the media.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In retrospect, those strong Walz interviews were all with friendly interlocutors, not in the oppositional, high-stakes setting of a debate. Indeed, when the Harris camp vetted Walz for VP, he admitted that he was a “bad debater,” CNN <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/06/politics/tim-walz-inside-harris-vp-pick/index.html">reported in August</a>. On Tuesday morning, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/01/democrats-worry-walz-vp-debate-00181732">Politico reported</a> that Democrats were privately worried about how Walz would fare in the debate. And once the debate kicked off, some commentators watching it <a href="https://x.com/tyler_a_harper/status/1841300799428636805?s=46&amp;t=WDV3NvpmCLI-fO5R13Teug">wondered</a> where the Tim Walz who was good on TV had gone.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Walz’s performance was not disastrous. Far from it. He seems to have come off just fine to viewers, <a href="https://x.com/kabir_here/status/1841321122442236140?s=61&amp;t=TQlk4x44ENcfSu3Y1ke6ew">per CBS’s post-debate poll</a>, and he had several good moments. For instance, it was smart of him to ask Vance directly whether Biden won the 2020 election, and to call Vance’s dodge a “damning non-answer.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It was not exactly a masterful showing, though. Walz seemed uncomfortable in the format compared to the smooth-talking Vance, he didn’t really seem to have one overarching message that he kept returning to, and he often missed opportunities to call out Vance’s lies and misrepresentations.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Walz’s answer on his own misrepresentation of his 1989 visit to Hong Kong — in which he talked about his Nebraska childhood for a while before concluding he “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/us/politics/walz-debate-hong-kong-tiananmen-square.html">misspoke</a>” — was genuinely bad. Fortunately for him, of all the issues that came up on the debate stage, that’s the one of least relevance to substantive issues affecting Americans today, and the least likely to affect voters’ decisions about whether to cast their ballots for Harris. —<em>AP</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Winner: Obamacare</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of Vance’s more remarkable lies of the night was this: Donald Trump saved Obamacare.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He said the law “was crushing under the weight of its own regulatory burden in health care costs” before the former president took office in 2017 and started loosening some of its rules.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think he can make a good argument that it salvaged Obamacare, which was doing disastrously until Donald Trump came along,” the Republican vice presidential candidate said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Donald Trump supported <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/31/16055960/why-obamacare-repeal-failed">the Republican Congress’s effort to roll back most of Obamacare</a>, including undoing some of <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/5/2/15523262/voxcare-republicans-preexisting-conditions">the regulations for preexisting conditions</a> and making <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/5/9/15579654/medicaid-cuts-ahca">major cuts to Medicaid</a>. It failed because of <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/8/25/17782664/john-mccain-legacy-obamacare-repeal-thumbs-down">John McCain</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump dramatically <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/8/16268572/trump-obamacare-navigators">cut funding for enrollment outreach</a>. He tried to introduce <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/11/16877916/medicaid-work-requirements-trump-guidance">Medicaid work requirements</a> for people covered by the Affordable Care Act’s expansion (but was stopped by the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/13/18263675/medicaid-work-requirements-lawsuit-donald-trump">courts</a>). He deregulated <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/6/30/21275498/trump-obamacare-repeal-short-term-health-care-insurance-scam">short-term insurance plans</a> that left people vulnerable to thousands of dollars in bills if they had a serious medical emergency.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2016, when Donald Trump was elected, the ACA marketplaces <a href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/state-indicator/marketplace-enrollment/?activeTab=graph&amp;currentTimeframe=0&amp;startTimeframe=10&amp;selectedRows=%7B%22wrapups%22:%7B%22united-states%22:%7B%7D%7D%7D&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D">covered</a> 12.7 million people. In 2020, when he lost the election to Joe Biden, they covered 11.4 million. After four years of Biden, 21.4 million Americans are getting their insurance through HealthCare.gov or one of its state counterparts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Voters have come to trust Democrats on health care <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicare/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-may-2024-voters-views-of-health-policy-issues-in-context-of-presidential-campaigns/">much more</a> over the years since the law Republicans tagged as “Obamacare” passed. More than 60 percent of Americans now say they <a href="https://www.kff.org/interactive/kff-health-tracking-poll-the-publics-views-on-the-aca/#?response=Favorable--Unfavorable&amp;aRange=twoYear">like</a> the ACA.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2010, Obamacare was <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2011/04/12/healthcare-vote-doomed-13-democrats-in-2010-elections">the culprit</a> for the Democratic wipeout in Congress, but its political fortunes have turned dramatically. In 2018, Democrats <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/7/18070152/midterm-elections-2018-results-trump-obamacare-repeal">won the House</a>, largely by running on a message that without a Democratic check, Trump’s myriad efforts to topple the law would succeed. Ever since, it has been a political asset for them against Republicans — forcing Vance to simply pretend that Trump’s health care record is different from what it is. —<em>Dylan Scott</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Loser: The moderators</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From the start, Norah O’Donnell and Margaret Brennan, the CBS news moderators, made it clear they did not think it was their job to keep the candidates grounded in reality.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The primary role of the moderators is to facilitate the debate between the candidates, enforce the rules, and provide the candidates with the opportunity to fact-check claims made by each other,” Brennan told viewers. And for the most part, the moderators allowed the candidates’ answers to go unchecked.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The questions themselves were either not probing enough or poorly framed. When Brennan turned to Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign promise to build 3 million homes, for example, she confoundingly asked Walz <em>where </em>those homes would get built, not how.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And despite Trump’s continued election denial and Vance’s previous statements that <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/10/vance-electors-2020-election-00178266">he would not have certified</a> the 2020 election results, the moderators left questions about the fate of American democracy till the very end. One of the debate’s most memorable moments was when <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/375285/vp-debate-vance-walz-democracy-2020-who-won">Vance wouldn’t answer Walz’s question</a> about whether Trump lost in 2020.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Viewers don’t have to look too far back to see how it is, in fact, possible to have good debate moderators. ABC News’s David Muir and Linsey Davis did a much better job moderating last month’s presidential debate. They fact-checked the candidates in real time — making it hard for even Trump to get away with lying — and pressed both Harris and Trump with tough questions. They also tried to avoid letting the candidates dodge questions entirely. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Luckily for O’Donnell and Brennan, they’re not going to stand out; they’re not the only debate moderators who have stumbled in the Trump era. The voters, on the other hand, are the unlucky ones.&nbsp; —<em>Abdallah Fayyad</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Winner: A surprising amount of decency</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After nine years of increasingly toxic political discourse and six weeks of mud-slinging between the two No. 2s on the trail, it was reasonable to expect a nasty affair when Trump and Harris’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/jd-vance-trump-campaign-loyalty-e9ec0f58">attack dogs</a> were unleashed on one another on the debate stage.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So it was a little shocking that Walz and Vance not only refrained from hurling personal attacks at one another, but even found common ground at many points.&nbsp;Midwest Nice prevailed: kind on the surface, followed by the occasional sting.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While Vance was criticizing Harris’s approach to the southern border, he seemed apologetic: “Tim, I agree with you,” Vance said. “I think you want to solve this problem, but I don’t think Kamala Harris does.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Later on, the two would find comity over the effects of off-shoring and trade deficits. “Much of what the senator said, I am in agreement with him on,” Walz said. And after Walz mentioned his son had witnessed a shooting, Vance reacted sympathetically: “I didn’t know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting and I’m sorry about that. I want to say — Christ have mercy. It is awful.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This seems to be the way the debate will be <a href="https://x.com/racheljanfaza/status/1841303036561326101">remembered</a>,&nbsp;if at all. It made both candidates seem more normal, civil, and human than they had seemed before — a particular advantage for Vance, who came in needing to soften his image. It may have been strategic politeness, but it was notable in an era when so much politeness has been dispensed with.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In snap polls of debate watchers, both Walz and Vance saw <a href="https://x.com/kabir_here/status/1841321122442236140">increases in their favorability ratings</a>. Focus group respondents seem to be saying similar things. “I hadn’t seen a debate like this in a very long time,” one undecided Michigan voter told CNN’s Phil Mattingly. “They supported each other. They were kind. And it was warm and fuzzy —&nbsp;you could watch it without being offended.” —<em>Christian Paz</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the end of the vice presidential debate, Gov. Tim Walz asked Sen. JD Vance a pointed question: Did Donald Trump <a href="https://x.com/AccountableGOP/status/1841307376655253614">lose the 2020 election</a>? Vance’s response: “Tim, I’m focused on the future. Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 Covid situation?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is a clear right answer&nbsp;— that the 2020 presidential election was in fact legitimate —&nbsp;and Vance refused to offer it. It was, as Walz immediately noted, “A damning non-answer,” one that showed viewers who JD Vance is and what he stands for.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/375299/vp-debate-vance-walz-winners-losers-analysis">every issue discussed earlier that night</a> comes in second to the fundamental question of whether America’s democratic institutions deserve to endure. On that question, Vance truly is radical, and his exposure as such was the only truly important moment of the night.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many Republicans have embraced Trump’s lies about the last election. Some have done so reluctantly, but Vance has been enthusiastic. He has, among other things, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/08/politics/fact-check-jd-vance-capitol-charges/index.html">fundraised for January 6 rioters</a> and said he would have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/02/05/vance-trump-upend-democracy/">illegally thrown the 2020 election result to Congress</a> had he been in Mike Pence’s position at the time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But what’s most distinctive about Vance is the degree to which he has paired 2020 conspiracy theories with <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360283/jd-vance-trump-vp-vice-president-authoritarian">a coterie of other anti-democratic positions and ideologies</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/abc-host-abruptly-ends-interview-jd-vance-supreme-court-remarks-no-no-george">a 2021 podcast interview</a>, Vance said that Trump should “fire every single mid-level bureaucrat” in the US government and “replace them with our people.” If the Supreme Court intervened, Vance suggested that Trump simply ignore the ruling and dare the Court to stop him. In the interview, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23373795/curtis-yarvin-neoreaction-redpill-moldbug">he explicitly cited Curtis Yarvin</a> — a Silicon Valley blogger who advocates for overthrowing democracy and replacing it with a form of monarchy —&nbsp;as an influence on his views in this area.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of this should come as a surprise. Anti-democratic radicalism has been central to Vance’s political identity since he began running for Senate in Ohio, widely discussed since he was tapped to be Trump’s vice president earlier this year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet, it wasn’t central to the vice presidential debate tonight. The moderators left it until the very last minutes of the event, only coming up after <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-to-watch-vp-debate-2024/">the debate was originally scheduled to end</a>. Despite democracy being at the core of the difference between the two candidates onstage&nbsp;— in fact, the core ideological difference between the two parties today — it was treated as an afterthought.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In doing so, the moderators created an illusion of normalcy: allowing the two candidates to civilly discuss issues like housing and the deficit in a basically standard-politician manner, when in fact they disagree on an existential question about the nature of American government itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also worth dwelling on Vance’s attempt at deflection — the confusing line about Harris trying to “censor Americans from speaking their mind” on the Covid-19 pandemic — because I think it’s essential to understanding the ideological scaffolding of anti-democratic politics on the right today.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are multiple theories on the right about how the Biden administration colluded with Big Tech to censor Americans, and it wasn&#8217;t exactly clear which particular one Vance was referencing. For present purposes, the details of the issue are less important than the ideological role they play.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Vance and others like him, it is essential to do more than just insist that Trump was right in 2020 — to go the extra mile and say that Democrats are the true threat to democracy in America today. That argument, the claim that he and Trump are democracy’s real defenders, serves as justification for taking aggressive action to seize power.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Vance proposed to “fire every single mid-level bureaucrat” in 2021, he didn’t sell it as a naked power grab. Rather, he positioned it as a kind of counter-offensive: a necessary response to the left’s alleged stranglehold over the “deep state” in Washington. The rallying cry of Trump’s campaign to overthrow the 2020 election wasn’t that democracy was illegitimate, but rather that Trump had been robbed of his authentic victory by Democratic cheating. Stop the steal!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The argument that “Democrats are worse” does more than just legitimize power grabs. It also is a powerful disciplining tool for wavering Republicans, the kind that aren’t on board with Trump or Vance’s rough-and-tumble politics. If they waver or blanch, the response that Democrats are <em>more dangerous</em> helps bring them back onside — producing <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/09/national-reviews-biden-profile-is-anti-anti-trumpism-as-art.html">the phenomenon known as anti-anti-Trumpism</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In just one moment, in short, the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/375316/vp-debate-vance-walz-abortion-health-care">veneer of normalcy carefully built up</a> over the past 90 minutes was punctured. Vance not only exposed the true center of his candidacy, but also some of the key ideological scaffolding underpinning the Republican Party’s turn into anti-democratic territory.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Workers at ports on the East and Gulf Coasts went on strike Tuesday following a breakdown in negotiations between the union representing them, the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA), and the organization of international shipping companies that employ them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Approximately 45,000 workers walked off the job at 12:01 am, making it the most significant strike the union <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/dockworkers-at-port-of-ny-and-nj-go-on-strike-for-first-time-since-1977">has engaged in since 1977</a>. On Tuesday, workers at 36 different ports stopped work after their six-year contract with the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX) expired — and depending on how long the work stoppage lasts, it could have a monumental impact on the US economy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The strike affects some of the country’s biggest ports, like the<a href="https://gothamist.com/news/dockworkers-at-port-of-ny-and-nj-go-on-strike-for-first-time-since-1977"> Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</a>. Overall, the affected ports handle about 50 percent of the imports and exports to the US. Though some of that cargo has been preemptively diverted to the West Coast, that isn’t a solution without complications.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent days, it appeared as though USMX and ILA were moving forward with negotiations, with USMX requesting to extend the current contract to garner more negotiating time. ILA, though, refused the new proposal.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">ILA president Harold Daggett warned Tuesday that the union was “prepared to fight as long as necessary, to stay out on strike for whatever period of time it takes, to get the wages and protections against automation our ILA members deserve.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the </strong>International Longshoremen’s Association? Why are its members <strong>striking?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The ILA represents the approximately 45,000 workers who manage the unloading of massive shipping containers from large cargo ships. Eventually, inventory from the ships makes its way to warehouses, store shelves, and factories. The members work at ports up and down the East Coast as far north as Maine, as well as Gulf Coast ports in Louisiana and Texas.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There&#8217;s a strike over two main issues,” Art Wheaton, director of labor studies at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said. “One is money. Two is technology.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The union has demanded a significant pay raise for dock workers over the six-year life of the contract, as well as increased contributions to their retirement plan and a say in the role of automation in their industry. Some reports indicate the union asked for as much <a href="https://apnews.com/article/longshoremen-strike-pay-automation-ports-jobs-consumers-3aa66e0a05db25a49645fad404a5f000">as a 77 percent pay increase</a>; the most recent proposal from USMX offered a 50 percent increase over the life of the contract.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The biggest concern is, the dock workers do not want automated machines to be responsible for picking up, dropping off, and releasing the cargo automatically,” Wheaton said. “They would like to have a human operator there” to ensure the quality and safety of their operations — and job security. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Negotiations between USMX and ILA for a new contract stopped in June, reportedly over the use of <a href="https://mynbc15.com/news/local/hundreds-of-mobile-dockworkers-set-to-go-on-strike">automation at a port in Mobile, Alabama</a>. USMX filed a complaint with the National Labor Review Board last week claiming that ILA refused to continue with contract negotiations. USMX did not respond to Vox’s request for comment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Shipping companies that compose USMX — all of which are based abroad — have made billions as global trade and shipping has boomed, the union argues, while worker wages have stagnated in the face of inflation. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dock workers on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/business/economy/port-strike-economy.html">West Coast make about $55 per hour compared</a> with the East and Gulf Coast <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/01/business/us-port-workers-strike-tuesday/index.html">average of $39 per hour</a> for experienced workers. West Coast dockworkers received an impressive <a href="https://www.portoflosangeles.org/references/2023-news-releases/news_083123_ilwu_contract">wage increase</a> in their most recent contract<a href="https://www.portoflosangeles.org/references/2023-news-releases/news_083123_ilwu_contract">;</a> they belong to a different union, the International Longshoremen and Warehouse Union (ILWU), which has long been much more radical than the ILA in terms of its politics, demands, and tactics, according to Gabe Winant, a labor historian at the University of Chicago.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the ILWU workers’ big wage wins proved that it was possible to demand more — and get it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, the ILA hopes to achieve a similar victory.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Which goods will be impacted?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More than 50 percent of all goods <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/east-coast-port-strike-what-to-know/">imported into the US using container ships</a> come in through the East and Gulf Coast ports, and nearly 70 percent of containerized exports leave through them. In the immediate term, there should be few shortages or price increases on most consumer goods; many companies have made preparations for the strike. But depending how long the strike continues, some perishable items might be more expensive or difficult to come by.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We have all these perishable goods coming imported [to] the East Coast,” like blueberries, bananas, and fish from South America, Chris Tang, a professor of supply chain management at UCLA, told Vox. “We also have apparel, toys, electronics, we import through the East Coast.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The automotive industry is also likely to be impacted, as many cars and car parts are imported from Europe. “There’s still some inventories available in the car manufacturing, and as well as the car dealers, so in the short term, it is not a major impact,” Tang said. But if the strike goes on for weeks, that inventory will run out, and car repairs could become more challenging as parts shipments are delayed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition to the strike, there are other factors affecting global shipping at the moment, including <a href="https://www.vox.com/videos/24113479/what-the-red-sea-ship-attacks-are-really-about">Houthi attacks in the Red Sea</a> that have disrupted shipping since November of last year, as has <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/374867/hurricane-helene">extreme weather</a>. The Panama Canal has also been impacted independent of the strikes; the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/business/panama-canal-drought.html">waterway is suffering from a drought</a>, which has created a shipping backlog there.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“As anyone who tried to buy toilet paper during the pandemic can tell you, we have a delicate supply chain, and when you start messing with the cargo ships, the rail, and the semi trucks, you&#8217;re toast,” Wheaton said. “You just aren&#8217;t going to get anything moved. Add to that that you just had a huge chunk of the East Coast get buried in water from the hurricane that just went through.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Overall, consumers shouldn’t worry too much about goods becoming scarce. For now, Tang cautions people not to hoard products for fear that they’ll be absent from US shelves; that will create shortages and drive up prices independent of the strike.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How might the dockworker’s strike end?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What happens with the strike largely depends on how quickly the ILA and USMX can come to an agreement.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Federal law gives Congress and the president the power to break strikes in certain circumstances. In this case, President Joe Biden could order dockworkers back to the ports for 80 days as USMX and the ILA continue contract negotiations through powers granted by the Taft-Hartley Act, but <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/01/biden-administration-dockworker-strike-00181839">he doesn’t want to do so</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tang cautions that could change the longer the strike goes on, given it could continue till the presidential election. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The administration will face “pressure from the consumers, from the retailers, from the manufacturers, and also the shipping companies” to take action and reopen the ports, Tang said. Some business groups are <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/01/biden-administration-dockworker-strike-00181839">already calling on Biden</a> to send ILA members back to work. But Biden has also been largely supportive of union action, save the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/11/29/23484623/congress-rail-strike-biden-sick-days">2022 railway workers strike</a>, and a number of unions are helping with <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/372935/teamsters-union-harris-biden-uaw-labor-trump-endorsement-vote">Vice President Harris’s campaign</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think that right now, President Biden is under large pressure,” Tang said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ideally, the administration won’t have to act, with ILA and USMX coming to an agreement either on their own or with US officials assisting with negotiations. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The official policy of the government for more than 100 years, that the best solution is a negotiated solution,” Wheaton said. “The union won&#8217;t get everything they want, management won&#8217;t get everything they want, but you sit at the bargaining table to see what both sides can live with.”</p>

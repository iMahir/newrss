<p class="has-text-align-none">Welcome to Next Page! I’m so glad to see you here. I’m Constance Grady, Vox’s book critic.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Between the avalanche of new releases that come out every month and the enormous back catalog of existing books, it can be hard for readers to sort through the chaos. This is why this newsletter exists. Each month, I&#8217;ll send a handful of book recommendations, both old and new, to help you find your next great read. I’ll also include some fun pieces from around the literary world.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>If you’d like to see these recommendations directly in your inbox, <a href="https://link.vox.com/join/6x9/optin-nextpage">consider subscribing</a>.</strong> If you want even <em>more</em> recommendations, <a href="https://www.vox.com/support-now"><strong>consider becoming a Vox member</strong></a>. You’ll receive exclusive access to a special edition of <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23592562/ask-a-book-critic">Ask a Book Critic</a> once a month, where I’ll offer members personalized book recommendations. Email me at <a href="mailto:constance.grady@vox.com">constance.grady@vox.com</a> with your reading desires, and I might answer them in the next member email.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With that, let’s get into the books.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/books/alice-munro-dead.html">Alice Munro’s death</a> last month, I’ve been rereading <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-beggar-maid-stories-of-flo-and-rose-alice-munro/6723399?ean=9780679732716">The Beggar Maid</a></em>, her 1987 novel-in-stories, and thinking about what a perfect book it is.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The novel-in-stories form is maybe one of the most beautiful variations on the novel, and it’s a structure Munro innovated and mastered. It means a collection of short stories featuring the same characters which, when compiled into a single volume, become a long narrative about them. You might think here of Jennifer Egan’s <em>A Visit From the Goon Squad</em> or Sandra Cisneros’s <em>The House on Mango Street</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In <em>The Beggar Maid</em> (published outside the US as <em>Who Do You Think You Are?</em>), the short stories are about Rose, a bright and awkward girl growing up in small-town Canada, and her stepmother Flo, who Rose both admires and is ashamed of. You follow Rose from her clumsy childhood up to her glamorous adulthood, watching the way her life is informed by the impoverished small town she’s left behind.&nbsp;Each story in the cycle stands on its own, discrete and shining like a pearl, and then Munro strings them all together into something new like beads on a necklace.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you haven’t read Munro before, <em>The Beggar Maid</em> is a good place to start. If you’d like something else to read, let’s see what we can do for you.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">On the shelf</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-virgin-in-the-garden-a-s-byatt/6712380?ean=9780679738299">The Virgin in the Garden</a></em> by A.S. Byatt</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While we’re on the subject of memorial readings! A few months ago, we also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/nov/17/as-byatt-dame-antonia-byatt-obituary">lost A.S. Byatt</a>, author of <em>Possession</em> and a longstanding favorite of mine. Byatt, who was also an English professor, wrote primarily bookish novels about academics. She had a deep sense of the pleasures of reading and analyzing a text, and she had an impeccable eye for writing about color. Byatt novels are always streaked with descriptions of peacock greens and deep rich crimsons and shadowy mauves, so that reading them feels like standing beneath a stained glass window.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Byatt’s best known for the Booker Prize-winning <em>Possession</em>, but the book of hers that’s been speaking to me most lately is her 1978 novel <em>The Virgin in the Garden</em>. It’s about a family of academics, all very clever and varying degrees of unhappy, who are roped into putting on a play about Queen Elizabeth I to celebrate the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The great joy of it for me is Fredericka, the youngest daughter of the family, bursting with bratty joy at her own erudite intelligence. There’s no one else in fiction quite like her.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=1025X1701643&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Fyou-dreamed-of-empires-alvaro-enrigue%2F19997322%3Fean%3D9780593544792">You Dreamed of Empires</a></em> by Álvaro Enrigue, translated by Natasha Wimmer</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is an absolute wonder of a new novel from Álvaro Enrigue, an institution in Mexico but whose work only recently became available to English-language readers. (<em>You Dreamed of Empires</em> is Enrigue’s third book to be published in English.) It takes place over the course of a single day in 1519, when the Spanish conquistador Cortés arrives at the imperial palace of Moctezuma in what is now Mexico City.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cortés’s troops are ragged and unwashed, “provincials, nobodies, hicks,” who are fixated on “the juice of rotting fruit they bring from their own lands.” The Tenochtitláns (rendered Aztecs by the rude Spanish) are, in contrast, magnificently wealthy, at the seat of a massive empire, and lavished with such marvels as quilts, grasshopper tacos, and magic mushrooms. (Moctezuma spends a lot of his page time in this novel tripping.) We know how history ends — but in Enrigue’s playful, hallucinatory prose, it feels entirely possible for things to go in different directions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701643&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Fthe-ministry-of-time-kaliane-bradley%2F20696241%3Fean%3D9781668045145">The Ministry of Time</a></em> by Kaliane Bradley</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>The Ministry of Time</em> is an unbelievably satisfying read, one I could not put down. Published just last month, it takes place in a near-future London where the British government has developed the technology to time travel. To test it, they’ve extracted people out of historical death traps and into the present moment. Our unnamed narrator is a government bureaucrat hired to help one such time traveler adjust to the present as his live-in companion. Of course they fall in love, but there’s a lot more to it than that.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The narrator references <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/03/22/graham-greenes-dark-heart">Graham Greene’s midcentury wartime spy novels a lot</a>, and that’s more or less the best comparison for this book. Think: smoke-filled rooms full of intrigue, hard-won camaraderie that is all the more precious for existing in so desperate a time, a protagonist who is never quite as innocent as she would like to believe herself. To that mix, Bradley adds time travel, romance, and a sophisticated exploration of the ways post-colonialism shapes our minds. I gobbled this book up in a matter of days. You will, too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This Sunday, French voters will cast their ballots in the first round of the country’s parliamentary election — one that President Emmanuel Macron called as a surprise after the far-right National Rally (RN) <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/354601/european-parliament-elections-macron-afd-national-rally-far-right-fidesz-france">won big in the European parliamentary elections earlier this month</a>. The <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/france-elections-2024-polls-macron-le-pen">French polls</a> suggest that the RN will also win big on Sunday and in the second round of voting that follows a week later — gaining either a plurality of seats or perhaps even an outright majority.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the final results may not be known for more than a week, the stakes are quite clear&nbsp;and quite high. In the French system, presidents depend on parliamentary majorities for major domestic policy-making; without a majority, Macron will be fairly impotent at home. If the RN has an outright majority, it can start passing parts of its far-right agenda, and Macron will have only limited tools to stop them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On one level, this isn’t surprising. The RN’s long-time leader, Marine Le Pen, has been Macron’s chief rival in the past two presidential elections. It’s clear that her party has emerged as the leading alternative to Macron’s centrism; few observers are surprised that his decision to call this parliamentary election early <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20240627-french-far-right-dominates-polls-three-days-ahead-of-snap-elections">is likely to lead to RN gains</a>. A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-21/macron-approval-rating-falls-to-match-previous-low">deeply unpopular president</a> causing voters to turn to the opposition: In some ways this is just democracy as usual.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But on another level, the RN’s rise should be truly shocking.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Not so long ago, the party’s extremism made it anathema to nearly everyone in France. When Le Pen’s father and the party’s founder Jean-Marie made it to the second round of the presidential election in 2002, nearly the entire country <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/04/23/this-chart-shows-how-the-french-election-is-a-break-from-the-past/">rallied against him and his party</a> (then called the National Front, or FN). He lost in a landslide 82–18 defeat, the worst showing of any presidential candidate since 1958.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even after years of Marine Le Pen softening the RN’s image, its policy agenda remains nearly as radical as it was then. The RN’s signature policy is to enact a “national priority” law <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/25/france-far-right-national-rally-history-1972-marine-le-pen#:~:text=Marine%20Le%20Pen%20has%20kept,has%20renamed%20%E2%80%9Cnational%20priority%E2%80%9D.">formally discriminating against immigrants</a> in housing, hiring, and public benefits.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The real story of the 2024 election is not that voters are turning against Macron, but how the far right came to be seen as a palatable alternative.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a rise fueled in large part by the RN’s canny political strategy, an extreme party doing a brilliant job of making itself seem reasonable to voters outside its base. But it’s also been fueled by the hubris and missteps of Macron, who seems motivated by a false sense that the RN was so toxic that he would inevitably triumph in a forced binary choice, just as his predecessor did in 2002.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These two forces have worked in tandem to turn the RN into the de facto leader of the opposition to an unpopular president. And now, France — like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reactionary-Spirit-Insidious-Political-Tradition-ebook/dp/B0CMQB8S94">other democracies around the world</a> — is reaping the whirlwind.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How France’s extreme right mainstreamed itself</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rise of the RN can best be understood as a kind of double normalization, with each generation of Le Pens playing a distinct but crucial role.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After World War II, the European far right appeared to be a spent force. No political movement could hope to win national elections promising a Third Reich redux; those that tried found no success.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">French politics immediately after the war —&nbsp;the Fourth Republic period — was tumultuous. After a military revolt in 1958, World War II hero Charles de Gaulle took power and ushered in a new constitution. The Fifth Republic remains the system under which France operates today. After De Gaulle left power in 1969, French elections evolved into relatively stable contests between center-right and center-left blocs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jean-Marie Le Pen was the first to develop a credible far-right alternative.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Recognizing that the Nazis had rendered dictatorship and race hatred beyond the pale, Le Pen refocused the far right on contesting elections by attacking immigration. The argument wasn’t (primarily) that minorities were biologically inferior, just that France is under no obligation to admit culturally distinct foreigners and treat them as equals. After he founded the National Front for French Unity (FN) in 1972, the party adopted the slogan “France is for the French.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Le Pen paired this xenophobia with extreme nationalism. He was a veteran of France’s failed wars to keep colonies in Vietnam and Algeria; in one contemporary interview, he <a href="https://www.theafricareport.com/346813/le-pen-and-torture-in-algeria-individual-crime-or-historical-crime/">seemingly confessed to personally torturing Algerian detainees</a> (a charge he later denied). As a politician, Le Pen defended French imperialism and railed against its diminished glory in a post-colonial era. Immigration, for Le Pen, was a kind of “reverse colonization” in which France’s former subjects were destroying its identity from within.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because the FN was never an outright fascist party, it could put itself forward as something distinct from Europe’s discredited Hitlerite past. This “<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228468169_Reputational_shields_Why_most_anti-immigrant_parties_failed_in_Western_Europe_1980-2005">reputational shield</a>,” as scholars term it, helped it make inroads into French politics in ways that neo-Nazis never could. In 1984, just 12 years after its founding, the FN managed to win 11 percent of the national vote in a European Parliament election. It soon became a model for far-right parties across the continent, which <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0010414003251176">rapidly began outperforming neo-Nazi rivals.</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nonetheless, the FN had a clear ceiling,&nbsp;and Le Pen himself was a big part of the problem. The party’s founder has always had a habit of rhetorical bomb-throwing that kept it from making further inroads with the broader public.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He has repeatedly engaged in Nazi apologia, calling the Holocaust a “<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna29881495">detail</a>” of history and <a href="https://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/archives/latest-news-briefs-from-the-jewish-telegraphic-agency/article_546ad744-caba-5d66-8ade-587c7becc313.html">saying that </a>“in France, at least, the German occupation was not particularly inhuman.” In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/06/world/europe/07cnd-france.html">a 2006 interview</a>, he said that “you can’t dispute the inequality of the races” because “blacks are much better than whites at running, but whites are better at swimming.” In his 2018 memoir, he defended French citizens who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/world/europe/lepen-memoir-france-national-front.html">volunteered for the German SS during World War II</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I — like millions of other French people — grew up with the image of Le Pen as a snarling bigot with an underbite, a political bogeyman who tidily gathered up all the ugliness of France’s recent history,” journalist Nick Vinocur <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/marine-le-pen-turned-respectable-france-presidential-election/">writes in Politico</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Jean-Marie’s daughter Marine took over the FN in 2011, she was initially perceived in much the same way. But the younger Le Pen proved a cannier operator, not only realizing that her party needed an image makeover but successfully delivering on it.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/gettyimages-471796314.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="France&#039;s far-right political party Front National founder and honorary president Jean-Marie Le Pen gestures onstage as FN&#039;s president Marine Le Pen looks on, in Paris France, May 1, 2015. | Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP via Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Much of this was about language. As Vinocur reports, she shifted the party’s demagoguery away from direct attacks on Muslims and Arabs and toward dog-whistles about cultural change and terrorism.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She would occasionally discipline party members who crossed her lines — including, most notably, her father. In 2015, when Jean-Marie once again got into trouble over comments about Jews and the Holocaust, Le Pen did the unthinkable: She expelled her father from the party he founded. He should “no longer be able to speak in the name of the National Front,” <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34009901">she said at the time</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2018, following a decisive presidential defeat, she changed the party’s name from National Front to National Rally. While seemingly minor, the move helped distance the party from her father’s relatively toxic brand and establish Le Pen’s independence as a political figure.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the current election, she has tried to elevate candidates —&nbsp;most notably, 28-year-old party leader and proposed prime minister Jordan Bardella — who come across as normal, suit-wearing politicians rather than bombastic confessed torturers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Don’t be fooled. Experts on French politics say that Le Pen’s moderation is primarily symbolic. While she has sanded off the RN’s rough edges, she also has maintained the far-right policy core —&nbsp;most notably, the “national priority” system mandating discrimination against immigrants in public goods —&nbsp;that helped make her father’s party so toxic in the first place. During the current campaign, Bardella vowed to <a href="https://www.thelocal.fr/20240614/explained-what-is-le-pens-party-policy-on-dual-nationals-in-france">ban dual nationals from holding government jobs</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“From [a policy lens], there’s very little difference between what Marine Le Pen is running with and what Jean-Marie was defending,” says Marta Lorimer, a Cardiff University expert on French politics.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Together, in short, the Le Pens accomplished one of the most successful political rebrandings in modern history. They created a party rooted in thinly veiled bigotry and, without significant policy compromise, turned it into something that the median French voter might actually consider supporting.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Macron’s (implicit) deal with the devil</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The RN’s recent success is not merely a story of Marine Le Pen’s political skills. Like most European far-right parties, it benefited hugely from the 2015 refugee crisis, which turned its signature issue of immigration <a href="https://migrant-integration.ec.europa.eu/library-document/what-do-people-europe-think-about-migrants-special-eurobarometer-survey_en">into <em>the</em> issue across the continent</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Le Pen also benefited from the rise of Emmanuel Macron, a self-proclaimed “radical centrist” who shattered the foundations of France’s party system. In doing so, he created the perfect conditions for Le Pen’s rebranding to succeed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The traditionally dominant factions of the center right and center left, today called the Republican and Socialist parties, saw themselves as rivals with a shared responsibility: guarding the republic from extremist forces that would harm it. They agreed never to share power with the FN/RN, an agreement referred to as “the republican front” or “cordon sanitaire.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Macron broke the two-party system. In 2016, he quit his position as finance minister under a Socialist president to run for president at <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2017/5/8/15578338/french-election-2017-macron-le-pen-results">the head of a party he just founded</a>, now called Renaissance. At the time, this may have seemed like an act of extreme hubris. But Macron proved far more popular than either of his mainstream rivals, and he won the most voters in the first round of France’s 2017 election. He faced Marine Le Pen in the head-to-head second round and crushed her.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After winning power, Macron made two moves that would serve his short-term political interests but end up paving the way for the RN’s rise in the long run.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, Macron built his new party as a kind of centrist empire, one designed to occupy the entirety of the territory between radical right and extreme left. Containing both former Socialists and Republicans, its rise sapped the vitality from the already-weakened established parties.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Their decline should, in theory, have left Macron and Renaissance the only serious choice for most French voters. Certainly that was Macron’s theory.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No politician, even one as “<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/emmanuel-macron-jupiter-model-unlikely-to-stand-test-of-time-leadership-parliamentary-majority/">Jupiterian</a>” as Macron, can maintain a personal majority forever. Macron has become deeply unpopular, with a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-21/macron-approval-rating-falls-to-match-previous-low?embedded-checkout=true">mere 26 percent of French voters</a> approving of his current performance. It’s easy to blame specific policies, like his <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65279818">pension reform</a> and <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20181205-france-macron-abandons-fuel-tax-hike-fears-violence-new-yellow-vest-protests">failed gas tax</a>, but it also might be plain old exhaustion. Around the world, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/06/06/world-elections-anti-incumbent-leaders-backlash">incumbents are unpopular</a>,&nbsp;and Macron has been in office for seven years.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So if French voters want to vote against Macron, who should they turn to? The center right is a shadow of itself. The center left has been forced into an unwieldy “new popular front” <a href="https://time.com/6991254/macron-bardella-le-pen-far-right-left-election/">alliance with the polarizing and unstable extreme left</a>, led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon. There’s a smaller extreme-right party, led by comedian Eric Zemmour, but he’s even more radical than Le Pen.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That leaves only one non-Macron option with a proven electoral track record: the RN.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There’s only two options for voters,” says Florence Faucher, a professor of political science at France’s Sciences Po research center. “At some point, people are going to want change from the majority of Macron.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Macron didn’t just demolish the other centrist parties. He actually aided Le Pen’s strategy of normalizing her party by <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67778170">tacking to the right on immigration</a>. “It’s not so much that the National Rally has moderated [on immigration] than that the entire political system has radicalized,” says Lorimer.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Macron has, for example, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/2/macron-announces-new-plan-to-regulate-islam-in-france">said</a> that “Islam is a religion that is in crisis all over the world” and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/france-emmanuel-macron-abaya-muslim-dress-ban-schools-secularism/">banned</a> some traditional Muslim clothing in schools. (Roughly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/21/france-snap-parliamentary-elections-muslims-lyon-far-right-national-rally">6 million people in France</a> practice Islam or come from a Muslim background.) Last year, he had Parliament pass an immigration bill so draconian that Le Pen hailed it as “<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/france-marine-le-pen-scores-big-win-on-toughened-immigration-bill-macron/">an ideological victory</a>” for her party.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She was more correct than it seems. Some <a href="https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/207180/1/ZORA207180.pdf">research on European politics</a> suggests that when parties in the center take right-wing positions, they don’t actually win over that party’s supporters. Instead, they end up normalizing far-right discourse on the topic: helping people on the fence think it must not be so weird to rail against Islam if self-proclaimed centrists are doing it and that maybe they can consider voting for the far right without being a bad person.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That appears to be how Macron’s strategy has worked out in France. His attempt to take out Le Pen’s signature issue has only made her seem more reasonable, all without persuading her base to defect to the center.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“All the attempts to co-opt the far right have aided the process of normalization,” says Art Goldhammer, an expert on France at Harvard University’s Center for European Studies. “The slogan in France is that people prefer the original to the copy.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It wasn’t Macron’s intent to usher in an RN-led Parliament. His actions betray a belief that the RN would always have a ceiling; that, when push comes to shove, the French people would always choose his moderation over Le Pen’s extremism when presented with a binary choice.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This strategy has long worked in modern France, but Macron appears to have finally found its limits. The same arrogance that powered Macron’s 2017 presidential bid has now brought France to the brink of a Parliament dominated by radicals.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For more than 400 million years, horseshoe crabs — 10-eyed, blue-blooded, dome-shaped sea creatures — have lived on our planet, crawling ashore in spring and summer to mate and lay thousands of eggs that look a bit like grains of millet.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They were doing this before Pangea broke up into the continents we know today. They were doing this the year an Everest-sized, dinosaur-slaying asteroid smashed into what is now Mexico.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And they continued doing this as humans transformed the planet, replacing forests with farms, covering beaches with buildings, and flooding the air and water with pollution. Even on some of the most urban stretches of coastline, in North America and Asia, these creatures still appear each year to seed the next generation.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/Horseshoe_Spot.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,30.141532949541,100,39.716934100918" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Benji Jones/Vox" data-portal-copyright="Benji Jones/Vox" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">One evening during a heat wave in June, I drove to Plumb Beach in south Brooklyn with a couple of friends. It’s a beautiful spot. The water is calm and the sand is speckled with shells and tufts of tall grass. It’s also very much a city beach. Plastic takeout containers poke out of the sand. There’s a large tire in the shallows. Traffic on the Belt Parkway competes with the sound of waves.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nonetheless, in May and June, horseshoe crabs appear here, like magic, around full and new moons.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The females, which are noticeably larger than the males, release pheromones on their way into shore to draw in suitors. One lucky male will grab onto her rear, using a pair of specialized claws, and release sperm while she lays eggs in the sand. Other “satellite” males will follow the pair around and try —&nbsp;often with successful results —&nbsp;to get their sperm in the mix too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This ancient animal orgy was on full display that evening.&nbsp;Just before sunset, dozens of the crabs — which are not technically crabs but arthropods more closely related to spiders — started coming to shore. Most of them paired up. Every few meters I saw a female the size of a dinner plate dragging along a salad-plate-size male. Some crabs were in piles. Others were in conga lines: rows of five or more individuals all attached to each other.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The horseshoe crabs were coated in a colorful amalgam of other sea creatures —&nbsp;barnacles, mussels, snails, and even crustaceans — as if they each had their own style. Sometimes called walking hotels, these animals are a foundation for so much life. They are ecosystems unto themselves.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"><img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/331A0287.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Benji Jones/Vox" data-portal-copyright="Benji Jones/Vox" />

<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/331A0656-2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Benji Jones/Vox" data-portal-copyright="Benji Jones/Vox" /></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s not all they support. The many eggs that horseshoe crabs lay on the beach — which can number in the tens of thousands per female — are food for more than 20 species of migratory birds.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None, perhaps, rely on them more than red knots. Rotund sandpipers that sport rust-colored chests in the summer, they&#8217;re among the world’s most impressive travelers. In the eastern hemisphere, some red knots migrate more than 9,000 miles, from the tip of South America to the Arctic Circle. And they rely on horseshoe crab eggs to fuel this trip. In the spring, red knots time their journey north to align with spawning on the East Coast (and especially the Delaware Bay).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Red knots will use Plumb Beach to refuel, though I saw a different crew of egg-eaters that evening: laughing gulls, which are basically elevated seagulls. While they too are&nbsp;seagulls — a&nbsp;colloquial&nbsp;term&nbsp;that people tend to use for&nbsp;all gull species found near the sea — they have black heads and calls that sound like cackles. I watched dozens of them travel in a pack down the beach, feasting on eggs and laughing.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/331A0525.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="A flock of laughing gulls fly over Plumb Beach." title="A flock of laughing gulls fly over Plumb Beach." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Benji Jones/Vox" data-portal-copyright="Benji Jones/Vox" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Horseshoe crabs also support billions of human lives. Their blood, made blue by copper-based proteins that transport oxygen, is a medical marvel. It quickly clots in the presence of bacterial toxins, and that has made it invaluable for sterility testing. Scientists use horseshoe crab blood to make sure medical devices, intravenous drugs, and vaccines — including those for Covid-19 — are free of harmful bacteria and safe to use.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I find this all pretty remarkable: These animals, which are basically walking helmets, have been supporting life around them for hundreds of millions of years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/331A0534.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Horseshoe crab eggs." title="Horseshoe crab eggs." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Benji Jones/Vox" data-portal-copyright="Benji Jones/Vox" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Then there’s us.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In an imperceivable fraction of the horseshoe crab timeline, humans have torn countless lives apart. We’ve ripped up forests and grasslands and overfished the seas, and we’re now slowly cooking the planet with carbon dioxide. Humans are fracturing the support beams of ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We’re even challenging the resilience of horseshoe crabs. In the last few decades,&nbsp;and especially in the 1990s,&nbsp;millions of these crabs were harvested and drained of blood. They often died afterwards. Fishermen also capture horseshoe crabs and use them as bait for eels and conch. Overharvesting caused their population —&nbsp;and the populations of some birds that depend on them —&nbsp;to crash. Red knots are federally threatened under the US Endangered Species Act, largely due to a decline in horseshoe crabs.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/331A0342.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="A few horseshoe crabs swimming with their tail spines pointing out of the water." title="A few horseshoe crabs swimming with their tail spines pointing out of the water." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Benji Jones/Vox" data-portal-copyright="Benji Jones/Vox" /><img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/331A0359.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="A dead horseshoe crab upside down on the beach next to the top of a plastic container." title="A dead horseshoe crab upside down on the beach next to the top of a plastic container." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Benji Jones/Vox" data-portal-copyright="Benji Jones/Vox" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">When you glimpse these creatures on the beach, they don’t appear especially intelligent or skillful. Males will confuse other males for mates. Sometimes they even pair up with rocks. I also saw a number of them stuck upside down, like capsized June bugs, their legs moving in the air with an almost mechanical rhythm.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then again, these animals have outlived almost every other organism on Earth. They’re obviously doing something right. More profoundly, they’ve helped sustain life around them. I might even suggest that we should all aspire to be more like horseshoe crabs. We should look up to these sea spiders, and try fortifying ecosystems rather than destroying them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So many important issues are at stake in the 2024 election: <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-trump-on-key-foreign-policy-issues-/7561392.html">foreign policy</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/explainers/356314/abortion-laws-roe-wade-dobbs-decision-mifepristone-supreme-court">reproductive rights</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/356761/bidens-border-record-trumps-claims-vs-reality">immigration</a>, the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24159069/trump-guardrails-authoritarian-democracy-second-term">future of American democracy</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But coming out of the first debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, one topic has crowded all those out: Biden’s performance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden’s rationale for agreeing to this historically early presidential debate was, in part, to try and put concerns over his age to rest. Instead, they’ve been supercharged. Multiple reports soon after the debate claimed that top Democrats were downright panicked by how Biden came off onstage. Major media outlets wrote that Biden “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/06/27/presidential-debate-live-updates/?itid=hp-top-table-main_p001_f001">struggled</a>” and appeared “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/06/27/us/biden-trump-debate">shaky</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden is the oldest president ever, and Republicans have long been trying to push an exaggerated narrative that he is senile. He didn’t seem senile on stage — but he didn’t seem sharp, either. He spoke very softly, his answers were often messy on the substance, and when he did have decent lines they were usually hampered by his halting and understated delivery.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sources told NBC News midway through the debate that Biden <a href="https://x.com/kellyo/status/1806505436457189594?s=46">has a cold</a>, implying his affect was a one-off fluke. The risk, though, is that voters determined after watching that he is simply not up for the job he wants to keep. This was, after all, the most prolonged look at Biden in an adversarial setting we’ve gotten in some time, and he didn’t come off well.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s performance was no great shakes: He said absurd and untrue things, rambled and lost coherence. But he did it more energetically — and, more to the point, he was typical Trump, no one would be surprised by what he said or how he said it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On one level, all of the above is so shallow and superficial that I feel somewhat embarrassed to have written it. Politics should be about more than theater criticism and affect. It’s about important issues that will affect the lives of millions of people.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unfortunately, the question of what a relatively small group of swing voters thinks about Joe Biden’s age may well be what the 2024 election hinges on. Many Democrats think they have a winning argument against Trump on the issues, but they’re worried that Biden simply can’t make the case. So the most immediate consequence of Thursday’s debate will be a revival of chatter about <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357746/biden-trump-debate-democrats-replace-dnc">whether Biden should even stay</a> in the race or <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/357739/biden-trump-debate-democrats-replace-nominee-whitmer-moore-newsom">whether there’s still some other option</a> for Democrats. And that consequence makes for a pretty clear set of takeaways for the race in the wake of this debate. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Loser: Joe Biden</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No need to belabor the point: If the debate ends with your party debating whether you should even stay in the race, it’s pretty obvious you lost.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Biden “age issue” is really a conflation of a few separate things. Again, there’s the exaggerated right-wing narrative that he’s senile. There are normal concerns about aging slowing people down somewhat mentally and physically. There’s the question about whether his health would hold up in a second term. There are questions about whether any of this has impaired his decision-making or governance (I don’t believe it has; it’s hard to point to an example of any administration that would be different if he was Joe Biden but younger).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there’s also a more difficult concern for Biden to rebut: that he has failed to appropriately “perform” the role of president or presidential candidate. That he hasn’t been good at seeming like he’s in command, like he’s energetic, can handle tough questioning, and is up to the job. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is where he failed most glaringly during the debate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For many elite Democrats, the worry about Biden’s age is mainly a meta-worry: It’s about what swing voters will think about Biden’s age. If that’s your rubric, it doesn’t matter if you think he’s doing a great job as president; what matters is what the swing voters will think. And it’s hard to believe many liked what they saw on Thursday.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Winner: Donald Trump</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By default, in a two-person contest, Trump won the debate due to Biden’s weakness. But his performance was not particularly impressive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As usual, Trump got sidetracked into his perennial grievances (“Russia Russia Russia,” “the laptop,” James Comey, false claims of 2020 election fraud). He lied, said ridiculous things, and dodged questions. He also missed opportunities: Biden was shaky enough that a more disciplined and savvy Republican candidate could well have embarrassed him far more — by, for instance, posing questions directly to him and truly throwing him off.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump did benefit from the relative lack of focus on his attempt to steal the 2020 election and his recent criminal conviction. And perhaps the way he won most was that the debate seemed to normalize him: His attack on American democracy was just one issue among many, only showing up halfway through. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Loser: Substantive issues</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Look, it never seemed particularly likely that with these two candidates on stage this debate would be an enlightening and nuanced exchange about policy issues. Neither are wonks, Trump lies constantly, and every debate he has participated in ends up devolving into a mudslinging contest.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, for anyone interested in substance, this debate was a truly desultory affair.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On abortion, Trump accused Biden of wanting to kill 9-month-old babies and Biden <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/27/politics/read-biden-trump-debate-rush-transcript/index.html#:~:text=BIDEN%3A%20I%20supported%20Roe%20v.%20Wade%2C%20which%20had%20three%20trimesters.%20First%20time%20is%20between%20a%20woman%20and%20a%20doctor.%20Second%20time%20is%20between%20the%20doctor%20and%20an%20extreme%20situation.%20And%20a%20third%20time%20is%20between%20the%20doctor%20%E2%80%93%20I%20mean%2C%20it%E2%80%99d%20be%20between%20the%20woman%20and%20the%20state.">struggled to explain</a> <em>Roe v. Wade</em>’s three-trimester framework. On climate change, Trump bragged that while he was president the country had clean air and “H2O.” On the economy, Biden claimed Trump destroyed the economy in 2020, while Trump claimed Biden solely caused inflation and has only created jobs for migrants — all false.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The nadir was the supremely stupid exchange in which both candidates insulted each other’s golf games. ”I’m happy to play golf if you carry your own bag,” Biden said. Trump responded by mocking Biden’s “swing.” Why?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Winner: Kamala Harris</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Back in March, Biden’s fiery State of the Union address quieted many concerns among Democrats over whether he was up to the rigors of another campaign. Now, the debate has reopened that topic of discussion.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It will take more time (and polling numbers) to determine just how serious the damage to Biden is. Maybe mainly politics die-hards who have their minds made up were the people watching this very early debate. The media may focus on Biden’s age for a while, but attention will inevitably shift to other topics.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, the odds that Kamala Harris ends up the Democratic presidential nominee for 2024 are, in my view, higher after the debate than they were before it. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Democratic National Convention is at the end of August. Biden won the primaries and has most Democratic delegates pledged to him, so he can’t be totally pushed out against his will. But if power players in the party tell him that he has to step down — and he listens — then Harris would be the obvious next in line.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When this scenario has been discussed, it’s often been about an “open” convention, where delegates would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/21/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-elaine-kamarck.html">come together</a> to somehow choose their own nominee, as in older political eras. My guess is that this would be far too messy and impractical, and coordination and consensus-building around one option would be too difficult. There have been doubts within the party about Harris’s political strength, but if Democratic elites come to agree Biden is fatally politically flawed, they’d be more likely to roll the dice with her.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For now, dropping Biden still seems very unlikely. But it seems less unlikely than it did Thursday morning.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Three separate times during Thursday night’s debate, CNN’s moderators asked Donald Trump if he would commit to accepting the legitimacy of the 2024 election results regardless of who won. He never did.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead, Trump said that he’d accept the results if he thought they were “fair and legal and good” — while at the same time repeating the false claim that the 2020 election was shot through with fraud (a claim that the moderators let stand).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Put together, the former president was all but openly telling us that he’s ready to repeat the campaign of lies and incitement that produced a mob attack on the Capitol less than four years ago. (He did offer a rote rejection of political violence.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That all of this felt normal, even expected, shows how much Donald Trump has warped our sense of what’s tolerable in America. Here was an authoritarian spouting falsehoods, ranting incoherently about policy, issuing thinly veiled threats against democracy, and somehow we’ve come to accept it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We’re all so used to this behavior, in fact, that we have trouble reminding ourselves how dangerous it is. I can guarantee Trump’s comments on the election won’t be the top headline at any major newspaper in the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That honor will likely go to Joe Biden’s poor performance, and I can understand why. The president of the United States barely stringing a cogent answer together for the first hour of a nationally televised debate is indeed a major story. It seems like the critics <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/16/opinion/ezra-klein-biden-audio-essay.html">warning about Biden’s age</a> had a point.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there’s something quietly obscene about Trump’s naked authoritarianism falling out of the frame. It wasn’t only these few comments about election results: It was his entire performance, <a href="https://x.com/nytimes/status/1806527958095474702">a cavalcade of lies</a> that betrayed a staggering contempt for the American public’s intelligence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Thursday night, an authoritarian put his distaste for democracy on open display. Opposite him was a man who <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/01/05/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-third-anniversary-of-the-january-6th-attack-and-defending-the-sacred-cause-of-american-democracy-blue-bell-pa/">claims to care about democracy</a> above all else but has seemed wholly incapable of considering whether there might be some tension between its future and his own ambitions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Blame Biden for running again. Blame the Democratic Party for failing to stop him. Blame CNN for burying the democracy questions halfway through the debate. Blame the Republicans for nominating Trump. Blame Trump, most of all, for acting the way he chooses to act — and his voters for standing by him while he does it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump reminded us tonight that he is uniquely unfit for office and hostile to our democracy. The fact that those qualities have lost their ability to shock underscores just how much the man has bent our politics to his will.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><br>A comatose Joe Biden would make a better president than Donald Trump. And the president’s capacity to lead the executive branch is, by most accounts, far greater than his capacity to speak in coherent, extemporaneous sentences on CNN.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the idea that Joe Biden is the best possible standard-bearer for the Democratic Party this November has lost all plausibility.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/357642/biden-trump-debate-presidential-cnn-poll-takeaways-live-coverage">first presidential debate</a> in Atlanta Thursday night, Trump spouted an endless stream of deranged lies, painting a portrait of a nonexistent United States in which babies are summarily executed in maternity wards, undocumented criminals live in the penthouses of luxury hotels on Uncle Sam’s dime, and the world’s wealthiest nation has become “a Third World country.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Biden’s senescence spoke louder than Trump’s mendacity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The president spoke in broken sentences through a soft, sometimes tremulous voice (Biden’s campaign said that he had a cold). At various points, his mind failed to keep pace with his lips, causing him to abandon a half-delivered talking point or else lose his train of thought entirely. In one excruciating early moment — while trying to advertise his administration’s efforts to cap the prices of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries — Biden said that he had been “making sure that we’re able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I’ve been able to do with &#8230; the Covid &#8230; excuse me, with, um, dealing with everything we have to do with &#8230; uh &#8230; look &#8230; if &#8230; we finally beat Medicare.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The president’s visual appearance was similarly unsettling, his skin pallid and his mouth hanging oddly agape during some of Trump’s answers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This despairing spectacle — of a viciously dishonest insurrectionist turning in a debate performance that, if juxtaposed with anything but the president’s even more disjointed efforts would have seemed astoundingly rambling and incoherent — led many Democrats on <a href="https://x.com/JulianCastro/status/1806519938984845809">social media</a> and in <a href="https://x.com/charles_lister/status/1806518997732438091?s=46&amp;t=DqqqiPqo3dK8m-7tJy5LZA">private channels</a> to call for Biden’s replacement. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those calls are now irrefutable.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">The case for Biden was weak even before the debate</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Americans currently disapprove of the president’s job performance by <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/">a roughly 18-point margin</a>, according to FiveThirtyEight’s polling average. By contrast, voters disapprove of Trump by <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/">only 11 points on average</a>, and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/">Kamala Harris</a> by only 10.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When asked whether they plan to vote for a Democrat or Republican for Congress, voters favor Democrats by <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/">a margin of 45.6 to 45.1</a>. In polls of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/20/joe-biden-underperforming-democrats-polls-00164156">battleground state electorates,</a> Democratic Senate candidates routinely run far ahead of Biden. Democrats have plenty of political challenges as a party, but Biden had even more as a candidate even before the cameras started rolling in Atlanta.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The president is saddled with the misfortune of presiding over the highest inflation in four decades. This does not reflect any great economic mismanagement on his part; to the contrary, he has <a href="https://www.vox.com/24134257/biden-economy-inflation-wages-interest-rate">shepherded the US to the strongest recovery</a> of any G-7 country. Yet, across the wealthy world, more or less <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/its-not-just-biden">every leader</a> who presided over 2022’s inflation has suffered overwhelming public disapproval. For many voters, Biden is the personification of price increases. Even if he were in his prime as an orator, there would be a case for swapping him out merely because bad luck had damaged his brand.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But of course, Biden is not in his prime. He would be 82 years old at his second inauguration and 86 at the close of his second term. It strains credulity to claim that the person best suited to run the United States is an octogenarian. Were the Democratic nominee anyone else, Trump’s age — 78 —  would be a significant liability for the Republicans. But Biden is three years older than Trump, and<em> </em>seems about a decade his senior. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Or so voters appear to think. In <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/poll-americans-on-biden-age/story?id=107126589">an ABC News poll</a> from February, 86 percent of voters said that Biden was too old to serve another term. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Partly for these reasons, Biden has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/upshot/introducing-2024-poll-tracker.html">trailing Trump</a> in polls of virtually every swing state. And in both 2016 and 2020, the polls significantly overestimated Democratic support in the Electoral College’s battlegrounds. Before Thursday night, <a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/nate-silver-2024-president-election-polls-model">Nate Silver’s model</a> gave Trump a 66 percent chance of winning.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thus, there was already a solid case for Biden to step aside and let Kamala Harris or some other Democrat lead the party into November’s election, even before his dispiriting debate performance. By far the most likely consequence of staying the course was America’s reelection of a corrupt and authoritarian reactionary. Rolling the dice on a new candidate was plausibly the party’s best move.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then, Biden went on national television and made it impossible for anyone to honestly say, “I am confident that the president will still be fit to serve in January 2029.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">It is not too late for Democrats to replace Joe Biden (with his cooperation)</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is no way for the Democratic Party to deny Biden the nomination at this point. But Democratic leaders could personally lobby the president to step aside and endorse his preferred successor, preempting the hazards of a contested Democratic convention in late August. Waiting months to anoint a presumptive nominee would be highly risky. Rallying around Biden’s handpicked heir now would be much less so.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If one wishes to minimize intra-party strife, then Biden could simply endorse his vice president, who already functions as his default replacement. Few consider Harris to be among her party’s best political talents, but she offers far more upside than the version of Biden we saw Thursday night. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Democratic leaders believe that it would be possible for Biden to endorse a more electorally formidable candidate (perhaps Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer?) without alienating key constituencies, then that might be the optimal course of action. Sticking with Biden, plainly, is not. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The president’s policy positions and governing record matter more than his current skills as a rhetorician. But precisely because of how much is substantively at stake in this election, Democrats cannot afford to wager it on American voters changing their minds and deciding that Biden isn’t too old for his job after watching him struggle to remember the topics of his own sentences. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many aspects of Biden’s legacy are laudable. His best chance for preserving it would be to voluntarily end his presidency after one term before voters get the chance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That President Joe Biden, age 81, is an elderly man is nothing new.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the first presidential debate between Biden and former President Donald Trump Thursday night has pushed the question of Biden’s age to the top of the public’s consciousness. His verbal stumbles, weak voice (the campaign <a href="https://x.com/axios/status/1806514229500850238">has said</a> that he was dealing with a cold) and meandering responses to Trump’s jabs and the moderators’ questions are likely to bring up one question: Is there any way Biden could be replaced as the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The short answer is, practically, there probably isn&#8217;t. All 50 states have already held their primaries, and Biden has won the vast majority of their delegates. Only Biden himself can direct those delegates to vote for someone else, as they are pledged to vote for him unless he drops out before the Democratic convention this August.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is where practical and political challenges merge: Biden is the only one who can decide if he wants to drop out before the floor vote. No secretive party apparatus or individual can direct him to do it. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And unless Biden has a serious change of heart after Thursday night, there are plenty of reasons that wouldn’t happen.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The real-world challenges</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first obstacle: Presidents are chosen through elections between candidates picked through a specific, organized party process.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Democratic presidential nominee is chosen in August at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where a candidate needs to win the support of the majority of the Democratic delegates. Those delegates are assigned proportionally based on the vote totals in a state’s primary (for any candidate who wins more than 15 percent of votes) and are then <a href="https://apnews.com/article/presidential-election-delegate-selection-process-primary-caucus-9720daa8d706a4afceaa2d939f59a1b9">“pledged” or “bound” to that candidate</a> in the first round of voting at the Democratic convention. Under this system, some other candidate would need to win more delegates than Biden in order to become the nominee.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Biden has not just all the delegates he needs, but essentially all the delegates, period. So practically, there isn’t anyone that could be swapped in at this point.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And according to DNC rules, these delegates are bound to support Biden during the first floor vote of the DNC.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyond the limits set by that process, there are also practical financial hurdles: Only Biden has the fundraising and money machine necessary on the Democratic side to run ads, hold events, hire staff, and, effectively, run a campaign. No other Democrat, elected or unelected, has that practical machinery in place.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Political challenges are still tricky</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At this point, it’s also politically risky for anyone to try to publicly force Biden out.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Democratic establishment has already united around Biden — endorsing him, stumping for him, and leading the party’s operations not only because he is the incumbent,<em> </em>but because it’s him specifically<em>. </em>They have deep relationships with him and are loyal to him.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is also where it’s important to dispel the notion that anyone could force Biden to drop out.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The DNC is not some omnipotent, shadowy operation that has the power, influence, or ability to crown a different party leader. Who do you think <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/jaime-harrison-picked-new-democratic-national-committee-chair-n1254292">chose the DNC chair and vice-chairs</a>? Biden! There just isn’t a council of decision-makers who can tell Biden to drop out or choose to ditch him.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The power of party elites is <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-parties-cant-decide">often overstated</a>, and the primaries so far show the influence of voters. As unpopular as Biden might seem to some folks, he still won handily in the 2020 primary, and when given options to protest-vote in New Hampshire or select “none of these candidates” in Nevada this year, Democrats have still sided with Biden.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And all the leading figures who could replace him — Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, maybe even Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (let alone Vice President Kamala Harris) are all major public surrogates and supporters of Biden. They wouldn’t publicly turn on him now. And it’s not clear that they would privately try to force him out. Even at the most self-interested level, none of them has an incentive to let the other strongarm a Biden capitulation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So only Biden could make the decision to drop out. He doesn’t want to (not least because he sees himself as key to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/biden-says-trump-wasnt-running-m-not-sure-d-running-rcna128232">stopping Trump’s reelection</a>). And even if he did choose to, the only option that would not risk massive dissension among the Democratic base would be to choose his vice president, <a href="https://www.vox.com/kamala-harris">Kamala Harris</a>. The vice president has her own political drawbacks: She <a href="https://x.com/admcrlsn/status/1755963760173289503?s=20">polls</a> <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-harris">worse</a> than Biden against Trump, has never run a successful national campaign, and, unfortunately, faces different voter prejudices because she is a woman of color.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other polls also show similarly negative results for Whitmer, Shapiro, and Newsom. They have <a href="https://x.com/admcrlsn/status/1756003253190357282?s=20">polled worse</a> than Biden, or are biding their time. And to bypass Harris for one of them also opens up potential ire from Black voters, without whom Democrats can’t win.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Should another Democrat savior emerge, with the vocal support of someone like Barack Obama and a core of Biden-critical strategists and politicians, and should first lady Jill Biden and other Biden confidantes approach Biden and convince him to drop out, we’d likely head toward a brokered convention with multiple rounds of voting. That also opens up the chance for even more chaos and disunity among Democrats. Does that seem worth it to anyone in Democratic politics right now?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At least until Thursday night, the answer was simple: No. It’s too late.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are facing off in the first presidential debate of the 2024 general election on Thursday, June 27. It’s a historic rematch, the first ever debate between a sitting president and a former president. While some voters might feel a sense of déjà vu, the outcome of this election is far from certain.&nbsp;National polls show a close race between Biden and Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The world was different when Trump and Biden debated four years ago, so we <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/356699/2020-debate-rewatch-2024-biden-trump-lessons">rewatched</a> their 2020 debates to remind us of how much has changed. This time around, we expect the economy, crime, immigration, and abortion to emerge as major issues — and we’re here to help you make sense of these <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/356784/trump-biden-economy-abortion-immigration-crime-explained">contested policy areas</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The debate, moderated by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, starts at 9 pm ET and will run for 90 minutes. In an effort to keep it focused, there will be no live audience, opening statements, props, or pre-written notes onstage. The position of Trump&#8217;s and Biden’s lecterns will be determined by a coin flip and their microphones will be muted except for when it’s their turn to speak.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Thursday, the Court handed down a 6-3 decision, on a party-line vote, that could render a simply astonishing array of federal laws unenforceable. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor writes in dissent, “the constitutionality of hundreds of statutes may now be in peril, and dozens of agencies could be stripped of their power to enforce laws enacted by Congress.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The dispute in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-859_1924.pdf"><em>Securities and Exchange Commission v. Jarkesy</em></a> turns on whether a hedge fund manager accused of defrauding investors is entitled to a jury trial to determine whether he violated federal securities law, or whether the government acted properly when it tried him before an official known as an “administrative law judge” (ALJ).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The charges against this hedge fund manager, George Jarkesy, are civil and not criminal, which matters because the Constitution treats civil trials very differently from criminal proceedings. While the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment">Sixth Amendment</a> provides that “in all criminal prosecutions” the defendant is entitled to a jury trial, the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment">Seventh Amendment</a> provides a more limited jury trial right, requiring them “in suits at common law” (more on what that means later).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the question of whether Jarkesy is entitled to a jury trial arose in the absence of any precedent, then he’d have a reasonably strong case that he should prevail. But, as Sotomayor lays out in her dissent, nearly 170 years of precedent cut against Jarkesy’s position.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Congress, moreover, has enacted a wide range of laws on the presumption that many enforcement proceedings may be brought before administrative law judges and not juries. According to one somewhat dated review of federal law cited by Sotomayor, “by 1986, there were over 200” federal statutes calling for trials before ALJs. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of these laws, including the one allowing the SEC to bring enforcement actions against people like Jarkesy, give the government a choice. That is, they allow federal agencies to bring a proceeding either before an ALJ or before a federal district court that may conduct a jury trial. So the SEC, at least, has the option of retrying Jarkesy in a district court.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But, as Sotomayor warns, many federal agencies — including the “Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission, the Department of Agriculture, and many others” — may only seek civil penalties in administrative proceedings. That means that a wide array of laws guaranteeing workplace safety and advancing other important federal goals could cease to function after <em>Jarkesy</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <em>Jarkesy</em> case, in other words, is an example of the Roberts Court at its most arrogant. Were the Court tasked with resolving the dispute on a blank slate, then there are entirely plausible arguments that Mr. Jarkesy should be entitled to a jury trial. But that ship sailed many years ago, and the federal government has operated for an exceedingly long time on the assumption that many disputes can be adjudicated by ALJs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By upending this longstanding assumption, the Court may have just thrown huge swaths of the federal government — particularly enforcement by those agencies Sotomayor listed — into chaos.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So when does a civil defendant have a right to a jury trial?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Seventh Amendment provides that civil litigants generally have a right to a jury trial “in suits at common law,” but what does that mean?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Broadly speaking, the common law refers to the body of judge-made law developed by English courts, much of which was imported into American law and which still governs many American lawsuits involving matters such as contracts and torts. Common law courts typically had the power to award money damages to a victorious plaintiff, which distinguishes them from <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/court_of_equity">courts of “equity”</a> that had the power to issue injunctions and other non-monetary relief. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Chief Justice John Roberts’s majority opinion in <em>Jarkesy</em> leans heavily into the kind of remedy available to the SEC if it prevails in a suit before an ALJ. Like a suit before a common law court, the SEC sought monetary damages from Jarkesy, and thus this case resembles a suit at common law in that way. As Roberts writes, “money damages are the prototypical common law remedy.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Additionally, Roberts notes that common law courts also historically had the power to hear suits alleging fraud. Thus, the suit against Jarkesy resembles a common law suit in that way as well.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most of this part of Roberts’s opinion is uncontroversial. His disagreement with Sotomayor turns on a longstanding exception to the jury trial right known as the “public rights” doctrine.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The term “common law” refers to judge-created law developed over the course of many centuries, as distinct from law created by acts of a state legislature or Congress. The somewhat unhelpfully named public rights doctrine provides that many lawsuits that arise under federal statutes are not subject to the Seventh Amendment, and thus the government is free to try these cases in an administrative proceeding without a jury.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The earliest Supreme Court case applying this public rights doctrine was <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/59/272/">handed down in 1856</a>, so it isn’t exactly an idea invented by 20th-century Progressive Era reformers who wanted to eliminate barriers to law enforcement. As the Court explained in <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-supreme-court/430/442.html"><em>Atlas Roofing v. OSHA</em></a> (1977), the doctrine applies when Congress passes a law authorizing suits by the federal government that are “unknown to the common law.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In “cases in which the Government sues in its sovereign capacity to enforce public rights created by statutes within the power of Congress to enact,” <em>Atlas Roofing</em> held, “the Seventh Amendment does not prohibit Congress from assigning the factfinding function and initial adjudication to an administrative forum with which the jury would be incompatible.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thus, this public rights doctrine does have limits. It applies only to suits brought by the federal government, and only when the government sues to enforce a federal statute authorizing a kind of suit that did not already exist under the common law. But, in those circumstances, trial before an ALJ is permitted.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though Roberts’s opinion denies that it overrules <em>Atlas Roofing</em> and similar cases, he speaks of that decision in disparaging terms. And his opinion places such an extraordinary amount of weight on the fact that the SEC sought money damages against Mr. Jarkesy that it is unclear how much, if any, of the public rights doctrine remains.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Were this the first time that such an issue came up, that might not be that big of a deal. Had Congress known a century ago that the Supreme Court would someday eliminate its ability to assign certain cases to ALJs, it could have written hundreds of statutes differently so that they would be enforced in jury trials. It also could have appropriated sufficient money to federal agencies to allow them to hire trial counsel who could bring proceedings in federal district courts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Congress has instead operated for many decades under the assumption that cases like <em>Atlas Roofing</em> are good law. And now the Supreme Court has pulled the rug out from under a multitude of federal statutes.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">This Court doesn’t typically care this much about the Seventh Amendment</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In light of the Court’s newfound appreciation for civil jury trials, it’s worth noting that the Court’s Republican appointees have historically read the Seventh Amendment very narrowly in cases that do not involve hedge fund managers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Court has long held that companies may force their workers and consumers to sign away their right to sue that company in a real court — one that can conduct a jury trial — and instead <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/3/14/22969321/supreme-court-forced-arbitration-southwest-airlines-saxon-circuit-city-adams">have the case heard by a private arbitrator</a>. The Court has, at times, claimed that forced arbitration is lawful because workers and consumers nominally consent to arbitration when they decide to do business with the company. But many of the Court’s arbitration decisions raise very serious questions about whether the justices understand what the word “consent” means.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-285_q8l1.pdf"><em>Epic Systems v. Lewis</em></a> (2018), for example, the Court held that an employer can simply order their employees to give up their right to a jury trial, under pain of termination.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So the Court’s approach to the Seventh Amendment is incoherent, and after <em>Jarkesy</em>, it could lead to dozens or even hundreds of federal laws arbitrarily ceasing to function.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I’m really tired of being called a protectionist,” <a href="https://ustr.gov/about-us/biographies-key-officials/katherine-tai-ambassador">Katherine Tai</a>, President Joe Biden’s trade representative and a leading architect of his confrontational economic approach to China, told me on Monday.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given what Biden’s opponent has been saying lately, I empathize. Former President Donald Trump reportedly told Republican lawmakers he wants <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/13/trump-all-tariff-policy-to-replace-income-tax.html">an “all tariff” policy</a>, in which all federal taxes would be replaced with taxes on imports. In the near term, Trump has <a href="https://time.com/6972022/donald-trump-transcript-2024-election/">committed to a 10 percent tariff</a> on all imports from any country. Next to proposals like that — which would explode consumer prices and make the tax code far more regressive — Biden and Tai sound like free-traders.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But compared to the bipartisan consensus that prevailed until Trump took office, I think “protectionist” is fair. Tai and Biden have continued many of Trump’s tariffs from his term, <a href="https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2022/december/statement-ustr-spokesperson-adam-hodge">in defiance of World Trade Organization (WTO) rebukes</a>. This spring saw a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/14/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-action-to-protect-american-workers-and-businesses-from-chinas-unfair-trade-practices/">flurry of new Biden tariffs targeting China</a>, most notably hitting electric vehicles and batteries.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tai and the administration see themselves as charting a new course, reversing anti-worker trade policies of the past. “We have shunted workers to the side,” Tai told my colleague and <em>Today, Explained</em> host Noel King, “and we need a domestic and international economic policy that champions the interests of our people.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But was the previous era really so bad? And are the Biden administration’s policies helping matters?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Global trade helped the poor catch up</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From the perspective of humanity as a whole, the period of hyper-globalization starting in 1990 was kind of miraculous. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030438782100064X">Growth rates in poor countries have sped up markedly</a>, and economists have found they were gradually “converging” toward rich countries. This era saw <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/the-share-and-number-of-people-living-in-extreme-poverty">dramatic reductions in extreme poverty</a>, especially but not solely in China.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For manufacturing workers in rich countries, however, the consequences were grim. Regions and industries in the US exposed to competition from Chinese imports saw <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20131578">declining employment</a>, <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-economics-080315-015041">lower lifetime incomes</a>, and even <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20180396">higher drug overdoses</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, <a href="https://bigdatachina.csis.org/the-china-shock-reevaluating-the-debate/">researchers</a>, including <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/on-the-persistence-of-the-china-shock/">those who identified some of the biggest costs of the “China shock,”</a> have found that the US as a whole benefited from trade with China, albeit modestly. Chinese imports lowered the cost of goods, which raises living standards for poor people in particular, given <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/02/13/low-income-high-inflation-inequality/">how much more they have to spend on consumer goods</a> as a share of their income than the well-off.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We could preserve the gains from globalization to both the world and the US while addressing its very real costs by combining open trade with more assistance to workers displaced in the process, such as through the <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5acbd8e736099b27ba4cfb36/t/5be07a4140ec9a642e20aa70/1541438026120/Hyman_TAA_Latest.pdf">successful Trade Adjustment Assistance program</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, <a href="https://www.salon.com/2016/04/21/elites_are_clueless_on_trade_paul_krugman_cant_connect_the_dots_of_his_own_analysis_partner/">critics have long contended</a> that the redistribution offered to those who’ve lost out has been, in practice, far too limited.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s fed a desire for a more confrontational attitude toward exporters like China, culminating in the tariffs adopted by Trump and largely continued by Biden.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Trump tariffs didn’t work</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In her interview with Vox, Ambassador Tai contended that consumers do not necessarily wind up paying the cost of high tariffs. “When we have started looking back at the last five and six years of prices in the United States, you did not see an automatic increase in prices as a result of tariffs,” she told King. After all, the companies that import goods could simply choose not to pass along the cost of tariffs to their customers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Except, in reality, they always <em>do</em> pass along the cost. At least <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.33.4.187">four</a> <a href="https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/135/1/1/5626442">different</a> <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20190611">high-quality</a> <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20190536">studies</a> have looked at the Trump tariffs. All have found “complete” or “almost complete” passthrough: that is, the tariffs were paid for entirely or almost entirely by US consumers in the form of higher prices. Make no mistake: US consumers pay for tariffs we impose.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, <a href="https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2024-01/Help%20for%20the%20Heartland%20-%20The%20Employment%20and%20Electoral%20Effects%20of%20the%20Trump%20Tariffs%20in%20the%20United%20States.pdf">Trump’s tariffs did not succeed in creating jobs in the US</a>. They did, however, destroy jobs in agriculture by prompting China to retaliate with its own tariffs, particularly on soybeans and cotton. It’s not clear to me that Biden’s tariff regime will be any more successful at preserving or adding jobs in sectors like battery and auto manufacturing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even though they were an economic dud,&nbsp; the researchers found the tariffs were a political success. Areas protected by Trump’s tariffs were more likely to vote for him in 2020.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though Tai certainly believes in tariffs against China on the merits, you don’t have to be a total cynic to wonder how much political factors are driving the Biden administration’s tariff policy too.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Trade and the world order</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tai has also continued the Trump policy of <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/93024/its-time-for-the-united-states-to-end-its-bipartisan-attack-on-the-wto/">obstructing appointments to the WTO’s appeals board</a>, and spent much of our interview criticizing the global trade body for inadequately fighting China’s own protectionist policies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She and her team have been <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/commentary/transcript/us-trade-representative-katherine-tai-transatlantic-trade/">talking a lot</a> about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Trade_Organization">International Trade Organization</a>, a never-created agency floated 80 years ago by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. They see it as a more pro-worker, pro-environment, and anti-monopoly vision of what international cooperation on trade might look like. FDR, Tai told me, understood the power of “market-based economies coming together to fend off the challenges of fascism on the right and communism on the left.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As an economic history nerd, I find discussions about FDR’s trade philosophy fascinating, but I did not expect to have one with a White House Cabinet member in 2024. We don’t have an ITO because the <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/blogs-and-reviews/protectionism-nothing-new-republicans">US Congress</a> blocked it in 1950. If you look through the <a href="https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/havana_e.pdf">institution’s charter</a>, which Tai is right to say includes a lot of tough anti-monopoly and labor rights language, “a lot of it is not something the US Congress would ever sign up for,” <a href="https://www.cfr.org/expert/inu-manak">Inu Manak</a>, a trade policy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tai is surely thinking about China when she invokes the dream of an organization uniting “market-based economies” against fascism and communism. But at the same time she is defending <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/section-232-tariffs-steel-aluminum-2024/">tariffs on steel and aluminum</a> that apply to almost all countries, not just China.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Biden administration’s <a href="https://www.cato.org/commentary/bye-america">Buy American provisions</a> hurt allies like South Korea too, and Biden is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-china-steel-tariffs-union-workers-0399b0450b67086ca86edc43ac45e5e9">opposing a Japanese company’s effort to purchase US Steel</a>. Is this really just about China, or a more general (here’s that word Tai hates again) protectionist turn?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I hope I’m wrong. Tai has expressed <a href="https://agoa.info/news/article/16376-remarks-by-ambassador-katherine-tai-at-the-closing-ceremony-of-the-20th-agoa-forum.html">strong support for US trade preferences toward Africa</a>, which gives me some optimism that the new paradigm she represents will treat poor countries fairly. But so far, the new trade approach is mostly reminding me of how much we gained from the old one — and how much we might lose by abandoning it.</p>

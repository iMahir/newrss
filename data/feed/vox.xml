<p class="has-text-align-none">Additional explosions, reportedly <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/09/18/israel-detonates-hezbollah-walkie-talkies-second-wave-after-pager-attack">involving thousands of walkie-talkies</a>, went off in Lebanon Wednesday, a day after hundreds of pagers exploded simultaneously in Lebanon and Syria in an attack that apparently targeted members of Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Islamist militant organization and Lebanese political party.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/09/18/israel-detonates-hezbollah-walkie-talkies-second-wave-after-pager-attack">Israel</a> was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/18/world/israel-hezbollah-gaza-hamas/here-is-the-latest-on-the-pager-attack?smid=url-share">reportedly behind both</a> attacks, though it has not taken public credit. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/17/middleeast/lebanon-hezbollah-pagers-explosions-intl/index.html">Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate</a>. The Lebanese government has <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/17/middleeast/lebanon-pager-attack-explosions-hezbollah-explainer-intl-latam/index.html">characterized the pager attack</a> as “criminal Israeli aggression.” It comes amid rising tensions between Hezbollah and Israel as the war in Gaza rages on without any end in sight. <br><br><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/18/middleeast/lebanon-explosions-intl/index.html">CNN reported </a>that at least 20 people were killed and 450 were injured in the latest round of attacks involving walkie-talkies. At least <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/lebanon-pagers-explode-hezbollah-israel-09-18-24-intl-hnk#h_64931bb6896d88e7f6ef8de48e302619">12 people</a> were killed in the pager attack, including members of Hezbollah and two children, according to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/lebanon-pagers-explode-hezbollah-israel-09-18-24-intl-hnk#h_3b49b73405fe412f4c2393dce072d488">CNN</a>. More than 2,800 were injured, including the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-ambassador-lebanon-injured-by-pager-explosion-2024-09-17/">Iranian ambassador to Lebanon</a>, with over 300 people in critical<strong> </strong>condition, according to the <a href="https://www.nna-leb.gov.lb/en/justice-law/722027/public-health-minister-more-than-2-800-wounded-8-m">Lebanese health ministry</a>. Most of the injuries were to the<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/lebanon-pagers-explode-hezbollah-israel-09-18-24-intl-hnk#h_64931bb6896d88e7f6ef8de48e302619">eyes, face, and hands</a>; hospitals in Beirut have been overwhelmed with patients and are <a href="https://x.com/BeirutCityGuide/status/1836060165876920553">asking the public to donate blood</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah officials have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-hezbollah-israel-exploding-pagers-8893a09816410959b6fe94aec124461b#https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-hezbollah-israel-exploding-pagers-8893a09816410959b6fe94aec124461b">blamed Israel for the pager attack</a>. US officials have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-pagers-explosives.html">reportedly confirmed</a> that Israel tampered with the pagers, adding a detonating switch that could be triggered remotely and a small amount of explosive material. The pagers <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/lebanon-pagers-explode-hezbollah-israel-09-18-24-intl-hnk#h_f1d3e4533528fe6cf1526bc93c05b11f">rang just before the attack</a>, so many victims were holding and looking at the pagers when they exploded.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) declined to comment on the pager attack.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israeli officials did, however, say earlier this week the country could soon <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/world/israel-hamas-war-news">escalate its ongoing operations against Hezbollah</a>. Hezbollah is allied with Hamas — the militant group behind the October 7 attack on Israel that sparked the latest war in Gaza —&nbsp;and has grown impatient with stalled ceasefire negotiations over the Palestinian territory, ramping up hostilities and preparing for the possibility of broader war.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The pagers bore the Taiwanese brand Gold Apollo, but the electronics manufacturer has <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/taiwan-firm-denies-making-pagers-used-lebanon-explosions-rcna171594">denied producing them</a>, saying that another company based in Hungary was licensed to use the brand. That company, BAC Consulting, has also <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/taiwan-firm-denies-making-pagers-used-lebanon-explosions-rcna171594">reportedly denied producing pagers</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The walkie-talkies were a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/lebanon-explosions-hezbollah-israel-09-19-24-intl-hnk#h_d2736454d7ed12f9b772f1008971075e">discontinued model</a> produced by the Japanese firm ICOM, which says most of those in circulation are counterfeits. It’s unclear exactly how Israel managed to gain access to the pagers and walkie-talkies and plant the explosives.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not the first time that Israel has weaponized personal communications devices against its adversaries. It used an exploding phone to <a href="https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/495023/Israel-infiltrates-telecom-sector-to-carry-out-assassinations">kill a Hamas bomb maker</a> in 1996.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel is also known for its sophisticated electronic surveillance capabilities as well as its ability to hack cellphones and computers. Before Tuesday’s attack, Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/how-israel-killed-a-ghost-73e6db68?mod=hp_lead_pos7">killed in a July Israeli missile strike</a> after he received a mysterious phone call instructing him to go to the seventh floor of his building in Beirut. After that attack, Hezbollah <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2024-07-09/pagers-and-drones-how-hezbollah-aims-to-counter-israels-high-tech-surveillance">reportedly stopped using cellphones</a> in favor of pagers and couriers who deliver messages in person; the group has used a private, fixed-line telecommunications network since the early 2000s.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The pager and walkie-talkie attacks — which were far more extensive and destructive than past attacks harnessing phones —&nbsp;demonstrate that Israeli forces have achieved a new level of sophistication in their ability to carry out strikes on enemy soil.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Israel and Hezbollah are locked in a regional conflict</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The recent attacks could lead to further escalation after months of increasing hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah, which is designated as a terrorist organization by many countries and has previously fought wars against Israel, launched its latest campaign after Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, saying it was in “solidarity with the victorious Palestinian resistance.” The hostilities have primarily taken the form of airstrikes. It has signaled that it would cease hostilities if a ceasefire in Gaza is reached. More than <a href="https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-820486">41,000 Palestinians</a> have been killed in Gaza.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Almost a year into the war, ceasefire negotiations have made little progress, especially after the recent <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/middleeast/hamas-israel-hostage-deal-raise-stakes-intl/index.html">execution of six hostages in Gaza</a>. It’s an open question whether a deal may even be achievable <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/06/politics/gaza-ceasefire-talks-roadblocks-white-house/index.html">before US President Joe Biden leaves office</a>. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-hamas-agreement-intl/index.html">deal is not close</a> and has resisted international calls for Israeli forces to promise a full withdrawal from Gaza.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As negotiations have stagnated, the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel has deepened, displacing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-war-impact.html?smid=url-share">more than 100,000 people</a> who face daily tit-for-tat attacks on both sides of the Lebanese border with Israel. Though it has not yet grown into full-scale regional war, increasingly aggressive tactics on both sides have raised worries that such a conflict may be inevitable.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Intense escalation with Hezbollah, which is considered the most widely armed and powerful militia group in the region, could be catastrophic, as Israel’s previous wars with Hezbollah in 1996 and 2006 would indicate. <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/17/beyond-hezbollah-the-history-of-tensions-between-lebanon-and-israel">Both of those conflicts</a> involved heavy civilian casualties in Lebanon, leaving more than 1,200 dead, and led to the killing of <a href="http://event">about 200 Israelis</a>, mostly soldiers. But Hezbollah now has an <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/07/31/haniyeh-hezbollah-israel-war-lebanon-hamas-gaza/">extensive rocket and missile arsenal</a> that make it a more formidable foe than it was before. A wider war could <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/10/28/23935157/hezbollah-lebanon-israel-hamas-palestine-gaza-iran-militia-group">also draw each side’s allies further into the conflict</a> — the US on the Israeli side and Iran on Hezbollah’s.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such a war would also represent a diplomatic failure for the US, which has supported Israel since the beginning of the war in Gaza and played a leading role in the ceasefire negotiations, all with the objective of maintaining stability in the Middle East. Throughout the war in Gaza, US officials like Secretary of State Antony Blinken have repeatedly emphasized the US has been “very clear about the importance of all parties avoiding any steps that could further escalate the conflict that we’re trying to resolve in Gaza,” as he said Tuesday, adding that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/18/world/israel-hezbollah-gaza-hamas/2922bdf9-9c65-5674-8865-676bb5c4f9b5?smid=url-share">US did not know about the operation and was not involved</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The attacks may make it harder for Israel and Hezbollah to continue to contain their hostilities, and put them one step closer to a full-out war. Both have indicated they are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/dozens-hezbollah-members-wounded-lebanon-when-pagers-exploded-sources-witnesses-2024-09-17/">prepared for that possibility</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sometimes, panics are overblown. Sometimes, older generations are just freaking out about the youngs, as they have since time immemorial.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s not the case, unfortunately, with kids’ learning right now, more than four years after the pandemic shuttered classrooms and disrupted the lives of millions of children. The effects were seen almost immediately, as students’ performance in reading and math began to dip <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/01/us/national-test-scores-math-reading-pandemic.html">far below pre-pandemic norms</a>, worrying educators and families around the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even now, according to a <a href="https://crpe.org/the-state-of-the-american-student-2024/">new report</a> released this week by the Center on Reinventing Public Education (CRPE), a research group at Arizona State University that has studied the impact of Covid on education since 2020, the average American student is “less than halfway to a full academic recovery” from the effects of the pandemic. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The report — the group’s third annual analysis of the “state of the American student” — combines test scores and academic research with parent interviews to paint a picture of the challenges facing public schools and the families they serve. That picture is sobering: In spring 2023, just 56 percent of American fourth-graders were performing on grade level in math, down from 69 percent in 2019, according to just one example of <a href="https://cdn.bfldr.com/LS6J0F7/at/x8v8wp2c6j4s4wttsw2nwphb/ca-state-of-student-learning-technical-report-2023.pdf">test score data</a> cited in the report.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Declines in reading were less stark but still concerning, and concentrated in earlier grades, with 65 percent of third-graders performing on grade level, compared with 72 percent in 2019. Recovery in reading has also been slower, with some researchers finding <a href="https://www.nwea.org/uploads/Reconciling-Recent-Evidence-on-Academic-Recovery-in-the-US-from-2022-to-2023.pdf">essentially no rebound</a> since students returned to the classroom. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The report mirrors what many teachers say they are seeing in their classrooms, as some <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/aglover/tiktok-says-kids-cant-read-teachers-weigh-in">sound the alarm publicly</a> about kids who they say can’t write a sentence or pay attention to a three-minute video.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Focus and endurance for any sort of task, especially reading, has been really hard for a lot of teenagers” since coming back from pandemic closures, Sarah Mulhern Gross, who teaches honors English at High Technology High School in Lincroft, New Jersey, told Vox.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, even the youngest children, who were not yet in school when lockdowns began, are showing troubling signs of academic and behavioral delays. “We are talking 4- and 5-year-olds who are throwing chairs, biting, hitting,” Tommy Sheridan, deputy director of the National Head Start Association, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/01/upshot/pandemic-children-school-performance.html">told the New York Times</a> earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If schools and districts can’t reverse these trends, Covid could leave “an indelible mark” on a generation of kids, CRPE director Robin Lake said this week. The effects are greatest for low-income students, students with disabilities, and children learning English as a second language, who faced educational inequities prior to the pandemic that have only worsened today. Covid “shined a light on the resource inequities and opportunity gaps that existed in this country, and then it exacerbated them,” said Allison Socol, vice president for P-12 policy, research, and practice at EdTrust, a nonprofit devoted to educational equity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The report is the latest effort to catalog what many educators, parents, and kids see as the deep scars — academic, but also social and emotional — left behind by the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Earlier this year, the Northwest Evaluation Association (NWEA), a nationwide testing company, <a href="https://www.nwea.org/uploads/recovery-still-illlusive-2023-24-student-achievement-highlights-persistent-achievement-gaps-and-a-long-road-ahead_NWEA_researchBrief.pdf">reported that</a> rather than making up ground since the pandemic, students were falling further behind. In 2023-24, the gap between pre- and post-Covid test score averages widened by an average of 36 percent in reading and 18 percent in math, according to the NWEA report.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When it comes to education, the effect of the pandemic “is not over,” Lake said. “It’s not a thing of the past.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Kids are behind in reading and math, and they’re not catching up</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8439454/#:~:text=Approximately%20100%2C000%20public%20schools%20were,78.8%25)%20during%20the%20closures.">Nearly all public schools</a> in America closed by the end of March 2020, and while <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/18/upshot/pandemic-school-closures-data.html">some reopened that fall</a>, others did not fully resume in-person learning until fall 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The switch to remote school, along with the trauma and upheaval of living through a global health emergency in which <a href="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/deaths?n=o">more than a million Americans</a> died, dealt a major blow to students’ learning. Scores on one set of national tests, released in September 2022, dropped to historic lows, reversing two decades of progress in reading and math, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/01/us/national-test-scores-math-reading-pandemic.html">the New York Times reported</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, experts were optimistic that students could make up the ground they’d lost. NWEA’s MAP tests, which measure academic growth, showed a strong rebound in the 2021-22 school year, said Karyn Lewis, director of the Center for School and Student Progress at NWEA. But growth slowed the following year, and now lags behind pre-pandemic trends.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kids “are learning throughout the year, but they are doing so at a slightly sluggish pace,” Lewis said — not enough to make up for their Covid-era losses.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A team of researchers using separate data from state tests appeared to find <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/01/31/us/pandemic-learning-loss-recovery.html">more hopeful results</a> earlier this year, documenting significant recovery in both reading and math between 2022 and 2023. But after reanalyzing their data, they found that the improvements in reading were probably produced by changes in state tests, not actual improvements in student achievement, said Thomas Kane, faculty director of the Center for Education Policy Research at Harvard and one of the leaders of the research team. In fact, though students did gain some ground in math, they showed little recovery in reading between 2022 and 2023.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More recent data does not paint a rosier picture. About half of states have released test results for the 2023-24 school year, and “I don’t see a lot of states with substantial increases” in scores, Kane said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many factors probably contribute to students’ slow recovery, experts say. Some may have missed “foundational pieces” of reading and math in 2020 and 2021, Lewis said. Learning loss can be like a “compounding debt,” she explained, with skills missed in early grades causing bigger and bigger problems as kids get older. Chronic absenteeism also remains a big obstacle to learning. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/03/29/us/chronic-absences.html">Twenty-six percent of students</a> were considered chronically absent in 2022-23, up from 13 percent in 2019-2020.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Children who are in kindergarten and first grade today were too young to experience the shift to remote learning in 2020 and 2021. But they were more likely to be isolated from other children and adults, Lake said. And like their older counterparts, many also experienced the trauma of <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/22774601/children-covid-parent-deaths-grief">deaths in the family</a>, poverty, and parents out of work, all of which could have affected their social and emotional development.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/28/briefing/pandemic-learning-loss.html">Some have argued</a> that pandemic learning loss shouldn’t be a concern because all students were affected — maybe, the argument goes, learning is just different now.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But that’s not the case, experts say.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Students from wealthier school districts are already well on their way to recovery, while students in lower-income areas continue to struggle. “Not everybody is in the same boat,” Kane said.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">It’s not too late to help kids recover</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite the dismal numbers, some teachers are seeing successes. When they came back to the classroom after the pandemic closure, Kareem Neal’s students at Maryvale High School in Phoenix, Arizona, were falling asleep in class, having trouble focusing, and struggling to put away their laptops when asked, Neal, who teaches special education science and social studies, told me.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But starting last school year, “a lot of the behavioral challenges dissipated,” he said. “I remember telling so many people, ‘Whoa, the kids are so well-behaved.’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gross, the New Jersey English teacher, said she has seen improvement since her students were required to leave their cell phones at her desk during class. “For the first time in years, I’m seeing them talk to each other,” she said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some schools have had success reducing chronic absenteeism, including a middle school in Salem, Massachusetts, that aimed to make education more fun by introducing more field trips and hands-on learning, according to the CRPE report. “It’s just like a happier version of school,” said one student cited in the report.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s still time to help kids who are struggling, experts say. Most of the strategies proven to work are simple and low-tech, like tutoring and summer school, according to the CRPE report. Staffing shortages and the sheer logistical difficulty of setting up large-scale tutoring programs, however, have made even these solutions a challenge for districts, Lewis said. The <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/20/schools-pandemic-aid-runs-out-00175065">expiration of pandemic-era federal funding</a> later this month will only make matters worse.&nbsp;“A system that actually needs more is about to have less,” EdTrust’s Socol said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And districts have to actually make recovery programs accessible to all, and convince families to participate. In Louisiana, for example, just 1 percent of students eligible for a post-pandemic literacy tutoring program actually participated, according to the report, and districts often struggle to get students to enroll in summer school.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But if schools don’t act, kids could face deficits in basic skills that could haunt them into adulthood, leading to difficulty attaining higher levels of education, finishing college, and lost earnings in their working lives.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/04/opinion/teachers-grades-students-parents.html">grade inflation</a>, many parents are also unaware that their children are behind academically. “One of the most powerful things would be if teachers told parents when their child was below grade level,” Kane said. In practice, that often doesn’t happen.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But more than that, schools need to rebuild the relationships among students, teachers, and families that frayed during the pandemic, experts and educators say. “People want to feel like a part of a bigger community again,” Neal said. “We need to figure out ways to make that happen so that students are not feeling left out.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a common worst-case scenario for many students aspiring to college: you’ve worked diligently throughout high school to earn top grades and aced your standardized tests. All your studying and those extracurricular activities are finally paying off — you’ve been accepted to your dream school. The problem is, says John Tillman, president of the financial aid planning firm <a href="https://mycollegeplan.com/">Ecliptic Financial Advisors</a>, there’s no way your family can afford it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a situation that can cause anguish for everyone involved. “As a parent,” he says, “you’re in a situation where now you have to have a discussion about a budget when the student has already gotten excited about being accepted.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/369475/paying-for-college-advice-financial-aid-loans-scholarships"></a><a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/369514/college-application-essay-advice-personal-statement-common-app-supplemental-essays">This is what admissions officers really want to read in college essays</a></p>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/369659/college-application-advice-undergraduate-extracurricular-organization-stress">Applying to college? Seven current students on how to stand out and stay sane</a></p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s no secret the cost of a college education has ballooned. In the United States, <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/paying-for-college-infographic">one year of tuition and fees</a> at an in-state public college ran students an average of $10,662 during the 2023-24 academic year (that total ratchets up to $23,630 for out-of-state students); private schools cost $42,162 per year on average. Over half of graduates from public and private four-year institutions walked away with debt in 2022. On average, students with a bachelor’s degree graduated with <a href="https://research.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/Trends%20Report%202023%20Updated.pdf">$29,400 in debt</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Stress due to high student loan payments can have <a href="https://abbott.mediaroom.com/2023-10-26-Ninety-One-Percent-of-Young-Adults-With-Student-Loans-Say-Financial-Stress-is-Impacting-Their-Wellness-Abbott-Launches-Blueprint-of-Award-Winning-Program-to-Help-Companies-Tackle-This-Problem">negative impacts on young adults’ mental and physical health</a>. Paying back loans can hamper you as you try to jumpstart a career and may take precedence over saving for retirement, too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even if you or your parents have little to contribute, getting a college degree is possible without taking out massive loans. In order to side-step future financial stress, students and their families should take a clear-eyed, pragmatic approach to paying for college that starts well before acceptance letters hit the mail, experts say.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Determine a budget as soon as possible</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ideally, parents will have begun saving for their child’s college education from the moment they’re born, Tillman says. Three-quarters of college families relied on money from parents to cover the cost of college, according to a <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2024-08/HAP_2024.pdf">recent Sallie Mae and Ipsos study</a>, followed by scholarships and grants. But saving for a child’s education may be unrealistic for some families. Depending on your circumstances, parents — or the student themselves — may want to start setting money aside for college by the student’s freshman year of high school, Tillman says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether parents have been saving for years or not at all, they should have a conversation with their child before the end of their junior year of high school about how much money they can contribute, says Brendan Williams, vice president of knowledge at <a href="https://www.uaspire.org/">uAspire</a>, a nonprofit that helps students from underrepresented backgrounds access financial aid and navigate higher education.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Parents and their children should be on the same page about how much money each party has available to pay for college, how long the student anticipates they’ll be in school (will they complete a four-year degree or go on to get advanced degrees?), and if they will get a job while in school. That way, the student has an idea of what schools they can realistically afford — and they won’t waste time applying to those they can’t.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Parents and their children should be on the same page about how much money each party has available to pay for college</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For example, <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/2019-06-25/the-cost-of-private-vs-public-colleges">private schools are typically more expensive</a> than public universities. The student might also consider attending a community college first and then transferring to a state university to save money. “You’re saving 35 to 40 percent off the full cost of the four years of school,” Tillman says. “So it’s a very effective way to reduce the overall cost of college.” If the student wants a certain college experience — dorm life, dining halls, and a sprawling campus with fancy facilities — they’ll have to weigh whether these features are worth the possible debt.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Williams suggests researching schools’ financial aid programs before applying. Each school has a net price calculator on their website (the US Department of Education also maintains <a href="https://collegecost.ed.gov/net-price">its own database</a> where you can search schools’ net price) where prospective students can enter information about their family’s finances to find out what students from similar backgrounds paid per year, including financial aid and grants.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Be strategic when applying for aid</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Students also should apply for schools where they have a strong chance at receiving <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/slideshows/things-to-know-about-merit-aid-scholarships">merit-based financial aid</a>, Tillman says. Scores of schools offer at least some <a href="https://www.collegetransitions.com/dataverse/merit-aid">merit-based aid</a> — that is, scholarships awarded based on your grades, leadership ability, or sports and artistic talents. For instance, over half of students at the University of Denver receive non-need based aid during the 2022-23 academic year. Some schools consider every student who applies for merit scholarships, but others may <a href="https://sayhellocollege.com/blog/colleges-that-give-the-most-merit-aid/">have separate applications</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Schools also usually list the GPA, SAT, and ACT scores of the middle 50 percent of students admitted to the university. For example, the <a href="https://www.towson.edu/admissions/undergrad/freshmen/faq.html#:~:text=Our%20middle%2050%25%20SAT%20score,both%20the%20SAT%20and%20ACT.">middle 50 percent SAT range</a> for accepted students at Towson University in Maryland is 1100–1300. If your scores are above these ranges, you’re more likely to receive merit-based aid, Tillman says.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Aside from merit-based aid, many students will qualify for <a href="https://collegemoneytips.com/what-is-need-based-financial-aid/">need-based financial aid</a>, which is based on your family’s financial situation. The <a href="https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa">Free Application for Federal Student Aid</a>, or FAFSA, <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/23977937/fafsa-changes-2024-2025-federal-student-aid-college">is how students apply for federal, state, and college financial aid</a>. Fill it out as soon as you can after the form opens for the next academic year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Aid is offered in the form of grants, scholarships, loans, and work study. On average, <a href="https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/facts-financial-aid/">students received $8,890</a> in 2022 in federal grants. Usually, the FAFSA is available on October 1, but the form for the 2025-26 school year will be <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/12/the-2025-26-fafsa-wont-fully-open-until-december-1.html">available on December 1</a>. Some aid is awarded on a first-come, first-served basis, so the <a href="https://studentaid.gov/resources/financial-aid-process-text">earlier you apply</a>, the better.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are also <a href="https://www.collegeraptor.com/paying-for-college/articles/scholarship-search-applications/can-you-earn-scholarships-without-the-fafsa/">scholarships offered by private organizations</a> that students can apply for beyond the FAFSA. Many students wait until they receive acceptances and financial aid packages to start applying, Williams says. However, there are more opportunities available at the start of the academic year than at the end, he says. Students should begin applying for scholarships as early as possible in their senior year of high school — and continue in the months following. Don’t discount scholarships from local organizations, like your school district or banks. You may have a higher chance of earning one because fewer students apply, Williams says. There are also more scholarship opportunities for incoming freshmen, he says, so don’t wait until your sophomore year to try landing scholarships.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Make a plan by listing all the scholarships you hope to apply for, when applications open, and the submission deadline, Williams says.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Consider your return on investment</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.thomascaleel.com/">Thomas Caleel</a>, the founder and chair of Global Education Opportunities and the former director of MBA admissions and financial aid for the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, always tells students to think about the return on investment for a degree at a particular school. “If I’m putting my money into this education,” he says, “what am I getting out of it?”</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“I personally don’t think you should go into this just thinking, ‘I’ll borrow whatever I need to borrow, I’ll figure it out.’ That’s a terrible thing to do.”</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Students should think about what they hope to pursue after college and if a specific school can best support those goals, whether through a professional network, a unique program or other surprising benefit that will help you get ahead. For example, a California-based student who plans to go into real estate in their home state would get a higher return on investment at an in-state college versus an East Coast university. “It’s going to be much harder for you to leverage that network into a focus on real estate development in the Los Angeles County area,” Caleel says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you know you want to go to medical school or will pursue an advanced degree, you might have a higher return on investment by starting your education at a community college and transferring to an in-state school for your undergraduate degree, knowing how long you anticipate being in school, Caleel says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Look at the big-picture cost</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Once students have gotten their acceptances and <a href="https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/pay-for-college/get-help-paying-for-college/state-federal-institutional-financial-aid/understanding-your-financial-aid-award-offers">financial aid award offers</a> — a document that shows how much financial aid, including federal grants, scholarships, and loans the college is offering — they can start comparing the yearly cost of each school.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, look at the details of your aid package. Anything marked as a grant, you do not have to pay back. <a href="https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/grants/pell">Federal Pell Grants</a> from the US government are awarded based on the information you included on your FAFSA — the maximum award is $7,395 for the 2024–25 year. Loans are funds that must be repaid and accrue interest. Work study allows you to get an on-campus job to earn money throughout the year. The <a href="https://studentaid.gov/complete-aid-process/receive-aid">school will apply your grant and loans toward your tuition</a>, fees, and room and board, while any extra money is paid to you directly.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the net cost for each school you were accepted to may be similar, make sure to compare how much money in loans you would need to repay after graduation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Try to avoid taking out <a href="https://www.citizensbank.com/learning/what-are-private-student-loans.aspx">private loans</a> — money lent by banks and credit lenders and not included on your financial aid award offer — which tend to have higher interest rates. “I personally don’t think you should go into this just thinking, ‘I’ll borrow whatever I need to borrow, I’ll figure it out,‘” Tillman says. “That’s a terrible thing to do, and it puts students in a very bad situation down the road.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are other associated costs not included in the price of tuition and housing students should be aware of. Factor in how much you’ll need to spend on books, transportation to and from campus, and social expenses, like club memberships and off-campus meals, William says. There are also other incidentals: you might need to buy an air conditioner if you’re going to school somewhere much warmer than where you grew up or a winter jacket for somewhere colder.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the cost of tuition for your dream school is just out of budget, you can try negotiating with the university, Caleel says. <a href="https://www.collegevine.com/faq/31651/negotiating-college-tuition-is-it-possible">Collect documentation</a> of financial aid offers from other schools, any <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/28/business/college-financial-aid/index.html">changes in financial circumstances</a>, like a parent’s loss of a job or medical expenses, and parent tax returns. The student should then email the financial aid office explaining how you’d like to negotiate tuition. “It’s best to get as many offers as you can and then go and say — and be honest here — ‘You are our top choice. But to go there, we need to pay $25,000 a year that we just don’t have, and our second choice is $5,000 a year. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?’” Caleel says. Sometimes schools will have extra funds for additional aid, but it’s hardly a given.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although college is a considerable expense, it doesn’t need to be an onerous burden. Students and their families need to be realistic about the costs and shouldn’t discount lesser-known institutions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Parents want to be able to say, ‘My child is going to [the] big, shiny university,’” Caleel says, “when the smarter financial decision is for a child to go to a really, really good community college, to a really, really good state college, and save a ton of money.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the most memorable essays college admissions counselor <a href="https://www.alexiscollegexpert.com/">Alexis White</a> worked on with a student wasn’t about a harrowing personal challenge or a rewarding volunteering experience. “It started with the sentence ‘My hair arrives in a room before I do,’” says White, the founder and director of the consultancy firm Alexis College Expert. “It just was the best. And everybody who reads it loves it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">College application essays have an infamous reputation for being one of the most difficult aspects of the application process. But it remains a <a href="https://counselors.collegeboard.org/college-application/essay">crucial way to share details about your life </a>and interests — a way to distinguish yourself beyond your grades, test scores, and extracurricular activities, <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/05/can-chatgpt-write-a-good-college-admissions-essay.html">even in the era of ChatGPT</a> (more on that later).</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Vox’s guide to college application season</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/369475/paying-for-college-advice-financial-aid-loans-scholarships">You got into college. How will you pay for it?</a></p>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/369659/college-application-advice-undergraduate-extracurricular-organization-stress">Applying to college? Seven current students on how to stand out and stay sane.</a></p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Admissions officers are looking to be entertained when reading application essays, White says. Of course, students should use their essay to showcase their curiosities, character, and point of view, but contrary to popular belief, these personal statements don’t need to recount devastating moments of painful growth. “You can be fun,” White says. “You don’t have to have trauma.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are a number of essays students will need to write as a part of their college application. Over <a href="https://www.commonapp.org/files/FY_application_trends_end_season_report_23-24.pdf">1 million students</a> apply to college through the <a href="https://www.commonapp.org/">Common App</a>, a streamlined platform that allows students to apply to multiple schools at once. There, students write a personal statement, <a href="https://blog.collegevine.com/college-essay-length">usually between 500 and 650 words</a>, centered on a student’s identity, beliefs, accomplishments, and interests, and can choose from among seven<a href="https://www.commonapp.org/blog/common-app-announces-2024-2025-common-app-essay-prompts"> prompts</a> for the 2024–25 application season. One prompt even allows the applicant to write about a topic of their choice. “Write the essay that your heart wants to write,” says college essay coach <a href="https://www.cassandracollegecoaching.com/">Cassandra Hsiao</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Individual colleges also ask for additional shorter pieces (<a href="https://blog.collegevine.com/college-essay-length">around 250 words</a>), also known as supplemental essays, which may ask applicants to explain why they’re applying to this specific school, and about <a href="https://thecollegecurators.com/top-10-college-essay-approaches/">their academic interests and extracurricular activities.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With so much to write, students need to dedicate serious time and effort — White suggests at least eight weeks — into crafting compelling and effective essays. Here’s what college essay pros want applicants to know.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Make sure your essays are unique to you</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Students often put pressure on themselves to have a one-of-a-kind essay topic, White says. There are very few unique concepts, she continues, but what will set you apart is your way into the essay. Start strong with an attention-grabbing first sentence, experts say, that immediately hooks the reader.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Can’t decide what to write? Try these exercises.</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Look around your house or room and pick 10 items that spark a memory — like a soccer trophy or a painting you made — and write them down. Or recount a typical day in your life in detail, from the music you listen to in the shower to the snack you grab before bed.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">The point, Brook says, is to home in on things that you may think of as humdrum, but that you can use to tell a story about yourself.<strong> </strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Don’t discount minor details when thinking about extracurriculars and accomplishments. “When my kids are stuck, it&#8217;s a lot of chatting about things that they think don&#8217;t matter and then we typically come to something really great,” says Tyler.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Another tactic is picking five adjectives would you use to describe yourself, suggests White. Expand on each with an experience or memory.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Focus on developing a unique lens through which to see an event in your life, with an original point of view. These can be small moments, says Stacey Brook, the founder and chief adviser at <a href="https://www.collegeessayadvisors.com/">College Essay Advisors</a>. For example, one student she worked with wrote an essay about bonding with her mother during drives to gymnastics practice. After the student got her license and no longer had these moments with her mother, she wrote, she felt a sense of loss. “She was reflecting on what those drives meant to her and what it means to grow up and to gain things and lose them at the same time,” Brook says. “That&#8217;s the tiniest moment, the smallest slice of life out of which you can make an incredible essay.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even if you’re writing about a common topic, like school sports or lessons learned from an adult in your life, one way to differentiate your essay is to add dialogue, Hsiao says. “It&#8217;s in the specificity that only you can write because you went through that,” she says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Avoid regurgitating your resume, Hsaio continues. Instead, lead the reader through a narrative arc showing your growth. You don’t need to explicitly state what you learned from the experience. Instead, use descriptive, scene-setting language — about how tense you were during that big game or your excitement when you stepped onto the stage — that shows how you’re different on the other side.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Again, you don’t need to share the worst thing that’s ever happened to you — or try to dramatize your life to make it seem more challenging than it is — but help the reader understand the effort you put in to get a new club off the ground, for example. “What you went through objectively might be really small on a global scale,” Hsiao says, “but because it felt big to you and I care about you as the writer, it will feel big to me.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Don’t even think about copying from ChatGPT (or other generative AI)</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While Brook understands the appeal of ChatGPT, experts say don’t use it to write your essay. College application reviewers will be able to tell.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The purpose of these pieces is to display your personality and writing ability and bots will never produce a unique, personalized essay. These chatbots use a style and tone that is immediately identifiable to readers, one that is rife with cliches and an awkward cadence, experts say.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Appropriate uses of generative AI include spell and grammar check or as a thesaurus. “Once you start pulling full paragraphs, you&#8217;re cheating,” White says. “It&#8217;s not your work.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tailor supplemental essays to each school</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Depending on the school, you may be asked to write <a href="https://blog.collegevine.com/how-many-common-app-essays-are-required">one or two shorter supplemental essays</a>. These prompts may have similar themes, about your <a href="https://www.collegeessayadvisors.com/supplemental-essay/purdue-university-2024-25-supplemental-essay-prompt-guide/">academic interests</a> or <a href="https://www.collegeessayadvisors.com/supplemental-essay/columbia-university-2024-25-supplemental-essay-prompt-guide/">how you relate to the people around you</a>. For these essays, experts say you can reuse answers for multiple schools — but make sure you revise your answers to be specific to each school.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To ensure you’re tackling supplemental essays efficiently, Brook says to collect all of the prompts for the schools you’re applying to and see where they overlap. Hsiao suggests brainstorming three or four activities, obsessions or aspects of your life you know you want to showcase and try to match these topics to essay prompts. This can be anything from an extracurricular to your favorite TV show. “We are prioritizing what is important in our lives and then showcasing that by mixing and matching per school for the supplemental essay questions,” she says. For example, if you plan on writing about your future major for one college, adapt that essay to each school. However, make sure you’re researching each university and adding details about their specific program to your piece, Brook says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For essays asking why you want to attend that specific college, ensure your answers are unmistakably catered to that school. “‘I love Delaware because I can&#8217;t wait to go to football games and pledge a sorority, and I&#8217;m excited about the business school.’ That is not going [cut it] because you could say that about Rutgers,” says <a href="https://getintocollege.com/our-experts/admissions-experts/kyra-tyler">Kyra Tyler</a>, a senior director and college admissions consultant at Bright Horizons College Coach. Instead, pepper your answer with details about school traditions, an honors program you hope to join, interesting research opportunities or what you observed when you went on a tour (whether in person or virtual), Tyler says.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tell a vivid story — and showcase your writing ability</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Not only do your essays need to be of substance, but they should showcase style, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tyler suggests students avoid metaphor: Don’t talk about caring for your younger sibling in the context of a <em>Bluey</em> episode — be straightforward. (“Kids can&#8217;t get away from [metaphors],” Tyler says, “and what happens is they get stuck under them, and they can&#8217;t write.”) You’ll want to write vividly using concrete examples instead of plainly spelling everything out, White says. For instance, if you were a camp counselor who helped a nervous child come out of their shell, write a scene showing the camper interacting with other kids rather than simply saying the camper was less reserved.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Write as if you were talking to your best friend, Tyler says. Avoid slang terms, but let your personality come through your writing. Try reading your essay aloud to see if it sounds like you.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Don’t forget about the basics, like good grammar, proper spelling, and word choice (make sure you’re not repeating similar words and phrases). You don’t need to focus on the five-paragraph structure, Hsiao says. Just make sure you’re telling a compelling story. Have a trusted adult, like a teacher or parent, read your essay to help point out style and structural issues you may have missed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After you’ve completed a draft, set it aside for a few days, come back to it with fresh eyes for revisions, Tyler says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">College application essays are your chance to share who you were, who you are, and how this university will shape who you hope to be, Hsaio says. Focus on topics you want admissions officers to know and let your voice and passion carry the essay.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Correction, September 19, 11 am ET: </strong>A previous version of this story conflated the number of applicants with the number of applications sent through the Common App. Over 1 million students apply using the Common App. </em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s that time of year again: Summer is over, class is in session, and high school seniors are filled with dread. Yes, it’s college application season. The formula required to get into many colleges these days involves striking a delicate balance between highlighting personal and academic accomplishments, outlining future interests and aspirations, and painting a picture of who you are versus who you want to be. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The prospect of documenting an entire high school career while also selling your personality can be daunting. It’s normal for aspiring undergrads — and their parents — to feel overwhelmed. But you can manage it, whether you’re applying to five schools or 15.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Vox’s guide to college application season</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/369514/college-application-essay-advice-personal-statement-common-app-supplemental-essays" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vox.com/even-better/369514/college-application-essay-advice-personal-statement-common-app-supplemental-essays">This is what admissions officers really want to read in college essays</a></p>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/369475/paying-for-college-advice-financial-aid-loans-scholarships">You got into college. How will you pay for it?</a></p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I talked to the people who are most familiar with how high-stakes it can all feel: seven current college students who successfully navigated the process for themselves. Here, they offer their best advice on staying organized, quelling anxiety, and the mistakes they wish they’d avoided.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Responses have been edited and condensed for clarity.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Don’t put all your eggs in one basket</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“At first, I only applied to one school, and then got wait-listed. I ended up applying to more after that. I wasn’t really thinking about college as much as I should have, and I was dead set on this one school. I just assumed the application process and acceptance was going to be a lot easier than it was. I put all my eggs in one basket. I was so overwhelmed and I wanted to get the application out of the way. I wish I would have applied to more schools from the start. I wish I would have relied more on support and help from other people, like my school counselors and friends who had already applied to colleges and got accepted.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>—Alani Sage, 19. Applied to five schools, accepted to four, wait-listed at one. Now attends the University of Alabama.</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Trust that you can turn heartbreak around</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I was one of those students who didn’t get accepted into a dream school, and you feel like it’s the end of the world, like you have no other hope. But now that I look back, I honestly think every single thing that happens, it’s for a reason. If you adapt and accept things head-on, you’ll thank yourself. I’m really happy now. I think that this experience was better for me, better for becoming more mature, more independent.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>—Amna Ahmed, 19. Applied to 22 schools, accepted to 10, wait-listed at six. Now attends Wake Forest University. </em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Use social media (but don’t let it discourage you)</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Reddit is a great resource. Subreddits <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/">r/CollegeResults </a>and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/">r/ChanceMe</a> are great resources because people post their admitted profiles and you can see what their extracurriculars were and you know what they did to get into X school. r/ChanceMe, you post your own application and people say if they think you’re going to get in or not. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-text-align-center"><blockquote><p>“Create a story for yourself that is so authentic and unique to you that anyone that reads it would be like, ‘That is so you.’”</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Take what people say about your application with a grain of salt, because at the end of the day, they’re not the admissions officer. It’s okay to compare yourself and your application to other people, but it’s not the be-all, end-all. Use it as inspiration but don’t think, ‘This person’s just better than me. I’m never going to have a chance.’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>—Dylan Ott, 18. Applied to 15 schools, accepted via early decision to the University of Pennsylvania</em>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Focus on authenticity</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“College apps are very tricky if you haven’t previously heard advice or if you don’t have other family members that have gone through them. I struggled a lot, because my family is from India, and they weren’t accustomed to the American college admission process. For example, a lot of my peers could afford college counselors when my family didn’t even know what those were. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I struggled with selling myself and knowing how to tell my story in a way that was unique to me, because from a very young age, I felt pressure trying to be more like people around me. Whenever I was writing my essays, I would try to frame myself as someone that had this background that my peers did, even though I didn’t. Create a story for yourself that is so authentic and unique to you that anyone that reads it would be like, ‘That is so you.’ Pick one angle about yourself to go with. For me, I talked about my self-growth and development, from being pretty shy to being super confident, starting a TikTok, and being in debate.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>—Tanu Tripathi, 20. Applied to 11 schools, accepted to six. Now attends the University of Texas.</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Just keep writing</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I spent a lot of time finding my story and writing down my life, asking my parents about things through my childhood that I couldn’t remember that I could draw connections to right now. It was me dumping much of my life onto the page, and then rewriting it and rewriting it and rewriting it again for a long time. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those 250-word blurb answers were the hardest for me. I wrote about all my interests first and then saw what would match the essay questions for each school. Then you can edit them and change it to match, so you’re not really writing as many essays as you need to. In all, for every single school, there were over 50 essays. But I didn’t write 50 essays. A lot of these are reused, and a lot of them were also 150-word ones. For those questions, I always tried to answer them very creatively and in a way that most people wouldn’t just to show another side of myself.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>—Jeremy Hsiao, 21. Applied to 11 schools, accepted to six, wait-listed at two. Now attends Stanford University.</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Stay organized and have an emotional outlet</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I figured out a system of organization that worked for me. Making a drive on Google was huge. I called it ‘college.’ Within that drive I had different folders for scholarships, supplemental essays, and then my Common App. Once you have those folders, make a huge spreadsheet for all the colleges you’re going to apply to. Divide out your spreadsheet into three different sections: early action, a November 30 or December 1 deadline, and then your regular decision colleges. Having it all in one place helped a lot.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Everyone’s going through this at the same time, and it’s really important to talk to your friends and family throughout the whole process for your mental health. Make sure you’re not keeping all the stress and all the overwhelming feelings inside of you. Make sure you’re ranting to your friends, ranting to your mom. Getting it all out is generally going to help you so much more in the long run.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>—Chahat Kapoor, 20. Applied to 15 schools, accepted to nine, wait-listed at two. Now attends University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Highlight the commonality in all your activities</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I talked to a lot of my admission officers and interviewers after I got into these schools and they told me what stood out about my profile was it was so clear what type of student I was going to be. All my activities, my awards, my essays, even my extracurriculars, touched on my leadership and value of community service, specifically in the health field. My junior year of high school when I started thinking about college, I sat down and I wrote out all my extracurriculars and all my awards, and I saw that so many things I did were involved in the health field, and I also had a lot of leadership positions, so that naturally became what I would present in my profile.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>—Olivia Zhang, 19. Applied to 26 schools, accepted to 20, wait-listed at two. Now attends Harvard University.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bill Gates <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2373372/#:~:text=Gates%20Foundation%2C%20founded%20in%201994,Learning%20Foundation%2C%20founded%20in%201997.">helped launch a global health revolution</a> at the turn of the 21st century, one in which multilateral humanitarian efforts <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/363716/africa-hiv-aids-sub-saharan-progress">arrested</a> the AIDS crisis in Africa and began to make strides against longtime killers like <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24128530/tuberculosis-vaccine-efficacy-solutions-tb-bcg">tuberculosis</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/9/10/20857132/malaria-eradication-2050-gene-drive-lancet-study">malaria</a>. People in the Global South were <a href="https://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/august-2022/healthy-life-expectancy-africa-rises-almost-ten-years">living longer</a>. A more equitable future appeared within our grasp.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But that progress has since stalled. Between 2000 and 2020, the worldwide child mortality rate <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/goalkeepers/report/2024-report">fell</a> by 50 percent, but it has remained stagnant over the past four years. Global development funding to support health efforts grew by 6.6 percent a year on average from 2000 to 2020, increasing less than $15 billion annually to about $50 billion. But that growth has slowed with the pandemic, falling to just 2.3 percent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/goalkeepers/report/2024-report">a new report from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a> projects global health investments could actually decline over the rest of the decade.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The stinginess comes at a particularly bad time. We are in a critical fundraising cycle for the major global health organizations. <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/358800/gavi-biden-vaccine-congress-foreign-aid">Gavi, the vaccine alliance</a> that provides immunizations to people in low-income countries, is currently seeking $9 billion to replenish its funds for the next five years. <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/1/13/23544865/congress-hiv-malaria-global-fund-replenishment">The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria</a>, which supports prevention and treatment for those diseases in developing countries and was seeded with a donation from the Gates Foundation, will begin its replenishment drive next year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there are real and growing concerns that these groups may fail to reach their fundraising targets.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a result, the world could lose ground against <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/1/15/24036314/us-global-public-health-infectious-disease-covid-19-hiv-aids-pepfar">infectious diseases</a> and especially <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/2/1/24055829/gaza-israel-conflict-hunger-famine-starvation-sudan">child malnutrition</a>, and those challenges are only set to grow in the future. Climate change threatens humanity’s food supply and thus its ability to feed itself. Without intervention, the number of children in the world who experienced stunting is expected to grow by 40 million by 2050 and the number who experience wasting will increase by 50 million.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How can the world get back on track? Gates, as the chair and chief funder of a foundation that has delivered nearly <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/foundation-fact-sheet">$78 billion in grants</a> chiefly for global health programs since 2000, is one of the most influential people trying to figure that out. In a recent interview with Vox, Gates conceded the challenges facing global health advocates, offered his own explanations for why investments have fallen off, and previewed the developments in the field he thinks hold the most promise for regaining the momentum of the early 21st century.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.</em></p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Dylan Scott   </h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You framed the report around the stalled investment in global health that coincided with the pandemic. There seems to be a real realignment within the public and among policymakers in the US and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-66378364">in other countries</a>, the countries that have driven a lot of global health investment. So what is your theory of why that is? How do you change people’s minds back if their views are starting to shift on this issue?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Bill Gates</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The world committed itself to keep making progress in reducing childhood death through <a href="https://www.undp.org/sustainable-development-goals">the UN sustainable development goals</a> that were set in 2015. We were spoiled during that period, between 2000 and 2015, because helping Africa, cutting the childhood death rate, it really had a lot of attention.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There was some low­-hanging fruit in that vaccines were being given in rich countries that we were able to reduce the cost of dramatically and we got Gavi to finance and get them distributed out to a very high percentage of all the world’s children. That’s why we got the childhood mortality cut by a factor of two, from 10 million kids a year dying to under 5 million.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If it was just the pandemic, then getting back on track actually wouldn’t be that hard because the pandemic’s over. The things that are happening alongside that are, first of all, that the African countries <a href="https://www.advocacyinternational.co.uk/featured-project/jubilee-2000">got cleared of their debts around the turn of the century</a>. And that was a super­-worthy cause that predates the foundation. Over these years, though, they’ve built up debts. Now, as macroeconomic conditions have changed, the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/un-chief-warns-africas-inadequate-access-debt-relief-is-recipe-social-unrest-2024-09-05/">interest rates on those debts have gone up a lot</a>, particularly for them because they’re risky borrowers. So African countries are now spending more on interest payments than on health and education combined.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s a pretty dramatic thing. Then the aid levels coming out of the rich countries have actually gone down. That’s a surprise. Rich country budgets are squeezed by wanting to raise defense spending, wanting to help Ukraine, having aging populations with higher health costs, and not wanting to raise taxes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So there’s a squeeze in the rich countries’ budgets, even though aid is <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-every-american-should-know-about-u-s-foreign-aid/">well under</a> 1 percent of the US government budget. We’ve seen cuts in the UK, in Germany, in France, and the European Union.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That is really tragic because the assumption was that as these Asian countries — Vietnam, Indonesia, India —&nbsp;graduated from being aid-eligible because of their economic growth, we’d have more money per person to put into the low-­income countries that remain, which are mostly in Africa. But that has not turned out to be the case.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-text-align-left"><blockquote><p>When somebody says to me the old arguments don’t work, I’m like, “Wow, we don’t care about children dying anymore?” I mean, it seems like, “Oh my God, what the hell?”</p><cite>BILL GATES</cite></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I want to help get those aid budgets up so we can provide the debt relief, so we can fund Gavi. Even Gavi is going to have a tough time raising as much money as it did five years ago. The Global Fund raises every three years, so next year, they’ll be going around. And I don’t know if they’ll be able to raise as much.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s despite the fact that whether you see it through the moral lens or the climate adaptation lens or stopping pandemics before they get to rich countries or global stability — whatever it is, these are the best investments possible.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Dylan Scott</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Does the global health movement need to find a new argument, as we expect these new countries to make more investments?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Bill Gates</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lots of countries have transitioned from low-­income to middle-­income: Brazil, Mexico, and Indonesia, India, Vietnam. Very few countries have transitioned from middle-­income to high-­income. South Korea is this famous example. Depending on where you set the threshold, you could say Chile or Poland are examples. But there’s not that many.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As you move from low-income to middle-, you are self­-sufficient, so you’re not drawing on whatever the aid budget is. As you move from middle- to high-, which China’s right on the threshold of, then hopefully you become a donor in some way. But we haven’t gotten too many new donors. We’re still extremely reliant on five countries: Japan, Germany, France, the UK, the US.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s like 70 percent of the aid right there, even though you have a few like Sweden and Norway who <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/08/foreign-aid-these-countries-are-the-most-generous/">by the percentage of their economy</a> are the most generous at about 1 percent each. But the big money is in the Big Five. But the cuts there are so gigantic, we won’t make up for them with new donors.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When somebody says to me the old arguments don’t work, I’m like, “Wow, we don’t care about children dying anymore?” I mean, it seems like, “Oh my God, what the hell?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I admit that the way that we get to people, including the younger generation, is changing. I think we have to renew our energy and how we connect on this. There’s no substitute for getting people to go see this and come back and bear witness to it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But we are challenged and we admit our message isn’t landing, so we’ve got work to do.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Dylan Scott</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Your report outlines some solutions. You’ve got new technology to increase dairy productivity. You’ve got financing through the Child Nutrition Fund. You’re focusing on making sure food is actually nutrient-­rich. You’ve got prenatal vitamins.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If I were to force you to pick the first action item, keeping in mind this idea that we just don’t have as many resources as we’re used to to accomplish these things, what would you pick?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Bill Gates</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I would say that large­-scale food fortification — where you get people to stick vitamin A or folic acid into foods — the cost of that is super, super low. We have a team that’s expert in that, working with the food makers and really measuring what the vitamin deficits are. That’s a best buy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The idea of these chickens that lay a lot of eggs or cows that make a lot of milk, the beauty of that is once you improve the genetics of the African cows, that’s a gift that keeps on giving. That’s a teaching a man to fish type thing where, as we mix the super productivity of Western dairy cows together with the heat and disease tolerance that African cows have, you can get something that’s 75 percent as productive as a [dairy cow], which is four times the milk productivity of the cows that are in Africa today.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’ll take five years before, say, half the cows in Africa get that, but that’s a gigantic thing because that’s income for women, that’s milk for the kids where malnutrition, vitamin deficiency, and protein deficiency are gigantic. Cheap eggs, cheap chickens, and cheap milk are a big part of this.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We’ve already cut the cost of eggs in Ethiopia in half. We see the poorest households actually using twice as many eggs as they used before because they’ve become a lot more affordable. Those egg factories and milk factories, getting those into Africa in the hands of the smallholder farmers, that’s pretty powerful.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Dylan Scott</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We are learning more all the time about <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/8/25/6050199/microbiome-human-gut-project-bacteria-probiotics">our gut bacteria</a> and how that influences our digestion and physical health. What potential interventions are in the works to improve the microbiomes of children in the Global South?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Bill Gates</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The probiotic stuff, that’s at an earlier stage. We have to prove out the impact, and we have to get the cost of that down a lot. It’s in our R&amp;D work. If it works as well as we think, if we reduce the cost as much as we think, then we might even want to grow the size of the <a href="https://www.childnutritionfund.org/">Child Nutrition Fund</a> [a UNICEF-led program on child hunger] and add that as an intervention.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We’ve been the biggest funder of research in [microbiomes], including <a href="https://source.washu.edu/2013/01/gut-microbes-at-root-of-severe-malnutrition-in-kids/#:~:text=A%20study%20of%20young%20twins,School%20of%20Medicine%20in%20St.">the original study</a> where we took Malawi twins. We saw that one of them would be on the growth path, one would be off, and then we would look at stool samples or have them swallow capsules and figure out, “Okay, what is the makeup of a healthy microbiome?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The kid whose growth was faltering, what we saw was their microbiome was very different [from their twin] and very inflammatory. Their ability to absorb nutrition was limited, and then you get on a negative path because as you get weaker, you can’t get out of that condition.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One way to intervene is to put the good bacteria in and have them outcompete the bad bacteria, but we don’t know how much we’ll be able to reduce the costs of that. The ideal thing would be to come up with a food-based intervention that’s cheap. We have a trial going on studying <a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/choline/">choline</a>, a nutrient that the good microbacteria thrive on and that the bad microbacteria don’t. It’d be a lot cheaper and more scalable if it turns out that choline, which we can make super cheap and add to vitamin supplements, pushes you toward this non­inflammatory set of microbiota species.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We know that protein pushes you in the right direction, but just saying, “Hey, every kid in the world should have lots of milk and eggs,” that’s way too expensive. We know we can make probiotics way cheaper than that.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Dylan Scott</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’ve been hearing that the global health field itself is changing, emphasizing systems more and specific diseases or conditions less. We used to focus on one problem at a time: PEPFAR being focused on AIDS is maybe the best example of that. People thought, “We’re going to try to address this disease,” or, “We’re going to try to address this particular problem.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But I’ve sensed that there’s been a shift toward supporting systems and supporting institutions. Investing in health system infrastructure, for example, instead of starting a campaign focused on a specific disease. I’m curious if your own thinking about not only how to deliver aid most effectively, but also what type of aid is most likely to lead to a lasting impact, has shifted.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Bill Gates </h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s no doubt that the long-run solution is economic development. Economic growth that allows the government to collect more taxes and therefore fund more health, more education, more infrastructure, that’s the magic thing that India, Vietnam, Indonesia have shown is the way to get to self­-sufficiency. They’ve reduced their malnutrition a lot.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-text-align-center"><blockquote><p>How do we help Africa get on an economic growth path? We need healthier children so that they can go to school and can be productive. </p><cite>BILL GATES</cite></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But you have to say, “Okay, what enables economic growth? Why is Africa in a <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/why-so-much-world-stuck-poverty-trap">poverty trap</a>?” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We know that parents choose to have enough children to have a 90 percent chance of having at least two survive to adulthood. As you reduce childhood death rates, fertility rates <a href="https://ccpr.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Child-Mortality-and-Fertility-Decline_-Does-the-Barro-Becker-Model-Fit-the-Facts_.pdf">go down</a> almost in lockstep. There’s this weird paradox that if children survive, population growth goes down, which is the opposite of the commonsense view.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So how do we help Africa get on an economic growth path? We need healthier children so that they can go to school and can be productive. We need to reduce population growth, and reducing the death rate is your biggest lever to do that. And as you educate girls, that becomes another factor in <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/health/female-education-and-childbearing-closer-look-data">driving that fertility rate down</a>, as is making a contraception widely available.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So these are all areas that the foundation works in. We want to enable economic growth. If you want to reduce children’s deaths, it’s not about some big health system; don’t think hospitals. Africans do not need doctors. They are born, they live, they die, and the majority never meet a doctor, or what the US would call a doctor. You have to look at: What’s killing these kids? What’s causing them to be malnourished?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Four things get you 85 percent of those deaths: malaria, pneumonia, diarrhea, and then a bunch of things that can kill you in your first 30 days. Those are the categories. We’ve made huge progress on malaria, diarrhea, and pneumonia. We haven’t made as much on those first 30 days, and there’s still a lot more to do on that.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No one disagrees that economic development is the end goal. But these very basic health things, that’s how for just $10 per citizen per year, you get yourself to a position where the kids are doing well at school. You’re moving off of the farms into services and manufacturing, and you will no longer be dependent on aid.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">My basic theory has been refined in terms of, “Okay, why did this work so well in Asia and what’s missing in Africa?” But the overall idea of “help them help themselves” is still pretty much the same.</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the past two days, the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah has been targeted with an attack as sophisticated and audacious as it is brutal, with the devices in their own pockets turned into deadly weapons.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Tuesday, <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/372399/pager-explosions-lebanon-syria-hezbollah-israel-gaza">hundreds of pagers</a> distributed by Hezbollah to its members and associates in Lebanon and Syria exploded, killing at least 12 people, including two children, and injuring nearly 3,000. Then, in a follow-up attack on Wednesday, thousands of two-way radios used by the group exploded, killing nine <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/09/18/israel-detonates-hezbollah-walkie-talkies-second-wave-after-pager-attack">people and wounding some 300</a>, some of whom had been attending the funerals of those killed in the earlier attack. There have also been reports of solar energy systems exploding in <a href="https://apnews.com/live/lebanon-syria-pagers-hezbollah-updates">several areas of Lebanon</a>, but few details have been reported about these incidents.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah quickly blamed Israel for the attack. While the Israeli government has not yet commented — it rarely comments on covert actions abroad — experts and media reports are generally assuming it was responsible. It’s hard to think of another regional actor with the ability and motivation to carry out such an unprecedented operation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The attack has stunned former intelligence operatives with both its scale and sophistication. “This is a hell of an opp,” Marc Polymeropoulos, a former CIA counterterrorism specialist now with the Atlantic Council, told Vox. “It’s probably the most impressive kinetic intelligence operation I’ve ever seen.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyond demonstrating the prowess of the Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence agency, what’s less clear is what this tells us about Israel’s overall strategic goals, not to mention how Hezbollah will respond or how this will impact the outcome of this conflict or conflicts in the future. Here are a few of the biggest outstanding questions and what we know about the answers.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">How did they do it?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The emerging consensus from experts and media reports is that small amounts of explosive material were placed inside the pagers. Some <a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-s-mossad-rigged-pager-batteries-with-explosives-before-they-reached-hezbollah-media/3333013">reports have suggested</a> the explosive was detonated by malware that raised the temperature of the batteries in the pagers, but US officials told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-pagers-explosives.html">New York Times that the devices were </a>also implanted with switches that detonated the explosive remotely. According to the Times, the pagers received simultaneous messages on Tuesday that appeared to be from Hezbollah’s senior leadership, but instead caused the devices to beep for several seconds and then explode. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The pagers were from a shipment of 3,000 that Hezbollah says they ordered from Gold Apollo, a Taiwanese company. But Gold Apollo says they were actually made by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gold-apollo-says-it-did-not-make-pagers-used-lebanon-explosion-2024-09-18/">BAC Consulting, a company</a> based in Hungary, and that the Taiwanese firm merely licensed its design and trademark. Reporters have so far been unable to contact BAC, and former intelligence officials who spoke with Vox said it’s questionable whether the company even makes pagers. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah had reportedly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/pagers-drones-how-hezbollah-aims-counter-israels-high-tech-surveillance-2024-07-09/">switched from using cellphones to old-fashioned pagers</a> several months ago to avoid Israeli surveillance. Communications are generally a point of vulnerability for militant groups. Earlier this week, the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/the-crude-system-of-coded-messages-keeping-hamass-leader-alive-c387b580?mod=hp_lista_pos2">Wall Street Journal reported </a>that Hamas’s top leader, Yahya Sinwar, has abandoned electronics entirely and now relies on a system of human couriers and coded handwritten messages for communication.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The attack comes several weeks after the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, reportedly by a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html">bomb that had been planted by Israeli agents</a> in a guesthouse in the Iranian capital months earlier. It also comes several days after a rare raid by Israeli ground forces in Syria that destroyed an <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/09/12/israel-syria-raid">alleged underground Iranian missile factory</a>.   </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“What we have seen over the past two months shows that Israel and its intelligence apparatus have completely infiltrated the most sensitive echelons of the entire Axis of Resistance,” said Charles Lister, senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, referring to the informal name for Iran’s network of proxy militias throughout the Middle East. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It was only a year ago when the reputation of Israel’s intelligence services took a major hit with <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/12/13/23998928/hamas-taliban-isis-attacks-terrorism-extremist-groups-israel-palestine">the failure to anticipate the October 7 attacks</a>, despite abundant signs that Hamas was preparing for a major operation. It’s worth noting that while the operations in Lebanon and Iran were likely carried out by the Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence service, Israeli-occupied Gaza is the responsibility of the Shin Bet, the domestic security service. The Shin Bet official responsible for Southern Israel and Gaza <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/shin-bet-official-in-charge-of-south-resigns-over-oct-7-failures-a-duty-to-apologize/">resigned over that failure</a>, as have <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/idf-commander-unit-8200-yossi-sariel-resigns-7a9d58da">two senior military intelligence officials</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Polymeropoulos said that while October 7 damaged the reputation of Israel’s vaunted spy services, “they have now restored that notion of deterrence based on fear, this notion that Israel has eyes everywhere.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Why did they do it?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Emily Harding, a former CIA analyst and director of the Intelligence, National Security, and Technology Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, noted that prior to October 7, Israel had shifted many of its intelligence resources away from Hamas toward Iran and regional proxy groups like Hezbollah. Over the past year, attention has obviously shifted to Gaza, she said, “but at the same time, they’ve clearly decided they’re not going to tolerate an imminent threat on their northern border” with Lebanon. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even as the war in Gaza has raged, Israel and Hezbollah have been <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24153755/hezbollah-israel-lebanon">exchanging fire over the Israel-Lebanon border,</a> displacing tens of thousands of civilians on both sides. While Israel reportedly backed away from plans to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/how-biden-averted-a-second-front-by-convincing-israel-not-to-attack-hezbollah-on-oct-11-e14a0a3b">launch a major preemptive strike</a> against Hezbollah in the early days of the war, senior Israeli officials, most notably <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-gaza.html">Defense Minister Yoav Gallant</a>, have repeatedly said that a military assault will be needed to deal with the threat on Israel’s northern border.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Earlier this week, Israel’s security cabinet added restoring security to the north as one of its <a href="https://www.abc3340.com/news/nation-world/israel-security-cabinet-updates-war-goals-to-include-stopping-hezbollah-attacks-israel-hamas-war-gaza-airstrikes-lebanon-conflict-hostages-cease-fire-humanitarian-aid-netanyahu">primary war aims</a>. Without referring specifically to the pager and walkie-talkie attacks, Gallant said on Wednesday that a <a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1svmcoar">“new phase”</a> of the war with Hezbollah had begun.   </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The question now is whether the attacks were launched as preparation for some major military action, or whether — contradictory as it may seem — this was conceived as a way to de-escalate tensions by putting Hezbollah on its heels, at least for a little while. For the moment, this second possibility looks more likely. Despite Gallant’s declaration, Israel doesn’t appear to be taking advantage of the chaos in Lebanon to launch a military invasion.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also possible that the timing of the attack wasn’t intentional at all. The Middle East-focused news site<a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/09/exclusive-hezbollah-suspicions-forced-israel-expedite-lebanon-pager-attack?token=eyJlbWFpbCI6Impvc2h1YWVrZWF0aW5nQGdtYWlsLmNvbSIsIm5pZCI6IjY2NjM2In0%3D&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Ungrouped%20transactional%20email&amp;utm_content=Ungrouped%20transactional%20email+ID_6eff8eb5-7544-11ef-b731-b859b7e75d67&amp;utm_source=campmgr&amp;utm_term=Access%20Article"> Al-Monitor reported</a> on Tuesday that Israel had intended to wait longer to detonate the devices but was “forced” to move more quickly by reports that some Hezbollah members were starting to think there was something odd about their pagers.   </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">How will Hezbollah respond?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah has <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/middle-east-updates-new-devices-blast-in-southern-lebanon/live-70244929">vowed to retaliate</a>, saying Israel would receive its “fair punishment for the attacks.” The militia’s leader Hassan Nasrallah says he will give a speech on Thursday to address the “latest developments.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Hezbollah’s ability to strike back may be limited by the state of chaos it currently finds itself in. “They almost certainly have little to no communication or the infrastructure to be able to coordinate not just an initial round of a retaliation, but whatever would come next,” said Lister.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harding predicted that Hezbollah’s next move is likely to be a “big internal mole hunt to try to figure out where their vulnerabilities are.” After the follow-up explosions on Thursday, “they can&#8217;t trust anything that they have right now.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Iran, whose ambassador to Lebanon was among those injured by the blasts — not a huge surprise given the close links between Iran and Hezbollah — has also claimed the <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/iran-says-it-reserves-right-to-respond-after-ambassador-wounded-in-lebanon-blasts/">right to respond</a>. The question is whether this would go beyond the missile strike it launched in April in response to Israel’s bombing of the Iranian consulate, which killed two senior generals. Though that barrage was unprecedented in scale, most of the missiles were intercepted by Israel’s defenses, with the assistance of several other countries including the US, and the attack caused little damage. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Iran President Masoud Pezeshkian also said the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/18/hezbollah-promises-reckoning-for-israel-after-pager-explosions">US shared responsibility</a> for the attack, given its support for Israel, though Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US had no advance knowledge of the operation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">What does it mean for the future of conflict — and is my phone safe?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Washington Post’s David Ignatius wrote on Wednesday that the attacks <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/09/17/pager-attack-israel-hezbollah-lebanon/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9">mark the start</a> of a “very dangerous era in cyberwarfare” in which “any device that is connected to the internet can potentially be transformed into a weapon.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But some perspective is needed. The devices themselves were not weapons. Hackers have <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/mobile/08/05/miller.apple.battery.hacks/index.html">warned in the past</a> that it’s possible to use malware to remotely tamper with or even detonate a device’s battery, but to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/pager-explosion-hezbollah/">cause the kind of damage</a> seen this week, you need old-fashioned explosives. As a matter of technology, this isn’t a huge advance over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/06/world/palestinian-believed-to-be-bombing-mastermind-is-killed.html">Israel’s killing of Hamas bomb maker Yahya Ayyash</a> using an exploding cellphone in 1996. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From a technical point of view, what was impressive was Israel’s apparent ability to “hack” the supply chain and insert explosives into so many devices. There probably aren’t that many situations other than this one where that’s possible. As Axios’s Colin Demarest <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-future-of-defense-thought-bubble-fedbbaa0-75b8-11ef-9608-6bb026eca3bc">writes</a>, referring to worries that the US could be vulnerable to such an attack, “the Pentagon is unlikely to buy thousands of C-4-laden pagers for top brass.” Your iPhone is probably safe, too. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But this week’s attacks represent something radically new in terms of tactics, if not technology. In international law, “booby traps” are <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/100193/law-war-exploding-pagers-lebanon/">prohibited under many circumstances</a>, and given how many devices were detonated and the fact that civilians, including children, were injured and killed, there are questions about whether the attack met international legal standards. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And then there’s the issue of whether other actors — either nation-states or militant groups — might now attempt something similar in the future.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Colin Clarke, director of research at the Soufan Group, a think tank focused on counterterrorism, compared the attack to the early use of deadly drone strikes by the US. Once mainly the provenance of the US, killer drones have <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024/1/29/24055046/jordan-drone-strike-troop-deaths-proliferation">now spread widely</a> to both state and non-state actors.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wars like the current conflict in the Middle East are “often laboratories of innovation for all sides,” Clarke said. “We’re going to see militant groups developing new tricks and trying to leverage emerging technologies in new ways.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given the vast number of connected devices now in homes and businesses all over the world, there’s no lack of potential targets. Even if it would be difficult for anyone to pull off another similar attack of this scale, Clarke said it’s the sort of precedent-setting example that “could give bad people good ideas.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Few things spread faster than innovative ways to kill people in war.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ukraine’s military <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-targets-western-russian-regions-with-drones-russian-officials-says-2024-09-18/">apparently launched a drone attack against a weapons depot</a> in Russia’s Tver region Wednesday, causing a blast detectable from space.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The large-scale attack occurred near the village of Toropets, about 240 miles west of Moscow, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-targets-western-russian-regions-with-drones-russian-officials-says-2024-09-18/">Russian military bloggers</a>. <a href="https://iz.ru/story/udar-vsu-po-mnogoetazhnomu-domu-v-belgorode">According to Russian state media</a>, the attack was so intense the town of Toropets had to be evacuated. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Tver attack follows another showy Ukrainian operation on Russian soil: August’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/russia-ukraine/367298/ukraine-russia-incursion-kursk-war-putin-zelenskyy-crimea">shock offensive into Russia’s Kursk region</a> that has captured <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-kursk.html">about 500 square miles of territory</a>. Both are likely efforts by Ukraine to put itself in a better position to end Russia’s two-and-a-half-year war, which has devastated parts of the country — particularly in the south and east. While no peace talks are currently scheduled, Ukraine’s strategy could theoretically put it in a stronger negotiating position should talks happen, while also damaging Russia’s morale, ability to resupply, and its ability to launch devastating strikes within Ukraine. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ukraine has long argued it could achieve more battlefield victories if the Biden administration would allow the military to use US-made long-range weapons to strike targets further in Russia.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Tver strike and the Kursk incursion are likely meant to send a signal to allies that despite the war grinding on, Ukraine isn’t beaten, and that its allies aren’t backing a lost cause. That’s especially important in the leadup to the November US election, when a change in the White House could affect US political and material support for Ukraine, as <a href="https://punchbowl.news/article/foreign-policy/gop-split-screen-ukraine-war/">former President Donald Trump and other Republican candidates</a> have signaled a coolness to continued material support for the war effort.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Essentially, Ukraine’s message is: We’re doing well in the fight against Russia, and would do even better with more advanced weapons. However, despite Ukraine’s flashy successes since the Kursk offensive, it’s unclear —&nbsp;and possibly unlikely — that the Biden administration will give Ukraine both the materiel and the go-ahead to use it the way they want.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ukraine’s trying to make the most of limited resources, but the US is in a tricky position</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The target of the drone attack, according to Ukrainian sources <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68933778">cited in reporting</a>, was a weapons depot that held conventional weapons like artillery shells and ballistic missiles. Those weapons, as well as the fuel tanks reportedly stored at the depot, could account for the explosive visuals being circulated on Telegram, a favorite platform for Russian military bloggers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Experts note that though the Tver attack has attracted attention due to the size of the explosion, it’s not an isolated strike: “Ukrainian forces are conducting a consistent drone strike campaign into rear areas of Russia, targeting oil refineries and military airfields, military ammunition depots, and logistics facilities,” <a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/press-media/staff-bios/riley-bailey">Riley Bailey</a>, a senior researcher on Russia at the Institute for the Study of War, told Vox. “This one just seems to be very effective.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The successful drone attacks, Bailey said, could <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-strikes-russian-military-base-in-occupied-south-as-offensive-looms-cce9606a">disrupt Russian military logistics</a> within Russia — as longer-range <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA2033-1.html">Ukrainian missile attacks did against Russian military installations within Ukraine in summer 2022</a>. Disrupting logistics and resupply within Russia could,  over time, hamper Russia’s ability to defend itself from attacks on its own soil; mount offensive campaigns within Ukraine; and force the military to rebuild and rearrange its supply capabilities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If there was this persistent threat of Ukrainian forces being able to achieve similar effects at several logistics facilities like this, then that would impose the same kind of operational pressure that Russian forces faced back in the summer of 2022,” Bailey said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ukraine has always been outgunned and outmanned against Russia; without continued US and NATO support, the Ukrainian military can’t continue to fight. But, Ukrainian leadership has long argued, they could do much more significant damage to Russian supplies and strategy if the US allowed them to use long-range weapons to hit targets deep into Russian territory.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The apparently successful Tver attack comes as <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-victory-plan-ready/">Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</a> is set to present his victory plan to US President Joe Biden during a visit to the US later in September. <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/369339/ukraine-zelenskyy-russia-putin-war-biden-sanctions-weapons-negotiations">Though details are scarce, that plan</a> seems intent on using military force to push Russia into negotiations to end the war. A pillar of the plan likely depends on continued weapons support and looser permissions around how those weapons are used. The US has been hesitant to grant those permissions in order to not be seen as <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/sweden-finland-not-to-prohibit-ukraine-from-striking-russia-with-its-weapons-amid-putins-threats-to-nato/">directly involved</a> or escalating the conflict — and therefore <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/369035/kursk-nuclear-escalation-zelenskyy-putin">inviting Russia to do the same</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, fears about escalation haven’t played out on the battlefield, <a href="https://www.rand.org/about/people/c/courtney_william.html">Amb. William Courtney</a>, an adjunct senior fellow at the RAND Corporation, told Vox. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Russian reaction, generally, has not been to escalate,” he said. “It’s been to adapt and try to counter.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But even if the Biden administration allowed Ukraine to use longer-range missiles in its arsenal to attack Russian positions, it might not have a major impact, according to <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/people/jennifer-kavanagh?lang=en">Jennifer Kavanagh</a>, senior fellow and director of military analysis at Defense Priorities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There are not that many Russian military targets in range of even the longer range missiles with additional permissions, and Russia can move valuable assets elsewhere, further reducing any losses from Ukrainian strikes,” she said. Plus, Ukraine wouldn’t be able to get enough of those weapons to mount the kind of sustained attacks that would make a long-term difference in the war.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, Ukraine appears to be pressing ahead with its strategy and <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/us-reassures-but-sense-of-urgency-questioned-by-ukraine-as-6-billion-military-aid-hangs-in-the-balance/">hoping that the Biden administration gets on board with the plan for victory</a> —&nbsp;and that even if long-range capabilities aren’t the key to winning the war, they’ll at least make Russia’s war increasingly difficult and costly to execute.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Islamist militant organization and Lebanese political party, has been in conflict with Israel since its founding decades ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The intensity of the hostilities has waxed and waned, hitting a relative low point before the war in Gaza broke out. The months since October 7, though, have brought a dangerous escalation in fighting that increasingly risks engulfing Hezbollah, Lebanon, and the broader region in all-out war.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire since the war in Gaza started. Hezbollah has vowed not to relent until a ceasefire is reached in Gaza, where more than&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-820486">41,000 Palestinians</a> have been killed. The hostilities have primarily taken the form of airstrikes and have deepened as ceasefire negotiations have stagnated, displacing more than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-war-impact.html?smid=url-share">more than 100,000 people</a> who face daily tit-for-tat attacks on both sides of Lebanon’s border with Israel.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah is allied with Hamas, the Gaza-based group behind the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Both Hamas and Hezbollah have vowed to destroy Israel, have ties to Iran, and are considered terrorist organizations by many countries. While Israeli forces may have significantly weakened Hamas’s capabilities, however, it would likely be much more costly for Israel to go to war with Hezbollah, which is generally considered the most formidable militia group in the region.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah boasts a vast weapons arsenal, including as many as <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/9/20/hezbollah-to-israel-precision-missiles-now-obtained">120,000 missiles</a>, and has deployed it with increasing success inside Israel’s borders since the war in Gaza began. It has demonstrated advanced military tactics such as <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/hezbollah-introduces-new-weapons-tactics-against-israel-as-war-in-gaza-drags-on">using drones to fire missiles at key Israeli targets</a> and effective intelligence capabilities including <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/tool-of-first-resort-israel-hamas-war-in-cyber/">digital espionage</a>. It also has the support of not just Iran’s autocratic regime, but also Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad after it helped him stay in power during the country’s ongoing civil war.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, Israel has exposed some of Hezbollah’s weaknesses. Apparently infiltrating the group’s communications network, Israel reportedly <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/372399/pager-explosions-lebanon-syria-hezbollah-israel-gaza">planted explosives</a> in pagers and walkie-talkies used by members of Hezbollah, detonating them from afar and killing some of its members in Lebanon and Syria. Israel has also assassinated <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-08-13/hezbollah-israel-assassinations">top Hezbollah commanders</a> over the course of the war in Gaza. Deputies of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah have <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/top-hezbollah-official-vows-bloody-revenge-for-attacks-says-nasrallah-will-reveal-all-tomorrow/">signaled that the group will retaliate</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But even so, it’s not clear that Hezbollah wants to be responsible for starting a regional war, especially after the group’s last war with Israel, in 2006, led to such heavy casualties. If anything can be learned from that war, it’s that conflict between Hezbollah and Israel would lead to much bloodshed on both sides as well as challenges for their international allies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nasrallah previously <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-hezbollah-hamas-palestinians-israel-5e09b939ca225562370f779360af62d3">held talks</a> with senior Hamas and Palestine Islamic Jihad leaders in which they concluded that they share a goal of seeking “a real victory for the resistance in Gaza and Palestine” and stopping Israel’s “treacherous and brutal aggression against our oppressed and steadfast people in Gaza and the<a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/11/20/18080034/west-bank-israel-palestinians"> West Bank</a>,” according to a statement they released after. But the groups did not elaborate further on their intentions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a delicate moment for Hezbollah, an organization whose primary goal is eliminating the state of Israel but that has also amassed significant political power in Lebanon that it is fearful of losing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“They can take the whole region into a very hard war,” said <a href="https://english.tau.ac.il/profile/abedkan">Abed Kanaaneh</a>, a professor of Middle Eastern studies at Tel Aviv University and author of <em>Understanding Hezbollah: The Hegemony of Resistance</em>. “But they have their own interests, and they need to sustain their popularity in Lebanon. So they have their own calculations to make.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hezbollah’s origins and ideology, briefly explained&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah was founded in Lebanon in 1982 by men inspired by former Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini’s radical brand of Shia theology. The organization was among many that resisted Israel’s invasion of Lebanon that year following an assassination attempt on the Israeli ambassador to Britain orchestrated by Palestinian militants. Though the assassination was carried out by a rebel offshoot of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), a militant group, Israel sought to eliminate all Palestinian militant groups operating from Lebanon.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Following bloody fighting that left <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1982/09/03/war-casualties-put-at-48000-in-lebanon/cf593941-6067-4239-a453-71bdcaf9eba0/">more than 17,000 dead</a>, Israel succeeded in driving out those militants through a US-brokered agreement in 1983, which brought an official end to the war and allowed the PLO to relocate to Tunisia. But Israel continued to occupy Lebanon, creating a militarized security zone in the south that it maintained until 2000 with the stated purpose of protecting Israelis from attacks by Lebanese militants. The occupation, however, “creat[ed] conditions for the establishment and proliferation of Hezbollah,” by angering and radicalizing the local Shia community, wrote Augustus Richard Norton in his book, <em>Hezbollah: A Short History.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Early Hezbollah supporters rally outside the bombed US embassy in 1986, listening to speeches by political and religious leaders.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel<a href="https://ciaotest.cc.columbia.edu/olj/meria/meria997_eisenberg.html"> set up permanent infrastructure</a> in the security zone — military bases, new roads, road signs in Hebrew, and detention camps that Norton notes became notorious for their brutality. When militant groups, including a fledgling Hezbollah, tried to drive out the Israeli forces, civilians were caught in the crossfire.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile,<a href="https://www.vox.com/iran"> Iran</a> was nurturing Hezbollah, offering it training, funding, and weapons. The Iranian government saw Hezbollah as a vehicle to indirectly attack Israel, which it regarded as an<a href="https://www.stimson.org/2023/what-drives-israel-iran-hostility-how-might-it-be-resolved/"> illegitimate state</a> and encapsulation of<a href="https://theconversation.com/the-long-history-of-iranian-distrust-of-the-west-4480"> Western imperialism</a>, as well as a promising group that could<a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/hezbollahs-record-war-politics"> spread their ideas of Shia Islamic revolution</a> across the Middle East. The willingness of Hezbollah’s early leaders to<a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-hezbollah#:~:text=Hezbollah%20bills%20itself%20as%20a,allegiance%20to%20Iran's%20supreme%20leader."> pledge loyalty</a> to Iran’s then-leaders helped facilitate bonds as well.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah shares Iran’s Shia revolutionary ideology, and they both support Palestinians and oppose Israel. But there is disagreement among experts as to how much Iran is really calling the shots with Hezbollah. Some say Hezbollah is an Iranian proxy;<a href="https://tcf.org/experts/thanassis-cambanis/"> Thanassis Cambanis</a>, director of Century International and author of <em>A Privilege to Die: Inside Hezbollah’s Legions and Their Endless War Against Israel</em>, said their relationship can be described as “very closely allied and ideologically aligned with a lot of shared interests,” but Hezbollah also has a “great deal of its own autonomy” and “shouldn’t be understood as a traditional proxy.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Iran has continued to fund Hezbollah over the years, and while it’s unclear exactly how much the organization has received, the US State Department estimates it at<a href="https://www.state.gov/reports/country-reports-on-terrorism-2021/"> hundreds of millions of dollars</a> annually. Most of that goes to Hezbollah’s military wing, and that figure includes weapons supplied by Iran, including an arsenal of drones and rockets. But Hezbollah also has other revenue sources, both legal and illegal: through the Lebanese state, smuggling, money laundering, and other forms of organized crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah laid out its ideology in a 1985 document addressed to the “Downtrodden in Lebanon and in the World.” It identified the United States and the Soviet Union as being among “the countries of the arrogant world” that inflict suffering on those less powerful, and explicitly rejected both the East and the West. It accused the US of using Israel as a “spearhead” against Muslims in Lebanon, and justified fighting the US, often by violent means, as an exercise of its “legitimate right to defend our Islam and the dignity of our nation.” It laid out a vision for Lebanon as an Iranian-style theocracy, though it emphasized the goal of Lebanese self-determination.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And finally, it opposed any attempts to negotiate with Israel, seeking the country’s withdrawal from Lebanon as the first step toward “its final obliteration from existence and the liberation of venerable Jerusalem from the talons of occupation.” The document made clear Hezbollah saw (and still sees) Israel’s existence as a threat to Muslims throughout the region. In that sense, it found common ground with Sunni Muslim militant groups like Hamas, though Hamas’s reasons for wanting Israel destroyed were slightly different, focusing less on regional factors than on the establishment of an independent state in historical <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Palestine">Palestine</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah has hewed closely to this agenda in the years since, even as it has evolved from a guerrilla group to a more professionalized resistance organization, political party, and provider of social services in Lebanon. It did, however, temper its Islamist rhetoric somewhat in<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-hezbollah/hezbollah-cuts-islamist-rhetoric-in-new-manifesto-idUSTRE5AT3VK20091130"> an updated 2009 manifesto</a>, noting that making diverse Lebanon into a state that follows Islamic law is an unrealistic goal and affirming a commitment to “the achievement of true democracy.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At present, Hezbollah has some<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10703"> 20,000 estimated active members</a> and is popular among the Shia, who represent about a third of the Lebanese population. The most heavily armed non-state actor in the world, Hezbollah has a<a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/security-aviation/2023-10-23/ty-article-magazine/150-000-rockets-and-missiles-the-weapons-israel-would-encounter-in-a-war-with-hezbollah/0000018b-573d-d2b2-addf-777df6210000"> large arsenal</a> of long-range missiles that can reach well within Israel’s borders, as well as a comprehensive air defense system and commando force. It has refused to give up its arms despite<a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20091111-hezbollah-warns-new-government-avoid-arms-issue"> repeated</a> domestic and international calls for disarmament, arguing that it<a href="https://mepc.org/journal/rethinking-hezbollahs-disarmament"> needs its weapons</a> so long as Israel continues to occupy what it claims is Lebanese territory in the Golan Heights (territory that Israel annexed in a move that has been recognized only by the US and no other country).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, Hezbollah faces the challenge of balancing its revolutionary aims with governance — and Nasrallah, who has been at the helm of Hezbollah since 1992, has at times been criticized within Lebanon and the greater Arab world for putting too much weight on the former. But Nasrallah has also proved a charismatic leader and orator who has bolstered Hezbollah’s legitimacy through a sophisticated communication strategy and has overcome harsh criticism before.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“They are cosmopolitan and seasoned professionals, even in pursuit of problematic goals,” said Cambanis<em>.</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is Hezbollah a militant group, a political party, or both?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US designated Hezbollah as a foreign terrorist organization in 1997. Many other countries and organizations have followed suit, though some, including the<a href="https://www.vox.com/european-union"> European Union</a>, distinguish between Hezbollah’s political and militant arms.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some argue that’s a distinction without a difference. Unlike Hamas — in which the political and military leadership are separate and operate out of different locations — Hezbollah is a “very centrally controlled, unified organization,” Cambanis said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Their political leaders all have a military background,” he said. “Their resistance structure, to use their term, necessitates the armed struggle and the political struggle being inextricable.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah became associated with terrorism in the 1980s, during a time when it rejected the notion of participating in Lebanese politics. It viewed the political system, which was designed to split power between the country’s largest religious groups based on their size at the end of France’s dominion, as irredeemably corrupt and unfair. So Hezbollah dedicated itself to pursuing the objective of replacing the secular government with an Islamist one.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Its first step was ridding Lebanon of the foreign influences it believed to be the source of political strife: France and the US. Both countries had deployed peacekeeping forces to Lebanon amid the 1982 Israeli invasion and outbreak of civil war. From the US perspective, the most devastating <a href="https://www.vox.com/terrorism">terrorist attack</a> was a 1983 suicide bombing on its military barracks in Beirut, an event that killed more than 300 American and French troops and Lebanese civilians. The Americans blamed Hezbollah for the attack and pulled all of their forces from the country. There was also the June 1985 hijacking of TWA flight 847 to Beirut, in which militants who later escaped without being captured killed a passenger and threatened to kill more unless Israel released hundreds of Lebanese prisoners. (Hezbollah denies involvement in either incident.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Between 1982 and 1992, Hezbollah took more than 100 foreign hostages, mostly Westerners, seemingly with the aim of winning concessions from Western countries. In one such incident, known as the Iran-Contra affair, then-US President Ronald Reagan traded weapons to Iran, which was then subject to an arms embargo, for the release of hostages held by Hezbollah. Hezbollah also kidnapped Israeli soldiers, conducted cross-border raids on the Israeli border, and fired rockets and missiles into Israel, again with the goal of ending Israel’s occupation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those tactics continued through the 1990s, even as Hezbollah changed its strategy and decided to enter politics. Hezbollah members were elected to the Lebanese Parliament for the first time in 1992, following the end of the 15-year Lebanese civil war that had seen various religious and secular subgroups clash. It was then that Lebanese leaders associated with Hezbollah came to recognize the “need to come to a modus vivendi with the state rather than remain outside the political system and judge it as abhorrent in strictly Islamic terms,” Norton wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Interestingly, Hezbollah built its political following on non-religious themes, which Norton identifies as “battling economic exploitation and underdevelopment, inequities in the political system, personal freedom and opportunity, and, of course, security.” But it wasn’t until after 2000, when Israel finally withdrew from the security zone it had established in southern Lebanon, that Hezbollah really gained popularity.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though Israeli leaders insisted that their withdrawal from Lebanon was a unilateral political decision,<a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/twenty-years-after-the-israeli-withdrawal-from-lebanon-hezbollah-faces-host-of-challenges/"> many Lebanese credited Hezbollah</a> with driving out the army by stepping up its attacks. That — along with Hezbollah’s investment in schools, clinics, youth programs, and other social services — drove up the organization’s profile in Lebanon. It went on to progressively gain seats in Parliament over the years and to run a coalition government alongside its sometimes political rival Amal, which also draws its power from Lebanon’s Shia community. In the most recent Lebanese elections in 2022, Hezbollah won 13 of 128 seats, though the party and its allies lost their majority.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, Hezbollah’s emergence as a political force didn’t mean that the group abandoned its violent tactics, at times undermining its authority as a resistance group. For instance, the United Nations found that four Hezbollah members were responsible for the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in a car bombing that also killed 21 bystanders. And in 2006, the organization killed three Israeli soldiers and kidnapped two others in a cross-border raid. It failed to anticipate the disproportionate Israeli response and the ensuing war, which claimed the lives of more than 1,000 Lebanese and 160 Israelis. Neither side won; a UN-brokered ceasefire ended the conflict after a little over a month.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah has also proved willing to enact violence at the<a href="https://www.mei.edu/publications/hezbollahs-regional-activities-support-irans-proxy-networks"> behest of Iran’s proxy networks</a>, especially following its involvement in the Syrian civil war defending the Assad regime and after the 2020 assassination of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commander Gen. Qassem Soleimani. Hezbollah has deployed militants to other countries — including Iraq and Yemen — to train these proxy groups and fight alongside them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Along with Iran, Hezbollah is closely linked to Syria, though their relationship has been more one of convenience than shared ideology. Syria has long served as a conduit for weapons supply lines between Iran and Syria. As a result and at<a href="https://www.mei.edu/publications/hezbollahs-regional-activities-support-irans-proxy-networks"> Iran’s urging</a>, Nasrallah committed Hezbollah to “<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10703">do everything in [its] power”</a> to protect dictator Bashar al-Assad’s government from largely Sunni rebel groups after civil war broke out in 2011.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah helped turn the tide of the war in Assad’s favor. When they withdrew most of their forces from Syria in 2019, they left <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/israel/2019-03-08/will-hezbollahs-rise-be-its-downfall">arguably stronger militarily</a> than they were before — raising concerns that they could pose a formidable foe should they enter the conflict with Israel.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hezbollah’s standing — domestically and internationally — is not what it once was&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although Hezbollah’s military wing came out of the last two decades of conflict battle-hardened, its violent adventurism has caused its political wing a lot of harm.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah lost some of its luster domestically and regionally as a result of the 2006 war’s death and destruction. In addition to the many casualties, Israeli attacks led to<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-war-cost/factbox-costs-of-war-and-recovery-in-lebanon-and-israel-idUSL0822571220070709"> $2.8 billion in direct damage</a>. While Hezbollah (using funding from Iran)<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-war-reconstruction/lebanons-postwar-reconstruction-far-from-complete-idUSL0922501920070709"> poured hundreds of millions</a> of dollars into compensation and rebuilding efforts, Lebanon<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/broken-lebanon-cannot-afford-war-hezbollah-knows-it-2023-10-26/"> still took years to recover</a>. The organization’s involvement in Syria <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-hezbollah#chapter-title-0-6">hurt it politically</a>, too. In Lebanon, voters believed that foreign intervention had come at the expense of their domestic concerns, and throughout the region, Sunnis expressed great disillusionment with Hezbollah; they saw the group as having propped up Assad, a vicious leader who routinely oppresses his people.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent years, Hezbollah’s political capital has been further reduced by political issues.<a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2020/1/19/21073004/beirut-lebanon-protests-300-injured"> Mass protests spurred by economic troubles</a> undermined support for Hezbollah and the country’s political elites in 2019. Prime Minister Saad Hariri<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/29/lebanon-prime-minister-saad-hariri-resigns-after-mass-protests"> resigned under public pressure</a>, despite Hezbollah’s desire to keep him in office. Hezbollah members actively sought to suppress the protest movement,<a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/10/29/774356174/lebanons-prime-minister-hariri-resigns-after-weeks-of-protests"> setting fire</a> to a camp of anti-government protesters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah’s popularity<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/is-hezbollah-overplaying-its-hand-inside-lebanon/"> again took a hit</a> following the<a href="https://www.vox.com/world/21451455/beirut-port-explosion-lebanon-political-crisis-hezbollah"> 2020 explosion of a Beirut port</a>, which the organization controlled. The group also resisted calls for an international investigation of the incident, much to the chagrin of the Lebanese public. Ahead of the 2022 elections, Hezbollah’s role in<a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/5/15/23073845/lebanon-elections-political-corruption-economic-crisis-voter-apathy-beirut-port-hezbollah"> Lebanon’s general political instability</a> had many of its opponents deeply frustrated.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25038496/GettyImages_1237783045.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="The protester, a woman with long dark hair and a leather jacket, bends to let her poster catch the flames rising from an overturned garbage bin.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even before these issues, Hezbollah was a polarizing force in Lebanese society. The organization has solidified Shia support by being effective in local government and supporting social services but has often struggled to expand its sphere of influence. Lebanon is a fractured society, with different religious and secular groups jockeying for power, and Hezbollah is hated by those who oppose its worldview, with little room for a middle ground.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“They are successful at winning very deep loyalty from their supporters,” Cambanis said. “And they’re successful at being able to violently coerce and intimidate their opponents.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a<a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52750dd3e4b08c252c723404/t/618dbc443f3402756b4b3f35/1636678726963/Lebanon+2021+FINAL.pdf"> 2021 Zogby/NC State University poll</a>, 52 percent of Lebanese said they did not think Hezbollah promotes stability, though significant majorities of Shia, Druze, and Christians — all groups with leaders who’ve partnered with Hezbollah in the past — said that it did. The question is whether these cracks in Hezbollah’s support can be contained as the organization faces the prospect of an all-out war with Israel.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Lebanese are okay with the limited war that Hezbollah is [waging] against Israel right now, but if it will become total war or much deeper war, I can say that Hezbollah’s support will drop off,” Kanaaneh said.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Will Hezbollah enter the Israel-Hamas war?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah has been reluctant to engage Israel in open combat since the devastating 2006 war, but the situation in Gaza appears to have changed that. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah has “built their own narrative and public image of being part of the resistance axis” around the Palestinian cause, Kanaaneh said. While it was previously reluctant to declare war against Israel in part because of the suffering it would inflict on Lebanon, the situation in Gaza has become dire.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel has decimated Gaza as well as the ranks of Hezbollah’s Sunni ally in Hamas, its link to the broader Islamic world. The fighting has already had a destabilizing effect on life in Lebanon, with tens of thousands of civilians displaced by the conflict and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/5/lebanese-grapple-with-fear-rage-and-tough-choices-as-regional-war-looms">living in fear</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah and Israel have <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/coming-conflict-hezbollah">exchanged thousands of attacks</a>, mostly in the form of airstrikes concentrated on both sides of Lebanon’s border with Israel. Hezbollah has also deployed forces and fired anti-tank guided missiles at Israel from this border region in <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/coming-conflict-hezbollah">violation of a United Nations resolution</a> passed after the 2006 war. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel has responded with targeted assassinations of Hezbollah leaders. That notably included top Hezbollah commander <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/how-israel-killed-a-ghost-73e6db68?mod=hp_lead_pos7">Fuad Shukr</a>, who was drawn onto the seventh floor of his building in Beirut after receiving a mysterious phone call and killed in a missile strike. The group <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2024-07-09/pagers-and-drones-how-hezbollah-aims-to-counter-israels-high-tech-surveillance">stopped using cellphones after his death</a>, but that move backfired when Israel reportedly targeted thousands of their pagers and walkie-talkies, <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/372399/pager-explosions-lebanon-syria-hezbollah-israel-gaza">hiding explosives inside and detonating them</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Hezbollah opens up a full-scale war against Israel, it could play out much like the 2006 conflict where there were no victors, though it could potentially be even bloodier. In 2006, Hezbollah was estimated to have 12,000 missiles; now, it is thought to have 10 times that. Its troops have far more experience, including in urban combat, than they did before.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Regardless of how any fighting turns out, “everybody will lose from this,” Kanaaneh said. That could include Kanaaneh himself: When we spoke last October, he was living in Israel near the Lebanese border. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rich Johnston, a father of two school-aged children in Atlanta, thought AOL Instant Messenger was bad enough. Johnston recently told me that “away messages screwed with people’s brains,” stressed them out. The self-identified elder millennial also loves the fire hose of information that is X, formerly Twitter, and yes, he knows that’s weird.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Now we’ve got Snapchat and TikTok and Instagram, and that’s got to be worse in 10 years,” he said. “That’s the terrifying part of bringing a kid up in this environment.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He’s not the only one who feels this way. There’s now a nationwide and rather panicked push to keep smartphones out of kids’ hands and teens off of social media, <a href="https://www.vox.com/24127431/smartphones-young-kids-children-parenting-social-media-teen-mental-health">pointing to a correlation</a> between young people spending more time online and an increase in mental health problems. US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/355795/technology-should-social-media-come-with-a-warning-label">even called for warning labels</a> on social media platforms earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This week that panic reached a tipping point.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Congress on Wednesday <a href="https://www.axios.com/pro/tech-policy/2024/09/18/energy-and-commerce-advances-kids-online-safety-bills">came one step closer</a> to passing <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/364127/kosa-social-media-teen-health-anxiety">the Kids Online Safety and Privacy Act (KOSPA)</a>, as tech companies scramble to get ahead of what would be the most significant internet regulation in decades. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And just a day before that bill was set to be marked up in the House, Meta <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/technology/instagram-teens-safety-privacy-changes.html">announced it was revamping Instagram</a> with a new effort called Teen Accounts, which makes accounts of users under 18 private by default, restricts notifications at night, and gives parents options to supervise their kids. It’s not exactly taking Instagram away from teens, but it could dramatically change how they use it. This is the latest move by social media companies to make their platforms a bit less, well, terrifying for parents. YouTube and Snapchat <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/09/17/teen-accounts-parental-controls-setup-instagram/">made similar announcements</a> this month.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether these developments will actually be good for kids remains an open question.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-megaphone-fm wp-block-embed-megaphone-fm"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div><iframe title="Your phone is banned, fellow kids by Today, Explained" src="https://player.megaphone.fm/VMP9434449812" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is all happening against a backdrop where seven states <a href="https://www.kff.org/mental-health/issue-brief/a-look-at-state-efforts-to-ban-cellphones-in-schools-and-implications-for-youth-mental-health/">have passed bans in schools</a>, and another 14 are considering bans. There’s also a wave of cultural pressure, <a href="https://www.vox.com/24127431/smartphones-young-kids-children-parenting-social-media-teen-mental-health">intensified by NYU professor Jonathan Haidt</a>, whose latest book, <em>The Anxious Generation</em>, <a href="https://www.anxiousgeneration.com/pdfs/four-norms.pdf">rallies parents to work together</a> to “swim against the tide of ever-increasing screen time.” One of his collaborators, psychologist Jean Twenge, was one of the first to sound the alarm about the link between youth mental health and time online back in 2017 when she asked in an Atlantic essay, “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/">Have smartphones destroyed a generation?</a>”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To be clear, researchers like Haidt and Twenge aren’t suggesting we simply ban kids from ever touching a smartphone or scrolling through a social media feed. We don’t actually know how such bans or even changes in policy would affect youth mental health. Meanwhile, the school phone bans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/technology/school-phone-bans-indiana-louisiana.html">that have been sweeping the nation</a> don’t govern what parents do at home. We are, however, starting to use the phrase “phone ban” a lot more than we used to.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I hear that talk of a ban as a kind of howl of despair, really, that we’ve lost control,” said <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/media-and-communications/people/academic-staff/sonia-livingstone">Sonia Livingstone</a>, a professor of social psychology at the London School of Economics, who has been studying kids and tech for decades. “We’ve lost control of the feed from the companies, and we’ve lost control of our education and our health and our family life by accepting — as part of whatever kind of Faustian contract — the infrastructure of commerce.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In other words, we’re letting the tech companies win.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Companies like Meta make money by getting their users to engage more with their products, so they can collect data about them and sell targeted ads accordingly. Instagram’s new Teen Accounts might make parents feel like they have a bit more control over how their kids factor into these transactions, but their kids’ attention is still the product.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">KOSPA, however, targets the business models of social media platforms. The legislation, which combines the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) and the Children and Teen’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (COPPA 2.0), would ban targeted advertising to minors, allow users to turn off algorithmic sorting in their feeds, and bumps the minimum age requirement for online accounts from 13 to 17. It would also create a so-called “duty of care” for social media companies that would make them liable for harmful content on their platforms. The definition of what constitutes harmful content <a href="https://publicinterestprivacy.org/2024-09-17-kosa/">is still being hammered out in the bill’s language</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We don’t yet know the fate of KOSPA. Its predecessor, KOSA, passed the Senate in July with a vote of 93 in favor, 3 opposed. Tech companies and their lobbyists <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/09/social-media-lgbtq-teens-harms/679798/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">have been arguing against it</a>, as have free speech advocates who believe it will <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/revised-kids-online-safety-act-is-an-improvement-but-congress-must-still-address-first-amendment-concerns">open the door to censorship</a>. Combined with whatever self-regulation social media platforms decide to do, such sweeping legislation could make it a little less terrifying to raise kids in our increasingly digital world. But it hardly guarantees an end to the youth mental health crisis.</p>

A good starting point is the <a href="https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/media-and-children/center-of-excellence-on-social-media-and-youth-mental-health/5cs-of-media-use/">5 Cs of Media Use</a> — Child, Content, Calm, Crowding Out, and Communication — that help you evaluate the specific needs of your child. The AAP <a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/Media/Pages/kids-and-screen-time-how-to-use-the-5-cs-of-media-guidance.aspx">points out</a> that although we’re accustomed to safety standards for childrens’ products, such regulations don’t currently exist for tech. “This means that kids are using platforms and apps that might have been <a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/Media/Pages/social-media-design-4-things-parents-should-know.aspx">designed</a> for adults — not kids at their different stages of development,” according to the AAP.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Parents should also follow <a href="https://www.apa.org/topics/social-media-internet/healthy-technology-use">basic guidelines for healthy digital media use</a>, like turning off notifications, avoiding screens before bed, limiting social media use, and just putting your phone away sometimes. You can live without looking at it for longer than you think.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To do that, Livingstone told me, we should study the causes of youth mental health problems, rather than focus on the consequences of screen time. <a href="https://www.wcwonline.org/Active-Researchers/linda-charmaraman-phd">Linda Charmaraman</a>, founder and director of the Youth, Media, and Wellbeing Lab at Wellesley College, pointed to the surgeon general’s call for warnings on social media platforms as a sign of “a little bit of a hysterical panic.” She also said that solving the mental health problem will require more than a crackdown on smartphone use.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“People want something to stop that rise of mental illness as if this was going to be the magic bullet,” Charmaraman said. “I think it could actually cause people to not look at the other root causes of mental illness.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not just the kids, after all, who are having a hard time navigating life online. Surgeon General Murthy in August <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/priorities/parents/index.html">issued an advisory on the mental health and well-being of parents</a>, and with it, the hand-wringing over kids and tech <a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/parents-are-the-anxious-generation">starts to resemble an ouroboros of anxiety</a>. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/28/opinion/surgeon-general-stress-parents.html?unlocked_article_code=1.GU4.S_UV._LQOgX5BhAXf&amp;smid=url-share">a New York Times essay</a> about the advisory, Murthy even points to “the impact of social media on youth mental health” as a source of mental health challenges for parents.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Stress, loneliness and exhaustion can easily affect people’s mental health and well-being,” Murthy wrote. “And we know that the mental health of parents has a direct impact on the mental health of children.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No wonder everyone’s feeling panicky. As Congress bands together to take aim at kids’ safety online and give parents more control over what their children see and do online, parents are stuck in a feedback loop. They’re stressed out by <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/9/27/23356278/the-pandemic-child-care-inflation-crisis">the child care crisis</a> that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024/5/14/24155209/child-care-cliff-daycare-moms-mothers-labor">Congress still won’t solve</a>. They’re <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/5/3/23707936/surgeon-general-loneliness-epidemic-report">suffering through a loneliness epidemic</a> with <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/366620/loneliness-epidemic-coping-demographics-america-social-connection-mental-health">no end in sight</a>. A <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b7c56e255b02c683659fe43/t/64ac08af6f3dc8123d9b3c45/1688996016873/Caring+for+the+Caregivers_final.pdf">2022 Harvard study found</a> that 20 percent of mothers and 15 percent of fathers reported anxiety, compared to 18 percent of teens. And almost 40 percent of teens said they were “somewhat worried” about their parents’ mental health.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We don’t yet know how changing the way social media works for kids will affect their mental health. There’s a chance that turning off algorithmic feeds will reduce the risk that they’re exposed to harmful content. It’s certainly possible that getting rid of targeted ads will have a positive effect. Better privacy is bound to keep kids safer from strangers online. If nothing else, we’ve at least started talking more about how these platforms work and could work better. And how we could feel better online and off.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“You can&#8217;t protect them from it forever,” Johnston, the dad from Atlanta, said. “So you’ve got to train them how to use it in a smart, safe, non-panic-inducing fashion as best you can.”</p>

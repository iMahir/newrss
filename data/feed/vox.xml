<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Editor’s</em> <em>note, November 4, 10:30 am:</em></strong><em> On Monday, November 4 — more than a year after the justices first met to consider the </em>Hamm<em> case — the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/110424zor_8mjp.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released an order</a> sending the case back down to the federal appeals court that previously decided it.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Monday&#8217;s order is probably bad news for Joseph Clifton Smith, the death row inmate at the heart of this case. It asks the lower court to clarify whether it gave “conclusive weight” to Smith&#8217;s lowest score on five separate IQ tests, or whether it also gave full consideration to the tests that showed a higher score. This suggests that many of the justices doubt that Smith is intellectually disabled — it is unconstitutional to execute an intellectually disabled person.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>At the same time, the order focuses on the specific facts of Smith&#8217;s case, rather than diving into deeper questions about how to interpret the Eighth Amendment. So that suggests the Court may not be eager to substantially revise the law governing cruel and unusual punishment.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>The original story, published October 17, follows. </em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For more than a year, Joseph Clifton Smith, a man who says he is intellectually disabled, has sat on death row, waiting to find out if the Supreme Court will greenlight his execution.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Smith’s case, known as <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/hamm-v-smith-3/"><em>Hamm v. Smith</em></a>, first arrived on the Court’s doorstep in August 2023. Since then, the justices have met more than two dozen times to decide what to do about the case, and each time they’ve put the decision off until a future meeting.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No one outside of the Court can know for sure why the justices keep delaying, but if you follow the Court’s Eighth Amendment cases closely, it’s easy to see how the <em>Hamm</em> case could open up all kinds of internal rifts among the justices.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Eighth Amendment, which has a vague ban on “<a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-8/">cruel and unusual punishments</a>,” is at the center of the <em>Hamm </em>case because, for decades, the Court has held this amendment forbids executions of<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-8452.ZO.html">intellectually disabled</a> offenders (and offenders who <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/543/551/">commit a crime while they are juveniles</a>). The idea is that both groups have diminished mental capacity, at least as compared to non-disabled adults, and thus bear less moral responsibility even for homicide crimes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That idea, however, has long been contested by the Court’s various ideological factions, and the <em>Hamm</em> case potentially reopens up all of the Court’s issues with the amendment at once. Indeed, in the worst-case scenario for criminal defendants, the justices could potentially overrule more than 60 years of precedents protecting against excessive punishments.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">This Supreme Court’s ongoing battles over the Eighth Amendment, briefly explained</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In two 2000s decisions, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-8452.ZO.html"><em>Atkins v. Virginia</em></a> (2002) and <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/543/551/"><em>Roper v. Simmons</em></a> (2005), a coalition of Democratic and moderate Republican justices handed down decisions that barred youths and people who are intellectually disabled from being executed. Those majority decisions came down over bitter dissents from the Court’s right flank — the same right flank that has since <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/7/8/23784320/supreme-court-2022-term-affirmative-action-religion-voting-rights-abortion">gained a supermajority on the Supreme Court</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At least some of the current Court’s Republicans seem eager to use their newfound supermajority to blow up those two cases (and pretty much everything the Court has said about the Eighth Amendment in the last six or seven decades). So it’s possible that the Court is fighting over what to do with the <em>Hamm</em> case because many of the justices want a wholesale revolution in Eighth Amendment law.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beginning in the mid-20th century, the Supreme Court maintained that the Eighth Amendment “must draw its meaning from the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/12/30/22187578/death-penalty-united-states-executions-decline-gregg-georgia-bucklew-precythe">evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society</a>.” Thus, as a particular method of punishment grew less common, the Court was increasingly likely to declare it cruel and unusual in violation of the Constitution.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At least some members of the Court’s Republican majority, however, have suggested that this “evolving standards of decency” framework should be abandoned. In <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-8151_1qm2.pdf"><em>Bucklew v. Precythe</em></a> (2019), the Court considered whether states could use execution methods that risked causing the dying inmate a great deal of pain. Justice Neil Gorsuch’s majority opinion, which held that potentially painful methods of execution are allowed, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/12/30/22187578/death-penalty-united-states-executions-decline-gregg-georgia-bucklew-precythe">seems to exist in a completely different universe</a> than the Court’s Eighth Amendment cases that look to evolving standards.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the Court’s earlier opinions ask whether a particular form of punishment has fallen out of favor <em>today</em>, Gorsuch asked whether a method of punishment was out of favor <em>at the time of the founding</em>. Though his opinion does list some methods of execution, such as “disemboweling” and “burning alive” that violate the Eighth Amendment, Gorsuch wrote that these methods are unconstitutional because “by the time of the founding, these methods had long fallen out of use and so had become ‘unusual.’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What makes <em>Bucklew</em> confusing, however, is that it didn’t explicitly overrule any of the previous decisions applying the evolving standards framework. So it’s unclear whether all five of the justices who joined that opinion share a desire to blow up more than a half-century of law, or if the justices who joined the <em>Bucklew </em>majority simply failed to rein in an overly ambitious opinion by Gorsuch, the Court’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/22431044/neil-gorsuch-nihilism-supreme-court-voting-rights-lgbt-housing-obamacare-constitution">most intellectually</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/6/27/23184848/supreme-court-kennedy-bremerton-school-football-coach-prayer-neil-gorsuch">sloppy justice</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In any event, <em>Hamm</em> opens up at least two major potential divides within the Court. Smith says he is intellectually disabled; the state of Alabama wants to execute him anyway. So the case perfectly tees up a challenge to <em>Atkins</em> if a majority of the justices want to go there. Meanwhile, <em>Bucklew</em> looms like a vulture over any cruel and unusual punishment case heard by the Court, as it suggests that the Republican justices may hit the reset button on all of its Eighth Amendment precedents at any time.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So what is the specific legal issue in <em>Hamm</em>?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Court receives thousands of petitions every year asking it to hear a particular appeal, and it typically <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/supreme-court-procedure/#:~:text=In%20most%20circumstances%2C%20the%20Supreme,argument%20in%20only%20about%2080.">only grants several dozen of these petitions</a>. The vast majority of these cases are nominally discussed at one of the justices’ regular conferences, then promptly denied.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent years, the Court often discusses a case in two different conferences before agreeing to hear it — for this reason, I and other Supreme Court reporters often watch the <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/petitions-were-watching/">list of cases the Court “relisted”</a> for a second conference to identify cases the justices are more likely to hear. Occasionally, a case may be relisted for several conferences in a row. But this is rare, and typically is a sign either that the justices are negotiating over which issues they wish to decide in a particular case — or, more often, that a justice is dissenting from the Court’s decision not to hear a case and the “relists” are really just buying that justice time to draft an opinion.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Hamm</em>, however, has now been relisted in every single conference since the justices first discussed it on October 27, 2023. That is, to say the least, highly unusual. And it suggests that some particularly bitter internal negotiations are ongoing. If someone were dissenting from the Court’s decision to turn the case away, they likely would have released that dissent last July, because the justices typically try to resolve loose ends before they go on their summer vacation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Hamm </em>involves a question that would inevitably arise once the Court decided <em>Atkins</em> — though it is unconstitutional to execute intellectually disabled offenders, there will always be some offenders who are on the borderline of what mental health professionals consider an intellectual disability. The specific question before the Court is what to do with these borderline cases.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a general rule, someone must have an IQ of 70 or below to be considered intellectually disabled. But IQ tests aren’t particularly precise — as the Supreme Court acknowledged in <a href="https://casetext.com/case/moore-v-texas-12"><em>Moore v. Texas</em></a> (2017), the IQ of someone who scores 74 on a particular IQ test falls within “a range of 69 to 79.” So, if courts read IQ tests as if they can identify an offender’s IQ score exactly, an intellectually disabled person could be executed due to something as arbitrary as a measurement error.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Accordingly, the Court held in <a href="https://casetext.com/case/hall-v-florida-7#p723"><em>Hall v. Florida</em></a> (2014) that a capital offender with an IQ score slightly above 70 must be given “the opportunity to present evidence of his intellectual disability, including deficits in adaptive functioning over his lifetime.” That is, such an offender must be allowed to present additional evidence beyond their IQ score to show that they are, in fact, intellectually disabled.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Hamm</em> is such a case. Smith took five different IQ tests, four of which showed him with an IQ in the low to mid-70s. Accordingly, two lower courts looked at additional evidence of his disability, determined he is, in fact, intellectually disabled, and ruled that he must receive a sentence other than death.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In asking to execute Smith, in other words, Alabama is asking, among other things, that the Supreme Court overrule <em>Moore</em> and <em>Hall</em>, both cases that were handed down before former President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/9/20962980/trump-supreme-court-federal-judges">remade the Court in the Federalist Society’s image</a>. If the Court agrees, that alone would be a very significant legal development, both because it could allow intellectually disabled inmates to be executed due to a testing error, and because it would be a severe blow to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/5/18/22440256/brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-edwards-vannoy-abortion-criminal-justice-constitution-stare-decisis">stare decisis</a> — the idea that judicial precedents shouldn’t be tossed out simply because the members of a court change.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, this Court’s Republican majority has shown little regard for stare decisis, at least in cases that divide along partisan lines. Since Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation gave the Republican Party a supermajority on the Supreme Court in late 2020, the Court has <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/7/8/23784320/supreme-court-2022-term-affirmative-action-religion-voting-rights-abortion">behaved as if it was going down a checklist</a>, overruling liberal victories such as the cases establishing a constitutional right to abortion or the line of cases permitting affirmative action in limited circumstances, and replacing them with whatever outcome the GOP prefers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet, while this process has been painful for Democrats and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/supreme-court/">toxic for the Court’s approval rating</a>, it hasn’t been comprehensive — occasionally, one or more of the Republican justices signal that they will allow a previous liberal victory to remain in effect. Concurring in the Court’s decision to overrule <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, for example, Justice Brett Kavanaugh identified the Court’s past decisions <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf">protecting a right to contraception, as well as the right to marry a person of your own choosing</a>, as cases he did not intend to overrule.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of which is a long way of saying that there’s no good way to know if <em>Atkins</em> or <em>Roper</em> is on the Court’s checklist of past liberal decisions to be overruled. These justices’ approaches to specific cases are often idiosyncratic, unpredictable, and unbound by preexisting law — just look at the Republican justices’ recent decision holding that Trump was <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship">allowed to commit many crimes while he was in office</a>. The question of whether <em>Atkins</em> survives or falls will turn on whether there are five justices who want intellectually disabled people to be executed, and nothing else.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the fact <em>Hamm</em> has been relisted so many times suggests, at the very least, that there is a vocal faction within the Supreme Court that wants to use this case to aggressively reshape the law.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What can be made of <em>Bucklew</em>?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The other uncertainty looming over <em>Hamm</em> is the <em>Bucklew</em> decision, which didn’t so much overrule the Court’s last six decades of Eighth Amendment precedents as pretend that they didn’t exist.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Bucklew</em> involved a death row inmate who claimed that the Eighth Amendment would not allow him to be executed using Missouri’s lethal injection protocol — he said he had an unusual medical condition that would cause him to experience extraordinary pain before his death. So the question was whether the Constitution allows a state to execute an inmate in a manner that may amount to torture.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gorsuch’s opinion denying relief to this inmate reads like the Court’s “evolving standards of decency” framework never existed. This phrase appears nowhere in Gorsuch’s opinion, and the only citation to <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/356/86/"><em>Trop v. Dulles</em></a> (1958), the first Supreme Court case to use that phrase, appears in Justice Stephen Breyer’s dissent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rather than follow longstanding law, Gorsuch asked whether capital offenders could be subjected to similar pain “<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-8151_1qm2.pdf">at the time of the framing</a>.” This is the Eighth Amendment rule long favored by the Court’s rightmost flank, including in Justice Antonin Scalia’s dissenting opinion in <em>Atkins</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Scalia’s <em>Atkins</em> dissent, moreover, doesn’t simply disagree with the Court’s past decisions. It lays out many examples of how the law would change — and how much easier it would be to subject even minor criminal offenders to outlandish punishments — under a framework that looks to how things worked in the 1790s.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For starters, Scalia argues that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-8452.ZD1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only “severely or profoundly” intellectually disabled people</a> enjoy some protection against execution (he argues these individuals were often “committed to civil confinement or made wards of the State” rather than being criminally punished). One of the sources Scalia cites suggests that only people with an IQ of 25 or below enjoy any constitutional protection.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More significantly, Scalia also argues that the Eighth Amendment only forbids “always-and-everywhere ‘cruel’ punishments, such as the rack and the thumbscrew,” and that it does not prohibit the government from imposing excessive punishments for minor crimes. Under Scalia’s framework, if the death penalty can constitutionally be applied to murderers (and he believes it can) then it can also be applied to shoplifters. If a rapist can be sentenced to life in prison, so too can a jaywalker.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gorsuch’s <em>Bucklew</em> opinion elaborates on the sort of punishments that, under this <a href="https://www.vox.com/21497317/originalism-amy-coney-barrett-constitution-supreme-court">originalist</a> framework, are prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. He lists “<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-8151_1qm2.pdf">dragging the prisoner to the place of execution, disemboweling, quartering, public dissection, and burning alive</a>” as examples.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So there is a faction within the Supreme Court that would drastically shrink Americans’ constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment. This faction would allow more people to be executed. They would apparently eliminate any concern that punishments must be proportionate to the crime. And the kinds of punishments they do offer up as examples of impermissible sanctions are the kinds of things normally depicted in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFFvI0IQpt8">torture scenes from movies set in the Middle Ages</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Will five justices go there? It’s impossible to know. But that a total of five justices joined Gorsuch’s opinion in <em>Bucklew</em> suggests this faction could very well prevail — if and when the Court decides to take up <em>Hamm</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Supreme Court announced on Monday that<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/110424zor_8mjp.pdf"> it will hear a bizarre dispute</a> between two different federal courts about how to fix Louisiana’s racially gerrymandered congressional maps. Under existing law, one of these courts was clearly correct and the other clearly erred. But this Supreme Court is often hostile to voting rights plaintiffs, so there is some risk that the justices could change the law, permitting more racial gerrymanders.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Court will consider this dispute in a pair of consolidated cases, known as <em>Louisiana v. Callais</em> and <em>Robinson v. Callais</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In June 2022, Chief Judge Shelly Dick, an Obama appointee to a federal court in Louisiana, determined that state’s congressional maps were <a href="https://casetext.com/case/robinson-v-ardoin-5">an illegal racial gerrymander</a>. Under the invalid maps, Black voters made up a majority in only one of the state’s six congressional districts, despite the fact that Black people comprise about a third of Louisiana’s population.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dick ruled that “the appropriate remedy in this context is a remedial congressional redistricting plan that includes an additional majority-Black congressional district” — meaning that Louisiana must draw a new map that includes at least two Black-majority districts. Dick’s case is known as <a href="https://casetext.com/case/robinson-v-ardoin-5"><em>Robinson v. Ardoin</em></a>, and Dick is a judge of the US District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A ton of litigation followed Dick’s decision, including a brief trip to the Supreme Court, but Louisiana’s attempts to appeal Dick’s ruling ultimately failed. After the Fifth Circuit, the federal appeals court that oversees Louisiana, <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/11/13/23959252/supreme-court-fifth-circuit-louisiana-gerrymander-robinson-ardoin">rejected an attempt to toss out Dick’s ruling</a>, the state decided to give up the fight and comply with her order. The state legislature passed a new map that includes two Black-majority districts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But then an entirely different federal trial court, the Western District of Louisiana, decided to insert itself into this dispute. A new set of plaintiffs filed a suit in the Western District claiming that the new maps are unconstitutional. This case, which was known as <a href="https://casetext.com/case/callais-v-landry"><em>Callais v. Landry</em></a> while it was before the trial court, was assigned to a three-judge panel. Two of those judges — the ones appointed by former President Donald Trump — agreed with these new plaintiffs that the state’s new maps are unconstitutional.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Louisiana, in other words, is now subject to two competing court orders. The first, from Judge Dick, forbids it from using the old maps. The second, from the two Trump judges in the Western District, forbids the state from using the new maps it enacted to comply with Dick’s order.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Supreme Court ruled last May that the state <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23a994_7mip.pdf">could use its new maps during the 2024 election</a>, so that temporarily delayed resolution of this fight. But the long-term situation is obviously untenable. Louisiana needs to be able to draw congressional maps of some kind. And it needs to know what the rules are governing how it must draw those maps.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s not possible so long as two entirely separate courts, each of which apparently have wildly divergent views about how to resolve racial gerrymandering disputes, are allowed to issue competing court orders.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So what does the law actually say about racial gerrymandering in Louisiana?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Under existing law — including the Roberts Supreme Court’s recent decision in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-1086_1co6.pdf"><em>Allen v. Milligan</em></a> (2023) — Dick is clearly correct, and the two Trump judges are clearly wrong, about what should happen with Louisiana’s maps. Among other things, <em>Milligan</em> involved a nearly identical racial gerrymandering dispute from Alabama, and the Supreme Court ordered Alabama to draw a second Black congressional district in that case.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But this Supreme Court, with its 6-3 Republican supermajority, is frequently hostile to voting rights claims — and it is <a href="https://www.vox.com/22575435/voting-rights-supreme-court-john-roberts-shelby-county-constitution-brnovich-elena-kagan">especially hostile to claims brought under the Voting Rights Act</a>, the law that Dick relied on in her decision. So, while the right outcome in <em>Callais</em> is clear under existing law, there’s always a risk that this Court will abandon that law.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In <em>Milligan</em>, Alabama effectively asked the Supreme Court to abandon the legal framework governing racial gerrymandering cases brought under the Voting Rights Act, which the Court first announced in <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/478/30/"><em>Thornburg v. Gingles</em></a> (1986), and replace it with a new test that would <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/10/2/23377432/supreme-court-alabama-merrill-milligan-racial-gerrymandering-voting-rights-act">render the act’s safeguards against racial gerrymandering toothless</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a 5-4 decision, the Court rejected Alabama’s request, holding instead that a lower court decision striking down Alabama’s racially gerrymandered maps “faithfully applied our precedents.” The <em>Gingles</em> framework, which the Court reaffirmed in <em>Milligan</em>, is complex. But it primarily required the <em>Milligan</em> plaintiffs to show that it was possible to draw two geographically “compact” Black-majority districts in Alabama, and that Black and white voters in the state tend to vote in separate blocs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <em>Ardoin</em> case — the one heard by Judge Dick — is similar in all relevant respects to <em>Milligan</em>. Louisiana’s lawyers previously told the Supreme Court that <em>Ardoin</em> “<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23A281/283864/20230930114301429_SCOTUS%20Emergency%20Stay%20Application%20-%20Robinson%20v.%20Ardoin-corrected.pdf">presents the same question</a>” as the one decided in <em>Milligan</em>. In its ruling against Louisiana, the Fifth Circuit concluded that “most of the arguments the State made here <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/11/13/23959252/supreme-court-fifth-circuit-louisiana-gerrymander-robinson-ardoin">were addressed and rejected by the Supreme Court in <em>Milligan</em></a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So that really should have been the end of this dispute. Advocates who wanted the Court to abandon <em>Gingles</em> and legalize the kind of racial gerrymanders that were initially drawn by the Alabama and Louisiana state legislatures brought their case to the justices, and a majority of the justices rejected those arguments in 2023. That likely explains why, after Louisiana lost its appeal to the Fifth Circuit, it decided to give up this fight and voluntarily draw new maps.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So how on Earth did the Western District wind up getting involved?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To understand how a second federal court wound up invalidating the very maps that Louisiana enacted to comply with Judge Dick’s order, it’s important to understand a bit of tension that has long existed in federal voting rights law.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">14th  Amendment</a> generally prohibits race discrimination of all kinds. Accordingly, the Supreme Court has held that this amendment forbids states from <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1262_db8e.pdf">using “race as the predominant factor in drawing district lines unless it has a compelling reason.”</a> At the same time, the Voting Rights Act sometimes requires states to draw a minimal number of legislative districts where a racial minority group is in the majority. This principle has been reaffirmed in many cases, including <em>Gingles</em> and <em>Milligan</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tension arises between these two principles because, if a state knows that it must draw at least two congressional districts with a Black majority, it can’t really accomplish that task without taking account of race. To resolve this tension, the Court held in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1262_db8e.pdf"><em>Cooper v. Harris</em></a> (2017) that a state may engage in “race-based districting” when it has “a strong basis in evidence” for concluding that it must do so to comply with the Voting Rights Act.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Under <em>Cooper</em>, a VRA-compliant map is lawful if the state “had ‘good reasons’ to think that it would transgress the Act if it did not draw race-based district lines.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, under <em>Cooper</em>, the Western District had no business striking down Louisiana’s new map. Louisiana clearly had “good reasons” to think that it must draw a new map with two Black-majority districts because a federal court ordered it to draw a new map with two Black-majority districts, and the state’s attempts to appeal that decision were unsuccessful.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To avoid this conclusion, the two Trump judges responsible for the <em>Callais</em> decision largely rely on a line in <em>Milligan</em> which states that the Voting Rights Act “never require[s] adoption of districts that violate traditional redistricting principles.” They argue that the new maps, which were also drawn to protect several Republican incumbents, violate the traditional principle that legislative districts should be compact.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd6PjuzUmbnY1iEHEpylrgn4eDalLY8ml3UyhI_oWbwfSyGtyotuE-3Ufu7VZ3w3jh8rMyR7utv5TPXJ6iPCg8SdA8pb-7wcO728gYHComcutwyMCdex_AEyHqF4j-jr-dAV9qT0N02BO8yRUfkeWVrt6ld?key=y4MweDqvOApL1yFN24Pi0ls2" alt="" /></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But that’s a pretty strained reading of <em>Milligan</em>. While the Supreme Court did hold that the VRA doesn’t <em>require</em> states to draw ugly districts, it also said in the very same paragraph that redistricting “is primarily the duty and responsibility of the States, not the federal courts.” So <em>Millligan </em>does not <em>forbid</em> states from drawing ugly, misshapen districts so long as those districts otherwise comply with the Voting Rights Act.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s worth noting that <em>Callais</em> falls within the Supreme Court’s mandatory jurisdiction, meaning that the justices are required to hear this case, or at least to issue an order resolving it. So the mere fact that the justices will hear what should be a very easy voting rights case does not mean that they intend to upend decades worth of law.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, while the legal principles that should govern in <em>Callais</em> are crystal clear, it is always worrisome whenever this unpredictable Court takes up a Voting Rights Act case of any kind. In <em>Milligan</em>, the Court <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/24153784/supreme-court-louisiana-gerrymander-black-voters-robinson-ardoin-callais-landry">surprised most Supreme Court-watchers</a> when it voted to leave longstanding safeguards against racial gerrymandering in place. We’ll find out soon if all five justices in the <em>Milligan</em> majority actually meant what they said in that case.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Your Mileage May Vary is an advice column offering you a new framework for thinking through your ethical dilemmas and philosophical questions. This unconventional&nbsp;column is based on value pluralism — the idea that each of us has multiple values that are equally valid but that often conflict with each other.</em>&nbsp;<em>Here is a Vox reader’s question, condensed and edited for clarity.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I’m at an age where I feel like I need to decide whether I want to have kids, but I’m very ambivalent about it and don’t know how to know whether I want them. I don’t dream of parenthood or filling my days with caregiving for a young child. But, does anyone?! That doesn’t seem like a good way to decide whether I truly want to be a parent. But then what is? The main place my mind goes is that I fear my life would be sad and depressing when my partner and I are 70 and childless. I like the thought of having well-adjusted adult children to spend time with when I’m old. That seems like a misguided and selfish reason to have kids.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>A better reason might be that I think my partner and I have good values, and I’d</strong><strong> like to bring more people into the world who have those values, but that also seems selfish because there’s no guarantee that a child will embrace your values, and your duty as a parent is to let them flourish as whoever they want to be. I worry that I would be the kind of parent who struggles to support my kid if they rebel against everything I believe in. But I also feel like you just can’t know what you would be like in that situation until you’re in it. How do you decide that such a life-altering decision is right for you, let alone its ethical implications for a person who doesn’t exist yet?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dear Fencesitter,</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ah, parenthood ambivalence. <a href="https://www.vox.com/features/23979357/millennials-motherhood-dread-parenting-birthrate-women-policy">So many</a> of us <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fencesitter/">can relate</a>. And, like you, so many of us try to answer the question “Do I want to have kids?” by looking inward for the answer. We introspect, we ruminate, we dig through childhood traumas. We consider what makes us happy now in hopes of predicting whether kids would make us happier or more miserable later. We assume the answer is there within us, a buried treasure waiting to be unearthed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s understandable: Most advice for people considering parenthood encourages us to do just that. Countless <a href="https://www.vox.com/first-person/22370250/should-i-have-kids-a-baby-decide-start-family-parenthood-kids-childfree">articles</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22399882/climate-change-kids-children-overpopulation">books</a>, and yes, <a href="https://therumpus.net/2011/04/21/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-71-the-ghost-ship-that-didnt-carry-us/">advice columns</a> are premised on the idea that the answer exists as a stable fact within us. So is the parenthood ambivalence coach Ann Davidman’s <a href="https://www.motherhoodisitforme.com/motherhoodclaritycourse">online class</a>, the “Motherhood Clarity™ Course” which opens with a mantra: “The answers will come because they never left … It’s all within me.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Have a question you want me to answer in the next Your Mileage May Vary column?</strong> </h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:sigal.samuel@vox.com">sigal.samuel@vox.com</a> or <a href="https://forms.gle/wTU5egBukdhyKeL56">fill out this anonymous form</a>!

</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there are a few problems with that approach. For one, you could spend your entire adult life auditing your soul for the answer and still end up looking like the shrug emoji. That’s because introspection is an unbounded search process: You’ve got no way to know when you’ve searched enough.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another problem is that this approach centers you and your desires too much. As you pointed out, bringing a kid into the world can’t only be about its costs and benefits for you.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, you’re just not well-positioned to predict whether kids will make you happier or more miserable! <a href="https://philosophybreak.com/articles/laurie-ann-paul-on-how-to-approach-transformative-decisions/">As the philosopher L.A. Paul notes</a>, you can’t quite know what it’ll be like to have a kid until you have one, and besides, the “you” might become transformed in the process, so that the things that make you happy now are not the same as the things that will make you happy as a parent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, what I suggest is a radically different approach: If you want to arrive at a decision, you have to go beyond your own interiority. You have to turn your gaze outward and ask yourself: What is it that you find awesome, thrilling, and intrinsically valuable about being in the world?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’m not asking because I think the key is deciding which values you want to transmit to your kid. Like you said, there’s no guarantee that your kid will embrace your values. Instead, I’m asking because this is the basis on which you can make a choice —&nbsp;not “find the answer” but make a choice —&nbsp;about whether to have kids.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Up until now, you’ve been thinking of the kids question as an epistemic one — you say you “don’t know how to know” — but I would think of it as an existential one instead. The existentialist philosophers argued that <a href="https://philosophybreak.com/articles/existence-precedes-essence-what-sartre-really-meant/">life doesn’t come with predefined meaning or fixed answers</a>. Instead, each human has to choose how to create their own meaning. As the Spanish existentialist Jose Ortega y Gasset put it, the central task of being human is “autofabrication,” which literally means self-making. You come up with your own answer, and in so doing, you make yourself. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A decade ago, just for fun, my friend Emily sat me down in a park and had me do an exercise that would turn out to be extremely impactful: It was, believe it or not, an online quiz. It listed dozens and dozens of different values —&nbsp;friendship, creativity, growth, and so on —&nbsp;and instructed me to select my top 10. Then it made me narrow it down to my top five. I found that brutally hard, but it was revealing. My number one value turned out to be what the quiz called, somewhat idiosyncratically, “delight of being, joy.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I return to that again and again (my mind preserves the punctuation, so I regularly find myself talking to people about “delight-of-being-comma-joy!”) when I have to make tough decisions. It captures a core fact about me: I love being alive in this world! Whenever I snorkel with impossibly colorful fish, or experience deep connection with another human being, or stare up at all the galaxies we’ve barely begun to understand, I feel so grateful that I get to participate in the grand mystery of being.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And that’s what made me decide I want to be a mom one day. Choosing to have a child feels like one of the biggest ways I can say YES to life, at a time when many <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/2/13/21132013/climate-change-children-kids-anti-natalism">doubt the worthiness of perpetuating human life</a> on this planet. It’s a way to affirm that being alive in this world is a gift, one I want to pass along to others.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So allow me to be your Emily. Let me present you with <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/reflection/reflectors-toolkit/self-awareness/values">an inventory of values</a> (one of many similar inventories available online) and urge you to select your top five. Then ask yourself: Would having a kid be a good way to enact my values&nbsp;—&nbsp;or is there another way to enact my values that feels more compelling to me? Which path is the best fit for you personally, given your specific talents and your physical and psychological needs?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This depends a lot on the individual. Imagine three women who all rank “personal growth” as their top value. They might still arrive at totally different conclusions about kids. For one woman, that value may feel like a great reason to have a kid, because she believes childrearing will help her grow as a person and that she’ll get to guide a new person in their development. The second woman might say her primary mode of growth is art-making, so she wants to focus on that while being an active auntie to her friends’ kids on the side. A third woman might feel that, for her, the most promising path is to become a nun. All three are completely valid!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A lot of people struggling with parenthood ambivalence say they’re scared that if they don’t have a kid, they’ll miss out on something sui generis —&nbsp;a completely unique experience, a sort of love to which nothing else compares. It sounds like this FOMO is playing a role for you, too; you mentioned that you fear your life would be sad and depressing when you and your partner are 70 and childless.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there are plenty of parents who will tell you that, while they adore their kids, the <a href="https://x.com/KelseyTuoc/status/1794865681051312460">kid-parent relationship is not magically more meaningful</a> than anything else in their life. In the excellent new book <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250276131/whatarechildrenfor"><em>What Are Children For?</em></a> by Anastasia Berg and Rachel Wiseman, the former writes:&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">While the relationship between a parent and child is doubtless unique, what if I told you that, phenomenologically speaking, it is not really grand and tremendous? That it’s not even particularly extraordinary? … To love your child isn’t like nothing you’ve ever known. It isn’t unimaginable. If you have known love, you have also known it, or something like it … What is so special about this love isn’t how exotic, mysterious, or astounding it is but how simple and familiar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, if you just like the thought of having children because you want lovely people to spend time with when you’re old, try first experimenting with other ways to get that same need met. You might find that it’s not something that only a child can provide. As the author (and my friend) <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24105295/platonic-partnership-friendship-other-significant-others-rhaina-cohen">Rhaina Cohen documents</a> beautifully in <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250333025/theothersignificantothers"><em>The Other Significant Others</em></a>, some people find that deep friendships meet their need for connection perfectly well, with no child-shaped hole or partner-shaped hole left over.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But even if you believe having a child is a sui generis experience, the point I would make is: Other things are too! An artist might tell you there’s nothing that compares to the creative thrill of painting. Someone involved in political work may tell you there’s nothing quite like the feeling of fighting for justice and winning. Lots of things in the world are unique and incommensurably good.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So don’t be pushed around by societal narratives of what the ultimate good looks like. Let your choice flow from your own sense of what’s most valuable about human life. Whereas what makes you feel happy or miserable can change a lot over time, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167216639245?journalCode=pspc">core values are relatively stable</a>, so they form a more enduring basis for making major decisions. Yes, it’s conceivable that even those values might shift a little over the decades, but making a choice that flows from your values means you will at least be confident that you had a very solid reason for doing what you did —&nbsp;no matter how you end up feeling about it in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And as for the future? You really can’t control it. So, your goal is not to control every possible outcome. Your goal is to live in line with your values.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Bonus: What I’m reading</h2>

<ul>
<li>Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, often called the “father of existentialism,” proposed the idea that <a href="https://philosophybreak.com/articles/kierkegaard-life-can-only-be-understood-backwards-but-must-be-lived-forwards/">life can only be understood backward</a>, but it must be lived forward. This week’s question prompted me to revisit that idea.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>As I wrote this column, I went back and reread a great <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/01/21/the-art-of-decision-making">New Yorker article by Joshua Rothman</a> about how we make major decisions. It discusses philosopher Agnes Callard’s idea that “we ‘aspire’ to self-transformation by trying on the values that we hope one day to possess.” In other words, you don’t decide you want to be a parent — you decide you want to be the sort of person who’d want to be a parent, and lean into that. I found the idea interesting but too complicated by half: Why would I ground this decision in values I hope to one day possess instead of grounding it in the values I already hold dear?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Lots of people bring up climate change as a reason not to have kids. I think that’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22399882/climate-change-kids-children-overpopulation">misguided</a>. Having a kid is one of the things that <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/2/13/21132013/climate-change-children-kids-anti-natalism">can push you to take heroic action</a> on climate change — so I was interested in <a href="https://www.noemamag.com/its-time-to-give-up-hope-for-a-better-climate-get-heroic/">this new piece in Noema Magazine</a>, which argues that we need to evoke heroism, not hope, with regard to the climate — and finds a prime example of that in … JRR Tolkien.  </li>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you were a Roman citizen around 200 BCE, you might have assumed that Rome was going to last forever.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the time, Rome was the greatest republic in human history and its institutions had survived several invasions and all kinds of disasters. But Rome’s foundations started to weaken less than a century later, and by 27 BCE, the republic had collapsed. It then transformed into an empire, and even though the Roman state persisted, it was no longer a representative democracy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The fall of the Roman Republic is both complicated and straightforward: The state became too big and chaotic; the influence of money and private interests corrupted public institutions; and social and economic inequalities became so stark that citizens lost faith in the system altogether and gradually fell into the arms of tyrants and demagogues.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of that sounds very familiar, doesn’t it?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Edward Watts is a historian at the University of California San Diego and the author of two books on ancient Rome. One, from 2018, is called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mortal-Republic-Rome-Fell-Tyranny/dp/0465093817"><em>Mortal Republic: How Rome Fell Into Tyranny</em></a>, and the other, from 2021, is <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-eternal-decline-and-fall-of-rome-9780190076719?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;"><em>The Eternal Decline and Fall of Rome</em></a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Mortal Republic</em> is probably the best thing I’ve read on Rome’s history, both because it lays out what went wrong and why, and because it attempts to explain how the lessons of its decline might help save fledgling republics like the United States.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I invited Watts on <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> to talk about those lessons and why he thinks the American republic is in danger of going the way of ancient Rome. As always, there’s much more in the full podcast, so listen and follow <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/id1081584611">Apple Podcasts</a>,<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6NOJ6IkTb2GWMj1RpmtnxP"> Spotify</a>,<a href="https://www.pandora.com/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/PC:30793?source=stitcher-sunset"> Pandora</a>, or wherever you find podcasts.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You told me several years ago that you thought America might be in the beginning stages of a similar decline as Rome. Where do you think we are in that process today?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Edward Watts</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I was much more optimistic in 2018 than I am now. What I saw in 2018 was a set of imbalances. I saw a primal scream by the American electorate that said, “We do not like what we&#8217;ve got.” And I saw hints that we might have violence injected into our political life. I had no idea that within two years that violence would take the form that it did and it would come so close to actually destroying the political system.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I was talking to a friend from Italy a couple of weeks ago about January 6, and he was like, &#8220;Oh, yeah, it&#8217;s a blip.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Well, let&#8217;s game this out. They came very close to actually getting in there when the representatives were present in the chamber, it was something like 15 minutes between when the representatives left and when the rioters got in. What would happen if they actually had gotten in and seized some representatives or disrupted the vote?&#8221; And my friend said, &#8220;Well, they would call in the army.&#8221; Who would call in the army? Who is actually legitimately in charge at that point? Who does the army answer to?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This was the situation Rome found itself in. Once you break a system, there are no rules governing what happens and all of the institutions that depend on that system free-float. And I think we don&#8217;t appreciate how close we came to a moment where that was our government, or our lack of government. And in Rome that happened and it was profoundly devastating, hundreds of thousands of people died because of that. It&#8217;s not something that we should play with.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Both the Roman political system and our own system were designed to be slow-moving with the idea that change should happen ploddingly and deliberately. Do you think, in retrospect, that trade-off wasn&#8217;t worth it for Rome? That it was too hard and too convoluted and therefore incapable of being responsive enough to what was happening?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Edward Watts</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is where the 2,000-year lifespan of the Roman state is so important. Over and over in Roman history, there are these moments where people step back and say, “What we have is broken.” But because you have leaders and because you have a tradition of adapting, most of the time Rome doesn&#8217;t blow up all of these traditions and systems it inherited. It tries to find ways to amend them and to adapt them and to create new ways to make them more responsive to the needs of its citizens.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The empire was built initially as a kind of Italian enterprise to extract stuff from all of these other places that it controlled. But by the early part of the third century [CE], every single free person in the Roman Empire was a citizen of the Roman state. And so this model of Italians extracting things from colonial subjects was gone. You couldn&#8217;t run an empire that way anymore because you have 6 million Italians and 60 million other Roman citizens. And so the third century was a process of trying to figure out how you remake a society that was originally devoted to sending resources into Italy and make it responsive to the needs of all of those people everywhere.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Would you say that adaptability, that expansion of the circle of citizenship, was the key to Rome&#8217;s survival for that long?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Edward Watts</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yeah, and I think that&#8217;s a lesson we should take away from Rome. What Rome was able to do from its very earliest point, from the point when there were Roman kings, was to identify who could contribute to its society and find ways to empower people who were initially [on the] outside.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So some of the first Roman kings actually weren&#8217;t Roman. They were chosen because they were the best people for the job. The third-to-last king, Tarquinius Priscus, wasn&#8217;t even born in Rome. He actually grew up in a city in Etruria (present-day central Italy) and moved to Rome because it was a place where you were allowed to rise as high as your talents would permit. This society wouldn&#8217;t block you because you weren&#8217;t of the right background.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This was deeply ingrained in what Roman society was, and I think that&#8217;s a lesson for us. You have to remain grounded in the things that make your country function, but you have to also acknowledge that there are people who may not have been born in a position of authority who have something to contribute. And if you&#8217;re going to make your society function in the long term, you have to find a way to bring them in, not just because it&#8217;s fair, but because they make your country better.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s interesting about Rome is that they experienced something like 150 years of political dysfunction and a brutal civil war before they finally scrapped the republic for an empire. That’s a long period of steady decline. Do you believe America has that much time to get its political affairs in order as a country?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Edward Watts</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Just in the last four years, we&#8217;ve had people try to storm Congress and two <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360489/trump-shot-thomas-matthew-crooks-secret-service-butler-rally">assassination attempts</a>. It took Rome a really long time to get to the point where they were willing to do that. And the fact that we&#8217;re barely talking about those assassination attempts is stunning.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Rome, there was a sort of creative tension that usually functioned well, but sometimes didn’t, between individuals who wanted to push change and systems that were designed to resist rapid change. In 27 BCE, Augustus figures out how to create a regime where he is the dominant figure for the rest of his life, but there are a couple of moments before that where individuals make choices that could have gone differently, but they have enough faith in the integrity of the system, and they have enough trust in the aesthetics of that system, that they do not go that far.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The moment that jumps out to me immediately is Sulla, who was a dictator. He won a civil war, he murders Roman citizens in a fashion that is totally contrary to what a Roman state is supposed to do, or what any state is supposed to do.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Sulla fundamentally believed that a republic is important. He seized power and he occupied a position of authority as an autocrat for a couple of years and then gave the republic back because he believed that was important to do. He did not need to do that.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And I think that&#8217;s a moment where we should reflect on whether some of the people who could find themselves in a position similar to Sulla in the United States would make that same choice. Would they walk away after changing whatever they wanted to change? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You once told me that people like Trump pop up in an old republic every generation or so, when things reach a certain point, and either the system reboots and gets back on the tracks or it goes the other way. I’m not really asking you to weigh in on the politics here, but I am asking you, as a historian, what you make of Trump as a symptom of deeper problems in the country.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Edward Watts</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is where the tension between the system and the individual becomes so important because there are moments where republican systems are not working and an individual does seize the momentum and seize the opportunity to potentially refashion them in whatever way that person wants. They could do like Sulla or Caesar. Sulla seizes the republic, he kills a lot of people, but he turns it back, he restructures it. He believes in the republic.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Caesar also takes over the republic, and what he wants to do is create a republic that is truly a republic. Caesar, I think, deeply believed that there are certain aspects of the republican structure and of this idea of a citizen-held political community that he did not want to transgress, even if it would cost him his life. It was much more important to him to have a republic than it was to make himself safe. He made that choice knowing full well that it was a choice.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What I find alarming about Trump is I do not believe he cares whether this country is a republic or not. And so if he takes power and he has the ability to remake the state, he&#8217;s not going to remake it as a republic. He&#8217;ll remake it as whatever he decides he wants it to be, but he has no deep commitment to the idea of the republic, and that&#8217;s different from every Roman who takes power.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of the many lessons we might draw from Rome’s collapse, what do you think is really worth reflecting on in this political moment?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Edward Watts</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think the biggest point — and I&#8217;m afraid the ship has already sailed — is that violence should never be a part of politics. Once it&#8217;s there, it is very hard to make it go away without even more violence that ultimately neutralizes the people willing to do it. Violence has no part in a representative political system.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But I think the other thing that is really important for us to understand is that you cannot wait or hope that a single individual is going to fix the problems in a society or fix the problems in a political system. If you have a political system that has functioned reasonably well and has been adaptable over the course of decades or centuries, that&#8217;s a very valuable thing. It creates rules, it creates assumptions, it creates a state of play where everybody more or less knows when you do X, this is how the system is going to respond. If you destroy that, you have nothing. And if you destroy that because of an individual, you just have that individual.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Very occasionally, you will get an individual who creates something that maybe isn&#8217;t even better but is at least something. Most of the time the person who destroys does not have the capacity to create. And so you&#8217;re going to replace something that has governed just about every aspect of your civic and personal lives for your entire existence, and probably, in the United States, for the existence of 10 generations of your ancestors potentially. If you throw that away for an individual, you&#8217;re making a really significant bet. And if that individual is somebody that you don&#8217;t 100 percent trust is capable of creating something different, you are throwing away an incredibly valuable thing for nothing. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On an unseasonably warm October afternoon, I did something I’ve done just about every fall since 2009: I made my way to Howard University’s (HU) campus to celebrate homecoming. It’s an event that’s reached almost hagiographic status: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLCOIcb41Y">name-checked</a> in rap songs and even <a href="https://thehilltoponline.com/2024/10/28/supermodel-anok-yai-returns-to-the-yard-for-howard-homecoming/">launching modeling careers</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The energy in October at my alma mater is always frenetic: You see students and alumni dressed their best, babies in strollers on the yard wearing HU onesies, and friends who have stayed connected across decades gathering once more at what’s <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-untold-story-of-how-howard-university-came-to-be-known-as-the-mecca-212245">lovingly referred to as the Mecca</a>. This year, the excitement in the air was even more palpable. For lack of better phrasing, the vibe was different. On one hand, the obvious culprit was that the university was celebrating its 100th homecoming. On the other hand, that difference may have something to do with the fact that the school’s most famous alumna (at least right now) could soon become arguably the most powerful person in the world.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vice President Kamala Harris wasn’t on campus — she has spent part of her fall at the homecomings of  historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in swing states and not bright blue DC — but you wouldn’t know that looking around. Howard does not have a political affiliation, but vendors gathered outside the entrance to the football game hawking bucket hats with Harris’s name on them; her sorority sisters wore T-shirts with her face embroidered in pink and green; people fanned themselves with Harris/Walz fans while R&amp;B singers entertained the crowd; and children in HU gear played in a bouncy house as their parents looked on. Despite its nonpartisan stance, the university is where Harris plans to be the night of the election, in a way creating a homecoming all her own.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In short, Howard is not a place with large numbers of Donald Trump supporters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Black voters are not a monolith, and the student body at Howard — one of the nation’s most prestigious universities —&nbsp;is not a representative sample of all Black voters. Indeed, some polls suggest that Black voters may be supporting Trump in higher numbers than in either of his previous two runs —&nbsp;a shift that some observers believe will be large enough to mark a “<a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/373535/3-theories-gop-donald-trump-nonwhite-voters-hispanic-black-latino-asian">racial realignment</a>” in American politics.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, the polls paint a murky picture. A recent NAACP survey found <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/10/28/2024-elections-live-coverage-updates-analysis/aarp-survey-00185978">Black men were backing off their support for Trump</a> and coming toward Harris in the final stretch before the election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some experts are skeptical that, after the election, the “racial realignment” will materialize. Enter Andra Gillespie, a political scientist and associate professor at Emory University who specializes in Black political participation.&nbsp;“The story of the cycle may very well be that people are overhyping the extent of Black defections away from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party,” she says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She points her finger at polling — or rather, the lack thereof — for Black voters specifically. While there has been plenty of <a href="https://youtu.be/In9Pqm9YlIo?si=VC53K-uLienjIi8x">polling with enough respondents</a> to get a clear picture of the electorate, Gillespie argues that the numbers of Black voters within those samples don’t provide a clear enough picture of Black voters. I spoke with Gillespie in October about the number of votes Trump may get from Black voters, and how even getting just 80 percent of the Black vote worries Democrats. We also talked about the roles education and age play within this segment of the electorate, and whether we’re seeing shifts based on those factors. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Below is an excerpt of our conversation, edited for length and clarity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>There&#8217;s been a lot of talk about the Harris campaign’s struggles with Black voters lately. Can you lay out what that struggle looks like? Are we talking about Black people leaving the Democratic Party en masse?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No. The first problem has been making a lot of conjectures based on sample sizes that have huge margins of error. So you&#8217;re looking at very noisy data. This started when Joe Biden was still the Democratic nominee for president. We forget that the number that comes out in surveys is the midpoint of a range of multiples. That&#8217;s why surveys are always plus or minus.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There was some evidence of [Black support] softening. We don&#8217;t know — because [Biden] dropped out of the race — whether or not people would have solidified their support for Donald Trump. Joe Biden was likely going to perform somewhere in the neighborhood of what he had done before and the numbers that you were getting, especially in the winter and early spring were suggesting that Donald Trump could get 30 percent of the African American vote. If your margin of error is minus 10, that means that that number could, in real life, be as low as 20 percent, which would suggest a gain.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I&#8217;m thinking back to the Obama years, and 20 percent would be a lot.</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Twenty percent would be a lot since nobody&#8217;s come close or even in the high teens since Gerald Ford and Richard Nixon. So yeah, it would be unprecedented. But that&#8217;s what 100 people were saying or 150 people, or sometimes 200 people were saying in a survey in March or in February.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I want to be very clear: Donald Trump could actually improve his share of African American voters. I&#8217;m not saying that that&#8217;s impossible. But what&#8217;s a more likely scenario is that he makes a marginal gain.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Looking at the numbers from the New York Times/Siena College poll that came out [recently], Trump&#8217;s numbers are in what I would call the normal range for a Republican candidate. What everybody was concerned about was the fact that Kamala Harris is pulling in below 80 percent on that poll. The upper bound of the margin of error would put that number into the low 80s, which would still be underperforming. But she still has three weeks from an election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Eighty percent of any demographic sounds like a lot of voters, but it&#8217;s framed as a problem for the Harris campaign.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s a problem for the campaign because Black people make up the base of the Democratic Party; it becomes a problem when she&#8217;s reliant on them turning out voting almost unanimously for her and in high numbers and in key battleground states.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a state like Georgia, for instance, most white people are Republicans. Black people make up more than half of the Democratic Party in the state of Georgia. If they have anemic turnout or start to vote for the Republican or other candidates in the race, there just aren&#8217;t many other votes that she can pick up. For a state like Georgia to be competitive, you&#8217;ve got to perform at historical averages, which means she needs to be doing 90 percent or better. And she needs Black turnout to be proportional to their actual numbers in the electorate: 30 percent of voters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You also have to care about it in the Blue Wall states, because even though Black people don&#8217;t make up as large a proportion of the population when you&#8217;re talking about margins, that could easily be 10,000, 20,000, or 50,000 votes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I want to get into one of the narratives we&#8217;ve seen this election cycle, and that&#8217;s this flip in the parties when it comes to education. One of the narratives that we see emerging is that&nbsp;Democrats are </strong><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-a-college-degree-is-one-of-the-best-predictors-of-which-candidate-voters-support"><strong>now the party</strong></a><strong> of those </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/30/opinion/gender-education-gap.html"><strong>with college degrees</strong></a><strong> — your lawyers, your doctors; and Republicans are more the party of the working class — your blue-collar workers, maybe without a college degree. How do you see that playing out among Black voters?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think one thing that should be noted is 2016 was the year that pundits discovered that working-class white voters were Republican. That trend actually started a long time ago. I&#8217;ve seen graphs that chart this back to the mid-1970s, where you can see a decline in the number of non-college-educated white voters who are voting Democratic in elections. People just discovered it because Donald Trump ran on a populist platform, but he wasn&#8217;t doing anything revolutionary or new there at all.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So yes, we now accept that education correlates with party identification, and voting behavior with college-educated voters being more likely to vote Democratic these days. If you go back and you look at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/13/us/elections/times-siena-poll-black-likely-electorate.html">that New York Times/Siena College poll</a>, and you look at the breakdown in terms of support for Harris and Trump based on college education, you don&#8217;t see much of a difference in terms of support among Black voters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are more conservative Black people who are still identifying as Democrats than Republicans, and the reason why is because of race. People who have a strong racial identity, people who perceive that the Democratic Party is the better party to handle issues related to race and civil rights. My friend, Tasha Philpot at the University of Texas, has noted that Black people aren&#8217;t necessarily putting the same weight or emphasis on social conservatism in the same way that white people might.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>If education is not this predictor for who Black people will vote for, is it a predictor of if they will vote or not?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If we&#8217;re looking at support for Harris, there’s only a percentage point difference [between Black voters with and without a bachelor’s degree]. I see differences in age — that&#8217;s actually not that unusual.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We expect that younger people have weaker partisan attachments because they&#8217;re new to the electoral process. Older age cohorts, the oldest Black Americans uniformly, have made up their minds. I think part of the push on HBCU campuses is to get a group of young Black voters who are probably the most likely to show up because they&#8217;re the most resourced to be convinced to support Kamala Harris and to convince their friends to do that as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The idea that they&#8217;re not strong Democrats could be a harbinger of things to come, but it&#8217;s going to take me 20 years to figure out what these folks are doing when they&#8217;re in their late 30s before I would be willing to say, “We&#8217;re witnessing a realignment of Black voters away from the party.” But I think that there&#8217;s still the question of who’s actually going to show up.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I think it&#8217;s interesting because you mentioned that the Harris campaign is on this HBCU tour. They’re going to your Spelmans, your Morehouses, to talk to these young voters who are most likely to be resourced and most likely to show up to the polls. Every election year we hear the phrase “Black people are not a monolith” and that&#8217;s always been true. But I think of W.E.B. DuBois and this idea of the </strong><a href="https://teachingamericanhistory.org/document/the-talented-tenth/"><strong>Talented Tenth</strong></a><strong> – that one of the jobs of the Black elite is to achieve racial progress. But that leaves out the other 90 percent of Black people. How have we seen this dynamic between education, class, and politics play out through the years?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think it’s important to keep in mind <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-fallacy-of-the-talent_b_613510">DuBois repudiated the idea of the Talented Tenth</a>. Part of the reason why college students in general are more resourced is, by being in college, they are picking up skills that are actually going to help them navigate civics.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As they get older, their education is going to prepare them for jobs that might actually give them more flexibility to be able to vote easier than others who might have shift work where their schedule is predetermined for them. All of those things accumulate and matter in terms of predicting a person&#8217;s likelihood of turning out to vote.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Also, colleges end up reducing the costs of voter registration and voting. If you are on a college campus where your office of student life has put out voter registration materials so that all you have to do is basically pick one up as you&#8217;re walking out of a cafeteria, that&#8217;s a lot easier than somebody who is living in an apartment downtown who then has to go to a county board of elections.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Do we know why Trump has been able to peel away some of these Black voters? What are the factors there?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I am skeptical of how effective he has actually been, and we&#8217;ll see how those numbers play out on Election Day. I would not be surprised at a marginal gain of a percentage point or two, but he was never getting the 30 percent that he claimed to get. If I think about those marginal gains, there have been outreach efforts to African American men the Republican Party has been engaged in for a long period of time that actually predates Donald Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The message that Trump has used to try to reach out — which has usually been worded in a really offensive way — actually harkens back to a strategy that Richard Nixon used to try to reach out to Black voters. Keep in mind, Richard Nixon didn&#8217;t do that badly, relatively speaking, among Black voters, despite the Southern Strategy, and it was because he used this strategy called Black Capitalism. He wanted to appeal to Black voters by talking about how Republican policies were more conducive to entrepreneurship and economic prosperity. And when you heard Donald Trump four years ago, trying to talk about his Platinum Plan — which, arguably, he may have <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/ice-cube-donald-trump-platinum-plan-1075709/">ripped off from Ice Cube</a> — that&#8217;s a play toward Black capitalism.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">[Trump] in particular has benefited from having been in the public eye, having been sort of like the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/11/06/trumps-rap-sheet/">name-check for financial success</a>. It&#8217;s not surprising that there&#8217;s some people who would ascribe very positive traits to him and to his presidency.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>How do you see all of this playing out and evolving beyond 2024? What will you be looking out for in the years to come when it comes to the Black electorate?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think that we are still kind of in a post-1964 paradigm, where Black people are going to be overwhelmingly Democratic in their voting orientation. I expect that the ratio is going to still be somewhere in the neighborhood of about nine to one in favor of Democrats, give or take a couple of points.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Let&#8217;s say that Republicans incrementally gain two to three percentage points per election cycle among Black voters. Then 20 years from now I might say, “Black people have been engaging in a secular realignment away from the Democratic Party and what we see is Republicans becoming more competitive over time.” If that happens and we start to point to the trend line, then we are going to start to go back to 2020 and 2024 and see that as the beginning of the shift. But if we are in the beginning of the shift — I don&#8217;t know that yet. It&#8217;s way too early for me to say that. I think the thing that will make it change is not Donald Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">CALI, Colombia — In the face of extreme and accelerating <a href="https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/2023/12/14/23990382/extinction-capital-hawaii-endangered-species-act">wildlife declines</a>, government officials from nearly every country have agreed<strong> </strong>to <a href="https://www.cbd.int/doc/c/bd4f/2861/9dce4f46d43a637231a442e0/cop-16-l-32-rev1-en.pdf" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cbd.int/doc/c/bd4f/2861/9dce4f46d43a637231a442e0/cop-16-l-32-rev1-en.pdf">a groundbreaking new deal</a> meant to funnel more money and other resources into conservation, especially in poor regions of the world.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If it works, the deal — finalized Saturday morning at a<strong> </strong>United Nations biodiversity meeting known as COP16 — could raise hundreds of millions of dollars, or perhaps more than $1 billion, per year, to protect the environment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The deal is designed to draw money from a new and somewhat unusual source: companies that create and sell products, such as drugs and cosmetics, using the DNA of wild organisms. Today a large number of databases store this sort of genetic data —&nbsp;extracted from plants, animals, and microbes&nbsp;all over the world — and make it available for anyone to use, including companies. Corporations in a range of industries use this genetic data, known as digital sequence information (DSI), to find and create commercial products. Moderna, for example, used <a href="https://www.dsiscientificnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSI-covid-vaccines-factsheet.pdf">hundreds of genetic sequences</a> from different respiratory viruses to swiftly produce its Covid-19 vaccine. Moderna has generated more than <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/moderna-beats-covid-vaccine-sales-expectations-deferred-revenue-rolls-2023-05-04/">$30 billion</a> in sales from the vaccine.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It is absolutely, 100 percent clear that companies benefit from biodiversity,” Amber Scholz, a scientist at Leibniz Institute DSMZ, a German research organization, told Vox.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GettyImages-1404559552.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.741428812701,100,78.517142374599" alt="Yellow oblong blobs float blobbily" title="Yellow oblong blobs float blobbily" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Clostridium botulinum, a bacterium that secretes toxins used to produce Botox. | Cavallini James/BSIP/Universal Images Group via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Cavallini James/BSIP/Universal Images Group via Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">This new plan is meant to share some of those benefits, including profits, with nature. It states that large companies and other organizations in sectors that rely on DNA sequences — such as pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and food supplements — should put a portion of their<strong> </strong>profits or revenue<strong> </strong>into a fund called the Cali fund. According to the plan, that portion is either <a href="https://www.cbd.int/doc/c/bd4f/2861/9dce4f46d43a637231a442e0/cop-16-l-32-rev1-en.pdf" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cbd.int/doc/c/bd4f/2861/9dce4f46d43a637231a442e0/cop-16-l-32-rev1-en.pdf">1 percent of profit or 0.1 percent of revenue, </a>though it leaves some wiggle room and remains open to review. This approach draws heavily from research by the London School of Economics.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The new Cali fund,<strong> </strong>operated by the UN, will go toward conserving biodiversity —&nbsp;the plants and animals from which all that genetic information stems.&nbsp;It will dish out the money to countries based on things like how much wildlife they have and how much genetic data they are producing. At least half of the money is meant to support Indigenous people and local communities, especially in low-income parts of the world, according to the plan.&nbsp;The exact formula for how money will be divvied up will be decided later.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It is a global opportunity for businesses who are benefiting from nature to be able to quickly and easily put some money where it’s genuinely going to make a difference in nature conservation,” William Lockhart, a UK government official who co-led negotiations for the new plan, told Vox on Friday.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Remarkably, the new plan is the only international tool to fund conservation nearly entirely with money from the private sector, Lockhart said. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It will change the lives of people,” Flora Mokgohloa, a negotiator with the government of South Africa, told Vox Friday, referring to how the plan could fund local communities who harbor biodiversity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In some ways this new plan is meant to correct longstanding power imbalances, said Siva Thambisetty, an associate professor of intellectual property law at the London School of Economics. Many of the world’s hotspots of biodiversity are in developing nations, like the Democratic Republic of Congo, yet many of the companies that profit from that biodiversity are based in wealthy countries.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This is about correcting an injustice,” Thambisetty said. “A number of biodiverse countries have been alienated from the value of their resources.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s a big deal,” she said of the plan, when it was in draft form.<strong> </strong></p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/54090836136_3068c7a220_o.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602" alt="People walk across a paved outdoor space surrounded by trees, with hazy hills in the distance.

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are still many unknowns, including how much money this mechanism might ultimately generate and how enforceable it will be. The deal was reached in the final hours of COP16, a meeting of roughly 180 world governments that are members of a global environmental treaty called the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). While that treaty is legally binding, this new plan — which is a “decision” in treaty parlance — is not. So unless countries enshrine the decision in their own legislation,<strong> </strong>it will be difficult to enforce. (Some countries already have legislation to regulate access to their genetic data. It’s still not clear how these&nbsp;national&nbsp;laws will work alongside&nbsp;the&nbsp;new global approach.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s more is that the US, the world’s largest economy, is one of two nations that’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/379295/cop16-biodiversity-why-us-global-treaty-protect-nature">not a member of the CBD</a> treaty. The other is the Vatican. That means American companies may have even less of an incentive to follow this new plan and pay the fee for using DNA extracted from wild organisms.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some advocates for lower-income countries are unhappy with the plan, saying it doesn’t do enough to remedy the problem of what they call biopiracy. That’s when companies commercialize biodiversity, including DNA, and fail to share the benefits that stem from those resources —&nbsp;including profits —&nbsp;with the communities who safeguard them. The plan undermines a country’s ability to control who gets to use its genetic resources, said Nithin Ramakrishnan, a senior researcher at Third World Network, a group that advocates for human rights and benefit sharing. “You’re just creating a voluntary fund that promotes biopiracy,”&nbsp;he said.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/CBD_COP16-4791_0.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.740836125969,100,78.518327748063" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Colombia President Gustavo Petro (left) and UN Secretary-General António Guterres (right) embrace on October 29 at COP16.&lt;br&gt; | Mike Muzurakis/Earth Negotiations Bulletin/IISD" data-portal-copyright="Mike Muzurakis/Earth Negotiations Bulletin/IISD" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Nonetheless, this decision —&nbsp;which resulted from hours of negotiations, often over single words —&nbsp;still has a lot of power, experts told Vox. Many companies,&nbsp;and especially those with international operations, will likely pay the fee, or a portion of it, they said, even if they’re based in the US. That’s because they operate in regions, such as the European Union, where this new plan will likely be honored. “The big companies are pretty engaged here,” Scholz, who is based in Germany, said. “They have a significant reputational risk.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Basecamp Research, a London-based startup that claims to manage the world’s largest database of non-human genetic sequences, wasn’t worried about a potential fee. “We are quite comfortable and willing to contribute,” Bupe Mwambingu, the company’s biodiversity partnerships manager, said. “It is going to go toward conserving biodiversity, which is the resource that we are tapping into for our business.” (Basecamp Research already pays local communities and conservation groups to extract physical organisms, such as microbes, which are later sequenced, the company said. It’s not clear whether this new plan would require the firm to pay more.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Early reactions from the pharmaceutical industry suggest it’s not thrilled. On Saturday morning, David Reddy, director general of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, said in a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.ifpma.org/news/conclusion-of-cop16-negotiations-on-multilateral-mechanism-for-benefit-sharing-of-dsi/" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a>&nbsp;that the new plan does “not get the balance right” between the benefits it could generate and the&nbsp;potential&nbsp;“costs to&nbsp;society and science.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the lead-up to the election, allegations are flying that social media platforms have been “shadow banning,” or in some way filtering the political content of, celebrities. After multiple Latine <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/latin/jennifer-lopez-bad-bunny-ricky-martin-amplify-kamala-harris-campaign-trump-rally-racist-puerto-rico-joke-1235812714/">stars spoke out</a> against <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380818/trump-rally-puerto-rico-tony-hinchcliffe-groypers">the racism and misogyny on display</a> at last week’s Madison Square Garden rally, Ricky Martin posted an Instagram Story <a href="https://twitter.com/cazarespr/status/1850678928815317433">claiming</a> that the platform was blocking a post he’d published on the subject. Users also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BadBunnyPR/comments/1gf39cp/x_twitter/">speculated</a> that their <a href="https://x.com/badbunnynetwork/status/1851402662949875774">access</a> to other public figures who posted about the rally, including Bad Bunny, was being somehow restricted. Add these musicians to a long list of users who say they’ve been shadow banned. These include <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com.sg/lifestyle/bella-hadid-claims-instagram-blocks-her-stories-when-she-talks-about-palestine">Bella Hadid</a>, who claimed in 2022 that the platform penalized her for posts about Palestine, and sources for a recent <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/10/16/instagram-limits-political-content-shadowban-election-posts/">Washington Post</a> investigation who claimed Instagram throttled their political content.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Claims of political post suppression have been made for years, but the idea that a platform would be censoring this content right before a deeply consequential election is alarming. Is it true?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, yes and no. Instagram and its text platform, Threads, have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/01/how-instagram-feed-works/">claimed</a> in the past and continue to claim that they don&#8217;t shadow ban specific people. “Our policies are designed to give everyone a voice while at the same time keeping our platforms safe,&#8221; Meta’s Public Affairs Director Dani Lever told Vox in an email. &#8220;We’re currently enforcing these policies during a fast-moving, highly polarized, and intense election and we readily acknowledge errors can be made, but any implication that we deliberately and systemically suppress a particular voice is false.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last year, Instagram head Adam Mosseri <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/instagram-ranking-explained/">detailed</a> the many moving parts that go into determining how a post gets ranked, curated, and served to users on a platform, including, he said, “thousands” of “signals” of user preferences, including what users like, information about the post and who posted it, and how interested you are in the person who made it. This criteria varies from user to user, and it’s constantly in flux.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instagram’s complicated system of ranking content involves another operation of filtering content as well. <a href="https://themarkup.org/automated-censorship/2024/02/25/how-we-investigated-shadowbanning-on-instagram">Previous reporting</a> has indicated that Instagram and Threads do remove and filter out content, including covertly restricting individual accounts and their content from search results — the oldest <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/23933846/shadowbanning-meta-israel-hamas-war-palestine">commonly understood meaning</a> of a shadow ban — as well as showing the posts to fewer users. That apparent contradiction may be why shadow ban discourse flared up again this past week. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition, the political context — mere days away from an anxiety-inducing election — adds another layer of concern. The platform’s current <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/continuing-our-approach-to-political-content-on-instagram-and-threads">official policy</a> regarding politics is not to recommend any political content to users. “Our goal is to preserve the ability for people to choose to interact with political content, while respecting each person’s appetite for it,” Mosseri <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/C3IjTzGvk6_">said</a> earlier this year when the policy was announced. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“People have told us they want to see less political content on Facebook,&#8221; Lever told Vox, &#8220;so we have spent the last few years <a href="https://transparency.meta.com/features/approach-to-political-content">refining</a> our approach to reduce the amount of political content seen in Feed and other surfaces.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Users can opt into being served political content if they want — which is good — but users who don’t know they need to opt in first might go looking for political content and then get the wrong idea when they don’t find it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Not only that, but in March, Instagram <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/C4yJaqgxK5o">rolled out</a> a little-noticed but massive change to the way it displays hashtags across the site: It essentially erased real-time feeds altogether. Now, regardless of what tag you’re searching for, you can no longer see posts made in real time on a universal feed. While you can still see posts that are recommended for you on the mobile app, you can’t see everything. This, again, is another wrinkle that might make people think they’re being targeted or that their posts are being hidden, when they’re more likely just being lost in Meta’s ineffable algorithmic approach to sourcing content.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given the polarized era we’re in, all of these factors can create confusion. After all, Meta <em>has</em> previously limited political content across all its platforms. In 2022, it issued an <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2022/09/28/upcoming-restriction-period-for-us-ads/">ad restriction</a> in the week prior to the election to squelch all political advertising from getting through, and it’s conducting a similar restriction this week. (A recent <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilybaker-white/2024/10/31/facebook-ads-election-misinformation/">Forbes investigation</a> found that prior to the current week-long ban on election advertising, the company has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284674/meta-is-profiting-from-election-conspiracy-theories">profiting handily</a> from political Facebook advertising — even ads that spread rampant disinformation about the election.) </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lever pointed out to Vox that the company had actually <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/11/how-meta-is-planning-for-elections-in-2024/">announced</a> its forthcoming approach to the elections a full year ago. &#8220;We very clearly stated that we would show people links to official information about how, when, and where to vote when they searched for terms related to the election on Facebook and Instagram,” Lever told Vox. Still, the average Instagram user likely won’t see missing content as part of a site-wide design; they may see it instead as an unfair ban on a specific piece of content or theme.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Users’ perceptions that their speech is being curtailed has become a running theme for Meta, as well as other platforms like Twitter, now known as X. Owner Elon Musk has frequently come under fire for allowing censorship and <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/10/30/study-shows-elon-musk-tweets-pro-trump-appear-x-users-feeds-within-2-sessions/">artificial amplification</a> of content on that platform, often at the behest of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235213/x-brazil-suppression-speech-elon-musk-india-turkey">right-wing authoritarian governments</a>. (Vox has reached out to X for comment.) Under Musk, X has also been known to <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/elon-musk-twitter-censor-left-accounts-rcna59638">ban left-leaning users</a>, including journalists, from the platform despite the users having violated no site policies. All of this prior activity tends to feed the rumor mill in times of high anxiety and tension — like, say, days before an election. Even if X isn’t filtering content, the perception that it must be can contribute to user backlash.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The problem of users believing they’ve been shadow banned reflects larger tensions between tech and politics</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That leads us to another, perhaps more ominous, problem. Increasingly, the prominent moguls at the helms of these platforms seem willing to bend the knee to Donald Trump. Some tech entrepreneurs like Jeff Bezos and Patrick Soon-Shiong may be <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-10-28/non-endorsement-post-la-times-cancellations">hedging their bets</a> in anticipation of a Trump election win. Musk has <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/380185/trump-elon-musk-election">made it clear</a> that he is a Trump fan, but that’s not necessarily the case with Mark Zuckerberg, with whom Trump has had a famously tense relationship over the years.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Following the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/1/6/22217657/us-capitol-breach-trump-rally-presidential-election">January 6 insurrection,</a> Facebook and Twitter both <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/1/16/22234971/trump-twitter-facebook-social-media-ban-election-misinformation-zignal">banned Trump</a> from their platforms, which left the former president thoroughly disgruntled, with Zuckerberg in particular. That March, on TruthSocial, he <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/donald-trump-tiktok-ban-facebook-zuckerschmuck-enemy-of-the-people-1235934951/">indicated</a> his intent to protect TikTok in the face of attempts by US politicians to ban the platform — solely because TikTok is Facebook’s biggest competitor. Trump followed that up by&nbsp;<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-warns-mark-zuckerberg-could-165321790.html">threatening</a> to put Zuckerberg in prison if he filtered Trump-related content from Facebook.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s statements are in line with a long litany of threats he’s made against his enemies across <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/us/politics/trump-opponents-enemy-within.html">politics</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/22/nx-s1-5161480/trump-media-threats-abc-cbs-60-minutes-journalists">the media</a>, and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/trumps-threats-to-prosecute-opponents-election-workers-and-google/articleshow/114783967.cms?from=mdr">Silicon Valley</a> if he were to win office. Additionally, Congress has shown <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/9/6/17824652/twitter-dorsey-energy-and-commerce-hearing-shadow-banning">a willingness</a> to <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/10/28/21538767/senate-social-media-hearing-section-230-twitter-google-facebook-dorsey-pichai-zuckerberg-censorship">investigate social media platforms</a> when they’re displeased by alleged content restrictions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The tensions between Trump and Meta seem to be thawing, however, as Meta has been giving progressively more face to Trump. Zuckerberg <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/01/trump-facebook-instagram-account-suspension/">restored Trump’s access</a> to Facebook and Instagram in 2023 after a two-year ban. He also <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/187644/too-scared-endorse-harris-trump">praised Trump</a> for his bravery following a July <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360390/trump-shot-assassination-attempt-shooter-bullet-butler-pennsylvania-biden-secret-service-updates">assassination attempt</a>, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/28/trump-bezos-billionaires-zuckerberg/">called</a> him after the incident. While Trump had previously referred to <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/donald-trump-tiktok-ban-facebook-zuckerschmuck-enemy-of-the-people-1235934951/">Zuckerberg as an “enemy of the people,”</a> that vibe has shifted; on a recent podcast interview, Trump claimed he <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/4934534-trump-zuckerberg-politics-facebook/">likes Zuckerberg “much better now.”</a> Facebook has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/09/09/meta-denies-zuckerberg-told-trump-he-cant-vote-for-a-democrat/?">denied</a> Trump’s <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/donald-trump-ear-campaign-assassination-attempt.html">claim</a> that Zuckerberg went one further and implied he would be voting for Trump in the election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not hard to see that in a scenario where tech CEOs are <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tech-ceos-trump-claims-are-courting-him/">falling in line</a> to pay their dues to Trump in case he wins the election, the end user is the one who loses out.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Starbucks announced this week that starting November 7, its US and Canada stores will drop extra charges for plant-based milks — including oat, soy, almond, and coconut — that add 70 to 80 cents to a drink’s cost.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a change that plant-based food advocates have long campaigned for, citing the dairy industry’s grave animal welfare and climate impacts. In 2022, <em>Succession</em> actor James Cromwell — in partnership with <a href="https://www.peta.org/media/news-releases/drop-it-peta-to-cause-a-stir-at-starbucks-shareholder-meeting-over-nondairy-milk-upcharge/">PETA</a> — <a href="https://sentientmedia.org/starbucks-plant-milk-surcharge/">superglued</a> himself to a Starbucks counter in New York City in protest of the upcharge.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/5.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=1.9640718562874,0,96.071856287425,100" alt="Two men wearing PETA shirts protest at a Starbucks counter, one holds a sign that reads “STARBUCKS: END THE VEGAN UPCHARGE”" title="Two men wearing PETA shirts protest at a Starbucks counter, one holds a sign that reads “STARBUCKS: END THE VEGAN UPCHARGE”" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="In 2022, actor James Cromwell glued himself to a Starbucks counter in protest of its plant-based milk uncharge. | PETA" data-portal-copyright="PETA" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The news comes as the coffee giant tries to win customers back after a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/business/starbucks-customers-brian-niccol.html">marked</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/business/starbucks-earnings-sales.html">drop</a> in sales over the last year. Some customers are leaving due to <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/23896266/latte-price-pumpkin-spice-starbucks-coffee-inflation" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vox.com/money/23896266/latte-price-pumpkin-spice-starbucks-coffee-inflation">inflation</a>, “balking at $8 lattes, while others are boycotting the chain for a variety of reasons,” according to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/business/starbucks-customers-brian-niccol.html">New York Times</a> (including the <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/10/17/starbucks-suing-union-israel-palestine/" data-type="link" data-id="https://theintercept.com/2023/10/17/starbucks-suing-union-israel-palestine/">war in Gaza</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/3/28/23659846/starbucks-ceo-howard-schultz-senate-union-busting" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/3/28/23659846/starbucks-ceo-howard-schultz-senate-union-busting">union busting</a>, though it’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/2023/12/13/23999981/starbucks-boycott-israel-palestine-market-value-loss-holidays-labor">unclear</a> how much impact that’s had on Starbucks’s business). The plant milk fee hasn’t helped. In the US, around <a href="https://stories.starbucks.com/stories/2021/key-takeaways-from-starbucks-q3-fy21-earnings-results/#">one quarter</a> of Starbucks’ drinks that include milk are ordered with plant-based milk, according to data from 2021, and the upcharge adds much more to the cost of a drink for the customer than the actual cost of the plant-based milk to Starbucks. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to <a href="http://switch4good.org/">Switch4Good</a>, a nonprofit that advocates for shifting away from dairy and has long agitated against the plant milk surcharge, it <a href="https://switch4good.org/droptheupcharge/">costs</a> Starbucks between 9 and 28 cents extra to make a drink with soy, almond, or oat milk. That means the extra 70- to 80-cent charge could amount to a markup of more than 700 percent, depending on the milk alternative. A Starbucks spokesperson told Vox that the decision to drop the surcharge was made to benefit customers but didn’t answer questions about Switch4Good’s analysis.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The company has also been<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/starbucks-lawsuit-nondairy-milk-lactose-intolerance/"> sued for the upcharge</a> on discrimination grounds because around one-third of Americans — disproportionately people of color — have difficulty digesting lactose, a sugar found in milk.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While changing course on the plant milk upcharge was, above all, a business decision, it could also be a milestone in the food industry’s <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/21092024/food-companies-greenhouse-gas-emissions/">stalled efforts to combat climate change</a>, given milk’s big carbon footprint. The switch will also help to further mainstream dairy-free milk, a more humane and sustainable alternative to conventional dairy, during what has otherwise been a turbulent year for the plant-based food market.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Starbucks’s new policy is a big deal for the climate&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Producing cow’s milk has outsize <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24128700/bird-fludairy-meat-industry-h5n1-cows-milk-eggs-safety">social</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22905381/meat-dairy-eggs-climate-change-emissions-rewilding">environmental costs</a> compared to plant-based milks — costs that aren’t priced into what consumers pay for dairy, which benefits from a range of <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/352359/milk-dairy-schools">government subsidies designed</a> to make animal products cheap and plentiful.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For one, there’s the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/377096/sonoma-county-denver-factory-farming-slaughterhouse-ban-ballot-measures">animal cruelty</a>. The dairy business model depends on <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/160448/meat-bestiality-artificial-insemination">artificially inseminating cows</a> and separating them from their calves at birth so humans can take their milk. The calves are typically forced to live alone in small enclosures while dairy cows are kept in large, industrial sheds, spending <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.00257/full">little to no time in pasture</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After multiple cycles of pregnancy and birth, when a dairy cow’s milk productivity wanes, she’s typically sent to slaughter.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More important to Starbucks, however, is <a href="https://stories.starbucks.com/emea/stories/2021/starbucks-to-work-directly-with-farmers-to-help-reduce-emissions/#">milk’s greenhouse gas emissions</a>, which comprise more than one-fifth of the company’s global carbon footprint. Dairy production devours dramatically <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impact-milks">more land and water</a>, and contributes far more greenhouse gas emissions and water pollution, than plant-based alternatives. <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/3/20/24105735/peak-meat-livestock-emissions-plant-based-climate-deadline">Climate scientists agree</a> that reducing dairy and meat consumption in wealthy countries is a necessary part of climate mitigation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Starbucks has committed to <a href="https://stories.starbucks.com/uploads/2021/04/Starbucks-2020-Global-Environmental-and-Social-Impact-Report.pdf">halving its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030</a>, and expanding its <a href="https://stories.starbucks.com/stories/2020/plant-based-menu-innovation-at-starbucks/#">plant-based menu options</a> is a key component of that goal. Removing the plant milk upcharge, a Starbucks spokesperson said in a statement, also contributes to the company’s sustainability plans.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As of 2023, the coffee chain had made <a href="https://content-prod-live.cert.starbucks.com/binary/v2/asset/137-88758.pdf">minimal progress toward reducing its carbon footprint</a>; its overall emissions had increased from its 2019 baseline, in part because its emissions from cow’s milk were up 8 percent over that period. Starbucks is such a large buyer of milk that dairy emissions across its global operations is equivalent to around <a href="https://dairy.osu.edu/newsletter/buckeye-dairy-news/volume-26-issue-2/dairy-sustainability-–-jargon-dairy-story-and" data-type="link" data-id="https://dairy.osu.edu/newsletter/buckeye-dairy-news/volume-26-issue-2/dairy-sustainability-–-jargon-dairy-story-and">2</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030222004830" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030222004830">percent</a> of emissions from all US dairy production.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Food companies are <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/21092024/food-companies-greenhouse-gas-emissions/">struggling to cut their emissions</a> because most of their menus revolve around meat and dairy, the most carbon-intensive foods. Starbucks’s decision to drop its dairy-free surcharge should help. Substituting nondairy milks is already Starbucks’s second most requested drink customization, according to the company, so the change could push even more of its customers to go dairy-free. It could also push other chains to follow.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What the Starbucks change could mean for the future of plant-based dairy</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The move represents a rare win in recent years for the US plant-based food industry. After a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/5/28/18626859/meatless-meat-explained-vegan-impossible-burger">meteoric rise</a> in the late 2010s — as Beyond Meat and Impossible burgers went mainstream and Oatly became the it-milk of baristas and consumers alike — the sector has since <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/4/17/23682232/impossible-beyond-plant-based-meat-sales">faltered</a>. A number of fast food chains have <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-24/which-fast-food-has-fake-meat-not-many-serve-beyond-meat-impossible-foods">dropped plant-based burgers</a> from their menus, while the incumbent livestock sector has <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/5/5/23709822/milk-dairy-plant-based-meat-soy-almond-fake-processed">attacked plant-based startups</a>. Shoppers have opted for cheaper animal products amid high inflation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Plant-based milk, though, has managed to weather the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/10/7/20880318/meatless-meat-mainstream-backlash-impossible-burger">plant-based backlash</a> better than most; from 2021 to 2023, <a href="https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2023-State-of-the-industry-report_Plant-based.pdf">revenues were up 9 percent</a>, accounting for almost <a href="https://gfi.org/marketresearch/#:~:text=Plant%2Dbased%20milk%20sales,unit%20sales%20declined%208%20percent.">15 percent of total milk sales</a> (though the number of nondairy milk units fell). Meanwhile, plant-based meat sales fell by an estimated 13 percent during that same period.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given Starbucks’s size and influence, dairy-free milk’s market share may continue to grow — and cow’s milk sales, which have been dropping for decades, may decline further.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/CZPWG-american-milk-consumption-has-fallen-by-almost-50-percent-since-1975-2.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,16.741052270191,100,66.517895459617" alt="Chart showing US fluid milk consumption dropping by nearly half since 1975 through the early 2020s. " title="Chart showing US fluid milk consumption dropping by nearly half since 1975 through the early 2020s. " data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Starbucks’s policy change, however, is more than just a sign of plant-based milk’s staying power; it also demonstrates the potential for the plant-based and anti-factory farming movements to apply sustained pressure to corporations and get results.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">PETA and <a href="http://switch4good.org/">Switch4Good</a> have called on the company to drop the surcharge for years. While Starbucks says the change was a business decision, the protests, celebrity endorsements, and petitions likely helped, creating the very idea that charging more for plant-based options was unjust. And while the protests have at times been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/05/20/james-cromwell-starbucks-glue-vegan-milk-upcharge/">ridiculed</a> as the work of whiny vegans angry about a 70-cent charge, the successful campaign will now primarily benefit Starbucks’s millions of nonvegan customers who just enjoy plant-based milks or require them due to lactose intolerance (and, of course, factory-farmed cows and the climate).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The move follows a vigorous five-year campaign, letters from more than 160,000 PETA supporters, protests at Starbucks around the country, and help from actor James Cromwell… as well as an appeal from Sir Paul McCartney,” a PETA statement reads. PETA paused its campaign in September to give the new Starbucks CEO, Brian Niccol, time to “make the right decision,” the organization said. “And he delivered.”&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/4.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,6.5968586387435,100,86.806282722513" alt="A group of people with protest signs protest Starbucks’s plant-based upcharge.

" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="PETA protested Starbucks’s plant-based milk surcharge for years before the company decided to drop it. | PETA" data-portal-copyright="PETA" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">If Starbucks wanted to, it could go even further by making plant-based milk the default option for its milky drinks. In 2022, Blue Bottle, a Nestlé-owned upscale coffee chain with some 100 locations around the world, announced it was making <a href="https://blog.bluebottlecoffee.com/posts/oat-milk-by-default">oat milk the default milk</a> in beverage orders in US locations as part of a larger effort to cut carbon emissions. Now, if a Blue Bottle customer wants cow’s milk, they have to request it, but most don’t; a few months after making the switch, Blue Bottle reported that 63 percent of customers were sticking with oat milk.<br><br>Blue Bottle’s approach, which <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-30/companies-and-schools-are-using-nudge-theory-to-cut-meat-consumption">other food companies</a> have also embraced, shows how heavily our food choices are influenced by our food environments. Small changes — from dropping surcharges to changing default options — can nudge us toward a more climate-friendly future. Starbucks is the latest, and largest, company to put conventional dairy and plant-based milk on a level playing field. Others should follow.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With just days until the 2024 election, it can feel like Americans are more divided than ever. Former President <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380818/trump-rally-puerto-rico-tony-hinchcliffe-groypers">Donald Trump and his supporters</a> have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-enemies-from-within-5c4a34776469a55e71d3ba4d4e68cf62">attacked opponents in increasingly vicious terms</a>. There have already been incidents of <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/381520/2024-election-violence-trump-loses-extremism-civil-war">political violence</a> — including multiple alleged arsons targeting ballot boxes and a terrorism arrest in Arizona after the windows were repeatedly shot out of a Democratic Party office — and polling suggests voters are worried about more post-election violence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are serious stakes to the election, including democracy issues and abortion rights — but the intense, vitriolic polarization we’re experiencing now is largely based on our <a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2024/10/27/snf-agora-poll-september-2024/">perceptions about each other</a>, according to research from Johns Hopkins University professor Lilliana Mason. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mason, a professor of political science at the university’s Stavros Niarchos Foundation’s Agora Institute, says this type of division, which she calls affective polarization, doesn’t require us to have wildly different policy disagreements to hate each other. Instead, she told Vox, “it’s based on feelings,” as well as misunderstandings about which groups, and what kind of people, are on the other side.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Through a series of surveys and experiments over four years, Mason and Nathan Kalmoe, a political communication professor at Louisiana State University, studied the origins of extreme partisanship among ordinary Americans for the 2022 book, <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/R/bo163195227.html"><em>Radical American Partisanship</em></a><em>. </em>Mason and Kalmoe found that around 40 percent of Americans surveyed were willing to use dehumanizing language about the other party — a metric she says can be a precursor to even more serious political violence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Today, Explained</em> host Noel King spoke with Mason to understand how the American electorate got to this point and how we can get back to a more civil politics<em>.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Below is an excerpt of the conversation, edited for length and clarity.</p>

<iframe frameBorder="0" height="200" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP7443558362" width="100%"></iframe>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You&#8217;ve written two books that seem relevant here. Tell me the names of your books.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Lilliana Mason</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first book is <em><a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/U/bo27527354.html">Uncivil Agreement How Politics Became Our Identity</a></em>. And the second book is <em>Radical American Partisanship</em>.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Two main parties in the United States, Democrats and Republicans; as a researcher, what do you know about what we think about the other group that is incorrect?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Lilliana Mason</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Everything! We all overestimate the extent to which people in the other party are extreme in terms of the policies. We also overestimate the degree to which the party is made up of groups that we kind of think of as like the stereotypical groups associated with the party. So, Republicans think that the Democratic Party is majority Black. It&#8217;s not. Democrats think that the Republican Party is majority wealthy people who make over $250,000 a year. It&#8217;s actually like 2 percent. And so we tend to assume that the stereotypical group that we think of when we think of that party, we tend to assume that that makes up the whole party and we&#8217;re all wrong.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And in fact, political scientists and sociologists have done experiments where we correct people&#8217;s misperceptions and it actually makes them hate the other party less because they hadn&#8217;t realized that the party wasn&#8217;t made up of maybe people they didn&#8217;t like or wasn&#8217;t made up of people who are really extreme in their policy preferences. We are overestimating the extent to which the other party is made up of people that we assume we would really dislike.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How do you define partisanship?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Lilliana Mason</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The classic understanding of partisanship is just which party you vote for based on your assessments of politics. But more recently, we&#8217;re starting to think of partisanship as a social identity, meaning it&#8217;s a psychological connection to the other people that are in the party and feeling like what happens to our party impacts our own sense of self-esteem and self-worth. The traditional view is thinking of choosing who to vote for like a banker chooses an investment. And really what we&#8217;re doing today is more like sports fans cheering on our team.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That&#8217;s partisanship. What is polarization?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Lilliana Mason</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So polarization can also be two things. It can be more than that, actually. But the classic understanding of polarization was that we are disagreeing about issues. So Democrats are really liberal and Republicans are really conservative on all of these different issues. But increasingly, what we&#8217;re finding now is that our polarization is partly about that, but it&#8217;s also about how we feel about each other. So Democrats and Republicans really don&#8217;t like one another, and we call that affective polarization. So it&#8217;s based on feelings. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And really the important thing about understanding the effect of polarization is that it doesn&#8217;t require us to disagree in order to hate each other. We use theories from social psychology about why any groups don&#8217;t like each other to explain why Democrats and Republicans don&#8217;t like each other, and it doesn&#8217;t necessarily require that they disagree on, you know, marginal tax rates.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Does the data really say that people of different parties dislike or even hate each other?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Lilliana Mason</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yeah. In fact, in my first book, I asked people how would they feel if their child married somebody from the other party or how would they feel if someone from the other party moved in next door to them. And those types of questions — people really don&#8217;t like the idea of their child marrying somebody from the other party. They don&#8217;t really want to have social contact with people from the other party. And that type of feeling isn&#8217;t entirely rooted in disagreement. So people who have really moderate policy preferences can still really dislike people from the other party. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the second book, we started to ask more extreme questions. So we asked, “Do you think people on the other party are not just wrong for politics, they&#8217;re downright evil?” Or even, “Do they deserve to be treated like humans because they behave like animals?” So a dehumanization question, which is kind of the most extreme of the questions, and we are finding that about 50 percent of partisans are willing to say that their partisan opponents are evil, and between 20 to 40 percent are even willing to dehumanize people in the other party. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We started asking this question in 2017. The reason we asked the question is because this is the type of thing that we measure in other countries, if there&#8217;s a mass violence event. This type of attitude exists beforehand. It doesn&#8217;t always lead to violence, but whenever there is mass violence, you have to have these dehumanizing and vilifying attitudes present beforehand, because otherwise it&#8217;s really hard to harm another human being and still feel like a morally good person. And really, the only way to do that is to think that they are a threat to you, that they&#8217;re evil and that they&#8217;re subhuman. And so when we see genocide in other places, for example, these attitudes exist before before the violence occurs. And what we wanted to know was, did these attitudes exist in the American electorate? And no one had really asked that question before.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tell me about what kind of polarization we&#8217;re seeing these days.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Lilliana Mason</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So what we&#8217;re seeing is mostly affective polarization. So it&#8217;s basically the type of polarization that means that we don&#8217;t like one another. And if you think about human groups throughout all of human history, there are plenty of reasons that two human groups don&#8217;t like one another. Humans hate one another for all kinds of reasons. And it&#8217;s very much that type of visceral dislike and distrust that any two social groups can have against each other that we&#8217;re observing in the Democratic and Republican parties right now.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Disagreeing on policy seems to me quite normal; thinking that a person in the other party is evil seems a bit less normal to me. What is this rooted in, this affective polarization? Where did this come from? </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Lilliana Mason</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A lot of this animosity between Democrats and Republicans has come out of a trend over the last many decades of not only our partisan identities being the thing that we fight over during elections, but also all of these other identities. And since the 1960s, our racial identities, our religious identities, all other cultural, even geographic identities have moved into alignment with our party identities. So what happens is that when we&#8217;re thinking about politics and who wins and who loses, we&#8217;re not just thinking my party wins or my party loses. We&#8217;re thinking, “If my party wins, then my racial group wins and my religious group wins.” And all of these other parts of my identity are winners and it feels really good and vice versa. “If my party loses, all these different parts of my identity are also losing,” and that feels really, really terrible. So the stakes get a lot higher when we think about our electoral choices and who is in control of our government as reflective of who we are as a human being. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I would like to not live in this version of America. There&#8217;s an election to cover. How do we, in all seriousness, fix this problem?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Lilliana Mason</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We&#8217;ve tried a number of interventions in our surveys, so we&#8217;ll embed an experiment in the survey to try to see if we can make people less violent or less approving of violence. And one thing that we found that basically always works is to have them read a quote from a leader. So in our experiments, we use Biden or Trump, a quote that just says something like, “violence is never acceptable. That&#8217;s just not how we do things here.” And people who read that quote are less likely to approve of political violence than those who&#8217;ve read nothing in a control condition. So simply reading a sentence from a leader can get people to kind of step back from this aggressive stance. We need to get something back. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the things I think that the last few years have done — and I think Trump as a candidate in particular — is really break the norms of what&#8217;s acceptable behavior in American politics and in American society. The idea that we can use racist and misogynistic language against our fellow citizens, the idea that we can tell lies and not be punished for it; you know, a lot of the things that our politics is characterized by right now are things that 20 years ago would not have ever been allowed on the political stage. And there are plenty of Democrats and Republicans that just remember a different time. And what worries me is that young people don&#8217;t. So we&#8217;re increasingly in this world where young people don&#8217;t know that it was nicer, more diplomatic, and so I hope that we can pay attention to the norms that have been broken because the only way to enforce a norm is for people around you, when you break the norm, to tell you to stop it. Laws are enforced with law enforcement. Norms are enforced with us, with people. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And the reason that shame is such a powerful emotion, is because it&#8217;s the way that we enforce norms. To the extent that together as a community, if we see somebody behaving in a way that we think of as unacceptable, that we as a community can say to them, “That&#8217;s beyond the pale, that&#8217;s that you just crossed the line. I&#8217;m not accepting that kind of behavior.” And we haven&#8217;t been doing that to each other in many years, I think. But to the extent that we can kind of remember what it&#8217;s like to be normal people and treat each other like we&#8217;re part of a community together and that we&#8217;re part of the same society, that&#8217;s something that we all can do on our own.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the two years since Elon Musk bought Twitter and turned it into X, the platform has become crowded <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/7/23907424/x-unlabeled-ads-posts-cant-block-report-chumbox">with deceptive ads</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/383336/trump-election-elon-musk-misinformation">unchecked misinformation</a>. Now, with President-elect Donald Trump heading to the White House and Musk joining his administration, countless people announced <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/x-sees-largest-user-exodus-musk-takeover-rcna179793">their departure from X</a>. Rival social media site Bluesky told Vox that 2.25 million new users have joined in the last week alone.<strong> </strong>And they’re having a blast.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bluesky looks a lot like the old Twitter you knew and loved. It’s a reverse chronological feed of posts, including images, videos, and links that you can like and repost. Like old Twitter, your feed is not ruled by an algorithm. Meanwhile, Bluesky’s open source, decentralized framework <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/06/how-clean-your-bluesky-feed">gives you a lot more control</a> over how your feed works than X or even Threads, the X alternative Meta has been <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/7/5/23785140/threads-instagram-meta-twitter-killer-mark-zuckerberg-elon-musk">pushing onto Instagram users</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition to the technical differences, there’s also a different vibe on Bluesky. It’s overflowing with weird memes and digital art thanks to early users who hurried to recapture that fun and serendipitous feeling of the original Twitter. But with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bsky.app/post/3larljiybf22v">an influx of a million users in the last month</a>, Bluesky is growing fast and bracing for some sort of evolution. The people arriving from X seem like they’re having fun so far, too. You can also expect to see a lot less Elon Musk on Bluesky, if only because he doesn’t own the place.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the good vibes continue, there’s a chance that Bluesky could usher in a brighter future for social media, one that gives users more power over their experience. Theoretically, the company’s model could give people a way to hang out on the social web outside of algorithmic feeds stuffed with targeted ads and ruled by trillion-dollar tech companies. For now, at the very least, Bluesky is a welcome breath of fresh air.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Why people are fleeing X</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This isn’t the first time people have flocked to Bluesky. When Twitter <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2022/10/27/23424938/elon-musk-own-twitter-deal-closes-what-will-change-superapp-layoffs-free-speech-parag-agrawal">accepted Elon Musk’s $44 billion bid</a> to buy Twitter in April 2022, a lot of people freaked out about the possibility of the billionaire changing the platform into a place where trolls and grifters could run free — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/15/23025120/elon-musk-twitter-free-speech-government-censorship">all in the name of free speech</a>. Those initial anxieties turned out to be correct. After Musk changed the name to X, what used to be Twitter <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/11/x-white-supremacist-site/680538/">filled up with white supremacists</a> and became overrun with harassment, <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-generated-content-internet-online-slop-spam.html">AI slop</a>, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/wrong-claims-by-musk-us-election-got-2-billion-views-x-2024-report-says-2024-11-04/">election misinformation</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This overhaul turned into a huge opportunity for open source, text-based social networks, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/24/what-is-mastodon/">Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/4/29/23702979/bluesky-twitter-elon-musk-jack-dorsey-chrissy-teigen-aoc-dril-decentralized">Bluesky</a>. Early on, it looked like the decidedly decentralized Mastodon would be the Twitter alternative of choice, but after it saw an initial burst of interest, some people felt like Mastodon <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90808984/using-mastodon-is-way-too-complicated-to-ever-topple-twitter">was just too confusing</a>. As a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/federated-network">federated network</a>, Mastodon let people set up their own servers, which functioned as independent but interconnected communities within the larger network. It’s related to the larger concept of the fediverse, where a single protocol could allow information to be exchanged between all social media platforms. The fediverse, like Mastodon, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24063290/fediverse-explained-activitypub-social-media-open-protocol">is very confusing</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bluesky took this idea of a federated network and made it easy to use. It started back in 2019, when Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey <a href="https://x.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106">announced</a> that Twitter would fund a small team that would build an “open and decentralized standard for social media.” The ambition — which would eventually result in Bluesky — was to work toward an open social media ecosystem, where users could control how content appeared in their feeds and take their data and followers with them when they moved platforms. Bluesky registered as its own public benefit company <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/2-7-2022-overview">in February 2022</a>, just a couple of months before Musk offered to buy Twitter.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first Bluesky app <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/bluesky">launched in beta about a year later</a>, and it looked a heck of a lot like Twitter, down to the blue logo, which would become a butterfly rather than Twitter’s bird. Rather than require you to figure out which server to join, as Mastodon does, Bluesky initially centralized the user experience on one server so users could see one feed, just like on Twitter. Within a few months, some prominent Twitter users, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Chrissy Teigen, <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/4/29/23702979/bluesky-twitter-elon-musk-jack-dorsey-chrissy-teigen-aoc-dril-decentralized">had set up Bluesky accounts</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bluesky has only gotten easier to use since its early days. While the company <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/02-22-2024-open-social-web">announced it was federating</a> earlier this year, allowing users to store their data on their own servers, the Bluesky user experience remains very straightforward and Twitter-like, down to the look and feel of the app and website. Honestly, if you’re not paying attention while you’re scrolling your feed, you might think you’re on Twitter circa 2021.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, the future of Bluesky is supposed to be transformative. While social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook have been plagued by content moderation problems, Bluesky <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/03-12-2024-stackable-moderation">wants to put users and communities</a> in control of those policies. The same goes for what shows up in people’s feeds. Bluesky says that instead of one algorithm to rule all users, it <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/3-30-2023-algorithmic-choice">will let developers create all kinds of different algorithms</a> and empower users to choose their own experience on the platform.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I&#8217;m really excited that folks can choose the social media that&#8217;s right for them. I&#8217;ll say for me, I like small social media where I talk to barely a dozen people,” Rory Mir, associate director of community organizing at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said of Bluesky’s open source architecture. “And then if folks want a really big audience and to really blow up that&#8217;s also available.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is not how Bluesky works for everyone quite yet. You can just set up an account, follow a bunch of people, and then see their posts. But looking ahead, Bluesky has an optimistic vision for a near future in which social media doesn’t <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/364127/kosa-social-media-teen-health-anxiety">make people so miserable</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">For new users, Bluesky&#8217;s appeal is all about the culture&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Timing has proven crucial to Bluesky’s current position as the X alternative du jour — that is, it’s had a significant amount of time to gather momentum leading to what seems to be this tipping point moment. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When the platform launched over 18 months ago, it was as an invite-only space, prompting extremely online types and various public figures to <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/4/29/23702979/bluesky-twitter-elon-musk-jack-dorsey-chrissy-teigen-aoc-dril-decentralized">flock to try to get in</a>. (The fact many of those early adopters were journalists didn’t hurt in terms of building hype.) That long period of limited entry served to build FOMO, of course, but it also served to allow a niche group of users time to help shape what the dominant modes of communication, moderation, and platform etiquette would be.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The health and positivity of Bluesky&#8217;s community is very important to us, and we&#8217;ve invested heavily in Trust and Safety,” Bluesky spokesperson Emily Liu told Vox in an email. “Last year, Bluesky required invite codes to sign up — not to build hype or exclusivity, but rather so we had time to grow the network responsibly and build our Trust and Safety team.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“​​When Musk first bought Twitter, the first things he did were rolling back moderation on transphobia on the platform and because of that we were the first group to leave Twitter in numbers,” journalist Katelyn Burns told Vox. “Because of that, a large group of funny, talented trans posters were the earliest adopters of Bluesky and were able to forge the platform into what it is today: funny, frequently horny, and with very strong moderation tools. If you like Bluesky&#8217;s vibe right now, thank a trans person.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When the platform finally <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/02/06/bluesky-launch-public-jay-graber/">opened to the public</a> in February, this culture was already well-established: Lots of shitposting passed down from the days of <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/8/8/16034974/writer-jonathan-sun-interview">Weird Twitter</a> (including various <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/faineg.bsky.social/post/3laeclwscaj2v">Alf memes</a> that recently <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alexkirshner.com/post/3latn7imcj22p">led to some confusion</a>); a seemingly <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/65961fec-a5ab-4c71-b1c8-265be3583a93">inevitable leftist tilt</a>; a subcommunity of NSFW posters; and, perhaps most important, an emphasis on proactively curating your own experience using Bluesky’s robust moderation tools.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The centrality of these tools are arguably the defining trait that allows Bluesky to stand out, especially compared to Twitter, which <a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/12/18/16790864/twitter-bans-nazis-hate-groups">struggled for its entire existence</a> to properly deal with bad actors on the site (until Musk more or less jettisoned that struggle altogether). Bluesky not only allows you to block and mute various people, words, and tags, it also allows you to hide individual posts on feeds, and allows users to subscribe to curated block lists directly from the platform that blocks users en masse.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“To me the biggest difference between Bluesky and every other social media platform I’ve ever been on is the close relationship between the user base and the (quite small!) team of developers,” journalist and longtime Bluesky shitposter <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/milesklee.bsky.social">Miles Klee</a> told Vox.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“When people first joined, it was very bare bones, and the devs pursued new features according to what they heard users wanted. Because a lot of people were looking to escape the toxicity of X, that meant they ended up prioritizing safety and accessibility,” Klee said. “On Bluesky, many users feel that they’re building something new together, and that gives them a feeling of ownership, control, community.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I adore Bluesky,” author and Bluesky user <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/debbieohi.com">Debbie Ridpath Ohi</a> told Vox. “While so many other new platforms chased user numbers, Bluesky focused on user safety first, and that made a huge difference. I am having fun using social media again.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bluesky does have one significant drawback. Because the platform is federated, accounts can’t be “locked” away from public view the way they can on X. Still, for many people, that’s likely a feature rather than a bug; after all, X’s easily accessible public interface and ease of searching and surfacing content made it indispensable to many users, especially the many journalists who used it and still continue to use it. These are all features that Bluesky replicates — without, so far, the endless trolls that came with X’s recent era.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">What it means to leave Twitter</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For people who have spent many years on Twitter — which launched in 2006, enough time to grow into an impossible teenager — it may be sobering to contemplate actually leaving the platform. This is, after all, the supposed “hellsite” that many of its most active users were all but glued to for everything from live events to hilarious viral incidents that found us all united through the power of a virtually instantaneous, public, and collective social media.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet for the vast majority of users, the thought of leaving X now probably feels much more plausible and realistic a possibility than it did a year ago, when Vox first <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2022/11/22/23466381/leaving-twitter-x-saying-goodbye-social-media">declared</a> that X was in its death throes. That’s not unusual; social media platforms very rarely die instantly. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the most part, platforms don’t suddenly shut down and strand all of their users. That only happens in extreme cases when a platform’s systems collapse, or it’s seized by the government, or the owner kills the site — situations that just don’t really happen to modern social media with complex infrastructure. The inverse scenario, in which all of a platform’s users simply give up and leave en masse overnight, doesn’t happen at all.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead, as we’ve seen across various internet platforms, including mass migrations away from <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/tracking-livejournal-fandom-diaspora-infographic/">LiveJournal</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/masonsands/2018/12/20/tumblocalypse-where-tumblr-and-its-users-are-headed-after-the-ban/">Tumblr</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2022/2/2/22915110/facebook-meta-user-growth-decline-first-time-metaverse-mark-zuckerberg-tiktok-competition-earnings">Facebook</a>, and now X, the exodus takes years and involves multiple inciting incidents that push people out of their comfort zone and off the platform in incremental movements. All of these steps shift users slowly and inevitably toward the decision to fully leave a platform — sometimes before they even realize they’ve made it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Social media is, by definition, social,” Bluesky early adopter <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mauraquint.bsky.social">Maura Quint</a> told Vox. “People want to be at places where they get something from other users, and where the tools the site provides help them have the experience they’re looking for. If people are miserable in a space, they leave.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Elon Musk made sure to design his version of Twitter to be an unpleasant, dull place,” Quint continued. “Why choose an awful room run by the worst guy you’ve ever met when there’s an alternative where cool people are hanging out, telling jokes, creating their own goofy lore, and engaging on issues they care about?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a platform slips into decline, those inciting incidents often become more and more frequent and close together. X has had multiple such inciting incidents this year, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/30/24232561/brazil-x-ban-sending-people-bluesky">a major ban in Brazil</a> that sent 500,000 users to Bluesky in a single weekend in August, <a href="https://www.usermag.co/p/the-burning-of-the-library-of-alexandria">a crucial step</a> in jolting X’s massive international fandom community out of its complacency. Then came the twin announcements in October: first, that X would be allowing third-party AI companies to <a href="https://www.avclub.com/twitter-removes-ability-to-stop-ai-from-scraping-your-pictures">scrape all user data</a>, and then that blocking a user would <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/10/half-a-million-users-could-be-leaving-x-due-to-blocking-changes.html">no longer prevent them</a> from being able to see your content — a change that arguably nullifies the point of blocking to begin with. Most recently came the US election and Musk’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/technology/elon-musk-trump-x.html">unabashed weaponization</a> of the platform in service of Trump and the far right.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This latest inciting incident seems to have been the final straw for many users to not only leave X for Bluesky, but begin deleting all of their content from X. (Some <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/use-porto-to-upload-all-your-old-tweets-to-bluesky">extensions and apps</a> allow you to import all of your content over from X to Bluesky first before you delete.) Still, while these actions suggest that momentum has well and truly shifted toward Bluesky, the newer site will likely have growing pains as old users adjust to newcomers and the platform itself grapples with the strain of millions of new users.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Our infrastructure is holding up!” Bluesky’s Liu told Vox. “We&#8217;ve prepared our infrastructure to be able to handle this demand, though there are definitely a lot of new users signing up right now.” She added that the site is building a subscription model to aid sustainability, though the site will always be free to use.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite the rapid growth, users are optimistic about the future. “Every influx of users brings with it more voices, some with good intent and some with bad intent, but Bluesky is responsive to the people who use it in ways that encourage people to stick around,” Quint said.&nbsp;“When you compare that to sites where white nationalists organize mass attacks, spending money lets anyone drown out real discussion, and mass disinformation spreads at the whim of a billionaire, Bluesky is clearly the place to be.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President-elect Donald Trump has begun naming members to his White House team, offering a strong signal about the direction he’ll take on important issues, including foreign policy, immigration, and climate. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s picks have included multiple immigration hardliners, underscoring his commitment to proposals like <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies">mass deportation</a>, as well as a number of staffers who hold adversarial stances toward China and Iran and supportive positions of Israel. Notably, most of Trump’s selections are longtime loyalists who could put up less opposition to his policy proposals than staffers did during his first administration. And he’s selected a number of people who have little to no experience in the subject matter they’ll be overseeing. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During his first administration, many of Trump’s Cabinet members oversaw significant changes to the executive branch, including Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who were critical to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/10/labor-secretary-eugene-scalia-faces-blowback-he-curtails-scope-worker-relief-unemployment-crisis/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/10/labor-secretary-eugene-scalia-faces-blowback-he-curtails-scope-worker-relief-unemployment-crisis/">curtailing worker protections</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/19/936225974/the-legacy-of-education-secretary-betsy-devos" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/19/936225974/the-legacy-of-education-secretary-betsy-devos">attempting massive cuts to education spending</a>, respectively. Trump has indicated he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-wins-second-term-policies-de3dcf0f173b42602b258042fd7aaafb">wants to go further</a> and <a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1855692242981155259">move faster this time around</a> and that he wants to ensure he’s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/default/donald-trump-staffs-up-second-term-only-maga-loyalists-need-apply-2024-11-11/">surrounded by like-minded staff</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Below is a rundown of the people Trump has named and the roles these appointees could play.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="tom-homan-former-ice-acting-director-has-been-named-border-czar"><strong>Tom Homan</strong>, <strong>former ICE acting director, has been named “border czar”&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who he is: </strong>Homan was acting ICE director during the first Trump administration and oversaw the implementation of the family separation policy during his tenure from 2017 to 2018. He’s also long backed <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/11/trump-makes-tom-homan-father-of-family-separation-in-charge-of-mass-deportation/">Trump’s desire to deport unauthorized immigrants</a>, previously noting that if invited to join the administration, he intended to “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/11/nx-s1-5186522/tom-homan-border-czar-trump">run the biggest deportation operation this country&#8217;s ever seen</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Homan worked for ICE during former President Barack Obama’s administration as well, and has also served as a police officer and Border Patrol agent. He’s been in lockstep with Trump on implementing punitive immigration policies and called <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tom-homan-trump-border-czar-what-to-know/">for ICE to deport a wide range of unauthorized immigrants</a>, including <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383845/trump-mass-deportations-immigration-family-separation">those who don’t have criminal histories</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Homan will be in charge of all Deportation of Illegal Aliens back to their Country of Origin,&#8221; Trump <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/11/nx-s1-5186522/tom-homan-border-czar-trump">wrote in a Truth Social post.</a> “There is nobody better at policing and controlling our Borders.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The “border czar” is not an official role that requires Senate confirmation;&nbsp;the secretary of homeland security is the actual Cabinet official overseeing the border. However, Homan appears poised to have a major say over policy and will weigh in on proposals at both the northern and southern borders, according to Trump.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Homan’s efforts in the first Trump administration and his commitment to sweeping deportations this term indicate that the president-elect is fully focused on his promise to <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies">remove a large number of unauthorized immigrants from the US</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="trump-policy-aide-stephen-miller-has-been-named-deputy-chief-of-staff-and-policy-adviser"><strong>Trump policy aide Stephen Miller has been named deputy chief of staff and policy adviser</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who he is: </strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/373479/stephen-miller-mass-deportation-camps-trump-agenda">Miller is a staunch Trump loyalist and policy adviser</a> who pushed many of the harshest immigration policies during the president-elect’s first term. He has advocated for a travel ban and family separations in the past, and he’s a chief architect and booster for the idea of the mass deportations Trump has promised this term as well. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“They begin on Inauguration Day, as soon as he takes the oath of office,” <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/11/politics/stephen-miller-trump-administration/index.html">Miller has said of deportations.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has not yet formally announced the appointment, though Vice President-elect JD Vance has already <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1856004703672324263">posted his congratulations to Miller</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>This position is another political appointment that doesn’t require Senate confirmation, but the role is set to focus heavily on providing Trump with policy guidance — likely focused on immigration, given Miller’s expertise.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Between this appointment and Homan’s, Trump has made clear that his <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies">promised mass deportations</a> will be one of his top policy goals when he retakes office.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="kristi-noem-has-been-tapped-for-homeland-security-secretary"><strong>Kristi Noem has been tapped for Homeland Security secretary</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who she is: </strong>The two-term South Dakota governor is a longtime Trump loyalist and was on <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/2/9/24048591/trump-vice-president-pick">his shortlist for the vice presidency</a>. Ahead of Trump making his VP selection, Noem became enmeshed in scandal after she <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24145840/kristi-noem-puppy-killing-book-trump-vp">admitted to shooting her dog, Cricket, because of behavioral issues</a>, generating overwhelming backlash.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As governor, Noem was known for refusing to<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/27/opinion/kristi-noem-south-dakota-coronavirus.html"> impose a mask mandate</a> during the pandemic, and for refusing to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/11/politics/kristi-noem-cpac-south-dakota-governor-covid-mandate/index.html">implement statewide business closures</a> despite public health concerns. Noem was also <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/22/politics/kristi-noem-tribal-lands-ban/index.html">banned by multiple Native American tribes </a>from visiting tribal lands in the state due to claims she’s made that they’ve been infiltrated by cartels.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On immigration, Noem has often echoed Trump’s hardline rhetoric suggesting that <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kristinoem/reel/DCIV983xbLS/?hl=en">many unauthorized immigrants are criminals</a>, and she backed his travel ban targeting Muslim-majority countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>Secretary for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is a significant role given the agency’s notable&nbsp;purview over the administration’s policies at the southern border. DHS includes key subagencies like ICE as well as Customs and Border Protection. The secretary role requires Senate confirmation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Noem is one of several picks that signal Trump’s investment in punitive immigration policies this term such as mass deportation — and aggressive border security.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-1167012750.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,9.8120095111577,100,80.375980977685" alt="Pete Hegseth, a man in a suit and tie" title="Pete Hegseth, a man in a suit and tie" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Fox News host Pete Hegseth | John Lamparski/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="John Lamparski/Getty Images" />
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="pete-hegseth-has-been-tapped-for-secretary-of-defense"><strong>Pete Hegseth has been tapped for secretary of defense</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who he is: </strong>A co-host of Fox News’s <em>Fox and Friends Weekend</em> show, Hegseth is a veteran who previously served in Afghanistan and Iraq but who has little senior national security experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hegseth has taken controversial positions in the past, including advocating for soldiers <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/21/media/fox-news-pete-hegseth-trump-pardon-war-crimes/index.html">who’ve committed war crimes to be pardoned</a> and stating that <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/tv/news/pete-hegseth-defense-cabinet-trump-women-b2646223.html">women shouldn’t be fighting in combat</a>. He’s written multiple books about his military service, often criticizing the military for <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e2e8d60f-7ac3-40a2-a252-5b7ab81622af">“wokeness” and prioritizing diversity</a> — and has said he <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-will-nominate-fox-news-host-pete-hegseth-defense-secretary-2024-11-13/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-will-nominate-fox-news-host-pete-hegseth-defense-secretary-2024-11-13/">supports firing senior leaders who advance these ideas</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hegseth has expressed his support for Israel as well as an adversarial stance toward Iran. In addition to working as a television host, Hegseth previously led the advocacy group Concerned Veterans for America, which is funded by the Koch brothers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Pete is tough, smart and a true believer in America First,” <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-pete-hegseth-defense-secretary/">Trump wrote in a statement</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The Secretary of Defense oversees the military, including the Army, Navy, and Air Force. This person serves as a key adviser to the president on international conflicts and military policy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Past officials in this role have often struggled to work with Trump, with five people cycling through it during his first term — and many of them criticizing his ability to govern.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hegseth would need to be confirmed by the Senate for this role.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Hegseth’s nomination seemed to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-hegseth-defense-secretary-pentagon-2d8030921ecef933778cf92afd40ec72">take many lawmakers and military leaders off guard</a> given his dearth of experience. His inflammatory positions about wokeism in the military and pardoning of war crimes have also spurred concerns.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hegseth is among the many Trump picks poised to be strong defenders of Israel, and who advance a more traditionally conservative viewpoint on foreign policy.&nbsp;Like Trump, however, Hegseth has expressed skepticism of NATO and the contributions of US allies. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="john-ratcliffe-has-been-selected-as-cia-director"><strong>John Ratcliffe has been selected as CIA director</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who he is: </strong>The former director of national intelligence during Trump’s first term, Ratcliffe is another longtime loyalist who’s being elevated in the upcoming administration.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Previously, Ratcliffe helped aid Trump’s efforts to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/us/politics/john-ratcliffe-cia-director-trump.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/us/politics/john-ratcliffe-cia-director-trump.html">investigate President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden </a>in the House, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/30/politics/ratcliffe-unverified-intelligence-concerns/index.html">and was also criticized</a> for declassifying intelligence about Russian operations at Senate Republicans’ behest while serving as the director of national intelligence. Members <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/13/politics/intelligence-agencies-john-ratcliffe/index.html">of the intelligence community told CNN</a> that his past experience and track record made him a less disruptive choice compared to others who may have been considered.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A House lawmaker prior to his time in the first Trump administration, Ratcliffe was known for his fierce defenses of the president-elect during his first impeachment proceedings. He’s also been a vocal critic of the Chinese government’s intelligence operations.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The CIA director oversees the United States’s intelligence-gathering operations around the globe. This official plays a key role in advising the president and overseeing how this intelligence is used.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Ratcliffe is the latest Trump loyalist to be installed in a pivotal position and questions remain about how committed he might be to opposing the president-elect. Trump has called for <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-has-promised-to-overhaul-u-s-intelligence-setting-up-collision-course-with-spy-agencies">an overhaul of intelligence agencies</a> that he’s viewed as challenging his authority.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="marco-rubio-has-been-tapped-for-secretary-of-state"><strong>Marco Rubio has been tapped for secretary of state</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who he is: </strong>Rubio is serving his third term as a Florida senator and is known for his adversarial position toward China, Iran, and Cuba, as well as his focus on <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2020/08/03/how-marco-rubio-runs-trumps-latin-america-policy-1972792">US-Latin American relations</a>. He currently sits on the Senate Intelligence and Foreign Relations Committees, and though he’s taken foreign policy positions aligned with Trump’s isolationist rhetoric lately, he has previously supported international alliances and interventionist approaches.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rubio has also expressed strong support for Israel, and emphasized he isn’t interested in a ceasefire in the region until the country has defeated Hamas. He’s backed Ukraine aid in the past as well, though he opposed more recent packages and has urged an end to the war.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rubio has also shifted considerably on certain issues like immigration: Early in his career, he was a chief proponent of immigration reform in the Senate, including a path to citizenship for <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/marco-rubio-answers-for-his-failed-2013-immigration-plans-again/">unauthorized immigrants,</a> and his rhetoric has grown more hardline and similar to Trump’s over time.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“He will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries,”&nbsp;<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4988992-trump-rubio-secretary-state/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4988992-trump-rubio-secretary-state/">Trump said in a statement.</a> </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>This position is one of the most powerful in the administration and key to shaping US foreign policy. The secretary of state is the chief envoy of the US in other countries, and offers counsel for how to approach different international relationships. Secretaries of state are also often dispatched to help mediate conflict. The role requires Senate confirmation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Like the selection of Rep. Mike Waltz for National Security Adviser,<strong> </strong>Rubio’s naming suggests that Trump may be open to a more traditionally conservative and aggressive approach to foreign policy.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-2173723479.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Michael Waltz" title="Michael Waltz" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="US Rep.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="michael-waltz-has-been-picked-as-national-security-adviser"><strong>Michael Waltz has been picked as national security adviser</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who he is: </strong>A member of Congress from Florida, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-picks-rep-mike-waltz-former-green-beret/story?id=115753630">Waltz is also a former Green Beret</a> who served in Afghanistan. He worked on foreign policy under President George W. Bush, and has sat on the Armed Services, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs Committees in the House.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While on the Hill, Waltz became known for his hardline, aggressive stances on China and Iran and for being a vocal critic of President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from Afghanistan.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The national security adviser is a key foreign policy aide to the president; historically, they provide advice on both military and diplomatic matters. The role does not require Senate confirmation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has clashed heavily with past individuals in this role including John Bolton, who has said<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bolton-excoriates-trump-fresh-introduction-his-memoir-2024-01-30/"> he’s “unfit” to serve as president again.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Waltz is one of multiple hawkish foreign policy picks Trump has made. That suggests the Republican Party wing that advocates for intervention and action on the world stage — rather than the restrained, more isolationist faction — may get a large platform in a second Trump administration.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-2162329710.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Representative Elise Stefanik in a dark blue V-neck dress, standing and smiling in front of a microphone." title="Representative Elise Stefanik in a dark blue V-neck dress, standing and smiling in front of a microphone." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="US Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images" />
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="elise-stefanik-has-been-tapped-for-un-ambassador"><strong>Elise Stefanik has been tapped for UN ambassador</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who she is: </strong>Once a moderate, Stefanik — currently part of Republican House leadership — has become a vocal Trump loyalist in recent years as her New York district shifted right.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/11/19/20966940/elise-stefanik-impeachment-hearing-donald-trump-adam-schiff">Stefanik first burst onto the national stage</a> as a member of the House Intelligence Committee, grilling witnesses as part of Trump’s first impeachment proceeding in the lower chamber in 2019. More recently, she went viral for her questioning of college presidents <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/23/us/elise-stefanik-republican-antisemitism-hearings.html">during a hearing on antisemitism</a> and their handling of student protests over Gaza.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a top House Republican, Stefanik has amplified Trump’s 2020 election denials and hewed so close to the president-elect that she was once on the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/2/9/24048591/trump-vice-president-pick">shortlist for the vice presidency</a>. Stefanik is also known for her <a href="https://www.vox.com/21262150/house-republican-women-candidates">efforts to recruit and support more Republican women</a> for House seats.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She’s taken a pretty standard conservative stance on foreign policy: Stefanik has been a prominent supporter of aid to Israel while balking at continuing support for Ukraine. She backed early tranches of Ukraine aid but joined other Republicans in arguing that more recent aid could be better applied domestically. Stefanik has previously questioned aid to the United Nations, including to its Relief and Works Agency, which has been vital to providing humanitarian aid to Gaza.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Elise is an incredibly strong, tough and smart America First fighter,” <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-chooses-rep-elise-stefanik-serve-us-ambassador-united-nations-rcna179558">Trump said in a statement about the role</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The UN ambassador serves as a vital envoy for US interests; given the country’s financial support for the body and its role on the UN Security Council, the ambassador has major influence regarding how the organization utilizes its resources and who serves in its leadership.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the last year, UN officials have been increasingly critical of Israel’s attacks on Gaza as thousands have died, health care systems have been assaulted, and famine has struck. As ambassador, Stefanik could criticize these positions and call for defunding UN relief programs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This role requires Senate confirmation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>The pick suggests that the Trump administration could once again ramp up its disagreements with the United Nations, after attempting to <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/10/02/trump-stealthily-seeks-to-choke-off-funding-to-un-programs/">curb funding for certain UN initiatives</a> in Trump’s first term. At that time, the administration also pulled out of the UN Human Rights Council, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/us/politics/trump-israel-palestinians-human-rights.html">citing its criticisms of Israel</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Stefanik’s naming could also underscore <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-ukraine-russia-war-threatens-cut-aid-election-2024/">the president-elect’s skepticism</a> of additional aid to Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-2162539091.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Rep.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="matt-gaetz-has-been-tapped-for-attorney-general"><strong>Matt Gaetz has been tapped for attorney general</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who he is:</strong> Gaetz is a conservative firebrand and longtime Trump supporter who is known for his disruptive presence in the House. Previously, he was a chief antagonist of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, and has threatened multiple government shutdowns over concerns that conservative demands weren’t being met on issues like immigration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gaetz has sat on the Armed Services and Judiciary committees in the House and has also faced an investigation over his alleged involvement in sex trafficking of a minor. (The DOJ ultimately declined to charge him.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s announcement of the position centered heavily on Gaetz’s supposed willingness to root out alleged bias toward the president-elect at the agency. “Few issues in America are more important than ending the partisan Weaponization of our Justice System,” <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113477516524300359" data-type="link" data-id="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113477516524300359" rel="nofollow">Trump wrote in a statement on Truth Social</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role:</strong> The attorney general heads the Department of Justice and oversees the enforcement of federal laws. The DOJ conducts investigations of possible violations of these laws and is also responsible for holding federal officials accountable.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Past Trump Attorney General  Jeff Sessions was previously forced out when the president-elect disagreed with <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46132348" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46132348">his handling of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. </a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Gaetz is another Trump loyalist who’s poised to help use the agency in a way that aids the president-elect’s aims. Republicans have long complained of targeting and bias at the DOJ and that could prove to be a major focus of his time there.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="robert-f-kennedy-jr-has-been-tapped-as-health-and-human-services-secretary">Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been tapped as Health and Human Services Secretary</h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The nephew of former President John F. Kennedy Jr. and the son of Robert F. Kennedy, he’s the founder of the Children’s Health Defense, a leading anti-vaccine group, which has spread rampant misinformation on social media. Kennedy is also associated with other odd viewpoints and actions including calls to remove fluoride from water and his decision to <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/365284/robert-f-kennedy-jr-bear-central-park">dump a dead bear in Central Park</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kennedy — who dropped out of the race and ultimately endorsed Trump — founded his campaign upon the idea that he was pushing back against corporate power and the establishment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The Health and Human Services Secretary is an integral figure who establishes public health policy in the US and also oversees other key bodies within the agency like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The HHS Secretary is also tasked with addressing and combating public health emergencies, like a national pandemic. The role requires Senate confirmation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Kennedy is the latest Trump ally being elevated to a role in which he lacks expertise. Kennedy could do serious harm if confirmed as the leader of HHS: Given this platform, he could spread misinformation at a larger scale and contribute to public health crises. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If Kennedy were to completely get his way and deter vaccination, vaccine-preventable diseases like <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23438552/covid-vaccine-refusal-hesitancy-politics-polarization-pandemic-mandates">measles and polio could make a comeback</a>,” <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/381470/trump-rfk-cabinet-hhs-vaccines-health">Vox’s Andrew Prokop previously wrote.</a></p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="lee-zeldin-tapped-as-environmental-protection-agency-administrator"><strong>Lee Zeldin tapped as Environmental Protection Agency administrator</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who he is: </strong>Zeldin is a former Republican House lawmaker who ran a failed campaign for the New York governor’s seat in 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Zeldin did not previously sit on committees focused on environmental policy in the House, and&nbsp;focused on <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/11/09/1134203429/new-york-governor-election-results-kathy-hochul-lee-zeldin">crime and inflation during his gubernatorial run</a>. That year, he came within a notably close margin of Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul as a Republican running in a traditionally blue state.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Zeldin has said some of his <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-taps-lee-zeldin-lead-environmental-protection-agency-rcna179658">first priorities</a> will be to “roll back regulations that are forcing businesses to be able to struggle,” and to work on US “energy dominance.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The EPA is responsible for crafting policies that protect clean water and air, and also plays a major role in approving regulations to combat climate change. The administrator position is a Senate-confirmed role.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Trump promised to take a very different approach to the environment than the Biden administration, including by <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382679/trump-foreign-policy-america-first-tariffs-nato-alliance">exiting international climate agreements</a> and focusing on <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/06/nx-s1-5181891/trump-win-climate-change-fossil-fuels-clean-energy">expanding fossil fuel production</a>. Zeldin’s nomination suggests those promises will be a priority, as will <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/06/nx-s1-5181891/trump-win-climate-change-fossil-fuels-clean-energy">rescinding Biden-era environmental protections</a> that curbed carbon emissions for businesses.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="elon-musk-and-vivek-ramaswamy-will-co-lead-a-new-department-of-government-efficiency"><strong>Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will co-lead a new “Department of Government Efficiency</strong>”</h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who Musk is: </strong>A massive and vocal Trump advocate, Musk has used his platform on X (formerly known as Twitter) to boost the president-elect as well as misinformation about numerous topics, including noncitizen voting and election fraud.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Musk is known for leading several companies, including Tesla and SpaceX, and for increasingly becoming part of Trump’s inner circle. Musk has also faced <a href="https://qz.com/tesla-elon-musk-ev-factory-wage-law-violations-lawsuit-1851391624">allegations of labor violations at his companies</a>, and for past attention-seeking efforts, like trying — and failing — to help a group of <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/7/18/17576302/elon-musk-thai-cave-rescue-submarine">Thai youth trapped in a cave in 2018</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He’ll lead something called the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, alongside former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. The moniker for the department is a nod to the cryptocurrency Musk once endorsed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&#8220;Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies &#8211; Essential to the &#8216;Save America&#8217; Movement,&#8221; Trump wrote in a statement.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-2180840404.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,13.791470441211,100,72.417059117577" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who Ramaswamy is: </strong>A 2024 presidential candidate and biotech entrepreneur, Ramaswamy framed himself as an outsider trying to challenge the establishment during the GOP primary.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ramaswamy also aligned himself closely with Trump during his run, and has made much of his platform dedicated to combating “wokeism.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The Department of Government Efficiency doesn’t currently exist and a new government agency can’t be created without the approval of Congress. It’s likely that this agency will exist outside of the government instead.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s purportedly focused on slashing bureaucracy, government spending, and waste.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>This position speaks to the prominence that Musk has achieved in Trump’s orbit, and Ramaswamy in far-right circles, despite a lack of government and policy experience.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-2182885052.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.729339346038,100,78.541321307924" alt="Susie Wiles shaking hands with Trump onstage at a Trump-Vance rally." title="Susie Wiles shaking hands with Trump onstage at a Trump-Vance rally." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Susie Wiles, Trump’s senior national adviser. | Jabin Botsford/Washington Post via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Jabin Botsford/Washington Post via Getty Images" />
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="susie-wiles-has-been-named-chief-of-staff"><strong>Susie Wiles has been named chief of staff</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who she is: </strong>Wiles, a longtime Florida campaign operative, helped run Trump’s 2016 campaign in the state and was a Trump senior national adviser in 2024. She’s heavily credited for the success he had during the Republican primary in 2024 and had previously aided Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis during his gubernatorial run in 2018 prior to a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/09/ron-desantis-susie-wiles-reaction-00188586">falling out between the two</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wiles has also been a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/07/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-susie-wiles-00188391">corporate lobbyist</a> and worked with a spectrum of Republicans in the past, including former Utah Sen. Mitt Romney and Florida Sen. Rick Scott.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Susie is tough, smart, innovative … universally admired and respected,” <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-susie-wiles-chief-of-staff/">Trump said in a statement</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The chief of staff is effectively a gatekeeper who helps shape the president’s priorities and offers policy counsel. The position is the most prominent political appointee in the White House and is not Senate confirmed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Notably, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/22/politics/trump-fascist-john-kelly/index.html">Trump’s former Chief of Staff John Kelly</a> has been a major Trump critic, describing him as a “fascist” who favors a “dictator approach.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Wiles <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/who-is-susie-wiles-the-woman-behind-trumps-historic-return-to-the-oval-office">has been credited</a> with professionalizing Trump’s campaign operations and reining in some of the chaos that has marked his past operations. That said, his campaign was still <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/12/30/trump-poisoning-the-blood-racism">rife with racist remarks</a> that echoed authoritarians as well as frequent lies <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/31/politics/donald-trump-kamala-harris-black-nabj/index.html">about former Vice President Kamala Harris’s </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mveuxlccbV0">policies and identity</a>. Kelly has said he <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/11/trump-susie-wiles-chief-staff-campaign/">attempted to restrain the president</a> during his first term, though it was still plagued by in-fighting and tumultuous policies on everything from climate to immigration.&nbsp;</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">President-elect Donald Trump and his allies have made clear — including through stated <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/president-trumps-plan-to-protect-children-from-left-wing-gender-insanity">policy positions</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/riley-gaines-recounts-sharing-locker-room-transgender-athlete-trump-rally-exposed-exploited">chosen campaign surrogates</a> — that his administration intends to bar trans athletes from playing on school sports teams that match their gender identity. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The president bans it,” Trump <a href="https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-interview-town-hall-harris-faulkner-fox-news-georgia-october-16-2024/">said at a Fox News event in Georgia last month</a>. “You just don’t let it happen. Not a big deal.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump and other Republicans have primarily <a href="https://burchett.house.gov/media/press-releases/burchett-votes-bill-protect-female-athletes-under-title-ix">threatened the participation of trans girls in K-12 sports programs</a>, though college athletes wouldn’t be immune from any action Trump decides to take. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s threats raise the question: Could he challenge trans athletes’ right to compete in school sports?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How would Trump enact such a ban?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The short answer is yes. Trump could strip away civil rights and nondiscrimination <a href="https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-releases-final-title-ix-regulations-providing#:~:text=The%20final%20rule%20requires%20schools,and%20not%20otherwise%20impermissible%20evidence.">protections enumerated under the Biden administration,</a> which specifically apply to trans students.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The executive branch has a lot of control over what counts as discrimination in education, thanks to <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1681">Title IX</a>, a civil rights law originally meant to advance women’s equality. The Biden administration took the position that the law’s protections against discrimination “on the basis of sex” mean that discrimination against trans students on the basis of their trans identity qualifies as sex discrimination. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That interpretation of the law faced legal challenges and has been rejected by about half of the states. The Trump administration can — and likely will — simply take the stance that Title IX offers no protections to trans students. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Trump administration’s interpretation of Title IX could go even further by arguing that “​​it is discriminatory against girls to have trans athletes participating in girls’ sports,” according to Jon Valant, director of the Brown Center on Education Policy at the Brookings Institution. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There could be new legal battles over Title IX if Democratic governors and attorneys general moved to stop the new interpretation —&nbsp;essentially the reverse of the current Title IX landscape.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, the administration could go through Congress and try to rewrite Title IX, explicitly stating those positions rather than merely interpreting the current law that way, Valant said. Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN) already proposed a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-joint-resolution/165/text?s=2&amp;r=1">law in July undoing the Biden-era regulations</a>. Trump has also said he will ask Congress to pass a bill stating that <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-vows-stop-gender-affirming-care-minors-re-elected-president-rcna68461">only two genders exist</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Republicans will hold narrow majorities in both the House and the Senate. It’s possible that such a bill could pass, though it would likely face some difficulty in the Senate, where <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/expect-hear-f-word-lot-us-senate-next-year-2024-11-13/">Republicans lack a filibuster-proof majority</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Outside of federal action, some states like <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/02/1002405412/on-the-first-day-of-pride-month-florida-signed-a-transgender-athlete-bill-into-l">Florida</a> already have bans against transgender students participating in school sports. Under that law, only people <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/01/politics/florida-transgender-sports-ban-ron-desantis/index.html">assigned female at birth can play on girls’ sports teams</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These kinds of laws could be stepping stones in dismantling trans people’s right to nondiscrimination in schools and the workplace, as well as their ability to access health care, Gillian Branstetter, communications strategist at the ACLU’s Women’s Rights Project and LGBTQ &amp; HIV Project, told Vox. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I can&#8217;t think of a single state or politician that has adopted this issue that has decided that they&#8217;re just going to narrowly focus on the rights of transgender athletes,” Branstetter said. “They have, using the exact same legal arguments, using the exact same legislative language, and usually using the exact same lawyers, also used these [tactics] to ban gender-affirming health care, to restrict what bathrooms trans people can use, and a long litany of other restrictions.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-which-countries-have-sent-the-most-delegates-to-cop29/?utm_content=buffer847ea&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">more than 66,000</a> world leaders, negotiators, delegates, and observers meet this week in Baku, Azerbaijan at the <a href="https://cop29.az/en/home">COP29 climate summit</a> in what’s shaping up to be the <a href="https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/2024-track-be-hottest-year-record-warming-temporarily-hits-15degc">hottest year on record</a>, they’re facing a one-two-punch of grim news: greenhouse gas emissions are still climbing, and one of the world’s largest carbon dioxide polluters — yes, the US — is likely to back out of the process altogether.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And after Donald Trump’s win in the 2024 United States presidential election, the US — the world’s second-largest greenhouse gas emitter — is poised to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/13/nx-s1-5181963/trump-promises-more-drilling-in-the-u-s-to-boost-fossil-fuel-production">extract more fossil fuels</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/trumps-transition-team-aims-kill-biden-ev-tax-credit-2024-11-14/">pull back clean technology incentives</a>, and may once again <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/10/trump-withdrawal-paris-agreement-different-00188002">withdraw the country from the Paris agreement</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To meet international climate targets under the Paris climate agreement, global greenhouse gas emissions need to be falling fast. Yet humanity’s output is on track to reach another record high this year, up 0.8 percent from last year, according to a new report this week from <a href="https://globalcarbonbudget.org/about/">Global Carbon Budget</a>, a research unit at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom. This trajectory means that the goal of capping the rise of global average temperatures below 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) is <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/1/3/21045263/climate-change-1-5-degrees-celsius-target-ipcc">almost completely out of reach</a>.&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The conference, where countries hammer out the details of how they will do their share to address climate change, is already off to a rocky start, struggling <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/energy-transition/111124-cop29-row-over-eus-cbam-stalls-day-one-progress-in-baku">just to adopt an agenda</a>. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b06ee7d7-bfd2-4fbf-8867-922d87ca49a0">France and Argentina</a> have also withdrawn their top negotiators.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We’ve just had the hottest day, the hottest months, the hottest years, and the hottest decade in the history books,” UN Secretary-General António Guterres told the conference. “Climate disasters are piling up — harming those who’ve done the least, the most.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So at a time when the world needs to be doing more than ever to limit warming, transition to clean energy, and adapt to the unavoidable shifts underway, momentum is slowing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet it hasn’t stopped. Though emissions are rising, their rate of increase is slowing down, and a <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24139383/climate-change-peak-greenhouse-gas-emissions-action">decline may be on the horizon</a>. <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/372852/solar-power-energy-growth-record-us-climate-china">Wind and solar power are still surging</a> and electric vehicles are <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2024/trends-in-electric-cars">gaining market share</a>. Even with diminished political will, the trends are moving in the right direction for the climate. But progress is fragile and far too slow.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s driving up global emissions right now?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last year, <a href="https://climateanalytics.org/publications/when-will-global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-peak">Climate Analytics</a>, a think tank, anticipated that there was a 70 percent chance that global emissions would begin to decline this year. The new Carbon Budget findings show that the world is more likely to be in the 30 percent scenario. “I think their analysis is generally really robust and sound,” said <a href="https://climateanalytics.org/team/neil-grant">Neil Grant</a>, a researcher at Climate Analytics. “There is still some chance that emissions might fall this year, but it certainly looks very unlikely.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Digging into the top-line greenhouse gas emissions number reveals a complicated story behind why emissions are up.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The big reason is that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/20/climate/fossil-fuel-emissions-record-climate-intl/index.html">fossil fuel consumption is up</a>. Oil and gas account for the bulk of this increase in emissions, with coal a distant third. While greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere are rising, their output is level or falling from some of the largest historical emitters. The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_5605">European Union’s emissions are declining</a>. <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/total.php">US emissions</a> are holding steady. China, the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, is on track to see its output grow by just <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-global-co2-emissions-will-reach-new-high-in-2024-despite-slower-growth/">0.2 percent this year</a>, one of the tiniest increases in years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bucking this trend are many developing countries like India, currently the world’s third-largest emitter. India has seen a huge increase in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/india-gets-386-bln-financial-commitment-expand-renewable-capacity-2024-09-16/">renewable energy deployment</a>, but its still developing energy from all sources, including fossil fuels. The Global Carbon Budget found India’s fossil fuel emissions are on track to increase 4.6 percent this year. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are a few additional factors that drove up emissions this year. The lingering effects of <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24145756/la-nina-2024-el-nino-heat-hurricane-record-temperature-pacific">El Niño</a> helped push global temperatures to record highs. Extraordinary heat waves in <a href="https://apnews.com/article/india-heatwave-deaths-heat-stroke-climate-change-880f26e3b8eeb066d2db2308502783d2">India</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinese-megacity-limits-outdoor-lighting-record-heat-strains-grid-2024-08-06/">China</a> pushed up energy demand for cooling, and that meant burning more fossil fuels. “We&#8217;re beginning to see some of those negative feedback loops where the climate crisis itself is impacting on the energy system and making it harder to reduce emissions,” Grant said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, there are glimmers of good news. More than 30 countries have already managed to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23447414/degrowth-decoupling-carbon-emissions-economic-growth">grow their economies while cutting carbon dioxide pollution</a>, a clear sign that coal, oil, and natural gas are not the only paths to prosperity. These countries have already summited their <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24139383/climate-change-peak-greenhouse-gas-emissions-action">emissions peaks</a> and are now on the descent, breaking a pattern that has held for nearly two centuries.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Most countries in the world, even if they haven&#8217;t peaked yet, you see that the trajectory is approaching peak, and in countries where emissions are declining, usually they&#8217;re declining faster,” said Pierre Friedlingstein, a researcher at the University of Exeter who led the Global Carbon Budget report. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s bending the curve? Friedlingstein said it’s because countries are switching to cleaner energy sources. That means turning away from carbon-spewing coal toward natural gas, which emits about half of the greenhouse gasses per unit of energy, or using energy from the sun and the wind, which emits close to none. Electrifying vehicles so they don’t have to burn oil is another key factor. Increasing energy efficiency is also negating rising energy demand.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Government policies initially drove these trends, but now economics have started to take the wheel. Tactics to reduce greenhouse gas emissions often save money and energy sources like wind and solar power are often the cheapest way to put electrons on the power grid.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s important to note that burning fossil fuels isn’t the only way humanity is increasing carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere; damaging and destroying landscapes that absorb carbon — forests, mangroves, wetlands, prairies — also lead to a net increase in greenhouse gasses. Carbon dioxide isn’t the only greenhouse gas of note either. <a href="https://www.vox.com/22613532/climate-change-methane-emissions">Methane</a>, which is about 30 times more potent when it comes to trapping heat, is also contributing to warming. It can leak from natural gas infrastructure and is also a byproduct of agriculture. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Conversely, restoring ecosystems that soak up emissions from the air can keep warming in check. <a href="https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/24114997/amazon-rainforest-deforestation-hope">Unchecked deforestation is slowing down</a> in many parts of the world and in others, it’s beginning to reverse. “The long-term trend in forestation is going in the right direction,” Friedlingstein said. “This is what helps to balance the book with fossil fuel emissions.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Where greenhouse gas emissions go is up to us now</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While greenhouse gas emissions are now increasing at a tiny fraction of their pace throughout much of the industrial era, there’s no sign at the moment that they’ve reached a peak, nor a guarantee that they will decline.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Friedlingstein said we may be in an era where emissions plateau, still adding to the volume of heat trapping gasses in the atmosphere at the highest levels in history. And a plateau could stretch on for a long time. <a href="https://environmentamerica.org/center/articles/ai-is-putting-googles-clean-energy-future-at-risk/">Environmental groups</a> have raised the alarm that the ravenous <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/2024/3/28/24111721/climate-ai-tech-energy-demand-rising">power demand from data centers behind artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies</a> would spike emissions upward again, but much of that demand could still be met with renewable energy or<a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/383547/nuclear-power-google-amazon-restart-energy"> nuclear power</a>, and so far, they haven’t led to a carbon dioxide spike.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the other hand, countries can take deliberate steps to bend emissions curves downward at a faster rate. Countries need to set ambitious climate goals for themselves, invest in cleaner energy alternatives, and hold themselves accountable. “In a sense, it&#8217;s a simple recipe,” Friedlingstein said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In practice, it remains an extraordinary challenge.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many countries are coping with inflation, making it harder to invest in big projects. Some are worried about securing their energy resources amid fears of international conflict, like how <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/2023/2/21/23594544/europe-electricity-natural-gas-renewable-energy-russia">Russia’s invasion of Ukraine disrupted natural gas</a> supplies in Europe. Many parts of the world experiencing the most acute damages from climate change are also those that contributed the least to the problem and have the fewest resources to adapt to it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Clean energy needs to scale up further as well. So does energy efficiency. About <a href="https://apnews.com/article/renewable-energy-climate-solar-wind-fossil-fuels-2718fce0ed37232dc25dbf46fff87955">30 percent of global electricity</a> came from low-emissions sources in 2023. “While renewables have grown fast, demand has grown faster,” said Grant. “And we know that the tipping point of peaking will come when renewables grow faster than energy demand growth.” He added that the distribution of clean energy technology so far has skewed mainly toward wealthy countries and not those facing the largest increases in energy demand, biggest spikes in air pollution, and worst impacts of climate change.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The United Nations’s Independent High Level Expert Group on Climate Finance estimated that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-talks-urged-find-1-trillion-year-poorer-countries-2024-11-14/">poorer countries will need $1.3 trillion per year by 2035</a> to deal with global warming. This is once again shaping up to be one of the biggest sticking points at COP29 as negotiators suss out who is to pay how much and by when. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though the world is likely to miss one of the most ambitious climate targets, the case for curbing greenhouse gas emissions remains strong. Every bit of averted warming — every degree or even fraction of a degree — reduces damages, saves money, and protects lives.&nbsp;The open question is how much we’ll do to change course.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Friday night, two boxers will take to the ring at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. One is among the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time, the “<a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/sports/other-sports/2024/11/13/mike-tyson-jake-paul-fight-netflix-att-stadium-press-conference">baddest man on the planet</a>,” “Iron” Mike Tyson. The other is Jake Paul, a zillennial influencer who built his career on prank videos, making bad music, and <a href="https://www.mic.com/articles/182398/social-media-star-jake-paul-accused-of-turning-la-neighborhood-into-a-living-hell-and-war-zone">terrorizing his neighbors</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One might reasonably wonder what chance the internet’s most obnoxious star, a cruiserweight, stands against Tyson; one might also reasonably wonder how a 58-year-old, no matter how practiced, could beat a man 31 years younger. But to overfocus on the mechanics of boxing or of athleticism in general is to miss the point. If all audiences wanted to see was the world’s best boxers fighting each other, well, those matches would probably enjoy much more hype. Instead, the lion’s share of the attention goes to the rash of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/why-the-best-boxers-dont-draw-the-biggest-crowds">influencers-turned-boxers</a> who concoct feuds with each other and solve them with their fists.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Paul and Tyson now occupy this much newer realm of the world’s oldest sport: celebrities whose controversial pasts provide ammo for a public who has strong feelings about both. While Friday’s match is a professional one (meaning it is <a href="https://www.dazn.com/en-GB/news/boxing/what-is-the-difference-between-professional-and-amateur-boxing/1gxo81gf7g3vu1sdc4b9dh4kvw">regulated by a sanctioning body</a>, will count on their records, and can be betted on, at least in certain states), it will be more spectacle than sport. Organized by Paul’s promotion company, Most Valuable Promotions, and Netflix, which will stream the match live, it’s also part of the streaming service’s attempt to reach young male viewers and the advertisers who want to woo them. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The match is expected to be a ratings hit, in part thanks to Netflix’s estimated 282 million subscribers, the largest of any platform. Originally scheduled for July, the match was postponed to November after Tyson had an ulcer flare-up on a flight. Paul, due to his age and recent record (10 wins, one loss, and seven knockouts) was already <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10142607-mike-tyson-vs-jake-paul-br-staff-predictions">a favorite to win</a>, but now the betting odds are even more in his favor, currently standing at minus-210, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/mike-tyson-jake-paul-fight-47348cf07fc56edfd74cf3e6f5e0d0e5">per BetMGM Sportsbook</a>.&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tyson’s participation has led to controversy: Eddie Hearn, one of the industry’s biggest promoters, <a href="https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/42293726/jake-paul-mike-tyson-boxing-fight-sanctioned-safety">told ESPN</a> he won’t support the fight due to the danger it could further cause to Tyson’s health. &#8220;That was the moment they [MVP] should have realized that this was actually a bad idea,” he said of the ulcer. &#8220;You only need to speak to him and look at him to know this guy should not be in a ring again. &#8230; If I was Jake Paul, I&#8217;d just feel a little bit embarrassed to be honest with you. &#8230; This is dangerous, irresponsible and, in my opinion, disrespectful to the sport of boxing.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nakisa Bidarian, co-founder of Most Valuable Promotions, however, maintains it will be a fair fight. “Paul&#8217;s never been hit by someone like Mike Tyson,” he told ESPN. “So people can say about the danger for Mike Tyson, he&#8217;s older. What about the danger for Jake Paul, who&#8217;s never fought at this weight? He&#8217;s never been in there with a true heavyweight in his career. You could say it to both sides.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s worth asking: What’s in it for everyone involved here? Paul has made his incentives explicit: “I’m here to make $40 million and knock out a legend,” <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/boxing/2024/10/31/jake-paul-mike-tyson-fight-purse-money-netflix/75963160007/">he said</a> at an August news conference (<a href="https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/richest-comedians/jake-paul-net-worth/">Paul’s net worth</a> is reportedly around $80 million). Tyson, according to reports, will stand to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/boxing/mike-tyson-jake-paul-purse-32383186">earn around half of that</a>, doubling his <a href="https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-athletes/richest-boxers/mike-tyson-net-worth/">reported</a> net worth of $10 million. In addition to the payout, Paul made a video announcing he’d pay Tyson $5 million if Tyson can last more than four rounds. Should he fail, Tyson must get a tattoo that reads, “I love Jake Paul.” (Tyson responded <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/boxing/2024/10/10/mike-tyson-jake-paul-5-million-incentive/75612344007/">in an interview</a> that he’d only agree to another $20 million.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As for Tyson, it’s yet another attempt at a return to the spotlight in a career full of them. “This fight is not going to change my life financially,” he <a href="https://www.unilad.com/news/sport/mike-tyson-jake-paul-fight-money-352727-20241108">told LadBible</a>. “I’m seeking my glory.” After his release from prison in 1995, he fought in a series of comeback matches, including one with Evander Holyfield, whom he would later <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1997/07/14/mike-tyson-kid-dynamite-blows-up">bite on both ears</a> in one of the most controversial moments in sports history. In the mid-2000s, his $300 million earnings squandered and bankrupt, Tyson announced a series of exhibition fights to “get out of this financial quagmire,” he <a href="https://www.espn.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2606686">said at the time</a>, though it was canceled after just one fight. Tyson last fought in a 2020 exhibition match against 2003 World Heavyweight champion Roy Jones Jr., and now runs a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/16/nyregion/mike-tyson-weed-cannabis-nyc.html">successful cannabis company</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Netflix, meanwhile, has been pushing heavily into live events over the last year. In January, it acquired the rights to WWE&#8217;s <em>Raw</em>, and earlier this year, it livestreamed the SAG Awards for the first time, as well as other live events like the<em> Roast of Tom Brady</em>, Joey Chestnut’s Labor Day hot dog eating contest, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24153957/john-mulaney-comeback-everybodys-in-la-netflix-live-comedy-specials-week">John Mulaney’s talk show</a>. On Christmas Day it will stream two NFL games. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rich Greenfield, a partner at LightShed Ventures who analyzes the streaming space, says it could be a “powerful tool” in the company’s bid for advertisers. “If you’re going to be in the ad business, the power of something that has to be watched at that moment and brings together millions of people is really important for advertising,” Greenfield said. Rather than buying up the streaming rights to, say, all of the big sports organizations, or major awards like the Oscars or Grammys, Netflix’s strategy appears to be creating smaller, less costly moments of their own. “Netflix already has the subscribers. It’s now about creating unique events to drive advertising sales,” Greenfield says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those advertisers are after a core demographic: men, particularly young men who pay attention to influencers like Paul. These young men don’t necessarily follow boxing, but they do find recognizable faces compelling. As Brady Brickner-Wood explained in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/11/magazine/celebrity-influencers-boxing.html">the New York Times Magazine</a> last year, “Influencer boxers know something boxing purists don’t: that a fight without a narrative, no matter how poetic its execution, is just a hollow technical exercise.” No doubt there’s also another draw for viewers who know of Paul and his ilk but don’t necessarily like them: “When you buy a Jake Paul fight, part of what you are buying is the chance to see him get punched in the face,” Kelefa Sanneh wrote in <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/why-the-best-boxers-dont-draw-the-biggest-crowds">the New Yorker</a> last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In anticipation for the fight, Netflix released a three-episode docuseries following Tyson and Paul as they prepare for battle. It is, of course, mere marketing: The nastier elements of Paul and Tyson’s pasts are glossed over. It does not mention the fact that Tyson was convicted of raping an 18-year-old in 1992 for which he served three years in jail, or that he was <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/boxing/2024/11/01/mike-tyson-rape-civil-lawsuit/75916757007/">recently sued for</a> raping another woman in 1990. It doesn’t include the fact that he is alleged to have physically abused his former wife, actress Robin Givens; one biography reports that Tyson admitted to having hit her and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-06-23-sp-2706-story.html">calling it</a> “the best punch I’ve ever thrown in my life.” Rather, the series shows a few clips of Tyson in handcuffs while the voiceover refers to “his life continu[ing] to spiral downward.” (Paul was also fined for <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/15/jake-paul-business-empire-youtube-walmart-w-anti-fund-venture-capital/">promoting a crypto scam</a> and has been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/13/jake-paul-justine-paradise/">accused of sexual assault</a> by fellow influencer Justine Paradise as well as model and actress <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/22/style/jake-paul-team-10.html">Railey Lollie</a>.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead, viewers will discover that the idea for the match was born from an ayahuasca ceremony Paul attended in Costa Rica, where he had a vision of himself fighting Tyson. It then shows Paul meditating and repeating to himself, “I, Jake Joseph Paul, will knock out and defeat Iron Mike Tyson.” He then reached out to Tyson, who enthusiastically agreed, according to Paul.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In one of its opening scenes, the docuseries asks, “Why fight when you have all the fame and money in the world?” The answer, naturally, is that no amount of fame and money are ever enough for people who stake their lives on such things. To be a celebrity in 2024 is to understand that the world moves on the moment people scroll away from your face, that your singular role is to produce an ever-increasing mountain of content so that your face might find them again. Though Paul and Tyson occupy vastly different places in modern pop culture, they both understand that fame and money are perhaps the only things worth getting punched in the face for.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.farmkind.giving/the-small-farm-myth-debunked">Nearly all</a> farmed animals in the US live on <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census">mega factory farms</a>, where they’re mutilated without pain relief and fattened up in dark, overcrowded warehouses before being shipped off to the slaughterhouse. Only a tiny sliver of livestock are actually reared on the small, higher-welfare farms that many companies conjure on their packaging with quaint red barns and green rolling hills — and even those operations can be rife with <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/04/alexandre-farms-treatment-of-animals/677980/">animal suffering</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the summer, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) had an opportunity to fix the false advertising problem pervasive in the meat aisle when it published <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media_file/documents/FSIS-GD-2024-0006.pdf">updated guidelines</a> that companies must follow when making animal welfare claims on their labels. Instead, its new guidance barely changed anything. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The updated rules “remain insufficient to combat misleading label claims used to market meat and poultry products,” as the nonprofit Animal Welfare Institute <a href="https://awionline.org/press-releases/usdas-revised-food-label-guidelines-insufficient-protect-consumers-animals">put it</a>, allowing companies “to essentially make up their own definitions with no repercussions.” (The one improvement, the organization noted, was a clearer definition of the term “pasture raised,” though that label remains poorly enforced and does not guarantee animals were raised humanely.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s how the USDA’s guidelines work: If a meat company wants to make an animal welfare or environment-related claim on its packaging, it must fill out a form with an illustration of its label and an explanation as to how the animals are raised to justify the claim; how the company will ensure the claim is valid from birth to slaughter to sale; and whether or not an independent, third-party organization certified the claim, which is optional. The USDA never conducts surprise audits, or any audits at all, to verify the company is telling the truth. It is, in essence, an honor system.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The USDA also has an incredibly low, and often nonsensical, bar for what passes as humane treatment.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The agency states, for example, that a chicken company can use the term “humanely raised” if it feeds its birds an all-vegetarian diet, which has virtually no bearing on their welfare (chickens are omnivores).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similarly, the agency says pork can be labeled “humanely raised” if the company provides its pigs with “proper shelter and rest areas.” By that definition, standard factory farms — which produce practically <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census">all US pork</a> — are humane because they provide ample shelter in the form of vast, crowded warehouses where the animals have nothing to do but rest on the same concrete flooring where they defecate and urinate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think that a lot of this is out of touch with what consumers are really thinking these claims mean,” <a href="https://www.richmanlawpolicy.com/team/p.-ren%C3%A9e-wicklund">P. Renée Wicklund</a>, co-founder of Richman Law &amp; Policy — a law firm that takes meat, dairy, and egg companies to court over false claims — told me.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the last decade, the Animal Welfare Institute has requested from the USDA the applications that meat companies submitted for <a href="https://awionline.org/sites/default/files/publication/digital_download/Deceptive-Consumer-Labels-2023.pdf">97 animal welfare claims</a>. For the overwhelming majority of them, there were either no records at all or the justifications for the labels had little to no relevance to animal welfare.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The USDA declined an interview request for this story and didn’t directly respond to numerous detailed questions. Instead, it sent a statement that read in part: “USDA continues to deliver on its commitment to fairness and choice for both farmers and consumers, and that means supporting transparency and high-quality standards.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To be fair to the agency, it doesn’t have the authority to conduct on-farm audits, which would require an act of Congress. But it does have authority to define animal welfare claims, an authority it rarely exercises. Instead, it allows companies to define animal welfare claims themselves. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The USDA also added it “strongly encourages” companies to validate animal welfare claims using third-party certifiers — private organizations that audit conditions on farms and license the use of their own humane labels. But a recent undercover investigation into one of the nation’s biggest “humane-certified” poultry companies shows how low third-party certification standards can be.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Chickens kicked and run over with forklifts: Inside a “humane-certified” poultry farm</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Foster Farms, the <a href="https://www.wattpoultryusa-digital.com/wattpoultryusa/march_april_2024/MobilePagedArticle.action?articleId=1959948#articleId1959948">11th largest</a> chicken company in the US, <a href="https://www.harristeeter.com/p/foster-farms-popcorn-chicken/0007527899547?fulfillment=PICKUP&amp;storecode=09700404&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw9p24BhB_EiwA8ID5BqphZYS41HAqhqsOkAPxj2wvtmIVi1P2V5jomuCRBUqLFdnbUA4U3RoCrpQQAvD_BwE">advertises</a> meat from animals raised with supposedly “better care.” On its packaging, chickens are shown roaming free on pasture, even though the company’s conventionally raised birds will never step foot onto grass. On its website, Foster Farms says its farming is “safe, sustainable, and humane” and that its chickens are “raised on local West Coast farms” with “strenuous, high standards.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The company also promotes its chicken as “cage free” with “no added hormones or steroids ever.” But touting these aspects is misleading because chickens raised for meat in the US <a href="https://www.chickencheck.in/farm-to-table/are-broiler-chickens-raised-in-cages/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.chickencheck.in/farm-to-table/are-broiler-chickens-raised-in-cages/">are not kept in cages</a> — only those raised for eggs are — and it’s illegal to feed chickens hormones or steroids.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“They’re feel-good words, but they don&#8217;t have any real meaning,” veterinarian <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gail-Hansen">Gail Hansen</a> told Vox.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This summer, an undercover investigator with the animal rights group Animal Outlook worked for a month on the company’s catch crew, a job that entails grabbing chickens on farms, stuffing them into crates, and loading them onto trucks bound for the slaughterhouse.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the course of more than a dozen shifts at multiple Foster Farms facilities, the investigator — who requested anonymity due to the covert nature of undercover investigations — <a href="https://animaloutlook.org/investigations/foster-farms-2024/">documented</a> workers slamming birds into crates, kicking and hitting chickens, and numerous instances of forklift drivers running over birds.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The investigator recalled making eye contact with a bird shortly after they were run over by a forklift. “They were being crushed and everything was being pushed forward, and they had their beak open, and they had this look on their face like they knew that they were dying,” the investigator told me. “And then I watched them flap and struggle for a moment before passing.” </p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“From a veterinary perspective, some of the things are just horrific,” Hansen said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The investigator chalked up most of the cruelty to the chaotic, fast-paced work environment imposed by supervisors during long, grueling shifts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Foster Farms did not respond to a list of detailed questions but did send a press release detailing how it had fired several employees and reported them to Fresno County law enforcement. The<strong> </strong>company said it has retrained employees on animal welfare, created additional animal welfare roles, and will increase the frequency of its audits.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Put simply, the conduct was counter to everything we stand for as a company, and our actions ensure those responsible are held accountable,” wrote Randy Boyce, general counsel for Foster Farms.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://animaloutlook.org/cheryl-leahy/">Cheryl Leahy</a>, who was executive director of Animal Outlook when the investigation was released but has since left the organization, said the company’s problems go much deeper than just a few employees.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cruelty is “woven into the culture,” Leahy said. “It is a feature, not a bug. It is a business practice. There is a decision made to go with volume and speed” over animal welfare.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent years, the USDA has cited Foster Farms for <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6318c476cc6cdb6a4beac1b7/t/64501577a3ba890f01152bb0/1682969980414/Animal+Partisan+v.+American+Humane+-+Complaint+%26+Appendices+%28Final%29.pdf">18 incidents</a> of violating federal animal welfare laws. Numerous other <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBZW2FKs8qs">investigations</a> into Foster Farms <a href="https://animalequality.org/campaign/end-factory-farming/baby-chicks-factory-farms/">facilities</a> have found <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23647682/factory-farming-dxe-criminal-trial-rescue">cruel conditions</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsfbrfeIEJk">practices</a> that, to be fair to the company, have also been documented across the US poultry industry.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Foster Farms’ announced reforms in response to Animal Outlook’s latest investigation are unlikely to do much to improve overall conditions, Leahy said. It has already taken similar actions — penalizing workers and increasing training — in the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/graphic-undercover-video-shows-mutilation-suffocation-other-alleged-abuse-of-foster-farm-turkey-chicks/">wake</a> of <a href="https://time.com/3925835/foster-farms-mercy-for-animals-abuse-chickens-investigation-graphic-video/">previous investigations</a>. More importantly, the company’s animal welfare standards are already at rock bottom, in line with the rest of the chicken industry.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But you wouldn’t know that from its marketing or its “American Humane” certification.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How misleading marketing — enabled by the USDA — tricks consumers</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For years, Foster Farms has bolstered its humane image through a certification from the nonprofit American Humane&nbsp;— the kind of third-party organization that the USDA “strongly encourages” meat companies making humane claims to work with. As of the late 2010s, the company paid American Humane <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/daily-dicta-mayer-brown-wins-071813522.html?guccounter=1">$375,000 annually</a> for its certification, and a lawsuit claimed that American Humane would give Foster Farms <a href="https://adlawdefense.com/attempts-to-enforcement-humane-treatment-of-poultry-fail/">seven to 14 days’ notice</a> of an audit, allowing them to prepare for the visits.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Animal advocacy groups like Animal Outlook argue that American Humane’s standards largely mirror that of the typical chicken factory farm, not the higher-welfare conditions a consumer would reasonably expect.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hansen, the veterinarian, echoed that sentiment: “The daylight between them is pretty narrow.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">American Humane’s “standards are not meant to actually bring these companies up to a level of palatability for the public,” Leahy said. “What they&#8217;re trying to do is stop the criticism.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A <a href="https://www.bermanco.com/people/jack-hubbard/">former American Humane executive</a> is now an owner and partner of a PR firm that defends factory farm interests and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cultivated-meat-pr-cew-center-environment-welfare-berman/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.wired.com/story/cultivated-meat-pr-cew-center-environment-welfare-berman/">executive director</a> of a related pro-factory farming organization. American Humane did not respond to multiple requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/ca-court-of-appeal/2112707.html">2015 class-action lawsuit</a>, alleging that Foster Farms misleads consumers with its American Humane Certified label, demonstrates how the USDA’s low standards enable such deception: In a 2018 decision, a three-judge panel rejected an appeal in part because the USDA had already <a href="https://www.mayerbrown.com/-/media/files/news/2021/02/foster-farms-beats-bid-to-revive-humane-labeling-suit.pdf%3Frev=14bd26808d47478fac27384a38264034">approved the label</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The Foster Farms of the world can say, ‘Look, this was approved by a government agency,’” Wicklund said. (Wicklund’s law firm, Richman Law &amp; Policy, has represented and co-counseled with Animal Outlook in meat labeling lawsuits; <a href="https://organicconsumers.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/4.10.24-Foster-Farms-Complaint.pdf">earlier this year</a>, it filed a legal complaint against Foster Farms over its animal welfare claims, which is ongoing.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The recently released Animal Outlook investigation reported that Foster Farms employees — and, according to the undercover investigator, its supervisors, too — did violate some of American Humane’s poultry handling standards, which are laid out in a dense <a href="https://www.americanhumane.org/app/uploads/2021/08/Broiler-Chickens-Full-Standards.pdf">115-page document</a>. However, Foster Farms remains certified by American Humane — when companies are in violation of the organization’s standards, there are seemingly no penalties. They have to fill out a form explaining how they’ll meet full compliance in the future and alert American Humane when that’s been done. Companies can still obtain certification even if they don’t fully pass their annual audit. (And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpAVL5bLNOc">numerous investigations</a> into poultry companies have found that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jvjqO9I9LI">rough handling</a> appears to be the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPkWABw0KFk&amp;rco=1">industry norm</a>, not the exception).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While some <a href="https://www.vox.com/22838160/animal-welfare-labels-meat-dairy-eggs-humane-humanewashing">animal certification programs</a> do set standards above the industry norm, what makes especially weak third-party certifications like American Humane&#8217;s so fundamentally inadequate — and deceptive — is that they permit the worst systemic abuses of poultry farming: cruel breeding practices, overcrowding, and especially inhumane slaughter methods.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Virtually all chickens raised for meat in the US have been bred to grow <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21437054/chickens-factory-farming-animal-cruelty-welfare">so big so fast</a> that they’re in constant pain. Many have difficulty walking or even standing and are <a href="https://www.thepoultrysite.com/articles/mortality-patterns-associated-with-commercial-broiler-production">more likely to suffer</a> from leg deformities, heart attacks, and other health issues when compared to heritage breeds that grow at a normal pace. Animal Outlook’s investigator alleged that many of the birds in the Foster Farms operations couldn’t walk and that some had broken legs. American Humane’s standards allow for these rapid-growth chickens, which animal rights activists call “<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-lincolnshire-66721642">Frankenchickens</a>.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/03_28_Chicken_Comparison.png.webp?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,23.821989528796,100,52.356020942408" alt="Chicken raised for meat are about 5x heavier than they were in the 1950s" title="Chicken raised for meat are about 5x heavier than they were in the 1950s" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The group’s standards also allow for overcrowding, giving birds a little more space than the industry standard but what still amounts to almost 20 percent less space than what animal advocacy groups argue should be the <a href="https://betterchickencommitment.com/us/policy/">bare minimum</a>. American Humane allows for the standard chicken slaughter process: shackling chickens upside down, dunking them in a bath of electrified water to stun them unconscious, slitting their throats, and then placing them in a scalding vat to loosen their feathers. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite all that, the resulting meat can still be advertised as humane, sustainable, and produced from healthy birds.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The empty claims many meat companies make on their labels and in their advertising stem from forces bigger than the USDA and third-party certifiers. Currently, chickens and other poultry birds have <a href="https://www.animallaw.info/article/overview-legal-protections-domestic-chicken-united-states-and-europe">zero federal legal protections</a> while on the farm or in the slaughterhouse, and third-party certification programs make an exceptionally weak substitute for this legal gap. If we wanted truly “humanely raised” chicken, we’d have to fundamentally change how chickens are farmed, which would require significant anti-cruelty legislation from Congress. That would substantially raise the price of chicken, making it more of a delicacy than a staple.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the USDA, the poultry giants, and the dubious third-party certification schemes would like us to believe otherwise — that wholesome marketing and hollow honor systems can fix the horrific reality of what it is to be a farmed animal in the US. &nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On a Wednesday morning in September, I was partaking in a sacred tradition known to millennials everywhere: trying to write the perfect Bumble bio. Something that said “spontaneous, but likes to be in bed by 11” or “loves to hang out on weeknights, but I’m not desperate.” Something that downplayed my earnestness, but didn’t paint me as a “cool girl.” I finally settled on “Journalist and triathlete based in Brewerytown. Obsessed with karaoke, terrible jokes, and gossip. Always down for a cocktail, a show or spontaneous wandering. I promise I’m more fun than this bio!!”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">My meticulous wordsmithing wasn’t an attempt to attract the perfect partner. No, it was to find, possibly, the perfect friend.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At 32, I find myself in the oh-so-common intersection of “wants to make new friends” and “<a href="https://www.vox.com/explain-it-to-me/373489/making-friends-adulthood-relationships-social-life">wow this is hard</a>.” I’m fortunate to have deep, long-term friendships dating back to high school, as well as tremendously fulfilling relationships I forged in early adulthood. But my late 20s were spent in a pandemic-induced social limbo that lasted long enough for me to realize I hadn’t really made any new connections in nearly half a decade.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the last few years, I’ve worked hard to maintain my existing friendships, while also pushing myself to expand my social circle. But there was a final frontier I hadn’t broached yet, a form of connection that promises a best friend is just a swipe away: the apps.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>At 32, I find myself in the oh-so-common intersection of “wants to make new friends” and “wow this is hard.”</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given that online dating has been a cultural mainstay for at least a decade, a pivot toward apps geared entirely toward platonic relationships isn’t entirely surprising. Dating apps <a href="https://ir.bumble.com/news/news-details/2021/Bumble-Inc.-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results/default.aspx">skyrocketed in popularity</a> during <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/futureofdating">the pandemic</a>, effectively topping the list of places to find love. In the years following, apps for platonic relationships entered the fray: Bumble unveiled its friend-finding service as a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230726935186/en/Bumble-Inc.-Introduces-%E2%80%98Bumble-For-Friends%E2%80%99-Friendship-finding-App">standalone app in 2023</a> and Timeleft, another app to meet friends, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/maximebarbier/reel/C6gCif8AeRr/">hosted its first dinner among strangers</a> that same year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These apps arguably help fulfill a dire need for connection. Emerging from the pandemic, nearly half of Americans <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/the-state-of-american-friendship-change-challenges-and-loss/">were not satisfied with the number of friends</a> they had, according to a 2021 survey. Just this year, an American Psychiatric Association poll found <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/news-releases/new-apa-poll-one-in-three-americans-feels-lonely-e">30 percent of adults said they felt lonely</a> at least once a week. But there do seem to be a few bright spots in this landscape: A <a href="https://bumble.com/en-us/the-buzz/bumble-for-friends-bff-data-friendship-loneliness-online">2023 survey commissioned by Bumble</a> found that two-thirds of Gen Z respondents said they met a friend online.&nbsp;And findings in 2024 showed that more Americans were now&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305834" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">satisfied with the number of friends they had</a> — 75 percent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/a24799641/best-friendship-apps/">More digital tools than ever before</a> have come to market to address <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/378924/loneliness-epidemic-solutions-religion-volunteering-community-purpose-meaning">the ongoing loneliness epidemic</a>. But I wanted to see for myself: Are they effective at fostering a friendship you want to work for? Do they connect you to those worth spending time with outside of a chatbox? Or are they plagued by all the <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/357937/delete-dating-apps-meet-people-irl-tinder-hinge-bumble-flirting-offline">same problems of online dating</a> — flighty matches, algorithms designed to keep you on the apps, and a lot of heartache and dissatisfaction?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So for one month, I threw myself into courting new friends through the apps: swiping through profiles, coordinating hangouts, and hoping to form real friendships with people I might not have met otherwise. I used three apps — <a href="https://bumble.com/en-us/bff">Bumble for Friends</a>, <a href="https://timeleft.com/">Timeleft</a>, and <a href="https://www.heyvina.com/">Hey! Vina</a> — all designed for platonic connection, and sought out people with whom I had shared interests, but who had qualities that were unique compared to my current pals.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What I learned is that despite app users’ good intentions, a desire to make friends and actually putting in the work to do it are not one and the same. In fact, to consider someone a close friend, you’ll need to spend <a href="https://news.ku.edu/news/article/2018/03/06/study-reveals-number-hours-it-takes-make-friend">200 hours together</a>, research shows. Matching on an app and exchanging small talk indefinitely won’t push you across that threshold. Despite my frustrations, I, ironically, was guilty of the pitfalls of failing to keep the conversation going or initiating follow-up plans. The thing is, making even one genuine friend is hard and involves a kind of indescribable alchemy, whether you meet at a book club or through a screen. Here’s what transpired during my experiment with internet friend dating.</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The apps</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Bumble for Friends: </strong>Initially <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/04/bumble-launches-bff-a-feature-to-find-new-friends/">launched in 2016</a> as a feature on Bumble known as BFF, the typical user is a young woman who has just graduated from high school or college or moved to a new city, a Bumble spokesperson told me. Nearly identical to the dating app version, users upload photos, write a bio, and answer prompts, such as “The three things that make a friendship great are…”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Hey Vina!: </strong>Similar to the user interface on Bumble for Friends and <a href="https://www.blume.com/blogs/blume-university/meet-olivia-q-a-with-founder-and-ceo-of-vina?srsltid=AfmBOoqCoxKqQ-6mwS8Fz9RlsRnj0UZJ9Q2grrDOpvFtVLkgWTrkSReW">founded the same year,</a> you set up a profile and swipe. Billed as the “<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hey-vina-app-to-meet-friends-2016-5">Tinder for female friends</a>,” the app is open exclusively to women, and allows users to add specific tags to their profiles about their interests, like “women who code,” “jetsetters,” and “fashionistas.” (Hey Vina! did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Timeleft: </strong>Timeleft, <a href="https://timeleft.com/de/story/">founded in 2020</a>, connects you with strangers for Wednesday night dinners at a restaurant in 275 participating cities. Upon signing up, users answer questions about their interests and personality, such as “How often do you feel lonely?” and “How important is humor to you?” The app then connects you to others with similar traits, about whom you know nothing until you meet in person. A majority of Timeleft users are in their 30s and early 40s, according to a Timeleft spokesperson. More than half of Timeleft users are women (60 percent).&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Looking for my perfect match&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the worst part of online dating is swiping, consider the act doubly terrible when it comes to making friends. Sifting through dozens of profiles was a massive time-suck, but a necessary evil. I clicked on every profile, scrolled past the photos, and made a digital beeline to their bios. Red flags: any mention of brunch and/or bedrotting, “looking for my partner in crime,” people that were extremely into camping. Otherwise, I tried to be open-minded.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Very quickly, I began amassing matches on Bumble for Friends. Still, I initiated most conversations; if I didn’t make the first move, the chat stayed dormant. On Hey Vina!, it took two days to get my first match and within two weeks, I’d swiped through all available profiles. Timeleft was looking all the more appealing: Within 10 minutes of signing up and answering the personality questions, I was booked for a dinner party the following Wednesday. I wouldn’t know where it was or who the other dinner party guests would be until the day of.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Was I being catfished? Alas, I’ll never know because she never replied again.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For apps whose express purpose is to help people find friends, my matches seemed overwhelmingly uninterested in chatting, let alone meeting up. After some getting-to-know-you chat with one woman on Hey Vina!, I suggested hanging out. We made tentative plans. When I attempted to solidify the details, I struggled to find our chat history since her photo had changed to a virtually unrecognizable person. Was I being catfished? Alas, I’ll never know because she never replied again.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another woman on the same app bailed a few days before our hangout because of work and personal stress. I felt for her — you can’t expect to connect with someone when you aren’t feeling your best — but was surprised she’d opened up to a virtual stranger about her struggles. “LMK if you ever wanna grab happy hour to blow off some steam lolol,” I told her. I didn’t hear from her again.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">My friend-finding mission was hardly a bust, though: The apps ended up introducing me to a range of people, from a scientist to a young mom. Everyone I hung out with agreed to appear in this story and I’ve changed their names to protect their privacy.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The hangouts</h2>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Friend date No. 1</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The only thing I had in common with Janine — the first person to reach out on Bumble for Friends&nbsp;— was the neighborhood where we live. Still, she invited me to a house party she was throwing that weekend. After those plans fell through, she suggested meeting at a bar nearby with a small group. When I arrived, my two best friends in tow, a solo Janine appeared frazzled and outnumbered. Sensing her low-grade panic, my friends moved a few seats down at the bar, leaving me and Janine to get into it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Janine has the kind of face where I swore I’ve met her before, an openness and familiarity that makes for easy chit-chat. Like virtually all of the people I connected with, she was a recent transplant and initially used Bumble for Friends to find a roommate. Out of her three other friend dates, she told me she’d probably hang out with only one again. “I want to find someone in my area who has my values and likes the things I like to do,” she told me. High on her list of priorities were getting married and starting a family, salsa dancing, and her faith. I couldn’t relate.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Red flags: any mention of brunch and/or bedrotting, “looking for my partner in crime,” people that were extremely into camping.</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite our differences, Janine was easy to talk to, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that we’d skipped the serendipitous run-ins and jumped right to the meat of a friendship. We lived in the same neighborhood, went to the same coffee shop — wouldn’t our paths have crossed at some point? Couldn’t we decide after a few weeks of small talk that we wanted to hang out? I felt like I knew too much, too soon.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After about two hours, we settled up and parted ways. A few weeks later, she invited me and another Bumble for Friends match to a local salsa meetup that none of us ended up attending anyway. I haven’t seen or heard from her since.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Friend date No. 2</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the back of an Uber during rush hour, I panicked: Of course I was running late to my Timeleft dinner. By the time I arrived, a group of about 10 people had gathered outside, staring at their phones. The restaurant designated as our meeting spot had permanently closed a few days prior. Two women who had clearly done this before steered us to a packed Mexican restaurant that squished us into two separate tables in a corner.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cici, one of the Women in Charge, told me this was her 13th Timeleft dinner. She even started a WhatsApp group where over 50 Timeleft-ers could coordinate plans off the app. Across from Cici was Angela, another Timeleft vet (this was her seventh meal); the two met at dinner a few weeks prior and hung out independently. Neither of them knew they’d be paired up again for tonight’s feast. Over giant margaritas, they told me they like the predictability of Timeleft — dinners are every Wednesday. Angela told me that a girl’s gotta eat anyway, so why not make some friends in the process?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Angela has lived in the city for a few years, but Cici and David, our other tablemate, had recently moved and were using the app to meet new people. In the weeks following our dinner, I noticed David was especially active on the WhatsApp group, frequently initiating and accepting plans with complete strangers.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Angela told me that a girl’s gotta eat anyway, so why not make some friends in the process?</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Everyone at the table, myself included, was in a comparable stage of life: early 30s, established careers — in law, academia, and business consulting — similar political views, slightly nerdy, an interest in <em>House</em> and <em>Suits</em> and <em>Les Miserables</em>. They were enthusiastic and inquisitive, inspiring me to respond in kind.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The group dynamic eliminated the pressure to be always on, to perform, to pepper unsuspecting subjects with questions as I’m wont to do. Just a few days after drinks with Janine, I was starting to think a multi-person hangout was how I preferred to meet people. After all, I do love an audience. I could also save my energy for moments when I felt it worthwhile to add to the conversation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Energized from our dinner, I joined the WhatsApp group and promised Cici, David, and Angela I’d definitely register for another Timeleft dinner. (I haven’t.) Currently, I have 100 unread messages in the thread. Every Wednesday, I tell myself I’ll sign up for another Timeleft dinner. Maybe I will.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Friend date No. 3</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The moment I read Ariana’s Bumble for Friends bio, rife with colorful language like “soft-bodied mammal” and “WFH hell,” I knew we were afflicted by the same internet brain rot (complimentary). The conversation flowed unlike others I’d had on the apps, and I had butterflies in my stomach as I frequently checked my phone to see if she’d written back.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ariana told me she signed up for Bumble for Friends after her sister told her of a friend’s success on the app. She’d been on two coffee dates, making our hangout her third, and sought out potential friends based on unique profiles and shared interests, like knitting with one match and writing with me. (Ariana went to grad school for poetry, which means she’s both cooler and smarter than me.) Her second friend date was fine, she said, but the woman was “younger — and feels younger,” she told me, “we’re not at the same place in life.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ariana was close with her sister and cousins but because she works from home, days will go by with her having only interacted with her partner. Ariana was endearing and quick-witted and I got the sense she was interested in getting to know me beyond the perfunctory small talk.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The moment I read Ariana’s Bumble for Friends bio, I knew we were afflicted by the same internet brain rot (complimentary).</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When I finally looked at my phone during our first hangout, I realized we’d been at the bar for four hours. Not wanting to further monopolize her night, I quickly closed out. I told her how much fun I had and immediately worried if I was coming on too strong. Despite my reservations about another one-on-one hang after declaring group hangs my thing post-Timeleft, spending time with Ariana was effortless and renewed my hope for the apps. I could keep swiping if everyone was a bit more like her.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the ensuing days, we exchanged texts about <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/377637/hurricane-milton-evacuation-caroline-calloway-concrete-house-tiktok-lietuenant-dan">Caroline Calloway and the hurricane</a>, about how deranged you’d have to be to make friends at a writing workshop. We’ve gotten together three additional times, my first repeat hang from the apps.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Friend date No. 4</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Early in my time with Tricia, she asked me if she could send a quick text. Her husband wanted to know that I wasn’t a total freak — or worse, trying to kill her. We were at the bar in a fancy hotel restaurant, a location that definitely felt more like a date-date than any of my prior meetups.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tricia had just moved to the area from Florida and didn’t have any suggestions as to where to go. She lived out of state, about 45 minutes away, and wasn’t comfortable driving on highways, so I offered to meet closer to where she was. But I was nearly as unfamiliar with her neighborhood as she was. The first, and only, place that came to mind was this hotel restaurant.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Still, a salad and one negroni later, my energy stores had run out.</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tricia hadn’t heard about Hey Vina!, where we first connected, until she Googled “apps for friends.” We had come to similar conclusions about the app: People weren’t super active there — she’d also swiped through everyone — and they didn’t seem willing to take the chat offline. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Once her nervousness subsided, Tricia opened up about her 5-year-old son and 13-year-old stepson, the fun fact that she and one of her brothers share a birthday, and some juicy gossip about one of her friends’ dating lives. I giggled every time she exclaimed “Giiiiiiirl!” Tricia is so sweet I can hardly imagine anyone saying a bad word about her.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, a salad and one negroni later, my energy stores had run out. The looming drive home took the wind out of my sails. Tricia showed me a few TikToks parodying how people flag down waiters for the check before I finally walked to the end of the bar to grab the bill.&nbsp;</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

<p class="has-text-align-none">As with most of my friend dates, I left feeling grateful that literally anyone was willing to spend time with me, but unsure if we’d ever see each other again. The line between “pleasant encounter” and “life-affirming experience” was beginning to crystalize. Perhaps due to the difficulty I had making friends as a kid, I’d cling onto any relationship even if it was just barely functional. This experience provided some much-needed clarity. I don’t need to spend countless hours with someone just because they’re nice enough.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">My experience on friend apps was similar to that of dating apps in a way: It’s easy for one or both people to let things fizzle if the sparks aren’t flying immediately. But friendships bloom during the in-between moments. After enough time together, you realize it just happened — one day you’re friends, and that’s that. It’s hard to replicate that slow burn when two people who might’ve never crossed paths are forcing themselves into each other’s lives. How much did I want to force it?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tricia texted me the next day saying she started listening to the podcast I’d recommended. If nothing else, we at least had that.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the days since Donald Trump’s victory became official, one of the great debates about Trumpism has come roaring back: To what extent can his rise to power be seen as a product of America’s divisions over race?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One side, focusing on Trump’s <a href="https://x.com/coldxman/status/1854930189907624371">gains with Black and especially Hispanic voters</a>, argues it makes little sense to believe his victory was primarily a product of racism. The other, noting that both groups still went for Vice President Kamala Harris in absolute terms, argues the election results still must be viewed <a href="https://x.com/nhannahjones/status/1856083231663370417">as primarily revolving around the country’s racial divide</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A closer look at the data suggests that both takes are wrong —&nbsp;or, at least, require more nuance. Trump’s victory was and wasn’t about race, as his winning coalition included many different groups with many different motivations. Understanding which kind of voter mattered, and in what ways, is crucial to getting the racial politics of 2024 right.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We can safely say it’s difficult to explain the shifts in the electorate between 2020 and 2024 by claiming that voters were motivated by Trump’s incendiary racial rhetoric.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not just that Trump gained with minorities; it’s that he gained with nearly everyone, winning new votes in places with all sorts of different kinds of voters. To explain such a consistent national shift to the right, you need to look to factors that unite the population rather than divide it. This is why the best post-election analyses have given pride of place to inflation and anti-incumbent sentiment, two factors that appear to be present across many different groups in the American electorate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, we can also say that race played an essential role in Trump being atop the Republican ticket in the first place.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There was a moment in 2021, right after January 6, when it looked as though Trump might finally be exiled from the Republican Party. The reason the GOP elite blanched is the same reason why Trump walked to victory in the 2024 primary: He has a devoted, unshakeable fan base among Republican primary voters. The research is crystal clear that many of these voters really are motivated by racial antagonism.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The 2024 election saw a Trump base motivated in large part by fear of a changing America entering into a coalition with many economically minded voters who represent that change. Both groups voted for Trump, albeit for very different reasons.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such a coalition might represent a fundamental realignment in American politics, the “multiracial working-class conservatism” <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/23982907/trump-democrats-republicans-working-class-voters-latino-black-voters">long dreamed of by Republican strategists</a>. Or it could represent a temporary alliance that will be severely tested, perhaps even sundered, when the reality of Trump’s policy agenda becomes clear to the electorate. At this point, we don’t know.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But we can at least say, with confidence, that Trump’s racial support in 2024 is more complicated than simplistic analyses might lead you to believe.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">No, race and racism didn’t cause the 2024 pro-GOP swing</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The argument for a race-focused explanation of 2024 focuses primarily on the well-documented fact that America is politically polarized by race. Trump won a clear majority of white voters while Harris won a massive majority of Black voters. In this argument, what happened in 2024 was a reflection primarily of anti-Blackness, directed at the first Black woman to run for president, by a country in the grips of reactionary racial panic.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“[The] vote was about perceived loss of status,” <a href="https://x.com/nhannahjones/status/1855308936632475649">Nikole Hannah-Jones</a>, the New York Times’s star reporter on racial issues, posted on X. “What elected Trump was demographic anxiety — his campaign ran explicitly on it, explicitly! — and so many people whose job it is to dispassionately deal with facts still do not want to deal with that.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’m sympathetic to the underlying theory of Trump’s support. So sympathetic, in fact, that I argue <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reactionary-Spirit-Insidious-Political-Tradition-ebook/dp/B0CMQB8S94">in my book</a> it’s the most important reason he rose to power back in 2016. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But if what we’re trying to explain is the top-line election result —&nbsp;why enough voters shifted from Biden to Trump to swing the election —&nbsp;it’s only of limited utility.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Were the big shifts between 2020 and 2024 to be driven by the kind of backlash Hannah-Jones is describing, you’d expect a specific kind of uneven distribution in the vote patterns. You’d expect Trump to run up the score with white voters in rural red areas while facing some backlash from Latino and especially Black voters.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s not what happened. Trump improved on his 2020 performance with nearly every demographic group across the country. His biggest improvements came in heavily nonwhite and urban areas — precisely the places where a race-focused explanation would expect him to do the worst. And white voters swung inconsistently, rather than as a rule.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Currently, the best way to understand these demographic swings comes from county-level reporting of results. You can look at the tallies in counties that are heavily made up of one group or another, compare it to other counties and previous election results, and draw some (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_fallacy">limited</a>) inferences about what’s happened. In the coming months and years, we’ll get more useful data on individuals through databases like the Catalist voter file; but for now, we have to make do.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the US electorate is still polarized by race — Harris won a clear national majority of nonwhite voters and Trump won a clear majority of white voters — racial polarization declined significantly in 2024. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/06/us/elections/trump-america-red-shift-victory.html">New York Times</a> tally found that Trump improved his margin in Latino-majority counties by 13.3 percentage points, Native American-majority counties by 10 points, and Black-majority counties by 2.7 points. (Note that these numbers will likely change as data from California, an extremely slow-counting state, continues to trickle in.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The pro-Trump shift across majority-minority counties was strikingly consistent. Texas border counties with largely Mexican American residents <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/11/06/donald-trump-near-sweep-texas-border-counties/">lurched hard toward Trump</a>; Starr County, which is 97 percent Latino, moved <a href="https://x.com/MWatkinsTrib/status/1854372802507272461">a staggering 75 points in his direction</a> between 2016 and 2024. There were also notable 2020–2024 swings in <a href="https://x.com/MappingFL/status/1854342028500558126">Florida counties with different Latino populations</a>, like Miami-Dade (where half the Latino population is Cuban) and Osceola (home to many of the state’s Puerto Rican residents).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s possible that some of these minority voters themselves had racially conservative — maybe even racist — views. This is an election that featured <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/373655/mark-robinson-black-latino-right-wing-extremism">Mark “I’m a Black Nazi” Robinson</a> as the GOP candidate for North Carolina governor. Previous research has found that Trump’s support among nonwhites is correlated with <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/9F91070372394D892BF11E1FFC0C619F/S1537592724000847a.pdf/div-class-title-embracing-the-status-hierarchy-how-immigration-attitudes-prejudice-and-sexism-shaped-non-white-support-for-trump-div.pdf">support for existing social hierarchies</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I don’t want to deny that this is part of the story of the 2020-2024 shift. It’s the kind of thing that will be hard to prove or disprove until we have much more granular data. But the evidence we have suggests anti-minority sentiment among minorities isn’t the entirety, or even the biggest part, of what happened. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are a few good reasons to think this is so.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, the uniformity of the shift. We didn’t see some minority groups swing toward Trump and some toward Harris — we saw a uniform move toward Trump across different racial minority demographics. Black people, Native Americans, Arab Americans, <a href="https://x.com/carlosodio/status/1856370229548286293">Latinos</a>, and Asians of all national origins — every single one moved in a pro-Trump direction. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Second, we can look to the white population as a benchmark. If whites shifted toward Trump even more dramatically than minorities, that would be consistent with an election whose shifts were triggered by activated racial resentment. If whites shifted by a smaller margin or even moved toward Harris, then that would suggest something else is at work.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What we saw looks more like the latter. While Trump saw overall gains among white voters, they were smaller than his gains among Latinos and far more uneven, with Harris actually making gains in certain demographics and areas. An analysis of Michigan results by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/nov/06/the-key-swings-that-handed-trump-the-white-house-a-visual-analysis">the Guardian</a>, for example, found that “the only areas in Michigan in which there were swings to the Democrats were areas with a higher proportion of white voters.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are two other demographic trends worth looking at: urbanicity and college education.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-2181325963.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Exterior of Penn Station in New York City with a large sign on it that reads “President Donald Trump at Madison Square Garden.”" title="Exterior of Penn Station in New York City with a large sign on it that reads “President Donald Trump at Madison Square Garden.”" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Generally speaking, <a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/old_uploads/2019/06/Wilkinson-Density-Divide-Final.pdf">urban counties</a> and counties with <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/10/education-polarization-diploma-divide-democratic-party-working-class.html">large numbers of college graduates</a> tend to have larger percentages of residents with left-wing views on cultural issues like race than rural and lower-educated ones. In a racial backlash election, you’d expect those counties to swing in Harris’s direction while rural and less college-educated ones moved more into Trump’s column.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet in 2024, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/06/trump-big-cities-popular-vote/">urban counties actually swung harder to Trump than rural counties</a> (where he was already extremely strong and thus had only limited room to make gains). Meanwhile, counties with relatively high levels of residents with college graduates (35 percent or over) swung to Trump by relatively similar margins as counties with fewer college graduates.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, these results are not the final word. When doing county-level analysis, political scientists often warn against something called the ecological fallacy —&nbsp;making inferences about individual residents of an area based on the characteristics of the whole. It could be, for example, that a chunk of racist voters who live in majority-minority counties, cities, and highly educated areas swung hard for Trump in 2024.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At this point, that seems far less probable than a well-documented alternative explanation: that Trump’s big gains come from a combination of <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383208/donald-trump-victory-kamala-harris-global-trend-incumbents">anti-incumbent sentiment</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/hey-stupid-it-wasnt-just-economy-it-was-inflation-2024-11-06/">a voter backlash to inflation</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The 2024 election might not be about race, but Trumpism is</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As much as I think the 2024 results weren’t primarily about race, some observers are taking this observation way too far by arguing it disproves the idea that racism drives any part of Trump’s support.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Trump has run three times. Each time he has gotten a higher share of the black and Hispanic vote than the last. Indeed, he has done better with these demos than any Republican in 50 years. The ‘racism’ theory of Trump&#8217;s appeal belongs in the graveyard of [political science],” the prominent commentator <a href="https://x.com/coldxman/status/1854930189907624371">Coleman Hughes posted on X</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is far too sweeping. “Trump’s appeal” is not just one thing. Like any candidate, he appeals to different voters for different reasons. Changes in minority vote totals can’t tell us, for example, why white support for Trump remains so durable inside the Republican Party.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is a crucial question because it explains why Trump is on the ballot this time despite real intra-party resistance. And the most important answer, though by no means the only one, has to do with the Republican base’s reactionary racial politics.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After January 6, 2021, Republican elites seem poised to kick him to the curb. Yet when Republicans had a chance to act — by voting to convict him in the Senate and declare him ineligible for public office — they didn’t. They backed down for the same reason Trump would romp through the primary despite a robust-on-paper challenge from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis: Republican voters love him. They love him so much that any Republican who openly defied him would face serious political blowback, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/23899688/2024-election-republican-primary-death-threats-trump">potentially even physical harm</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are many, many reasons why Trump has secured such a hold on the GOP; it is not fair to term all of his base presumptive racists. And yet, the uncomfortable fact remains: The evidence that Trump’s support stems primarily from the racial resentments of the Republican base is overwhelming.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unlike the limited county-level analyses of the 2024 election results, research tying Trump’s base support to racial factors has been able to employ complete and granular datasets on individual voters. Scholars have used gold-standard political science tools, things like <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3692784">natural experiments</a> and <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0002716218811309">regression analyses of massive national surveys</a>. They’ve tested theories of Trump support against competing explanations, like <a href="https://academic.oup.com/psq/article-abstract/133/1/9/6848138">economic deprivation</a> and <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/explaining-the-trump-vote-the-effect-of-racist-resentment-and-antiimmigrant-sentiments/537A8ABA46783791BFF4E2E36B90C0BE">general anti-system sentiment</a>, and overwhelmingly found that racial issues provide the stronger explanation. They’ve even uncovered good evidence that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2007747117">the turn against democracy among Republicans</a>, including the willingness to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240626103609id_/https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/4BB3B6F641B41D8B63D152F9779C64CE/S2056608523000338a.pdf/div-class-title-who-buys-the-big-lie-white-racial-grievance-and-confidence-in-the-fairness-of-american-elections-div.pdf">accept the Big Lie about the 2020 elections</a>, is primarily concentrated among Trump supporters who hold high levels of anti-minority resentment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nothing about the 2024 results should cause us to doubt these well-established findings. Instead, they should give us an opportunity to take a more sophisticated understanding of the role race plays in the Trump coalition.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given the longstanding and well-documented body of research on Trump and race, it is fair to say Trumpism as a political movement is in large part driven by white racial anxiety. It is one factor among many driving Republicans to back Trump to the hilt, but clearly the most influential.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This suggests the 2024 Trump coalition is an alliance between a critical mass of racially resentful whites and others with very different motivations, including minority voters who physically represent the social change his base despises. Some Trump general election supporters were racially resentful, while others were simply fed up with inflation and the Biden-Harris administration. For others, it might be some combination of both.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is how politics works in a large and diverse country. People who differ, perhaps even hate each other, can end up voting for the same candidate for different reasons. And if we fail to appreciate that, we will fail to truly grasp what just happened and what it might mean about America’s future.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Donald Trump announced he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/13/politics/matt-gaetz-attorney-general?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_google">intends to nominate Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL)</a> to serve as his attorney general.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gaetz is a longtime Trump loyalist who will likely be tasked with remaking the Department of Justice. The department has traditionally adhered to strong norms against interference by the president; Trump and his allies have been explicit <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/381094/trump-second-term-2024-election-justice-department-civil-rights">in arguing that should change</a>. Trump has also repeatedly called for legal action against his political enemies, including <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/21/nx-s1-5134924/trump-election-2024-kamala-harris-elizabeth-cheney-threat-civil-liberties">promising</a> to “appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family,” in 2023.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Enforcing those sorts of threats would fall to Gaetz, if he is confirmed by the Senate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before being nominated to be attorney general, Gaetz was probably best known for two things. One is his <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/10/1/23898555/kevinn-mccarthy-speakership-matt-gaetz">longstanding feud with former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy</a> (R-CA), who was eventually ousted in no small part because of Gaetz. The other is the string of sexual misconduct allegations. Gaetz denies these allegations, and the Justice Department <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/doj-decides-not-charge-rep-matt-gaetz-sex-trafficking-investigation-rcna70839">dropped its investigation into them in 2023</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Gaetz does end up running that same department, he’ll be in a uniquely powerful role. He would be tasked with overseeing all federal prosecutions, providing legal advice to the president and the Cabinet, and would have the final say on any legal stance that the United States takes in court.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of greater significance perhaps is the fact that Gaetz would have enormous authority over who is prosecuted, who is allowed to get away with committing federal crimes, and who might be targeted for politically motivated prosecutions in an authoritarian administration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has repeatedly promised “<a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy">retribution</a>” against his Democratic rivals. And his fellow Republicans on the Supreme Court ruled last July that he can order the Justice Department to <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/366855/supreme-court-trump-immunity-betrayal-worst-decisions-anticanon">bring politically motivated prosecutions without consequence</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the first Trump administration, Trump reportedly wanted to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/11/20/18105462/trump-clinton-comey-order-justice">order the Justice Department to prosecute</a> his former political opponent Hillary Clinton and former FBI Director James Comey, but was dissuaded from doing so by White House Counsel Don McGahn. Gaetz’s strong support for Trump, by contrast, makes it seem he’s much less likely to resist such an order.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Just who is Matt Gaetz?<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gaetz has a law degree, and he <a href="https://gaetz.house.gov/about">did previously practice law in northwest Florida</a>. He’s been a representative since 2017, and became known both for stunts on the House floor — like wearing a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/04/politics/gaetz-coronavirus-gas-mask/index.html">gas mask</a> to protest masking policies during the coronavirus pandemic — as well as his <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/10/23/20929023/house-republicans-impeachment-stunt-trump">staunch support for Trump</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2021, it was revealed that Gaetz was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/us/politics/matt-gaetz-sex-trafficking-investigation.html">the subject of an investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The allegations arose out of his relationship with Joel Greenberg, a former county-level tax collector who was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/politics/joel-greenberg-sentencing/index.html">sentenced to 11 years in prison</a> by a federal judge in 2022. Greenberg pled guilty to a wide range of crimes, including underage sex trafficking, wire fraud, identity theft, and conspiring to defraud the federal government. Judge Gregory Presnell, who sentenced Greenberg, said he’s “never seen a defendant who has committed so many different types of crimes in such a relatively short period.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to CNN, Greenberg also “cooperated extensively with the Justice Department’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/politics/joel-greenberg-sentencing/index.html">sex-trafficking probe into GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz</a>.” Among other things, Greenberg reportedly told investigators that he <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4751778-matt-gaetz-joel-greenberg-sex-trafficking-florida/">witnessed Gaetz having sex with a 17-year-old girl</a>. (Gaetz in 2021 issued a blanket denial of the allegations via a statement from his office, writing: &#8220;No part of the allegations against me are true.”)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a general rule, sex offenses such as soliciting prostitution are handled by state-level prosecutors, as the Constitution only gives the federal government <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3801442224983217117&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr">limited authority over sex crimes</a>. The Justice Department can get involved, however, in narrow circumstances.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The department’s investigation into Gaetz looked into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/us/politics/matt-gaetz-sex-trafficking-investigation.html">whether he had sex with this teenager and paid for her to travel with him</a>. It is a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2423#g">federal crime</a> to transport someone across state lines, with the intent that they engage in prostitution or “illicit sexual conduct.” The most serious violations of this statute carry a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In any event, the Justice Department <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/doj-decides-not-charge-rep-matt-gaetz-sex-trafficking-investigation-rcna70839">eventually decided not to charge Gaetz</a>. Its reasons for declining to do so have not been made public, but the lack of charges does not necessarily clear him of the allegations. Meanwhile, a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/witness-tells-house-ethics-committee-matt-gaetz-paid/story?id=111217102">House ethics investigation into Gaetz remains ongoing</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to ABC News, one woman told the House committee investigating Gaetz that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/witness-tells-house-ethics-committee-matt-gaetz-paid/story?id=111217102">the member of Congress paid her for sex</a>. Others have said they were paid to attend parties that Gaetz also attended, where attendees used drugs and had sex. Again, Gaetz has denied any misconduct.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As of yet, it’s unclear whether a majority of senators will vote to confirm Gaetz as attorney general. But there’s some evidence that many Republicans will be turned off by the sex crimes allegations against Gaetz, and by his generally poor reputation on Capitol Hill. In 2023, for example, Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-OK) said that “<a href="https://x.com/mkraju/status/1709765049051381761">there’s a reason why no one in the [Republican] conference defended</a>” Gaetz after seeing some of the evidence against him.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sen. Markwayne Mullin on Matt Gaetz: “We had all seen the videos he was showing on the House floor … of the girls that he had slept with.

<p class="has-text-align-none">As <a href="https://x.com/ezraklein/status/1856798502484910130">New York Times columnist Ezra Klein writes</a>, Trump’s decision to nominate Gaetz should be read as an effort to gauge whether Republican senators will permit him to take absurd and dangerous actions. “These aren&#8217;t just appointments,” Klein writes of Gaetz and Defense Secretary nominee Pete Hegseth, “They&#8217;re loyalty tests. The absurdity is the point.”</p>

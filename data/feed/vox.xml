<p class="has-text-align-none">Donald J. Trump is headed to the White House again. He&#8217;ll have the help of a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382868/republican-senate-majority-ohio-west-virginia-trump">Republican Senate</a>, almost certainly a Republican House, and a <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/373084/supreme-court-trump-judges-federalist-society">conservative Supreme Court</a> that includes three justices he appointed the first time around. The former president made plenty of pledges on the campaign trail — now it&#8217;s time to see what&#8217;s actually possible.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vox explains the agenda for Trump&#8217;s second term.

<p class="has-text-align-none">We hope this coverage will cut through the chaos of the post-election months. Please keep checking back as we add stories and build out a guide to what to expect for the next four years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382197/trump-harris-live-results-polls-updates-analysis-explainers">Donald Trump’s election victory</a> evoked disappointment and distress for millions across the country. Many people fear for the future of reproductive justice, immigration, LGBTQ+ rights, tariffs, labor unions, the environment, and much more. Some feel so hopeless about the future that they want to give up. Others are fired up and ready to get more involved in local issues or politics, but they may have no idea how or where to start.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why I wrote this</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">In August 2020, I moved to Washington, DC. Outside of my roommates, I didn’t know anyone there. I was feeling alone and anxious about the world, so I decided to search for local organizations and see what was around me.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">I ended up joining two local groups, and over the course of a couple years, I got pretty involved with community organizing. It was a lot of work, but it was also a big source of joy for me. I learned a lot about local issues and made lifelong connections.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, I’m hearing a lot of valid concern about where our world is heading and what to do about it. I wanted to write something for those people and give them a framework I wish I’d had. I hope you find your community and that the work is as rewarding as it was for me.<br><strong>Have questions? </strong>Email me at samantha.delgado@voxmedia.com.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of those reactions are valid. But if people are serious about improving our flawed democracy, they must participate — and not just by voting. Voting is an important aspect of civic life, but presidential elections happen only once every four years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If we want to make a change beyond the ballot box and find meaning in these challenging times, we need to engage with the people around us. Look at the social movements of the past that created lasting impact, like the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/interactive/2023/march-on-washington-60th-anniversary-memories/">civil rights movement</a> securing legislation to outlaw segregation and discrimination, or <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/workers-rights-won-by-unions">the labor movement</a> establishing weekends and the eight-hour workday. Powering these campaigns were longstanding relationships between different people with different skills and roles, forged together into a collective by their shared values and a desire for a better world. They built communities that were able to create sustained public pressure for change outside of the presidential election cycle.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite the need for real community networks, our country’s social fabric has been fraying.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to the US Surgeon General’s 2023 report on the “<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf">loneliness epidemic</a>,” approximately half of US adults have reported feeling lonely. People are spending <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/sg-social-connection-graphic-trends.pdf">more time alone and less time with others</a>. We’re <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/daily-hours-spent-with-digital-media-per-adult-user">more online</a> than ever before, yet we feel more disconnected. We trust each other less.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Belonging to a community provides the interpersonal support human beings naturally need to <a href="https://www.vox.com/22992901/how-to-find-your-community-as-an-adult">survive and thrive</a>. But building a real social network doesn’t happen overnight. It requires consistently showing up, being willing to give and take, and managing uncomfortable disagreements. “There is no Amazon one-click for community,” says <a href="https://thedoubleshift.substack.com/">Katherine Goldstein</a>, a writer who covers care and a fellow for the Better Life Lab at New America.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Creating community takes time. It demands discipline. But it’s not impossible — and there are many other people out there looking for the same connections and sense of purpose.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The civic, health, and practical benefits of community</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 1970, American political scientist Robert Putnam was in Rome studying Italian politics when a unique research opportunity opened up. The Italian national government had relinquished some of its power and delegated a wide range of responsibilities to 20 new regional governments. These institutions were structured nearly identically, but each region had different economic, political, and cultural dynamics.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Putnam, this was a perfect situation to study what makes successful (and unsuccessful) democratic institutions. He found that the governments that were able to effectively operate internally, propose relevant policy, and implement legislation all shared a deeply embedded sense of trust and cooperation among their citizens. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Some regions of Italy, we discover, are blessed with vibrant networks and norms of civic engagement,” he wrote in his 1993 book about his research, <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691037387/making-democracy-work?srsltid=AfmBOor6kZje2r1ykbqECnf6MFBicuQ6J-ZsdUbEWY0C0ZaevmMhZY9u"><em>Making Democracy Work: Civic Traditions in Modern Italy</em></a><em>, </em>“while others were cursed with vertically structured politics, a social life of fragmentation and isolation, and a culture of distrust.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Does the latter environment sound a little familiar?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Putnam came back to the US years later, he noticed a trend that disturbed him: American social life seemed to be disappearing. Membership in groups and clubs was <a href="https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/essays/59744/who-killed-civic-america">declining</a>. Across unions, religious groups, sports leagues, and political groups, people were reporting less time spent participating and being in these spaces. Putnam wrote the influential book <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Bowling-Alone-Revised-and-Updated/Robert-D-Putnam/9780743219037"><em>Bowling Alone</em></a>, published<em> </em>in 2000<em>, </em>in which he claimed that the social structures these groups provided were key to our physical and civic health. A 2023 documentary called <em><a href="https://www.joinordiefilm.com/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.joinordiefilm.com/">Join or Die</a> </em>presents Putnam’s research and perspective and confronts the audience with a challenge: If you care about democracy, join a club.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There were critiques of Putnam’s thesis. Some commentators pointed out that Putnam’s focus on a narrow band of clubs and <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/368201/volunteer-charity-donations-systemic-change-activism-nonprofits-loneliness-philanthropy">volunteering</a> left out spaces populated by women, people of color, and immigrants.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But he is right that strong networks of connection have immense benefits and that isolation can have <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/5/3/23707936/surgeon-general-loneliness-epidemic-report">adverse effects</a> on our lives. Being socially isolated has the same impact on people’s mortality as smoking 15 cigarettes a day, according to the Surgeon General, and loneliness and isolation make us more at risk for individual risks like heart disease, strokes, anxiety, and depression. These impacts can be measured across entire communities where social cohesion is breaking down, the Surgeon General found.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We know that loneliness and not having connections is not good for us physically,” says Goldstein. “Part of that is very much related to our psychology, that as humans, we have adapted and are biologically and neurologically programmed to want to be together. That&#8217;s how we have survived for this long.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyond the long-term health impacts, there are also practical benefits to prioritizing and being a part of a community. For example, if you’re going to a book club once a month, you’re practicing skills like public speaking and active listening. If you end up leading a book club meeting, you’ll learn how to facilitate a conversation among different people.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Having a strong community also creates support systems for times of need or crisis. Whether you need someone to watch your kid, drive you to your job, or get your groceries when you’re sick, having a collective of people to lean on isn’t just a convenience — it’s a comfort to know you’re not alone.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>How we find community …</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A community is a network of people with shared values or intentions. If you want to build or strengthen a community with others, you can ask yourself: What communities am I informally a part of or which do I feel close to? What values matter to me? In what ways am I seeking change in the world around me? Your answers can inform your search for local <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/what-is-mutual-aid-explainer">mutual aid</a> organizations, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/rents-are-rising-and-neighborhoods-are-changing-renters-mobilized-to-form-a-tenants-union/2019/08/22/c3a29286-c2c8-11e9-b72f-b31dfaa77212_story.html">tenant unions</a>, labor rights organizations, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/8/19/20727283/unions-good-income-inequality-wealth">union</a> locals, or nearby advocacy groups. See what speaks to you.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If getting politically or civically involved feels overwhelming at first, you can also start with something low-stakes, like joining a <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/23837430/how-to-make-friends-start-a-club">hobby-based club</a>. These still offer the opportunity to get close with a group of people with whom you share common interests. Want to get more exercise and play a team sport? Join a sports league. Are you a voracious reader? Try a book club. Feeling imaginative and want to escape reality for a few hours a week? A Dungeons and Dragons campaign may be your thing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Depending on where you live, there’s a good chance these spaces already exist. Some of them have little to no cost; I highly recommend visiting your local library’s website and seeing what events and clubs they offer. You don’t have to create them from scratch.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whatever it may be, you just need to show up consistently. How else do we get to know the people around us if we don’t make the effort to get together? Community-building is a long-term project and an investment that can be easy to neglect. But every interaction and every group meeting is an opportunity to get to know one another and create trust. If these community-building efforts are made a priority, it gives us real networks to activate and rely on during a crisis, and it makes tough discussions with each other much less intimidating.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>… and withstand the challenges that can break it</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are some obstacles that can make it difficult to build and embed yourself into a long-term community. A big one is American individualism — the idea that we must be self-reliant and do everything ourselves. Pushing self-sufficiency too far robs us of the connections that we know are beneficial.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Allowing some level of vulnerability about how you might need help, or things that you might need when appropriate, I think is really crucial for community building,” Goldstein says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That self-awareness is particularly important when building community around a specific political issue because you need others to trust you and vice versa. Carla Blessing, a tenant union organizer at Quality Hill Towers in Kansas City, knows it isn’t always easy.<br><br>“It&#8217;s a thing that I still struggle with,” she says. “Learning that I can be vulnerable with [my neighbors] and let out some of the sadness and the frustration, the anger, and knowing that I&#8217;ve got a safe place to do that, where I won&#8217;t be judged and where people will not only listen but ask, ‘How can we support you?’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I&#8217;ve got a neighbor who said, ‘If you&#8217;re having trouble knocking doors, I&#8217;ll go with you. We can do it together.’ And I&#8217;ve done that for other people too,” she added.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Blessing has struggled with anxiety and depression her entire life (something that <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/505745/depression-rates-reach-new-highs.aspx">nearly 3 in 10</a> Americans can relate to). Social interactions, like cold-knocking on neighbors’ doors, can be scary or difficult. But person-to-person interactions are necessary for building community and trust, so she’s developed a strategy to help her.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Imagine the things that you&#8217;re trying to project, the kind of person who is confident and relatable,” she said. “You focus on embodying that. Think back to your role models, to the people you&#8217;ve seen who did have these qualities, and you emulate them.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Quality Hill Towers tenants union is currently organizing the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwn9tmcisFg">largest rent strike</a> in decades. Blessing has only been with the union for two months, but she’s already learned a range of skills that help keep their movement running: facilitating meetings in their building, taking quality notes, moving through disagreements, making sure everyone gets a turn to speak. While these administrative duties may seem mundane, they’re the foundation for civic groups.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It can be easy in moments of crisis or need to feel energized and want to do something. The hard part is making your work sustainable when that urgency fades. It can take years for grassroots groups to create local or systemic change, and often there are painful losses along the way. Community groups rarely have enough power or money to do everything they want. There are ways to prevent burnout in community efforts: making sure responsibilities are split among everyone, figuring out sustainable ways of operating, and making time for moments of joy along the way. It’s important to accept that almost everyone feels burnout at some point, whether it’s because of community-building efforts or from other personal struggles that can impact each of our lives.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are also bound to be some uncomfortable moments when taking the time to build community. It could be feeling anxious or too tired to go to an event or meeting, or having <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/24153561/fight-argue-without-ruining-relationships-conflict-disagreement-compromise">disagreements</a> with fellow community members. These are all normal parts of deeper person-to-person interactions. However, when trying to get more involved in a certain space, you may discover more serious differences in values or goals than you originally anticipated.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Conflict is also an opportunity to identify strategic differences and, in some cases, decide to go in different directions,” says Emily Dupree, the founder of <a href="https://cleanairclub.org/home">Clean Air Club</a>, which provides free air purifiers to artists and musicians in Chicago. “That isn&#8217;t a failure of organizing. That is a success of interpersonal relations and an organizing success because now there are two strategies being implemented in the world rather than one.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you do find that your values, interests, or goals are similar enough to others in your group, then feeling some discomfort doesn’t mean you don’t fit in, nor is it an indicator that you should leave. Rather, facing that discomfort head-on helps <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/23988269/how-to-be-more-resilient-stress-management">build resilience</a> within these communities. The more we practice these skills and embed them into our lives, the easier it will be to process and move through the tougher times.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Blessing, the community she has built with her neighbors has helped immensely with her anxiety and depression. “Being part of a group that is making changes happen, it feels powerful, and it is an antidote for the powerlessness of that despair that can creep in when you look outside at everything that is happening in our country, in our world,” Blessing says.  “You think, ‘What can I do about it?’ Well, this is something I can do.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It&#8217;s a reason to get up in the morning,” she added. “I needed that.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The 2024 election has conclusively proven something that we really should have known since 2016: America’s gatekeepers have failed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The premise of “gatekeeping,” as a political enterprise, is that there is a mainstream consensus that can be enforced by institutions designed to protect it. It works not by outright violent repression, but by deplatforming and shunning certain ideas, people, movements, and the like.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gatekeeping, when successful, involves a collective of recognized authority figures declaring that something is out of bounds —&nbsp;and then that thing actually getting consigned to the fringes. No politician will engage with it, no talk show hosts will give it a respectful hearing, and only a tiny number of citizens will have heard of it. Think of how nearly everyone agreed, after 9/11, that conspiracy theorizing about the attack deserved scorn.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s wins are proof that gatekeeping doesn’t really work anymore. Immediately after the attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021, there was a brief moment when leaders across the political spectrum agreed Trump was too dangerous to be allowed to remain in politics — and even tried to drive him out. In a January 8 email, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/2/28/23617987/fox-news-rupert-murdoch-dominion-trump-election-fraud">Rupert Murdoch wrote</a> that “Fox News [is] very busy pivoting &#8230; We want to make Trump a non person.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet Murdoch failed, pivoting back to pro-Trump coverage almost immediately. Every other attempt to shun Trump into political nonexistence has met with similar failure.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This isn’t just a Trump phenomenon.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">His chief allies and messengers — like Elon Musk, Joe Rogan, and Steve Bannon — have all been shunned or blacklisted to varying degrees. X/Twitter suffered a post-Musk <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/twitters-revenue-collapses-84-tesla-171535190.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAIZD6WZkZkZXbRVD8XG8plDknEUKzofY8TwVvr6ua93UBS-qNZrjOAVo1MMtyRUP9TemrNOWsupBWenXAmqCYeNfbd-5ThOZXbniR_2QHZCA5H0pZLnySKSVgteQ3h_FGVUuMv0b3mXrzV_AFZgn4buSmY7ibDVuU1vMFsCQCAKZ">ad revenue collapse</a>, liberal musicians <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/02/arts/joe-rogan-spotify.html">pulled their music from Spotify</a> to pressure the streaming giant to drop Rogan, and Bannon just spent four months in federal prison (<a href="https://apnews.com/article/steve-bannon-contempt-sentence-federal-prison-trump-77353a10250c36f77b2c1b7d188c5250">for good reason</a>). None of these tactics have durably eroded these figures’ influence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nor is the failure of deplatforming even a famous person thing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’ve written extensively and repeatedly about the influence of obscure radicals on the mainstream Republican Party — the way that, for example, Vice President-elect JD Vance has <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23373795/curtis-yarvin-neoreaction-redpill-moldbug">explicitly cited someone who openly wants to topple American democracy</a> as a key influence in his thinking about the executive branch. I’m hardly the only one: There’s a whole cottage industry of journalism devoted to tracing the linkages between the true fringe — internet weirdos with <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/09/bronze-age-pervert-costin-alamariu/674762/">names like Bronze Age Pervert</a> — and the Republican mainstream.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such links are no longer hidden, but out in the open. Yet, with a few exceptions, this kind of reporting doesn’t seem to have hurt, and it sometimes even helps the targets of the gatekeepers’ ire by raising their profiles.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Again and again, we’ve seen the gatekeepers’ efforts to deplatform their enemies into oblivion fail. And I think it has a lot to do with a mistaken analysis of power —&nbsp;specifically, a failure to appreciate just how much people with devoted followings can get away with in the 21st-century political-media environment.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Trumping the gatekeepers</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the past, the American mainstream consensus was enforced through bipartisan political agreement and a cultural apparatus dominated by elite institutions:&nbsp;a shared set of norms in those environs helping to define the rules of the political game. If you broke those rules, either by (for example) <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-does-not-understand-military-arlington-1235093220/">insulting the troops</a> or <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/10/bad-bunny-puerto-rico-trump/680453/">particular ethnic groups</a>, you could risk electoral defeat or even being exiled from polite public life.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s 2016 rise to power and 2024 political resurrection help us see why neither political nor cultural elites can enforce their old rules anymore.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Anyone who heads one of the two major parties already has a baseline floor of about 46 to 47 percent of the electorate. The most important voters in deciding the general election are swing voters. In a highly polarized country with two very different parties, swing voters tend to be people who <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/24058352/what-were-getting-wrong-about-2024s-moderate-voters">definitionally don’t have very strong partisan preferences</a>, seeing both parties as potential options.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Candidates like Trump who enjoy unified support of a major party cannot truly be gatekept. They are definitionally part of the mainstream, and thus potentially electable thanks to the basic gravity of a two-party political system.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of this raises the question: How is it that Trump, an extremist, managed to seize control of the Republican Party in the first place?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For reasons I’ve documented extensively, including in my book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reactionary-Spirit-Insidious-Political-Tradition-ebook/dp/B0CMQB8S94"><em>The Reactionary Spirit</em></a>, Trump managed to build a direct bond with a critical mass of GOP primary voters rooted in shared resentments and fears. These voters, like Trump and unlike Democratic partisans, were largely disdainful of any elite attempts to gatekeep him —&nbsp;either from the cultural mainstream or even the alternative elites of the Republican Party, which back in 2016 tried and failed to stop his initial rise in power.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In other words, Trump short-circuited the gatekeeping capacity of both the Republican Party and mainstream media.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After January 6, when some Republican elites tried again to break with Trump, they faced immense backlash from their base. Three days after his “non-person” email, Murdoch was walking things back — <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/2/28/23617987/fox-news-rupert-murdoch-dominion-trump-election-fraud">telling his son Lachlan</a> that “we have to lead our viewers, which is not as easy as it might seem.” Fox’s viewers actually forced its CEO to reboard the Trump train.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So it’s Trump’s personal support, his mass following, that gives him and aligned Republicans the power to resist gatekeepers.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The death of the old political-media order</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s something else too. Shifts in the media landscape have allowed his allies in the cultural space to survive and even thrive for similar reasons.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the past, it used to be hard enough to create a mass media enterprise that only a handful of people — the sorts who could operate television stations and mass newspaper distribution networks — could do it. Today, anyone can find fans on social media and work to monetize that following. Given direct access to a mass audience, unpopularity among cultural gatekeepers is far less of a concern than it used to be.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Joe Rogan has millions of dedicated fans; those fans like him much more than the people trying to make listeners feel bad for enjoying his show. Steve Bannon’s <em>War Room</em> show is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/jun/24/steve-bannon-war-room-republican">super popular among the Trump faithful</a>, and remains so despite (or perhaps because of) his stint in prison. <a href="https://www.vox.com/23481984/trump-kanye-nick-fuentes-ye-jews-anti-semitism-dinner">Nick Fuentes’s weird and creepy fans</a> don’t really care if the mainstream media calls them weird and creepy for stanning a Nazi incel. All enjoy a level of influence and power because of their ties to Republicans who are unwilling to be shamed for said connections.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This fragmented landscape means there&#8217;s not enough cultural unification to ever really expel anyone from the discourse. When Fox News fired Tucker Carlson, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/26/world/europe/interpreter-tucker-carlson-populism.html">many wondered</a> why it took them so long: it was Fox that held the power, not its popular but increasingly difficult employee. Yet Carlson’s post-Fox trajectory —&nbsp;a successful turn to Twitter/X broadcasting that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/18/nx-s1-5043765/tucker-carlson-fox-news-republican-convention">earned him a seat next to Trump at the Republican National Convention</a> —&nbsp;reveals that even the Murdoch empire couldn’t cancel someone with Carlson’s devoted following.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even if someone doesn’t have the personal draw of a Carlson or a Rogan, there are institutions dedicated to serving ever more extreme audiences that might be willing to hire you. If you get “canceled” at a mainstream outlet, you can go to Fox. If you get kicked off Fox News, NewsMax and One America News Network are out there waiting.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To be clear, there are benefits to the end of gatekeeping. By concentrating power in a smaller number of people and institutions, the old consensus encouraged groupthink, resulting in, for example, widespread cheerleading for the 2003 Iraq War. The era of gatekeeping was also meaningfully less democratic, in that it gave elites far more power than the people as a collective to set the terms of public debate. The creator economy, for all its faults, gives citizens the ability to financially empower voices they believe are unfairly cut out of public life.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet those faults are undoubtedly immense.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Donald Trump, a man who literally incited a riot on the Capitol and has <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy">openly vowed to attack democratic institutions in his second term</a>, is president-elect largely — if not primarily — because he built a following that allowed him to short-circuit elite gatekeepers in both parties. And the gatekeepers, for all their flaws, adhered to basic standards of evidence and decency that simply can’t be enforced in our new political-media environment. Does anyone really think this country is better off now that someone like Fuentes has the juice to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/story-trumps-explosive-dinner-ye-nick-fuentes-rcna59010">secure dinner with the once and future president</a>?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Regardless of how you normatively evaluate these trade-offs — ones that I think point to thorny conceptual problems for liberalism itself — we need to be clear on where we’re at empirically. And the fact is that Trump and aligned Republican extremists clearly can’t be criticized into defeat. Nor can Musk be shamed into managing X more responsibly or Rogan ignored into political oblivion.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Their opponents need a new tactic.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some <a href="https://blog.phillyhistory.org/index.php/2011/08/the-boulevard/">110 years ago</a>, a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/oldimagesofphiladelphia/photos/roosevelt-boulevard-philadelphia-pa-circa-1929/1173930726003197/?paipv=0&amp;eav=Afalm-woospaGzSHhjFwCRd8TsK3u_YGSewLU0Dm9ax3uWGI1qCynOKD9Y8ewa7m8qQ&amp;_rdr">picturesque</a> new road known as Roosevelt Boulevard <a href="https://billypenn.com/2017/02/06/how-roosevelt-boulevard-became-the-most-dangerous-road-in-philadelphia/">began ferrying vehicles</a> across the nascent but burgeoning neighborhoods of North and Northeast Philadelphia. At first, traffic was light, but it rapidly thickened as car ownership rose and the surrounding area developed. By the 1950s, when the boulevard expanded to meet the new Schuylkill Expressway, it was lined with row houses and shops. Today, what was initially a bucolic parkway has become a traffic-snarled, 12-lane thoroughfare snaking its way through neighborhoods that house <a href="https://www.phila.gov/media/20210513121401/Route-for-Change-program-executive-summary.pdf">1 in 3 Philadelphians</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is, by all accounts, a mess.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dubbed the “corridor of death,” Roosevelt Boulevard has been named the <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/philadelphia-roosevelt-boulevard-speed-cameras-safety-study/">most dangerous street in the city</a> (and among <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/video/philadelphias-roosevelt-blvd-among-most-dangerous-roads-in-us/#10">the most dangerous in the nation</a>). In 2022, 59 pedestrians were killed there. Residents “want to get across the street to the pharmacy to get their medication or get across the street to the supermarket,” Latanya Byrd, whose niece and three nephews were killed in a crash on the boulevard in 2013, said in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3LxEpAIQMM&amp;t=16s">video</a> produced by Smart Growth America. “It may take two, maybe three lights, for them to get all the way across.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s not just pedestrians who loathe Roosevelt Boulevard. “People who walk, drive, or take public transit are all pretty badly screwed,” Philadelphia’s public radio station <a href="https://billypenn.com/2017/02/06/how-roosevelt-boulevard-became-the-most-dangerous-road-in-philadelphia/">declared</a> in 2017.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Aware of the road’s shortcomings, city officials have long sought design changes that would reduce crashes. But they are powerless to act on their own, because the boulevard is controlled by the state of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That situation is common across the United States, where many of the most deadly, polluting, and generally awful urban streets are overseen by state departments of transportation (DOTs). Often they were constructed decades ago, when the surrounding areas were sparsely populated.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2022/hm10.cfm">only 14 percent of urban road miles nationwide</a> are under state control, two-thirds of all crash deaths in the 101 largest metro areas occur there, according to a recent <a href="https://smartgrowthamerica.org/dangerous-by-design/">Transportation for America report</a>. In some places, this disparity is widening: From 2016 to 2022, <a href="https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/ATD%20PIO/Vision%20Zero/Vision%20Zero%20Update%2005.25.23.pdf">road fatalities in Austin, Texas,</a> fell 20 percent on locally managed roads while soaring 98 percent on those the state oversees. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The country is littered with roads that are a legacy of the past, that don’t work very well, and that drive people crazy,” said US Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR), who calls them “legacy highways.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead of fixing such roadways, state officials tend to keep them as they are, citing limited resources or a need to maintain traffic speeds. In doing so, they constrain the capacity of even the most comprehensive local reforms to respond to urgent problems like <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/25/23844717/america-safe-air-travel-car-safety-accidents">car crash deaths</a>, which are far more widespread in the US than among peer countries, or unreliable bus service.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unless state DOTs recognize that a successful urban road must do more than facilitate fast car trips, that problem will persist.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Why we have state highways</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the early 1900s, states from coast to coast created transportation agencies to build smooth, wide roads that enabled long-distance car trips. New high-capacity roadways traversed forests and farmland, often terminating at what was then the urban edge. When Americans went on a car-buying binge after World War II, states like <a href="https://www.michiganhighways.org/history5.html">Michigan widened their highways</a> with the goal of keeping traffic moving quickly, a prime directive for engineers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://highways.dot.gov/public-roads/septoct-2000/genie-bottle-interstate-system-and-urban-problems-1939-1957">High-speed roadways</a> fed rapid suburbanization, with new developments mushrooming on the city periphery. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Columbus-Ohio">Columbus, Ohio</a>, for instance, roughly doubled in population from 1950 and 2000, while its land area quintupled. Sprawling cities in the South and Southwest <a href="https://population.us/az/mesa/">emerged seemingly overnight</a>, while <a href="https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/bending-lines/why-persuade/1.1.2/">new suburbs encircled</a> older metropolises in the North.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In these newly urbanized areas, state highways that had previously meandered through the countryside were now lined with retail and housing. Their designers had initially paid little attention to transit, sidewalks, or tree cover — features that are often afterthoughts for rural roads, but crucial in more densely populated areas.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As with Philadelphia’s Roosevelt Boulevard, the width and traffic speed of state roads in urban neighborhoods now frequently clash with local desires for street safety, quality transit service, and pedestrian comfort. But revising them is rarely a priority for state DOTs engaged in a Sisyphean battle against traffic congestion.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If a state agency’s primary focus is on moving vehicles, they’re looking at reducing delays and building clear zones” that remove objects such as trees next to a road, where errant drivers might strike them, said Kristina Swallow, who previously led the Nevada DOT as well as urban planning for Tucson, Arizona. “At the local level, you’re looking at a bunch of other activities. You have people walking or on a bike, so you may be okay with some congestion, because you know that’s what happens when people are coming into an economically vibrant community.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">City-state tensions over state highways can take many forms. Roadway safety is often a flashpoint, since fixes frequently involve slowing traffic that state officials want to keep flowing. In San Antonio, for instance, the city negotiated for years with the Texas DOT to add sidewalks and bike lanes to Broadway, a state arterial with seven lanes. Last year the state <a href="https://sanantonioreport.org/san-antonio-txdot-broadway-corridor-funding/">scuttled that plan at the 11th hour, leaving Broadway’s current design in place.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Local efforts to improve transit service can also face state resistance. In September, Madison, Wisconsin, launched its first <a href="https://www.cityofmadison.com/metro/routes-schedules/bus-rapid-transit">bus rapid transit</a> (BRT) line, a fast form of bus service that relies on dedicated bus lanes. But much of its route runs along East Washington, an arterial managed by Wisconsin, and the state transportation department prevented Madison from making the entire BRT lane bus-only <a href="https://media.cityofmadison.com/Mediasite/Showcase/madison-city-channel/Presentation/fe4f5aeeb21d4b38bb2fe030f894018b1d?playfrom=1452000">during rush hour</a>. That could sabotage the new service out of the gate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“These dedicated bus lanes would serve the bus best in the heaviest traffic, so it’s counterintuitive to typical BRT design,” said Chris McCahill, who leads the State Smart Transportation Initiative at the University of Wisconsin and serves on Madison’s transportation commission. Wisconsin’s DOT did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The whole point of fast transit programs like BRT is to get more people to ride transit instead of driving, thereby increasing the total <em>human</em> capacity of a road since buses are much more space-efficient than cars. But that logic can escape state transportation executives oriented toward longer, intercity trips instead of shorter, intracity ones, as well as highway engineers trained to focus on maximizing the speed of all vehicles, regardless of how many people are inside them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even sympathetic state transportation officials may not fix dysfunctional urban roadways due to limited resources and competing needs that include expensive upgrades to bridges and interstates. Critical but relatively small-dollar projects, such as street intersection adjustments that better serve pedestrians or bus riders, can get lost in the shuffle. Lacking the authority to make changes themselves, city officials are stuck.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“How do you create connected networks when you don’t own the intersection, and to fix it you have to compete at the state level with 500 other projects?” said <a href="https://nacto.org/person/stefanie-seskin/">Stefanie Seskin</a>, the director of policy and practice at the National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As an example, Seskin cited the state-controlled St. Mary’s Street bridge in Brookline, a dense suburb adjacent to Boston. “It’s the only way to get to and from Boston that isn’t on a major, super busy arterial,” she said. “It’s not structurally deficient, but from the position of those walking, biking, and using transit, it’s just not functioning well. It requires a reconstruction” — something that Massachusetts has not done.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">The beginnings of a paradigm shift in transportation policy</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With deaths among US pedestrians and cyclists <a href="https://www.vox.com/23784549/pedestrian-deaths-traffic-safety-fatalities-governors-association">hitting a 40-year high in 2022</a>, a growing number of state DOTs are starting to acknowledge that maximizing vehicle speed is not the only goal that matters on urban roadways. The Pennsylvania DOT, for example, is now <a href="https://www.penndot.pa.gov/RegionalOffices/district-6/ConstructionsProjectsAndRoadwork/Philadelphia/Pages/Roosevelt-Boulevard-Improvement-Projects.aspx">working</a> with Philadelphia to at last bring lane redesigns, bus lane improvements, and speed cameras to Roosevelt Boulevard. On the other side of the country, the head of the Washington state DOT has <a href="https://www.theurbanist.org/2024/08/23/wsdot-head-wants-150-million-annual-stroad-fund/">requested $150 million</a> from the state legislature to address the shortcomings of legacy highways.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think there are people in every single state DOT who want to be more proactive and to plan for safer streets for people who are moving, no matter what mode of transportation they use,” Seskin told me. “I don&#8217;t think that that was necessarily the case 20 years ago.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, fixing the deficiencies of state roadways requires a paradigm shift within state DOTs, with senior officials accepting that maximizing car speeds jeopardizes crucial local priorities like accommodating pedestrians, enabling rapid transit service, or supporting outdoor dining.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such nuance can escape state highway engineers trained with a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-06-03/in-killed-by-a-traffic-engineer-a-us-road-planner-pleads-for-reform?sref=qYiz2hd0">myopic focus on vehicle speed</a>. “Many of the people doing roadway design work for states are still stuck in the old model,” said Billy Hattaway, an engineer who previously held senior transportation roles in the Florida DOT as well as the city of Orlando.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">McCahill, of the State Smart Transportation Initiative, empathized with those toiling within state DOTs. “Think about their position as engineers,” he said. “They&#8217;ve got their federal highway design guidelines, they&#8217;ve got their state guidelines. They&#8217;ve been conditioned to be conservative and not try new things.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Historically, those roadway design guidelines have prioritized free-flowing traffic. Making them more malleable could empower engineers to get more creative. Instead of applying one-size-fits-all rules for elements like lane widths and traffic lights, “<a href="https://trid.trb.org/View/1085159">context-sensitive design</a>” encourages engineers working in urban settings to add pedestrian crossings, narrow lanes, and other features that can support local transportation needs. McCahill applauded Florida’s DOT for recently “rewriting” <a href="https://www.fdot.gov/roadway/fdm/default.shtm">its design guide</a> to incorporate such context-sensitive layouts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Federal money could help finance such redesigns — if state officials know how to use it. “There’s a lack of knowledge about the flexibility of federal dollars, with misunderstandings and different interpretations,” said NACTO’s Seskin. Recognizing the issue, over the summer, the <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/specialfunding/legacyhighways/240726.pdf">Federal Highway Administration published guidance</a> and held a webinar highlighting dozens of federal funding programs available to upgrade legacy highways.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then there is an alternative approach: Rather than revise problematic roads themselves, states can hand them over to local officials, letting them manage improvements and maintenance. Washington state, for instance, in 2011 <a href="https://housedemocrats.wa.gov/blog/2011/02/26/bothell-to-get-2-5-miles-of-sr-527-for-multiway-boulevard-project/">transferred</a> a 2.5-mile strip of state road 522 to the Seattle suburb of Bothell. But such moves are not always financially feasible.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The risk is that when you transfer a highway to local government, you take away the capacity to properly fund it over the long term” because the city becomes responsible for upkeep, said <a href="https://www.nlc.org/people/brittney-d-kohler/">Brittney Kohler</a>, the legislative director of transportation and infrastructure for the National League of Cities. Unless the revamped road spurs development that creates new tax revenue, as it did in Bothell, cash-strapped cities may be unable to afford the costs of retrofits and ongoing maintenance.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">States and cities can work together to fix legacy highways — and federal support can help</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Portland, Oregon, pretty much everyone <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2012/03/portlands_bad_roads_readers_re.html">seems to agree </a>that 82nd Avenue, a major thoroughfare that the state manages, is a disaster.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Originally a little-used roadway marking the eastern edge of the city, 82nd Avenue has developed into a bustling arterial. It’s been a dangerous eyesore for decades, with potholed pavement, insufficient pedestrian crossings, inadequate lighting, and minimal tree cover, said Art Pearce, a deputy director for the Portland Bureau of Transportation. According to city statistics, from 2012 to 2021, crashes on the thoroughfare caused 14 deaths and 122 serious injuries. At least two-thirds of crash victims were pedestrians, bicyclists, or occupants of cars turning left at intersections without traffic signals.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During winter storms, Pearce said state workers would often clear nearby Interstate 205 but leave 82nd Avenue unplowed, leaving the city to do it without compensation. “Our priority in snow and ice is to keep public transit moving, and 82nd Avenue has the highest transit ridership in the whole state,” he said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nearby residents and business owners have been begging local officials to revamp 82nd Avenue for decades, said Pearce and Blumenauer (whose congressional district includes Portland). The state was willing to transfer the roadway to the city, but the local officials wanted more than a handshake.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We were like, if you give us $500 million, the city will take over 82nd Avenue and fix it,” Pearce said. “The state officials answered, ‘We don’t have $500 million, so hey, good meeting.’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A breakthrough came in 2021, when the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/american-rescue-plan/">American Rescue Plan Act</a> offered states and cities a one-time influx of federal funding. Matching that money with contributions of their own, the state and city negotiated a <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2021/11/18/oregon-odot-portland-82nd-avenue-local-control/">transfer of seven miles of 82nd Avenue from the Oregon DOT to Portland</a>. Some $185 million will go toward new features including sidewalk extensions, trees, a BRT line, and curb cuts for those using a wheelchair or stroller. Blumenauer, who said that reconstructing 82nd Avenue has been a personal goal for 35 years, led US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/commuting/2023/07/us-transportation-secretary-pete-buttigieg-tours-portlands-82nd-avenue-sees-opportunities-for-area.html">a tour</a> of the roadway last year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The success story is “a bit of a one-off,” Blumenauer admits, reliant on stimulus dollars tied to the Covid-19 pandemic. But a dedicated federal funding source could enable similar roadway reboots nationwide.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the moment, President-elect Donald Trump and incoming congressional Republicans show little appetite for transportation reforms, but a golden opportunity will come during the development of the next <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policy/olsp/reportspubs.cfm">multiyear surface transportation bill</a>, which is expected to be passed after the 2026 midterms. Although Blumenauer did not run for reelection this month, he said he hopes the future bill will include a competitive grant program that invites state and local officials to submit joint proposals to upgrade state highways in urban areas, with federal dollars acting as a sweetener.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Otherwise, these state roads will continue to obstruct urban residents’ most cherished goals of safety, clean air, and public space. Flourishing cities cannot coexist with fast, decrepit roads. Too many state officials have not yet learned that lesson.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Vox reader Alexia Cherry asks: I work at a public library and I think a lot of the talk about libraries is generally uninformed about what librarians actually do. So many people that I interact with are shocked that you need to have a master&#8217;s degree to be considered a professional, and many people don&#8217;t know about the wide variety of library jobs available.</em></p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

<p class="has-text-align-none">People do indeed seem to find librarians oddly mysterious! In August, <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/business/cost-cutting/2024/08/20/library-faculty-eliminated-western-illinois-university">Western Illinois University laid off its entire librarian faculty</a> and at the same time insisted the university would still have “adequate coverage in the library.”&nbsp;The school seemed to be operating under the belief that librarians are only warm bodies who exist to check books in and out, and that they only have master’s degrees in order to artificially jack their wages up. Anyone, this line of thinking goes, could keep a library running without much work. They just need to know how to scan a barcode.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But then, libraries are undervalued in general, perhaps because they are such radical institutions. The truism is that if you tried to invent the public library today, the right would never let you get away with it —&nbsp;giving so many things to the public for free, and subsidizing them all with taxes, imagine. How many other spaces do we have left where a person can go and spend hours on end and still not be expected to buy anything?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps on a subconscious level, we tend to undervalue libraries culturally in order to keep them from reaching their full potential. If we pretend that they’re bizarre federally subsidized bookstores, we don’t need to think about how they’re enormous warehouses full of knowledge available to anyone who walks in, staffed by professionals highly trained in sorting, extracting, and preserving that knowledge.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What do librarians actually do?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Let’s take a brief look at what libraries need and how librarians provide those needs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All libraries, from the public to the academic to the corporate, <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/4/21/15357984/card-catalog-library-of-congress-history">need to be cataloged</a> in order for anyone to know what books are in them, where each kind of book is, and what those books are useful for. In the library sciences, <a href="https://www.librarianshipstudies.com/2015/05/cataloging.html">cataloging</a> is its own highly esoteric specialty, closer to coding than anything else, and it requires careful technical training. Catalogers describe each notable aspect of a book, then classify each aspect so it’s searchable. To do it, you have to learn not just multiple classification systems, but also get training in how to describe a book you may have not read, what parts of it are most important, and which categories will supersede others depending on the library you’re classifying for. A cataloger must make judgment calls on whether to code in spoilers (do you classify a spy novel as “double agent” even if that’s the big twist at the end?) and how far down you should keep subdividing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cataloging is such a rigorous and precise form of information processing that it’s one of a librarian’s most lucrative skill sets in the information era. Some librarians, after grad school, go off to work in corporate archives, where they catalog and preserve information about the company’s history for internal usage. (Not a particularly glamorous job, but the private sector tends to pay better than the public.) Fresh library school graduates can use the same skill set to process papers at historical archives, but there they’ll also need to know how to handle fragile antique documents without damaging them, and potentially how to repair books at the end of their lifespans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All libraries also need acquisition specialists, who are the ones facing heavy scrutiny in our book-banning era. The <a href="https://www.librarianshipstudies.com/2015/05/acquisitions.html">acquisitions department</a> is responsible for deciding where the holes in a library’s collection are and how to fill them. They make the call as to whether it’s a good idea to bring in a book full of errors — say, a book on creationism — if patrons are requesting it, or whether it’s worth it to keep around a book on a controversial subject — say, teen sex ed — if patrons are protesting against it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most libraries need research specialists who can help patrons figure out how to access what they’re trying to look up. If you’re trying to flesh out your family tree, a research librarian can usually tell you what newspaper archives to consult, and get you access to those archives free of charge. If you’re trying to write an academic paper, a research librarian can walk you through the process of which databases best serve your specialty and how to navigate them.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How are public libraries different?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Public libraries require all these specialties, too, and more. Most public libraries have a mandate to serve the communities in which they exist, and so they offer more resources than many people are probably aware exist.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Public libraries in places with a large immigrant population will frequently offer <a href="https://www.nypl.org/get-help/community-resources">free ESL and citizenship classes</a>. Many libraries help connect patrons to social workers, food banks, public health, and legal resources. Many others will let patrons check out things like <a href="https://www.eater.com/2019/9/16/20861011/public-library-cake-pans-on-loan-baking">cooking equipment</a>, <a href="https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/five-things-you-didnt-know-you-could-get-for-free-at-the-library-011822#google_vignette">musical instruments</a>, <a href="https://www.bklynlibrary.org/board-game-library">board games</a>, and even <a href="https://www.almanac.com/seed-libraries-public-libraries-are-growing">seeds</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because public librarians are one of the only third spaces left that don’t charge money, librarians find themselves working as de facto social workers for unhoused people —&nbsp;in addition to the literal social worker that <a href="https://www.ala.org/advocacy/diversity/odlos-blog/social-workers">many libraries now have on staff</a>. <a href="https://onlinegrad.syracuse.edu/blog/libraries-fight-opioid-crisis/">Many libraries train their staff in using Narcan</a> to revive people overdosing on opiates. Some offer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/24/us-libraries-homeless-crisis-social-workers">hygiene kits and clean clothes for unhoused people</a>. All of that is despite the low salaries public librarians can expect. <a href="https://govsalaries.com/salaries/NY/new-york-public-library">The average salary at the New York Public Library system is just around $52,000 per year</a>, under <a href="https://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/36061">the $69,000 estimated to be the cost of living in New York</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A library is both a vast, complex technology designed to preserve and organize information and a physical space that exists in order to serve its community in whatever ways it can. The people who work there have to go through enormous amounts of training in order to do both — even if their labor is often invisible to those of us who enjoy its fruits.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President-elect Donald Trump has begun naming members of his White House team, offering an early signal to the direction he’ll take on important issues, including foreign policy and immigration.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thus far, Trump has announced a number of policy staffers, including several — like former Immigration and Customs Enforcement Acting Director Tom Homan, his pick for “border czar” — who advocate for hardline approaches to immigration. On the foreign policy front, Trump is poised to nominate multiple lawmakers (including Rep. Elise Stefanik, his pick for UN ambassador) who’ve expressed staunch support for Israel and aggressive national security views. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Broadly, Trump’s picks have one key attribute in common: They’re longtime loyalists who could put up less opposition to his policy proposals than staffers did during his first administration.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump described a range of priorities while on the campaign trail, including promises of <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383845/trump-mass-deportations-immigration-family-separation">mass deportations</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/2024/2/9/24064244/trump-economy-china-tarriffs-today-explained">expansive tariffs</a>, and cuts to <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/lgbtq/4656405-donald-trump-transgender-students-athletes-title-ix-lgbtq/">protections for LGBTQ people</a>. It will be up to his secretaries and staff to execute these plans, with his picks thus far underscoring just how serious he is about pursuing many of these goals, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/11/trump-prepares-immigration-crackdown-with-miller-homan-posts/">particularly on immigration</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During his first administration, many of Trump’s Cabinet members oversaw significant changes to the executive branch, including Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who were critical to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/10/labor-secretary-eugene-scalia-faces-blowback-he-curtails-scope-worker-relief-unemployment-crisis/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/10/labor-secretary-eugene-scalia-faces-blowback-he-curtails-scope-worker-relief-unemployment-crisis/">curtailing worker protections</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/19/936225974/the-legacy-of-education-secretary-betsy-devos" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/19/936225974/the-legacy-of-education-secretary-betsy-devos">attempting massive cuts to education spending</a>, respectively. Trump has indicated he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-wins-second-term-policies-de3dcf0f173b42602b258042fd7aaafb">wants to go further</a> and <a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1855692242981155259">move faster this time around</a> and that he wants to ensure he’s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/default/donald-trump-staffs-up-second-term-only-maga-loyalists-need-apply-2024-11-11/">surrounded by like-minded staff</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Below is a rundown of the people Trump has named and the roles these appointees could play.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-2173723479.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Michael Waltz" title="Michael Waltz" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="US Rep. Michael Waltz of Florida. | Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>US Rep. Michael Waltz has been picked as national security adviser</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who he is: </strong>A member of Congress from Florida, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-picks-rep-mike-waltz-former-green-beret/story?id=115753630">Waltz is also a former Green Beret</a> who served in Afghanistan. He worked on foreign policy for under President George W. Bush, and has sat on the Armed Services, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs Committees in the House.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While on the Hill, Waltz became known for his hardline, aggressive stances on China and Iran and for being a vocal critic of President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from Afghanistan.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The national security adviser is a key foreign policy aide to the president; historically, they provide advice on both military and diplomatic matters. The role does not require Senate confirmation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has clashed heavily with past individuals in this role including John Bolton, who has said<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bolton-excoriates-trump-fresh-introduction-his-memoir-2024-01-30/"> he’s “unfit” to serve as president again.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Waltz is one of multiple hawkish foreign policy picks Trump has made. That suggests the Republican Party wing that advocates for intervention and action on the world stage — rather than the restrained, more isolationist faction — may get a large platform in a second Trump administration.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-2162329710.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Representative Elise Stefanik in a dark blue V-neck dress, standing and smiling in front of a microphone." title="Representative Elise Stefanik in a dark blue V-neck dress, standing and smiling in front of a microphone." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="US Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>US Rep. Elise Stefanik (NY) has been tapped for UN ambassador</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who she is: </strong>Once a moderate, Stefanik — currently part of Republican House leadership — has become a vocal Trump loyalist in recent years as her New York district shifted right.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/11/19/20966940/elise-stefanik-impeachment-hearing-donald-trump-adam-schiff">Stefanik first burst onto the national stage</a> as a member of the House Intelligence Committee, grilling witnesses as part of Trump’s first impeachment proceeding in the lower chamber in 2019. More recently, she went viral for her questioning of college presidents <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/23/us/elise-stefanik-republican-antisemitism-hearings.html">during a hearing on antisemitism</a> and their handling of student protests over Gaza.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a top House Republican, Stefanik has amplified Trump’s 2020 election denials and hewed so close to the president-elect that she was once on the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/2/9/24048591/trump-vice-president-pick">shortlist for the vice presidency</a>. Stefanik is also known for her <a href="https://www.vox.com/21262150/house-republican-women-candidates">efforts to recruit and support more Republican women</a> for House seats.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She’s taken a pretty standard conservative stance on foreign policy: Stefanik has been a prominent supporter of aid to Israel while balking at continuing support for Ukraine. She backed early tranches of Ukraine aid but joined other Republicans in arguing that more recent aid could be better applied domestically. Stefanik has previously questioned aid to the United Nations, including to its Relief and Works Agency, which has been vital to providing humanitarian aid to Gaza.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Elise is an incredibly strong, tough and smart America First fighter,” <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-chooses-rep-elise-stefanik-serve-us-ambassador-united-nations-rcna179558">Trump said in a statement about the role</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The UN ambassador serves as a vital envoy for US interests; given the country’s financial support for the body and its role on the UN Security Council, the ambassador has major influence regarding how the organization utilizes its resources and who serves in its leadership.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the last year, UN officials have been increasingly critical of Israel’s attacks on Gaza as thousands have died, health care systems have been assaulted, and famine has struck. As ambassador, Stefanik could criticize these positions and call for defunding UN relief programs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This role requires Senate confirmation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>The pick suggests that the Trump administration could once again ramp up its disagreements with the United Nations, after attempting to <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/10/02/trump-stealthily-seeks-to-choke-off-funding-to-un-programs/">curb funding for certain UN initiatives</a> in Trump’s first term. At that time, the administration also pulled out of the UN Human Rights Council, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/us/politics/trump-israel-palestinians-human-rights.html">citing its criticisms of Israel</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Stefanik’s naming could also underscore <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-ukraine-russia-war-threatens-cut-aid-election-2024/">the president-elect’s skepticism</a> of additional aid to Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

Bernstein/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Former ICE Acting Director Tom Homan has been named “border czar”&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who he is: </strong>Homan was acting ICE director during the first Trump administration and oversaw the implementation of the family separation policy during his tenure from 2017 to 2018. He’s also long backed <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/11/trump-makes-tom-homan-father-of-family-separation-in-charge-of-mass-deportation/">Trump’s desire to deport unauthorized immigrants</a>, previously noting that if invited to join the administration, he intended to “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/11/nx-s1-5186522/tom-homan-border-czar-trump">run the biggest deportation operation this country&#8217;s ever seen</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Homan worked for ICE during former President Barack Obama’s administration as well, and has also served as a police officer and Border Patrol agent. He’s been in lockstep with Trump on implementing punitive immigration policies and called <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tom-homan-trump-border-czar-what-to-know/">for ICE to deport a wide range of unauthorized immigrants</a>, including <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383845/trump-mass-deportations-immigration-family-separation">those who don’t have criminal histories</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Homan will be in charge of all Deportation of Illegal Aliens back to their Country of Origin,&#8221; Trump <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/11/nx-s1-5186522/tom-homan-border-czar-trump">wrote in a Truth Social post.</a> “There is nobody better at policing and controlling our Borders.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The “border czar” is not an official role that requires Senate confirmation;&nbsp;the secretary of homeland security is the actual Cabinet official overseeing the border. However, Homan appears poised to have a major say over policy and will weigh in on proposals at both the northern and southern borders, according to Trump.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Homan’s efforts in the first Trump administration and his commitment to sweeping deportations this term indicate that the president-elect is fully focused on his promise to <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies">remove a large number of unauthorized immigrants from the US</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-1464161119.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.729399246567,100,78.541201506867" alt="Lee Zeldin sits quietly at a desk with his hands folded." title="Lee Zeldin sits quietly at a desk with his hands folded." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Former US Rep. Lee Zeldin. | Roy Rochlin/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Roy Rochlin/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Former Rep. Lee Zeldin tapped as Environmental Protection Agency administrator</strong> </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who he is: </strong>Zeldin is a former Republican House lawmaker who ran a failed campaign for the New York governor’s seat in 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Zeldin did not previously sit on committees focused on environmental policy in the House, and&nbsp;focused on <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/11/09/1134203429/new-york-governor-election-results-kathy-hochul-lee-zeldin">crime and inflation during his gubernatorial run</a>. That year, he came within a notably close margin of Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul as a Republican running in a traditionally blue state.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Zeldin has said some of his <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-taps-lee-zeldin-lead-environmental-protection-agency-rcna179658">first priorities</a> will be to “roll back regulations that are forcing businesses to be able to struggle,” and to work on US “energy dominance.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The EPA is responsible for crafting policies that protect clean water and air, and also plays a major role in approving regulations to combat climate change. The administrator position is a Senate-confirmed role.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Trump promised to take a very different approach to the environment than the Biden administration, including by <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382679/trump-foreign-policy-america-first-tariffs-nato-alliance">exiting international climate agreements</a> and focusing on <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/06/nx-s1-5181891/trump-win-climate-change-fossil-fuels-clean-energy">expanding fossil fuel production</a>. Zeldin’s nomination suggests those promises will be a priority, as will <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/06/nx-s1-5181891/trump-win-climate-change-fossil-fuels-clean-energy">rescinding Biden-era environmental protections</a> that curbed carbon emissions for businesses.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Trump policy aide Stephen Miller expected to be named deputy chief of staff and policy adviser</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who he is: </strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/373479/stephen-miller-mass-deportation-camps-trump-agenda">Miller is a staunch Trump loyalist and policy adviser</a> who pushed many of the harshest immigration policies during the president-elect’s first term. He has advocated for a travel ban and family separations in the past, and he’s a chief architect and booster for the idea of the mass deportations Trump has promised this term as well.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“They begin on Inauguration Day, as soon as he takes the oath of office,” <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/11/politics/stephen-miller-trump-administration/index.html">Miller has said of deportations.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has not yet formally announced the appointment, though Vice President-elect JD Vance has already <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1856004703672324263">posted his congratulations to Miller</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>This position is another political appointment that doesn’t require Senate confirmation, but the role is set to focus heavily on providing Trump with policy guidance — likely focused on immigration, given Miller’s expertise.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Between this appointment and Homan’s, Trump has made clear that his <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies">promised mass deportations</a> will be one of his top policy goals when he retakes office.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-2182885052.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.729339346038,100,78.541321307924" alt="Susie Wiles shaking hands with Trump onstage at a Trump-Vance rally." title="Susie Wiles shaking hands with Trump onstage at a Trump-Vance rally." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Susie Wiles, Trump’s senior national adviser. | Jabin Botsford/Washington Post via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Jabin Botsford/Washington Post via Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Trump campaign adviser Susie Wiles has been named chief of staff</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who she is: </strong>Wiles, a longtime Florida campaign operative, helped run Trump’s 2016 campaign in the state and was a Trump senior national adviser in 2024. She’s heavily credited for the success he had during the Republican primary in 2024 and had previously aided Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis during his gubernatorial run in 2018 prior to a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/09/ron-desantis-susie-wiles-reaction-00188586">falling out between the two</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wiles has also been a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/07/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-susie-wiles-00188391">corporate lobbyist</a> and worked with a spectrum of Republicans in the past, including former Utah Sen. Mitt Romney and Florida Sen. Rick Scott.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Susie is tough, smart, innovative … universally admired and respected,” <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-susie-wiles-chief-of-staff/">Trump said in a statement</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The chief of staff is effectively a gatekeeper who helps shape the president’s priorities and offers policy counsel. The position is the most prominent political appointee in the White House and is not Senate confirmed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Notably, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/22/politics/trump-fascist-john-kelly/index.html">Trump’s former Chief of Staff John Kelly</a> has been a major Trump critic, describing him as a “fascist” who favors a “dictator approach.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Wiles <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/who-is-susie-wiles-the-woman-behind-trumps-historic-return-to-the-oval-office">has been credited</a> with professionalizing Trump’s campaign operations and reining in some of the chaos that has marked his past operations. That said, his campaign was still <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/12/30/trump-poisoning-the-blood-racism">rife with racist remarks</a> that echoed authoritarians as well as frequent lies <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/31/politics/donald-trump-kamala-harris-black-nabj/index.html">about former Vice President Kamala Harris’s </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mveuxlccbV0">policies and identity</a>. Kelly has said he <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/11/trump-susie-wiles-chief-staff-campaign/">attempted to restrain the president</a> during his first term, though it was still plagued by in-fighting and tumultuous policies on everything from climate to immigration.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Expected picks</h3>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-2162179387.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.742099199347,100,78.515801601307" alt="Kristi Noem" title="Kristi Noem" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="South Carolina Gov. Kristi Noem. | Scott Olson/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Scott Olson/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Kristi Noem is expected to be tapped for Homeland Security secretary</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who she is: </strong>The two-term South Dakota governor is a longtime Trump loyalist and was on <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/2/9/24048591/trump-vice-president-pick">his shortlist for the vice presidency</a>. Ahead of Trump making his VP selection, Noem became enmeshed in scandal after she <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24145840/kristi-noem-puppy-killing-book-trump-vp">admitted to shooting her dog, Cricket, because of behavioral issues</a>, generating overwhelming backlash.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As governor, Noem was known for refusing to<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/27/opinion/kristi-noem-south-dakota-coronavirus.html"> impose a mask mandate</a> during the pandemic, and for refusing to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/11/politics/kristi-noem-cpac-south-dakota-governor-covid-mandate/index.html">implement statewide business closures</a> despite public health concerns. Noem was also <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/22/politics/kristi-noem-tribal-lands-ban/index.html">banned by multiple Native American tribes </a>from visiting tribal lands in the state due to claims she’s made that they’ve been infiltrated by cartels.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On immigration, Noem has often echoed Trump’s hardline rhetoric suggesting that <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kristinoem/reel/DCIV983xbLS/?hl=en">many unauthorized immigrants are criminals</a>, and she backed his travel ban targeting Muslim-majority countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>Secretary for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is a significant role given the agency’s notable&nbsp;purview over the administration’s policies at the southern border. DHS includes key subagencies like ICE as well as Customs and Border Protection. The secretary role requires Senate confirmation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Noem is one of several picks that signal Trump’s investment in punitive immigration policies this term such as mass deportation — and aggressive border security. </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-2182884073.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.729028715909,100,78.541942568182" alt="Trump shaking hands with Marco Rubio" title="Trump shaking hands with Marco Rubio" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Sen. Marco Rubio is expected to be tapped for secretary of state</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who he is: </strong>Rubio is serving his third term as a Florida senator and is known for his adversarial position toward China, Iran, and Cuba, as well as his focus on <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2020/08/03/how-marco-rubio-runs-trumps-latin-america-policy-1972792">US-Latin American relations</a>. He currently sits on the Senate Intelligence and Foreign Relations Committees, and though he’s taken foreign policy positions aligned with Trump’s isolationist rhetoric lately, he has previously supported international alliances and interventionist approaches.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rubio has also expressed strong support for Israel, and emphasized he isn’t interested in a ceasefire in the region until the country has defeated Hamas. He’s backed Ukraine aid in the past as well, though he opposed more recent packages and has urged an end to the war.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rubio has also shifted considerably on certain issues like immigration: Early in his career, he was a chief proponent of immigration reform in the Senate, including a path to citizenship for <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/marco-rubio-answers-for-his-failed-2013-immigration-plans-again/">unauthorized immigrants,</a> and his rhetoric has grown more hardline and similar to Trump’s over time.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>This position is one of the most powerful in the administration and key to shaping US foreign policy. The secretary of state is the chief envoy of the US in other countries, and offers counsel for how to approach different international relationships. Secretaries of state are also often dispatched to help mediate conflict. The role requires Senate confirmation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Like Waltz,<strong> </strong>Rubio’s selection suggests that Trump may be open to a more traditionally conservative and aggressive approach to foreign policy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a truism that everything’s bigger in America — just look at the <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2024/03/11/why-american-cars-are-so-big">cars</a> and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/09/american-houses-big/597811/">houses</a>. But perhaps nowhere is the virtue of bigger is better more bizarrely apparent than how toilet paper is sold. Wander into the bathroom products aisle at the supermarket and you’ve entered a topsy-turvy world where numbers shape-shift. A pack of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Charmin-Toilet-Family-Cushiony-Packaging/dp/B07986PWD3">18 mega</a> toilet paper rolls, for example, magically transforms into 90 “regular” ones. The labeling emphasizes this greater number in large font, lest you foolishly think 18 simply equals 18. Another pack might insist that 12 <a href="https://www.target.com/p/charmin-ultra-strong-toilet-paper-12-mega-xxl-rolls/-/A-91778080">even-thicker rolls</a> of toilet paper are the equivalent of 96 normal rolls.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The advertising is clear: You’re getting a lot of toilet paper. That should be good news, since if there’s one rule of thumb everyone should live by, it’s never run out of TP. We saw anxiety around this eventuality reach new heights in the early days of the pandemic, when crowds of people <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/amid-coronavirus-fears-shoppers-throw-punches-over-toilet-paper-1491220">fought to snap up as much toilet paper</a> as they could, leading to a <a href="https://cnr.ncsu.edu/news/2020/05/coronavirus-toilet-paper-shortage/">shortage</a> and extreme <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/us/coronavirus-price-gouging-hand-sanitizer-masks-wipes.html">price gouging</a>. Americans’ enormous vehicles and palatial abodes may in fact exist in service of conveying and storing gigantic bulk packs of this bathroom essential.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s some irony, then, that for all the trumpeting of gargantuan sizes, toilet paper rolls are generally getting smaller. It’s a key example of the trend of manufacturers charging the same price (or even slightly more) for less product that’s been dubbed “shrinkflation.” It makes it more difficult than ever to figure out if you’re getting ripped off. None of the three major toilet paper manufacturers Vox reached out to responded to a request for comment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I really can’t think of any other category that’s as confusing as toilet paper,” says Neil Saunders, managing director of retail at the consulting firm GlobalData. With dubious numerical claims about how much a “mega” roll is really worth, brands can promote the perception of value without actually having to show their work. Figuring out the price per toilet paper sheet is a hassle, but it would show how much more expensive the product has become.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The consumer wouldn’t like that, so they all keep it a bit opaque,” Saunders says.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Get ready for some back-of-the-toilet-paper math</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The most glaring issue plaguing the toilet paper industry is a lack of standardization. Double, triple, and mega rolls are imprecise descriptors that vary by brand; they are not measurement units. In fine print, toilet paper packaging will often admit that these sizes are relative to the “regular” roll — sometimes they mean their own brand’s regular size, but other times, it’s against a competitor’s one-ply regular.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unsurprisingly, the so-called standard size has no consistency, either. Charmin’s regular roll has <a href="https://shop.charmin.com/ultra-strong-regular-roll/">55 two-ply sheets</a>, for example, but it’s often hard to even find the regular size of a brand’s toilet paper in stores. The mega roll is often advertised as having <a href="https://www.quiltednorthern.com/faq">four times as many sheets</a> as the mythical “regular” it’s being compared to, which means that <a href="https://www.cottonelle.com/en-us/products/toilet-paper/ultra-comfort">Cottonelle’s</a> idea of a regular roll contains 61 sheets, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quilted-Northern-Strong-Packaging-Regular/dp/B0BT34BJ8S">Quilted Northern’s</a> an awkward 73.75 sheets, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Angel-Soft-Toilet-Seasonal-Evergreen/dp/B0B2252ZP6">Angel Soft’s</a> 80 sheets. But even these are perplexing figures since many real-life <a href="https://www.costco.com/kirkland-signature-bath-tissue-2-ply-380-sheets-30-rolls.product.100645583.html">standard</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Scott-Professional-13607-Individually-Convenience/dp/B0040ZOEXU?crid=31LW9AE7EEMRX&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.j_nC_bMnzRnBFISOAwUY2IJN1F8_HLQNXc5ttzNZkWnLkPzMcR19_vR1Ef0ZmAxMiFm3npa6POteKaNdDe_-wUSP9Spa8gTAeR6GrnTEHaX16VZshSYHSoMN1o5pVh0GCPRN-BRoGs9TMx4_sjO1KQQN52zetzWH8pxN2Jnrnnp-WsSk0Fg5k-u2oV_wlmzBjZDMGLYapXqvVUgXmgT0HBvX6ScQoLlG5vmufngeeNfR_2n4mh6wQxvrKmRZ-ckZVVYXgxyk2FYnmxQW5t93uZW90LRC7xKHf8sdb6361No.aKriB0qtzi-nJ3ETOyGnchXK3-mEevLNNm3VnZouJZI&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=standard%2Btoilet%2Bpaper%2Broll&amp;qid=1730310506&amp;sprefix=standard%2Btoilet%2Bpaper%2Broll%2Caps%2C106&amp;sr=8-5&amp;th=1">toilet</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cottonelle-12456PK-Ultra-Tissue-Sheets/dp/B00UZNZV24">paper</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seventh-Generation-Toilet-Tissue-Recycled/dp/B00D3JA5V4">rolls</a> contain more than 100 sheets.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The sheets-per-roll ratio is also subject to change depending on whether you’re looking at single-ply, two-ply, or three-ply. (Not to make your brain hurt more, but <a href="https://www.supplytime.com/Blogs/Blog/The-Size-of-a-Sheet-of-Toilet-Paper-Matters_16.aspx">sheet dimensions</a> vary too.) The mega roll is just one size out of many that brands offer, all with slightly different naming conventions. Cottonelle sells mega, family mega, or super mega, while Charmin now offers the <a href="https://www.charmin.com/en-us/shop-products/ultra-strong-toilet-paper-mega-xxl-roll">mega-XXL</a> and even the “<a href="https://shop.charmin.com/all-products/">forever roll</a>,” which is so big you need a standalone holder. There appears to be no limit to the jumbofication of toilet paper jargon. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All this renders comparison shopping far more challenging than it is for the average household product. Making matters worse, there’s no single consistent method of unit pricing for toilet paper. Some retailers, like Walmart, Amazon, and Target, show the price per 100 sheets, but then you still have to factor in the variation in sheets per roll for each brand. Walgreens shows price per sheet, while Home Depot displays a pretty unhelpful price per roll. Irregular unit price labeling is a problem for many consumer products, according to Chuck Bell, programs director of advocacy at Consumer Reports. Unit pricing is “only mandated directly in nine states,” Bell says, while 10 others have voluntarily taken it up. “It’s hard to compare products online for value for money.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s no wonder people have taken matters into their own hands. In late 2018, a California man named Victor Ly launched a “<a href="https://tetrion.com/tpcalc.php?r">Toilet Paper Value Calculator</a>” that crunches the number of rolls, sheets per roll, and any discounts that apply. Ly told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/money/toilet-paper-deals/">Wirecutter</a> in 2022 that a good deal was probably around 0.253 cents per sheet. While there’s no longer a toilet paper shortage or people panic-buying pallets of them — though the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/02/business/toilet-paper-shortages-port-strike/index.html">impulse to do so lingers</a> — it’s a much <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/2023/11/8/23951098/economy-inflation-prices-job-market-sticker-shock">more expensive</a> commodity today than before the pandemic, especially now that we’re a few years out from a <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/24065037/food-inflation-prices-grocery-boycott-carrefour-pepsico">period</a> of <a href="https://www.vox.com/business-and-finance/367103/inflation-report-cpi-ppi-us-economy-fed-rate-cut">high inflation</a>. A report from consumer watchdog Public Interest Research Group noted that, before the pandemic, a pack of 36 Charmin Ultra Soft <a href="https://pirg.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-Year-Later-Comparing-Pre-Pandemic-Prices-to-Todays-on-Amazon-1.pdf">rolls cost $30.95 on Amazon</a>. At time of writing, the same pack <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Charmin-Ultra-Family-Rolls-Regular/dp/B0024NUM9A">costs $59</a> on the site. (In December 2020, it was selling for as high as <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0024NUM9A?context=search&amp;cpf=amazon-new">$114.99</a>.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most name-brand toilet paper today far exceeds Ly’s price threshold. A 30-pack of <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Charmin-ULTRA-STRONG-Toilet-Tissue-Dry-2-Ply-Unscented/7397212016">Charmin Ultra Strong</a> mega rolls breaks down to 0.5 cents per sheet, though a 36-pack of <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Scott-1000-Toilet-Paper-36-Rolls-1-000-Sheets-per-Roll/209228848?classType=VARIANT&amp;athbdg=L1103">Scott 1000 toilet paper</a> is about 0.083 cents per sheet. <a href="https://www.costco.com/kirkland-signature-bath-tissue%2C-2-ply%2C-380-sheets%2C-30-rolls.product.100645583.html">Kirkland’s 30-pack</a> of toilet paper, selling for $23.49 at time of writing, works out to 0.206 cents per sheet.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-02-10/housing-market-making-toilet-paper-more-expensive">cost of making toilet paper</a> may have gone up in recent years, according to the Los Angeles Times, due to a slowdown in lumber production (there’s less available wood pulp, which is what most toilet paper is made of). Combine that with the fact that, as journalist Will Oremus reported in a piece about the <a href="https://marker.medium.com/what-everyones-getting-wrong-about-the-toilet-paper-shortage-c812e1358fe0">pandemic toilet paper shortage</a>, more people are working remotely today, reducing the time spent in office bathrooms. It means that the average consumer is using more toilet paper at home, cringing at how much their budget for bathroom products has gone up. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Shrinkflation strikes – again</h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Toilet paper manufacturers have come up with a way to keep prices roughly the same, though — at least at a quick glance. The same pack of toilet paper you buy every month might only be more expensive upon close scrutiny of the fine print, when you realize each roll is made up of fewer sheets. A recent analysis by loan marketplace LendingTree showed that toilet paper was among the top offenders among products whose size or volume had <a href="https://www.lendingtree.com/credit-cards/study/shrinkflation-report/">shrunk since 2019 or 2020</a>. A pack of 12 mega rolls from Angel Soft went from 429 sheets per roll to 320 — essentially shrinking by a quarter — but at least the price went down by 15 percent too. Charmin Ultra Strong mega rolls, on the other hand, shrank by 15 percent while the price increased by 11 percent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This isn’t a new strategy that only toilet paper makers are employing. People have been complaining about <a href="https://www.prwatch.org/spin/2008/11/7971/sneaky-manufacturers-shrink-packaging-while-keeping-prices-same?page=3">product shrinkage</a> <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/business/analysis-and-features/toilet-paper-rolls-in-the-us-are-steadily-shrinking-this-is-why-10005455.html">for years</a>; a <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2015/08/the-dirty-little-secrets-of-toilet-paper/index.htm">Consumer Reports article from 2015</a> compared toilet paper rolls from top brands, showing that some had reduced by over 20 percent. The reason, manufacturers claimed at the time, was that better paper quality meant that people could use less of it.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>An older Charmin regular roll had 82 sheets versus just 55 today.</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Edgar Dworsky, a former consumer protection lawyer, has been tracking this shady practice — which he calls “<a href="https://www.mouseprint.org/category/downsiz/">downsizing</a>” — for decades on his websites, <a href="http://mouseprint.org">MousePrint.org</a> and <a href="http://consumerworld.org">ConsumerWorld.org</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I remember back in the 1960s when my Mounds candy bar used to be two ounces and became one point something or other,” he tells Vox. He notes that old Charmin toilet paper had as many as <a href="https://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/vintage-nos-charmin-toilet-paper-650-1821062730">650 sheets</a> in a single-ply roll; its mega-XXL today has just 440 sheets. An older Charmin regular roll had 82 sheets versus just 55 today. The playbook is to shrink the current roll size, then invent a new tier (with a more ridiculous name) that can be priced higher.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Consumer brands “are in the business of making you think you’re getting more,” Dworsky says. “It’s all a name game, it’s all a numbers game, and if you’re just oblivious to it, you’re going to get snookered.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">How to avoid flushing money down the toilet</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Toilet paper is marketed both as a value product, where you’re getting four rolls for the price of one, and a weirdly indulgent luxury at the same time. It’s something meant to be quickly disposed of, literally flushed away, yet commercials for toilet paper are almost always focusing on its delightful, cushiony softness or a special “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJfeviFUcyw">quilted</a>” or “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qU03x43pTT4">diamond weave</a>” texture that adds a premium feel to the product. There’s scented toilet paper, and even toilet paper with colorful patterns. One of Quilted Northern’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpXtAhiKHBE">April Fool’s Day ads</a> pokes fun at the excessive promotional style of its own industry, proclaiming a “return” to hand-crafted, artisanal toilet paper.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, this is because we spend so much time with it, and in such an intimate way, so such bells and whistles do matter to some of us. “There’s obviously some people [who], for medical reasons, like to have really soft toilet paper,” Saunders says. “Some people just like extra strong toilet paper.” For others, it’s a pure bang-for-buck play, where they might just gravitate toward the pack with the most rolls (which isn’t necessarily the best value). </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The range of options, from one-ply sparseness to lilac-scented plushness, isn’t the problem. It’s that it’s so hard to disentangle the value you’re actually getting. As Dworsky notes, consumers could bring a scale to weigh packs of toilet paper every time they go to the store, but then what can you do about it? You still have to buy one of the #ShrinkFlated options, and it’s not an area where we’re spoiled for choice. While there are plenty of different versions that a single brand offers, just three manufacturers — Procter &amp; Gamble, Kimberly-Clark, and Georgia-Pacific — make up some 80 percent of the bathroom tissue market.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One could switch to commercial-grade toilet paper, which is much cheaper but is of (ahem) crappier quality. Where consumer toilet paper is soft, perhaps <a href="https://www.charmin.com/en-us/shop-products/ultra-gentle-toilet-paper-with-lotion">infused with lotion</a>, often embossed with a delightful little pattern, the stuff we see in public restrooms is stiff and so thin that it breaks apart if you so much as look at it. Still, a <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/General-Supply-3-3-in-x-700-ft-2-Ply-Jumbo-Roll-Bath-Tissue-in-White-12-Carton-GEN9JUMBOB/305772552">12-pack of commercial toilet paper</a> at Home Depot is about $34 at time of writing, and one roll is about 700 feet long. Assuming that a square of consumer-grade toilet paper is about 4 inches long, a 440-sheet Charmin mega-XXL roll would still be under 147 feet.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-dean-press-cocacola-pepsico-and-general-mills-on-shrinkflation-price-gouging-and-tax-dodging">Lawmakers</a> and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/07/fact-sheet-president-biden-is-taking-action-to-lower-costs-for-families-and-fight-corporate-rip-offs/">President Joe Biden</a> have wagged their fingers at corporations for shrinkflation and have even <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/3819/text">introduced a bill</a> attempting to ban the practice, though neither Dworsky nor Bell thinks it’s likely to become law. But more transparency around product sizes, more consistent unit price labels, or even requiring a consumer notice when there’s a change in size would go a long way to help shoppers. Last year, in the lead-up to price negotiations with suppliers, French grocery chain Carrefour <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/14/carrefour-puts-shrinkflation-price-warnings-on-food-to-shame-brands">started attaching labels</a> next to packaged foods and drinks that had gotten smaller. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s certain is that the deceptive, confusing accounting of toilet paper rolls shouldn’t be the norm — and, in fact, it appears to be mostly a North American tradition. While other countries do also sell “mega” rolls, there’s <a href="https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/search?query=toilet+paper&amp;inputType=free+text">no</a> <a href="https://groceries.morrisons.com/search?q=toilet%20paper">fiddly</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.de/s?k=toilet+paper&amp;crid=KUAE7ZR6KPML&amp;sprefix=toilet+pape%2Caps%2C163&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2">math</a> <a href="https://www.woolworths.co.nz/shop/searchproducts?search=toilet%20paper">on</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/s?k=toilet+paper&amp;crid=2M08DIZBDIX37&amp;sprefix=toi%2Caps%2C934&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2">the</a> <a href="https://www.carrefour.fr/s?q=papier+toilette">packaging</a> insisting that a dozen rolls are somehow more than that. Toilet paper is no small matter, especially for Americans. Per capita, the US is the No. 1 consumer of it in the world, each American using about <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/15676/cmo-toilet-paper-consumption/">141 rolls per year</a> as of 2018. A Consumer Reports buying guide once compared the annual usage to the <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/home-garden/toilet-paper/buying-guide/">length of 23 football fields</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One way to avoid the frustrating morass of counting rolls and sheets is to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/home/2024/03/18/pandemic-covid-bidet-sales/">opt out of the game</a> altogether. “I switched to a bidet 10 years ago,” Dworsky says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Welcome to the golden age of STI prevention.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sure, condoms are still an effective strategy for lowering the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) — but now, they’re just one of a smorgasbord of strategies for decreasing your chances of catching an infection spread by sex.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That includes vaccines to lower your risk of certain STIs, and medications you can take to prevent infection — some with the ease of a morning-after pill, and many that can be mailed to your home after an online telehealth visit. It also includes new STI tests that people can take in their homes, with results available either instantly or within days to enable quick and discreet testing and treatment. In a world where getting sexual health care sometimes feels fraught with judgment, these new methods offer a level of discretion and convenience that feels nothing short of revolutionary.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In-person care is still best for getting the most comprehensive and personalized evaluation and education, and we’ve got guidance on how to find that kind of care <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/355132/sexual-health-care-stds-stis-birth-control-contraception-how-to-doctor-provider-clinic">here</a>. But even sexual health care clinicians recognize it’s annoying — <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/apc.2018.0114">or worse</a> — to go to the doctor sometimes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Inconvenience — whether it&#8217;s cost, or travel, or parking, or taking off work, or other competing demands — is probably a big factor in why people aren&#8217;t necessarily engaged in … sexual health care that they might otherwise benefit from,” says <a href="https://www.populationmedicine.org/dkrakower">Douglas Krakower</a>, an infectious disease doctor and HIV prevention researcher at Harvard Medical School. Stigma — that shameful sense that people who know you have an STI look down on you, whether real or imagined — also sometimes prevents people from getting high-quality sexual health care in person.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The bottom line: People often prefer sexual health care that involves as few other humans as possible. Now, there are more ways to get that than ever.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Not everyone gets to benefit equally from these advances. Some come with hefty out-of-pocket price tags or are still out of reach for pregnant or likely-to-be-pregnant people. Still, the changes represent a leap forward in an area of health care that needs as much help as it can get.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s what’s out there.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>You can greatly reduce your risk of HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and more&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">STIs include a range of bacteria and viruses that cause unpleasant genital symptoms, threaten your ability to have pleasurable sex, and may endanger your ability to have healthy children. Barrier protections like internal and external <a href="https://www.ashasexualhealth.org/condoms/">condoms</a> are still the best (and usually cheapest) way to protect yourself from STIs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, if you anticipate having sex without condoms, there are now lots of other ways to prevent STIs. Vaccines have come a long way and <a href="https://www.ashasexualhealth.org/vaccines/">several can prevent STIs</a>, including HPV (a cause of genital warts and cervical cancer), mpox, and hepatitis A and B. Recent studies also suggest being vaccinated against meningitis can offer some <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(24)00031-8/abstract">gonorrhea protection</a>, especially among gay men and the people they have sex with.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are also pills and injectable medications that can greatly reduce the risk a sexual partner will infect you with HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">HIV prevention is available in a few forms: as a daily oral or every-two-months injectable medication you take <a href="https://www.ashasexualhealth.org/hiv-prevention-prep/">before sex</a> (called PrEP, for pre-exposure prophylaxis), or as a month-long regimen of oral medicines you take immediately after sex. The latter option, called <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/prevention/pep.html">PEP</a>, for post-exposure prophylaxis, has to be started within 72 hours of exposure to be effective. Both options work by entering the body’s cells and preventing HIV from replicating inside them.</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">

<ul>
<li>PrEP, a daily oral or every-two-months injectable HIV-prevention medication you take <a href="https://www.ashasexualhealth.org/hiv-prevention-prep/">before sex</a></li>



<li>PEP, a month-long course of oral HIV-prevention medication you take <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/prevention/pep.html">after sex</a></li>

</ul>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s even more progress to come in this area: An every-six-months injectable drug for preventing HIV infection called lenacapavir has shown huge promise in preventing HIV infections in both <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2407001">women</a> and <a href="https://avac.org/press-release/purpose-2/">trans and nonbinary people</a> and could be available for US use as soon as <a href="https://www.gilead.com/news/news-details/2024/gileads-twiceyearly-lenacapavir-for-hiv-prevention-reduced-hiv-infections-by-96-and-demonstrated-superiority-to-daily-truvada">late 2025</a>. Krakower says an oral option isn’t far behind.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Syphilis has been rising explosively in the US for the past few years, affecting gay men and the people they have sex with as well as heterosexual men and women, especially those whose sexual partners include sex workers and people who inject drugs. The trend has huge stakes: Women can spread syphilis to their pregnancies, leading to serious illness or death in their newborns. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Earlier this year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released guidelines for using <a href="https://www.ashasexualhealth.org/doxy-pep-is-a-new-strategy-to-help-prevent-stis/">doxyPEP</a>, a <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2022/10/25/23402228/doxypep-doxycycline-pep-morning-after-sti-chlamydia-syphilis">morning-after pill to prevent syphilis infection</a>. This breakthrough strategy involves taking the antibiotic doxycycline the morning after sex — and because this medication also fights other germs, doxyPEP also reduces gonorrhea and chlamydia transmission.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The problem is that doxycycline’s effects on pregnancy are unclear, but there’s suspicion they’re <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4898140/">not good.</a> Many clinicians are therefore hesitant to prescribe it to younger patients in their care.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, because congenital syphilis has become such a dire national emergency, scientists are seeking ways doxyPEP can protect pregnant people and their fetuses. One focus is getting more men who have sex with men and women to use doxyPEP; another approach may involve prescribing the drug to women at high risk of syphilis infection. In a Japanese study of <a href="https://www.natap.org/2024/IAS/IAS_14.htm">female sex workers</a>, this strategy led to plummeting syphilis and chlamydia rates.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>You can get at-home testing for a range of STIs&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It used to be that if you’d had unprotected sex with a new partner or had unusual genital symptoms — like painful urination, funky discharge, or skin changes like a bump, ulcer, or rash — you’d have to jump through a lot of hoops to figure out whether you had an STI. You would start by visiting a clinic or emergency room; getting your parts swabbed by a clinician (or peeing in a cup or getting blood drawn); waiting for a lab to process those results; waiting for the doctor’s office to communicate those results to you; going back to the clinic for medicine or picking it up at a pharmacy; and then potentially going back again to be retested once treatment was done. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, a variety of new testing options allows clinics to get test results within hours for a range of STIs. Once these get adopted broadly by clinics and emergency rooms, it’ll be a lot easier for people to get testing and treatment all in the space of one health care visit. Hopefully, that will lower the number of people who get diagnosed with an STI but never get treated for it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another huge step forward: New tests now enable people to do most or all of the STI testing and treatment process at home, online, or through the mail — without a doctor or another clinician having to get involved. “Agency is what home testing gets people,” says <a href="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/yuka-c-manabe/2707088">Yuka Manabe</a>, an infectious disease doctor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine who leads the home-based HIV and STI testing program, <a href="https://iwantthekit.org/">I Want the Kit</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The FDA has only approved a handful of these tests, and they’re not perfect. For example, the only FDA-approved test that screens for chlamydia and gonorrhea with home-based sample collection is the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-grants-marketing-authorization-first-test-chlamydia-and-gonorrhea-home-sample-collection">Simple 2</a> test —  it’s only approved to test samples from penises and vaginas. That means the test <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/sexual-health/-home-sti-testing-work-fda-clears-first-self-test-gonorrhea-chlamydia-rcna125994">can’t be used to diagnose throat and rectal infections</a>, which are more common in men exposed through oral or anal sex with other men. So while the Simple 2 is a great choice for people who engage only in heterosexual sex, it leaves out gay men and people they have sex with. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another important innovation is the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-marketing-authorization-enables-increased-access-first-step-syphilis-diagnosis">First to Know</a> Syphilis Test, which can detect within minutes syphilis-fighting antibodies in blood samples <a href="https://firsttoknow.com/">collected at home</a> with a simple skin prick. The FDA approved the test in August. However, it has a catch: The test doesn’t distinguish between new syphilis infections and old, already-treated infections. That means people who’ve had syphilis before can’t use the test to rule out a new infection.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s worth noting that home-use HIV tests have been FDA-approved for <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/approved-blood-products/oraquick-home-hiv-test">more than a decade</a>, although they also require follow-up testing for positive results.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Just because these tests are FDA-approved doesn’t guarantee they are covered by insurance; you can check with your insurer to find out what it will cost you. If it’s not covered, it’s worth checking to see if you live in a part of the country where free HIV, gonorrhea and chlamydia, or trichomonas test kits are available (the <a href="https://www.ashasexualhealth.org/testing-for-stis-at-home/">American Sexual Health Association</a> lists free HIV and STI home test kit resources).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most of this testing would be free or low-cost if you got it in person, says <a href="https://www.ncsddc.org/about/our-staff/">Elizabeth Finley</a>, the senior director of communications and programs at the National Coalition of STD Directors. “There’s some equity implications” in the reality that higher-income people can afford to pay out of pocket for the convenience of home-based testing, while lower-income people often cannot, she says.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Choosing a test is just the beginning</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">An array of companies have created <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/free-home-sti-test#A-quick-look-at-the-best-free-or-low-cost-STI-tests">home-based STI tests</a> that haven’t yet been approved by the FDA, including ones for <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/hepatitis-b-test">hepatitis B</a> <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/hepatitis-c-screening">and C</a>, which are often overlooked. Non-approval doesn’t mean a test is garbage — it just makes it harder to be certain that it’s effective at doing what you want it to do.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There are no real guardrails for the companies in terms of the quality they have to offer to customers,” Finley says. “The tests have to work, but I&#8217;m not sure customers are fully informed about, if they see a test available on social media, ‘Is this a good one? Is this a bad one?’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The appeal of these tests is strong for people who hate having someone else get their genital sample. Many of them have you pee in a cup, pinprick your own finger and blot blood on a card, or swab a range of body parts at home (including your vagina or penis, your butt, or your throat), then mail that sample to a lab that runs the usual tests on it, which can be retrieved in an online portal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Home testing kits also often make an end-run around the process of getting to a brick-and-mortar clinic to figure out next steps or pick up medication. Many use a telehealth platform to connect people who test positive for an STI with clinicians, who can provide counseling, suggest ways to get partners tested, and mail some medications directly to patients.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Curing many STIs requires one or more antibiotic injections, and experts sometimes recommend additional evaluation after a diagnosis. Both of these scenarios require an in-person visit with a clinician. If you test positive for one of these STIs, your test company’s telehealth provider should direct you to a clinic where you can see an in-person clinician.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Giving people the option of self-directed sexual health care isn’t just good for people’s sense of autonomy — it’s also a sensible response to impending health worker shortages. Out of concern for an inadequate global supply of clinicians, the World Health Organization has recently recommended a <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240052192">range of self-care interventions</a> for people all over the world, among them many of the latest innovations in STI self-sampling and testing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s about time, Manabe says: “We’re not trusting the public enough.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the weekend, a very small wildfire broke out in a hilly and densely vegetated area of Prospect Park, a swath of green space in Brooklyn. The 2-acre blaze drew about 100 firefighters as residents were warned to stay out of the park. Meanwhile, on the New York-New Jersey border, another blaze, the Jennings Creek wildfire, has burned thousands of acres, sending smoke drifting across much of New York City and killing an 18-year-old New York state forest ranger volunteer who <a href="https://amp-cnn-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2024/11/10/us/new-york-wildfire-death?amp_js_v=0.1&amp;amp_gsa=1#webview=1">died while responding to the fire</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Is this typical? Not exactly. But the Northeast has been under severe drought conditions for weeks. These fires, and the dozens of others currently burning in the Northeast and across the Ohio River Valley, as well as the scores more in the Western US, are the consequence of months of unseasonably hot and dry weather across large swaths of the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Okay, pause: What <em>is</em> a drought? Simply put, a drought is a dry period — that is, a long stretch of time without any rain or snow — that leads to a water shortage. Droughts can (and do) happen all over the world; they are not just a characteristic of a desert or a regional problem. Extreme drought can stress landscapes and water tables, regardless of whether a city is built on top of them. If a drought lasts long enough, <a href="https://www.vox.com/24152402/mexico-city-day-zero-water-resource-management-solutions">people in that place can lose access to water</a>.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the Western United States is associated with aridity, it is remarkable to see this extent of drought spread across the Northeast. And current forecasts show that the conditions will persist for weeks or even months. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s problematic to see drought in all parts of the country. It’s not just a regional issue,” said <a href="https://drought.unl.edu/AboutUs/WhoWeAre.aspx?id=8">Brian Fuchs</a>, a climatologist with the National Drought Mitigation Center. “Regardless of where you’re at, drought can and will impact you.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Firefighters extinguished the Prospect Park fire. Rain mercifully moved into New York on Sunday night and snuffed much of the smoke drifting across the East Coast, obscuring the fact that a cluster of fires in New Jersey continued to burn.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As the smoke fades, attention shouldn’t: Millions of people in the Northeast remain under red-flag wildfire warnings, which signal conditions where anything that can generate a spark could likely lead to a fire. But we all live with drought, extreme heat, and fire now — and our relationship to water is connected to just how bad things could get.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GettyImages-2183348826.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.785131724411,100,78.429736551177" alt="Five people and two dogs stand across the water from a mountain on fire at night." title="Five people and two dogs stand across the water from a mountain on fire at night." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="People watch as a wildfire burns and spreads on a mountain in West Milford, New Jersey, on November 9, 2024. | Kyle Mazza/Anadolu via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Kyle Mazza/Anadolu via Getty Images" />
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Why is the drought so severe?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For much of the country, October was an extremely hot and dry month. We are on pace for 2024 to become the hottest year ever recorded, a declaration that forecasters from the World Meteorological Organization are <a href="https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/2024-track-be-hottest-year-record-warming-temporarily-hits-15degc">making with confidence</a> even with more than a month left. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.drought.gov/current-conditions">According to the US Drought Monitor</a>, the long periods of hot and dry conditions have left every state in the country facing drought — an unprecedented statistic.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There isn’t a single driver responsible for the scope of the current drought conditions. Even as our global average temperatures <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/chapter-1/#:~:text=The%20Anthropocene%3A%20Strengthening%20the%20Global%20Response%20to%201.5%C2%B0C%20Global%20Warming&amp;text=14-,.,et%20al.%2C%202013).">are rising</a> thanks to climate change, our short-term weather patterns will shift all of the time. For example, despite Hurricane Helene bringing heaps of moisture to places like North Carolina a little more than a month ago, even western North Carolina is now abnormally dry. How can that be? Because it&#8217;s been that hot and dry in the weeks since — enough to erase any sign of a so-called <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/09/17/carolina-beach-flooding-unnamed-storm/">thousand-year event</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“When I started looking at data over the past six months, you see that places like New Jersey, the Ohio River Valley, much of the plains have 12 to 15 inches below normal precipitation for this time of the year,” Fuchs said. “New York has a deficit of 10 inches. That’s very extreme for this part of the country.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And then there are these warmer temperatures later in the year that end up amplifying the ongoing drought’s worst effects. Temperatures usually fall significantly by November. Trees will drop their leaves and go dormant. Certain critters hibernate or go into low-power mode. Snow begins accumulating in the higher elevations, banking moisture that will melt out — gradually — during the warmer periods.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But when it’s 80 degrees in New York in November, trees and vegetation are still consuming water. There’s an extra period of demand on the overall water system, and that taxes water sources — lakes and streams begin to draw down and the ground holds onto less moisture. Vegetation that grew earlier in the year begins to dry out —&nbsp;and fuel wildfires.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It really doesn’t take much time to transition to a hot and dry environment and you all of a sudden have all of this extra fuel for wildfires,” Fuchs said. “This is the perfect mix for fires to blossom.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Should we expect more wildfires?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Drought is a normal part of our climate, but it’s not normal<em> </em>to see this much drought across so much of the country.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Resources to help you understand how drought will impact where you live</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">There are two monitors produced by the US Drought Monitor from the Climate Prediction Center that reflect what areas in the US will be most affected by drought and water scarcity. These projections, which update regularly, give a real-time pulse on conditions across the country and are created through a partnership between the US Department of Agriculture and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. These tools are also helpful in getting a clearer picture of how the climate is impacting your local landscape and will give you the heads-up if you’re likely to face water shortages.</p>



<ol>
<li><a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/ConditionsOutlooks/Outlooks.aspx">The monthly outlook</a> is a great snapshot for this moment in time. It provides a gradient of drought conditions, shaded by severity, impacting the country. If you live in a place where drought is persisting, conserve your water and be aware of acute wildfire risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li><a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/ConditionsOutlooks/Outlooks.aspx">The seasonal outlook</a> currently shows projection through January 2025 and will update again in mid-November to show conditions expected to the end of February. This map is helpful for getting a longer-range view of aridity and whether it’s likely to lessen or become more severe.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This extreme period of dry weather is a part of the larger picture that scientists have come to expect: that our weather will become more extreme and unpredictable and that we will collectively experience more pronounced swings from incredibly dry periods to incredibly wet periods.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those dry periods, Fuchs says, are connected to warmer temperatures persisting into what should be the colder parts of the year and ramping up the demand on our water systems.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That demand, by the way, includes water consumption by you, me, and everyone else. Just multiply our daily showers, drawing from the tap, running our dishwashers and washing machines, washing our cars, watering our house plants (and so on) by the millions of people who live in a watershed, the area that shares a single water source for a particular region. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If there’s too much demand on an already-stressed landscape, the wildfire risk increases as water levels in streams and in our water table drop. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To better navigate the conditions we see today and the climate we should expect in the future, we need to understand that no place is immune to drought conditions, Fuchs said. “Even if you think you’ve not been impacted by drought in the past, it’s increasingly important for people to know where their water comes from and conserve it the best you can at any time,” he said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We’re actively experiencing severe climate change impacts,” said <a href="https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/person/aradhna-tripati/">Aradhna Tripati</a>, a climate scientist from UCLA who helped author the <a href="https://nca2023.globalchange.gov/">latest national climate assessment</a>. Climate change “is no longer theoretical or a distant threat, an abstract one. It is not something that happens in the future here. It is not something only happening in places far away from where we live. All weather is now being affected.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes — even in New York City.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Support independent journalism that matters — </em></strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/support-now"><strong><em>become a Vox Member today</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the war in Gaza began, the threat of a protest vote — in which voters would choose to abstain from the presidential election or vote for third-party candidates who had no shot of winning — hung over Democrats’ heads because of President Joe Biden’s unconditional support for Israel and its right-wing government. When Vice President Kamala Harris became the nominee, her lack of willingness to distance herself from Biden on this issue didn’t help alleviate that threat. Meanwhile, Donald Trump <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/6/28/trump-calls-biden-a-bad-palestinian-in-us-presidential-debate-jab">accused Democrats</a> of not being sufficiently pro-Israel.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Throughout the election, pro-Palestinian voters tried to pressure Biden to change course, organizing protests on college campuses across the country and forming various campaigns to punish him at the ballot box. One group, the Uncommitted National Movement, asked Democratic voters to cast their ballots for “uncommitted” instead of Biden during the primaries, and they amassed hundreds of thousands of votes — <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/22/nx-s1-5048065/will-the-democrats-uncommitted-delegates-support-kamala-harris">enough to secure delegates</a> at the Democratic National Convention (DNC).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But no matter how much pro-Palestinian voters pushed candidates to give them a better vision for how to end the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, none were willing to meaningfully address the concerns of pro-Palestinian voters. And for Americans who regarded Gaza as one of their top concerns, their choice <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/381550/arab-americans-protest-vote-harris-gaza-palestine-israel">boiled down to either</a> punishing Democrats or stopping Trump. The result was an election in which neither outcome would have been a win for Palestinians.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While it’s impossible to point to any single issue to explain why Harris lost to Trump, it’s clear <a href="https://theintercept.com/2024/11/06/dearborn-michigan-rashida-tlaib-kamala-harris-gaza/">Harris lost at least some voters</a> because of the Biden administration’s stance on Gaza. And now Trump, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/16/us/politics/trump-gaza-refugees-travel-ban.html">vowed to ban</a> Palestinian refugees from entering the United States and said <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/israel-hamas-war-trump-strip-student-visas-anti-semitic-foreigners-2023-10">he would revoke visas</a> from foreign students who are deemed antisemitic, is the president-elect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Voters wanted an actual plan to stop the war. Candidates weren’t interested</strong>.</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When it came to which candidate had a better vision for how to end the war in Gaza, neither Biden, Harris, nor Trump offered a compelling message.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden offered Israel <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/18/politics/joe-biden-israel-trip/index.html">unqualified support</a>, sending billions of dollars in military aid. His administration defended Israel even as it committed horrific war crimes, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-16/biden-backs-israel-s-hospital-raid-hopeful-on-hostage-release">including hospital bombings</a>. Instead of reckoning with the rapidly rising death toll in Gaza, he <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/biden-says-he-has-no-confidence-palestinian-death-count-2023-10-26/">cast doubt</a> on the numbers that the Gaza Ministry of Health had put out — numbers that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/despite-bidens-doubts-humanitarian-agencies-consider-gaza-toll-reliable-2023-10-27/">humanitarian groups</a> and even the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/10/24/gaza-death-toll-palestinian-health-ministry/">US government had deemed</a> reliable in the past.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At times, Harris, after she became the Democratic nominee, tried calling out Israel for the staggering death toll, saying that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0lx2xgn55o">“far too many” civilians</a> had been killed and emphasizing that <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/harris-vows-to-always-give-israel-the-ability-to-defend-itself-says-gaza-war-must-end/">how Israel conducted itself</a> during this war mattered. She called for an end to the war, but after having served in the administration that financed Israel’s war with virtually no conditions, it wasn’t a particularly convincing message.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris also muddied her outreach — or lack thereof — to Arab Americans by coupling any sympathetic statement about Palestinians with a staunch defense of Israel. At her DNC speech, for example, she said the death toll in Gaza was “<a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/368462/kamala-harris-israel-palestine-gaza-dnc-speech">heartbreaking</a>” and that Palestinians’ right to self-determination ought to be realized — reiterating long-held US talking points — but also prefaced that statement by again justifying the war itself. When she was asked whether she was worried about losing Arab American voters because of Israel’s conduct, <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/harris-the-first-and-most-tragic-story-coming-out-of-gaza-is-oct-7-onslaught/">she said</a>, “There are so many tragic stories coming from Gaza,” but that “the first and most tragic story is October 7.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For his part, Trump didn’t try to say he would be any better than Biden on Gaza. Earlier this year, he said Israel should wrap up the war and “<a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-gaza-israel-policy-war-b2524136.html">get back to peace and stop killing people</a>.” But he said it not in the context of sympathy for Palestinians, but out of concern that Israel was making itself look bad. “And the other thing is I hate — they put out tapes all the time. Every night, they’re releasing tapes of a building falling down. They shouldn’t be releasing tapes like that,” he <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-gaza-israel-policy-war-b2524136.html">said</a>. “That’s why they’re losing the PR war.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, also seemed more concerned about the lost opportunity for development in Gaza than the human suffering, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/19/jared-kushner-gaza-waterfront-property-israel-negev">saying</a> that the strip’s waterfront properties could be very valuable. “There was no ocean as far as that was concerned. They never took advantage of it,” <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-gaza-oceanfront-comments-rebuild-israel-2024-10">Trump said</a>. “You know, as a developer, it could be the most beautiful place — the weather, the water, the whole thing, the climate.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As to how Trump would deal with Benjamin Netanyahu, he indicated that he would let the Israeli prime minister be even more unrestrained, <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/187332/trump-biden-tough-netanyahu">saying Netanyahu</a> was “doing a good job” and that Biden was holding him back.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Throughout the election, Palestinians were a target</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, whether Trump would end up being worse than Biden or Harris on this issue didn’t necessarily resonate with pro-Palestinian voters. For them, what’s been happening over the last year already represented the worst. Israel, after all, has <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/01/26/1227078791/icj-israel-genocide-gaza-palestinians-south-africa">already been credibly accused</a> of genocide at the International Court of Justice. As one Georgia voter told me in the week before the election, “In no way do I imagine Trump is better for Palestine … [but] I can’t imagine it worse.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That helps explain why so many Arab Americans came out against Harris on Election Day. In Dearborn, Michigan, an <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/wayne/2023/09/26/arab-americans-now-a-majority-in-dearborn-new-census-data-shows/70929525007/">Arab-majority city</a>, Trump <a href="https://theintercept.com/2024/11/06/dearborn-michigan-rashida-tlaib-kamala-harris-gaza/">won 43 percent of the vote</a> compared to Harris’s 36 percent. In 2020, Biden won the city with 69 percent of the vote, and though Harris lost there, Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Palestinian American, won her reelection to Congress with 62 percent of the vote.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As much as this issue resonated with many voters, America’s politicians were not ready to rethink the country’s relationship with Israel, even as the war escalated to the point where now over <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2023/10/9/israel-hamas-war-in-maps-and-charts-live-tracker">44,000 Palestinians have been killed</a>. In July, when Netanyahu gave an address to Congress, he was <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/24/nx-s1-5048793/netanyahu-met-with-standing-ovation-and-protest-over-joint-meeting-of-congress">met with a standing ovation</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From the start, Palestinians were a target in this election. During the Republican primaries, candidates got on the debate stage and competed over <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/gop-presidential-candidates-compete-seen-closest-israel-debate-rcna124311">who would be the most pro-Israel president</a>. At that point, it had been a month since Hamas’s October 7 attack, and Israel’s war on Gaza had already <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/reuters-next-un-chief-says-gaza-deaths-show-something-wrong-with-israel-2023-11-08/">killed over 10,000 Palestinians</a>, 40 percent of whom were children. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he would tell Netanyahu to “finish the job once and for all with these butchers,” referring to Hamas. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott said, “You cannot negotiate with evil.” Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley repeated a line she had already tested out on the campaign trail: “Finish them.” She would later <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/nikki-haley-writes-finish-them-israeli-artillery-shell-drawing-criticism-2024-05-29/">write that on an artillery shell</a> during a visit to Israel. As for Trump, he <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/07/trump-racist-insult-palestinian-schumer/678902/">even hurled the word</a> “Palestinian” as an insult.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At each turn, no matter how devastating the war became, Palestinians were humiliated. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-condemns-antisemitic-protests-palestine-columbia-university/">Pro-Palestinian protesters</a> were <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/hillary-clinton-anti-israel-protesters-dont-know-very-much-about-the-middle-east/">denigrated</a>. And voters who sympathized with Palestinians in Gaza <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/31/bill-clinton-criticised-for-saying-israel-forced-to-kill-gaza-civilians">were scolded</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That left voters with no tangible options to improve the situation in Gaza at the ballot box, prompting many to believe that the best way to be heard is by sending a message that reckless foreign policy will cost incumbents votes. Even as <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/381550/arab-americans-protest-vote-harris-gaza-palestine-israel">some voters tried</a> to turn the election into a referendum on Biden’s Gaza policy, the reality was that no candidate was willing to promise anything beyond the status quo. So Palestinians and their supporters found plenty of reason to believe that whatever the election outcome would be, it could only range from bad to worse.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That feeling of hopelessness paved the way for a protest vote to take hold. While Biden’s Israel policy, in the end, might not have been the deciding factor for much of the electorate, in some pockets of the country, voters tried to show that they shouldn’t be ignored in the only way they could: by voting against the party that allowed Gaza to turn into a “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/gaza-graveyard-for-children-un-chief-warns-intl-hnk/index.html">graveyard for children.</a>”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s hard to know what the next few months, or next four years, will look like for Palestine. But there aren’t many signs of hope — if there are any at all. As the election drew to a close, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/06/palestinians-will-not-be-allowed-to-return-to-homes-in-northern-gaza-says-idf">Israelis announced</a> they are nearing a “full evacuation” of northern Gaza and that “there is no intention” to allow Palestinians to return. That sounds like only the beginning of a new phase in the war. ​​</p>

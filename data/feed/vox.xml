<p class="has-text-align-none">Kamala Harris elevated abortion rights to the heart of her campaign, but <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy">Donald Trump is the winner of the 2024 presidential election</a>. So what does this mean for reproductive rights on the federal level?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The short answer is that there are many ways Trump could ban abortion, and the most likely way isn’t through Congress, even with a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/republicans-senate-control.html">Republican-controlled Senate</a>.&nbsp;(It is not yet clear whether Republicans will take control of the House.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The long answer is that as a candidate, Trump <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/373046/trump-republicans-ivf-abortion-reproductive-rights-election">waffled on his positions on abortion</a>. Despite frequently <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-was-able-kill-roe-v-wade-rcna84897">bragging</a> about appointing the Supreme Court justices who overturned <em>Roe v. Wade, </em>Trump started to soften his tune in the months leading up to the election, especially as his vice presidential pick JD Vance began generating negative media attention <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jd-vance-advocated-abortion-illegal-nationally_n_66984d11e4b076f190eb37a1">for his anti-abortion views</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Election Day drew nearer, Trump <a href="https://x.com/TrumpDailyPosts/status/1827007862830452738">began insisting</a> he’d be “great for women and their reproductive rights” but he also repeatedly dodged questions about whether he’d veto any national abortion bans that land on his desk. At the presidential debate in September, Trump refused to answer that question multiple times, insisting it wouldn’t be necessary since abortion rights are now a matter of state discretion. By October, though, he finally came out to say he would veto a federal abortion ban, posting on social media that he would “<a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1841295548109955091">not support a federal abortion ban, under any circumstances</a>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unfortunately, that’s not as reassuring as it sounds.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Federal abortion bans in 2025 are not likely to take the form of bills landing on the president’s desk. Any bill out of Congress would still require some bipartisan agreement unless lawmakers <a href="https://www.vox.com/21424582/filibuster-joe-biden-2020-senate-democrats-abolish-trump">overturned the filibuster</a>.<strong> </strong>Republican senators have already <a href="https://punchbowl.news/article/senate/senate-republicans-say-they-will-preserve-filibuster/">promised to preserve the filibuster</a> in a Trump administration, and the anti-abortion movement, for its part, has not been counting on the GOP to push bills with a simple majority. Given the widespread support for abortion rights across the US, passing a federal ban would also be politically dangerous for congressional lawmakers from swing or moderate districts, making the near-term prospect of such efforts highly unlikely.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Quite frankly, unless something really unusual happens in this election, neither side is going to have the votes in Congress to pass a national law,” Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-vance-walz-debate-2024-election-abortion-64c739e99ffa1ad51b973e420e1fe92d">told the Associated Press</a> in early October. “So that wasn’t really at the top of our list anyway.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They do have a list, though.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sending abortion pills by mail is more at risk</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One agenda item at the top of the anti-abortion movement’s list is enforcement of <a href="https://www.vox.com/abortion/351678/the-comstock-act-the-long-dead-law-trump-could-use-to-ban-abortion-explained">the Comstock Act</a>, an 1873 federal law that could prohibit anything associated with abortion from being sent in the mail. Such a ban could mean not only restricting abortion medication — the most common method used to end a pregnancy in the US — but also any medical equipment used during abortion procedures, like speculums, suction catheters, and dilators.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We don’t need a federal abortion ban when we have Comstock on the books,” Jonathan Mitchell, the legal architect <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/8/31/22650303/supreme-court-abortion-texas-sb8-jackson-roe-wade-greg-abbott">behind a 2021 law in Texas</a> that effectively banned abortion in that state, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/17/us/politics/trump-allies-abortion-restrictions.html">told the New York Times</a> earlier this year. Mitchell urged anti-abortion groups to &#8220;keep their mouths shut as much as possible until the election&#8221; regarding this strategy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Comstock Act was rendered moot by <em>Roe </em>in the 1970s but never formally repealed, and now, with <em>Roe </em>gone, many conservatives see it as an ideal vehicle for restricting abortion nationwide, precisely because it wouldn’t require the passage of a new federal law.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For months Trump dodged journalists&#8217; questions regarding the Comstock Act, but by August, he <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/26/nx-s1-5090224/trump-abortion-pills-comstock">finally said</a> he would not use the old statute to ban abortion drugs in the mail. However, many people in his close orbit, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/07/17/jd-vance-abortion-comstock-vice-presidential-nominee/">including the vice president-elect</a>, are on record urging the opposite, and it was a core item of Project 2025, the notorious policy blueprint drafted by <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce">the Heritage Foundation</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/22/us/politics/project-2025-trump-heritage-foundation.html">many people close to Trump’s campaign</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump could also ban abortion by appointing anti-abortion leaders to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tz2BUuzTmE">control key federal agencies</a> that could use executive power to restrict reproductive rights, including the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, says her top priority is to push Trump to appoint anti-abortion leaders to executive agencies so they can integrate anti-abortion policies into existing federal programs. “I think reversing the Biden-Harris abortion agenda will be vibrant, it’ll be active,” she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/opinion/kristan-hawkins-abortion-republicans-trump.html">told the New York Times</a> over the summer.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hawkins says her group’s second priority will be to push HHS to defund Planned Parenthood. While federal funds are already barred from financing abortion, Planned Parenthood receives federal money from the Office of Population Affairs for family planning and preventive health services, including contraception, cancer screenings, and STI testing. (In 2019, Trump <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/8/14/20805628/planned-parenthood-title-x-trump-birth-control">issued a rule to limit this money</a>, which was <a href="https://19thnews.org/2021/10/title-x-contraception-family-planning/">subsequently reversed</a> under the Biden administration.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Appointing anti-abortion leaders to agencies like the FDA and DOJ could affect anti-abortion litigation. In October, three Republican attorneys general (Raúl Labrador in Idaho, Kris Kobach in Kansas, and Andrew Bailey in Missouri) filed a lawsuit to force the FDA <a href="https://theweek.com/politics/gop-abortion-pill-republican-states-fda-mifepristone">to heavily restrict access to mifepristone</a>, one of two drugs used to induce abortions. (Though medication abortion has a lower risk of complication than many other widely available drugs, it has faced stricter regulation in the US largely for political reasons. Since 2016, the FDA has gradually reduced these restrictions, including allowing for telemedicine prescriptions.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/355175/supreme-court-mifepristone-abortion-alliiance-hippocratic-medicine-fda">threw out a similar FDA complaint</a> over the summer, concluding the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the lawsuit, the Republican attorneys general believe they’ll be better able to prevail in this new attempt. Notably, they also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/health/abortion-pill-mifepristone-lawsuit.html">argue in their complaint</a> that the FDA has violated the Comstock Act by permitting abortion bills to be sent by mail. While a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/olc/opinion/application-comstock-act-mailing-prescription-drugs-can-be-used-abortions">2022 Biden DOJ opinion ruled that</a> the Comstock Act doesn&#8217;t criminalize mailing abortion drugs if the sender lacks intent for unlawful use, a Trump DOJ could interpret the law differently. A Trump FDA also may not fight changing rules on abortion pills at all.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The judiciary awaits</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The last major way Trump could promote a federal abortion ban is through federal court appointments. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In his first presidential term, for example, Trump appointed one of the most anti-abortion judges in the country — <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/12/17/23512766/supreme-court-matthew-kacsmaryk-judge-trump-abortion-immigration-birth-control">Matthew Kacsmaryk</a> — to a federal court in Texas. Kacsmaryk greenlighted the now-overturned legal opinion that the FDA <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/11/us/abortion-pill-ruling.html">should revoke its approval of mifepristone</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s<strong> </strong>campaign has maintained close ties to Leonard Leo, the co-chair of the right-wing Federalist Society, which helped Trump vet all his anti-abortion judicial appointments in his first four years in office. (Leo also <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/supreme-court-leonard-leo-reforms-corruption-1235070458/">helps finance groups</a> to bring cases to the Supreme Court and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/03/supreme-court-amicus-briefs-leonard-leo-00127497">orchestrates strategy</a> for the conservative legal movement broadly.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The anti-abortion movement has been explicit that its long-term goal is “<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/24090347/alabama-ivf-ruling-fetal-personhood-abortion-embryos">fetal personhood</a>” — endowing fetuses, embryos, and fertilized eggs with full human rights and legal protections. This once-fringe idea has been gaining traction over the last few years. (Kacsmaryk also embraced the idea of “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/08/texas-judge-kacsmaryk-abortion-pills-ruling-anti-abortion-rhetoric">unborn humans</a>” and fetal personhood.) At least 19 states have declared that fetuses at some stage of pregnancy are people, according to <a href="https://www.pregnancyjusticeus.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fetal-personhood-with-appendix-UPDATED-1.pdf">a report from Pregnancy Justice</a>, a group that advocates for pregnant people’s rights.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In February, the Alabama Supreme Court issued a decision <a href="https://www.vox.com/24080428/alabama-ivf-embryo-abortion-women-fertility">that claimed frozen embryos</a> count as “children” under state law. In April, the Florida Supreme Court <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/4578252-florida-supreme-court-signals-readiness-to-rule-for-pre-born-personhood/">signaled openness</a> to hearing a future challenge on fetal personhood when its chief justice asked whether Florida’s constitution should include “the unborn” in its equal protection statute.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And in the 2022 majority opinion for <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf"><em>Dobbs v.</em> <em>Jackson Women’s Health Organization</em></a><em>, </em>the<em> </em>case that overturned <em>Roe</em>, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito seemed to lay the groundwork for a fetal personhood challenge by repeatedly emphasizing the significance of “fetal life.” Over the spring, Alito <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/justice-alito-voices-support-for-fetal-rights-in-federal-law">also seemed to endorse the idea</a> that a fetus needed the same “stabilizing treatment” in a hospital as a pregnant patient.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Codifying a fetal personhood standard could lead not only to the outright ban of abortion but also most forms of <a href="https://www.vox.com/24087411/anti-abortion-roe-dobbs-birth-control-contraception-ivf">birth control</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/24080428/alabama-ivf-embryo-abortion-women-fertility">in vitro fertilization</a> (IVF). While Trump and Republican lawmakers insist they are determined to protect reproductive rights, including IVF and contraception, their anti-abortion judicial picks could do just the opposite.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Editor’s note, November 6, 5:45 am ET: </em></strong><em>Donald Trump <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy">has won the 2024 presidential election</a>. For more of our 2024 campaign coverage, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382197/trump-harris-live-results-polls-updates-analysis-explainers">click here</a>.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The presidential race remains too close to call, likely coming down once again to the Rust Belt trio of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the results so far suggest former President Donald Trump improved his performance in much of the country relative to 2020, and that if Vice President Kamala Harris still manages to win, it would be by an extremely narrow margin.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The two swing states called by a major news outlet as of early Wednesday are North Carolina and Georgia, both of which were won by Trump. Harris likely can’t count on Arizona, the swing state where she’d polled the worst, though it will take some time to count the votes there.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Georgia and Arizona indeed fall to Trump — and keep in mind they haven’t been called yet, but he looks formidable there — Harris’s path to victory depends on winning <em>all three</em> of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. If she loses just one in this scenario, it’s over for her. (The other remaining swing state, Nevada, will be very slow in counting, but it would be too small to make much of a difference in the Electoral College.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All three of those Rust Belt states are still close. Trump leads the current count in all three, though many uncounted votes remain from Democratic-leaning areas.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But notably, outside the swing states, Trump is on track to do significantly better than he did in 2020, so a Harris win scenario depends on the Rust Belt defying an apparent nationwide shift in Trump’s favor.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For instance, Biden won Virginia by 10. As of late Tuesday, with more than 80 percent of votes in the state counted, Harris led Trump by a mere 1.7 percentage points. That margin is sure to expand when more Democratic areas count, but per the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-virginia-president.html">New York Times’s forecast of the uncounted vote,</a> she’ll likely end up with somewhere around a 5-point win, significantly worse than Biden.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similar dynamics are at play in many other states, and Trump utterly romped in Florida, winning it by about 13 percentage points. (In 2020, Trump won Florida by a little over 3 percentage points.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, it seems quite possible that Trump could win the national popular vote. It will take some time to determine that, as it would depend on the final margin in slow-counting states like California.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But what really matters is how the Rust Belt states end up, and we&#8217;re still waiting to learn that.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Update, November 6, at 1:07 am ET: </em></strong><em>This piece, originally published on the evening of November 5, was updated to include Georgia being called for Trump.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Fearless journalism needs your support now more than ever. </em></strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/support-now"><strong><em>B</em></strong></a><a href="https://www.vox.com/support-now"><strong><em>ecome a Vox Member today</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The 2024 presidential election is over — and Donald Trump is the victor. There is no doubt about the election’s legitimacy: Trump is on track to win the Electoral College by a wide margin, and potentially win the popular vote for the first time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet while the election itself was clearly on the level, what comes next may not be. Having won power democratically, Trump is now in a position to enact his long-proposed plans to hollow out American democracy from within.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump and his team have developed detailed plans for turning the federal government into an extension of his will: an instrument for carrying out his oft-promised “retribution” against President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and anyone else who has opposed him. Trump’s inner circle, purged of nearly anyone who might challenge him, is ready to enact his will. And the Supreme Court, in its wisdom, has <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship">granted him sweeping immunity</a> from his actions in office.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In nearly every conceivable way, a second Trump administration will likely be more dangerous than the first, a term that ended in over 1 million deaths from Covid-19 and a riot at the Capitol. A predictable crisis — a president consolidating power in his own hands and using it to punish his enemies —&nbsp;looms on the horizon, with many unpredictable crises likely waiting in the wings.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet as dire as things are, America has reserves it can draw on to withstand the coming assault. Over the course of the country’s long democratic history, it has built up robust systems for checking abuses of power.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">America’s federal structure gives blue states control over key powers like election administration. Its independent judiciary stood strong during Trump’s first term. Its professional, apolitical military will likely push back against unlawful orders. Its politically active citizenry has a proven capacity to take to the streets. And America’s world-leading media will fiercely resist any effort to compromise its independence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No country at America’s level of political-economic development has ever collapsed into authoritarianism. There are some reasonably close modern analogues, most worryingly modern Hungary, but even they are different in crucial respects.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is not to make an argument for complacency or naive optimism. Quite the opposite: The next four years will be American democracy’s gravest threat since the Civil War; if it survives them, it will surely do so battered, bruised, and battle-scarred.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But this realism should not be cause for succumbing to despair. As grim as things feel now, it’s possible that — if people take the gravity of the threat seriously — the republic may come out intact on the other side.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Trump’s scary second-term agenda, explained</h1>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We do not know why, exactly, America’s voters have chosen to return Trump to high office. The data isn’t fully in, let alone analyzed in detail. But as murky as the electoral picture remains, certain elements of the policy future are crystal clear. Trump’s own comments, his campaign’s statements, and allied documents like <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce">Project 2025</a> give us a relatively coherent picture of what the agenda will be in the next Trump administration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Much of it resembles what you’d see from any other Republican president. Trump will appoint corporate allies to lead federal agencies, where they will work to slash regulations on issues ranging from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/11/03/trump-labor-union-election/">workplace safety standards</a> to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-02/climate-skeptics-are-hatching-big-plans-for-a-second-trump-term">pollution</a>. He has already proposed <a href="https://prospect.org/economy/2024-09-20-trumps-tax-cut-a-rama-total-so-far-9-75-trillion/">regressive tax cuts</a> without off-setting hikes, which would increase the federal deficit in the same way as George W. Bush’s fiscal policy did. He will <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/366495/trump-medication-abortion-mifepristone">likely take steps to curtail abortion access</a>, end <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/381094/trump-second-term-2024-election-justice-department-civil-rights">federal police efforts to rein in abusive police</a>, and crack down on <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/20/trump-lgbtq-second-term-agenda/">federal protections for trans people</a> —&nbsp;all examples of how his agenda would hurt certain groups of people, typically already vulnerable ones, more than others.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s biggest breaks with his party in traditional policy areas will likely come on trade, immigration, and foreign policy. Trump has proposed a “universal” tariff on imported goods, a mass deportation campaign that detains suspected “illegals” in camps, and <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/trump-can-t-withdraw-from-nato--but-he-could--quiet-quit">weakening America’s commitment to the NATO alliance</a>. These policies would together be a recipe for economic decline, domestic turmoil, and global chaos — <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/380060/trump-world-risks-war">at an already chaotic time</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But perhaps the most dangerous Trump policies will come in an area that traditionally transcends partisan conflict: the nature of the American system of government itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Throughout the campaign, Trump has proven himself obsessed with two ideas: exerting personal control over the federal government, and exacting “retribution” against Democrats who challenged him and the prosecutors who indicted him. His team has, obligingly, provided detailed plans for doing both of these things.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This process begins with something called Schedule F, an executive order Trump issued at the end of his first term but never got to implement. Schedule F reclassifies a large chunk of the professional civil service —&nbsp;likely <a href="https://donmoynihan.substack.com/p/what-mandate-for-leadership-says">upward of 50,000 people</a> — as political appointees. Trump could fire these nonpartisan officials and replace them with cronies: people who would follow his orders, no matter how dubious. Trump has vowed to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/381094/trump-second-term-2024-election-justice-department-civil-rights">revive Schedule F “immediately”</a> upon returning to office, and there is no reason to doubt him.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Between a newly compliant bureaucracy and leadership ranks purged of first-term dissenting voices like former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Trump will face little resistance as he attempts to implement policies that threaten core democratic freedoms.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And Trump and his team have already proposed many of them. Notable examples include <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-suggests-re-elected-biden-indicted-rcna132810">investigating leading Democrats on questionable charges</a>, prosecuting <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/381094/trump-second-term-2024-election-justice-department-civil-rights">local election administrators</a>, using regulatory authority for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/31/business-leaders-trump-election">retribution against corporations that cross him</a>, and either shuttering public broadcasters or <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/09/what-would-project-2025-do-for-or-to-journalism/">turning them into propaganda broadsheets</a>. Trump and his allies have claimed unilateral executive authority to take all of these actions. (It remains unclear which party will control the House, but Republicans will be in charge of the Senate for at least the next two years.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, all this executive activity is aimed at turning the United States into a larger version of Hungary — a country whose leadership and policies are regularly praised by Trump, Vice President-elect JD Vance, and Project 2025 leader Kevin Roberts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hungary still has elections and nominal free speech rights; there are no tanks in the streets or concentration camps for regime critics. But it is a place where everything —&nbsp;from the national elections authority down to government art agencies — has been twisted to punish dissent and spread the government’s propaganda. Every aspect of government has been bent to ensure that national elections are contests in which the opposition never has a fighting chance. It is a kind of stealth autocratization, one that maintains the veneer of democracy while hollowing it from within.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is why the second Trump presidency is an extinction-level threat to American democracy. The governing agenda Trump and his allies explicitly laid out is a systematic attempt to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2024/07/why-special-republican-relationship-hungary-so-worrying/679035/">turn Washington into Budapest-on-the-Potomac</a>, to deliberately and quietly destroy democracy from within.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Democracy is not lost</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is important to remember that, as dire as things are, the United States is not Hungary.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Prime Minister Viktor Orbán came to power in 2010, he had a two-thirds majority in the country’s parliament — one that allowed him to pass a new constitution that twisted election rules in his party’s favor and<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/19/world/europe/19iht-hungary19.html"> imposed political controls on the judiciary</a>. Trump has no such majority, and the US Constitution is nearly impossible to amend.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">America’s federal structure also creates quite a few checks on the national government’s power. Election administration in America is done at the state level, which makes it very hard for Trump to seize control over it from Washington. A lot of prosecution is done by district attorneys who don’t answer to Trump and might resist federal bullying.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The American media is much bigger and more robust than its Hungarian peers. Orbán brought the press to heel by, among other things, politicizing government ad purchasing —&nbsp;a stream of revenue that the American press, for all our problems, does not depend on.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But most fundamentally, the American population has something Hungarians didn’t: advanced warning.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the form of subtle authoritarianism pioneered in Hungary was novel in 2010, it’s well understood today. Orbán managed to come across as a “normal” democratic leader until it was too late to undo what he had done; Trump is taking office with roughly half the voting public primed to see him as a threat to democracy and resist as such. He can expect major opposition to his most authoritarian plans not only from the elected opposition, but from the federal bureaucracy, lower levels of government, civil society, and the people themselves.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is the case against despair.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As grim as things seem now, little in politics is a given —&nbsp;especially not the outcome of a struggle as titanic as the one about to unfold in the United States. While Trump has four years to attack democracy, using a playbook he and his team have been developing since the moment he left office, defenders of democracy have also had time to prepare and develop countermeasures. Now is the time to begin deploying them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has won the presidency, which gives him a tremendous amount of power to make his antidemocratic dreams into power. But it is not unlimited power, and there are robust means of resistance. The fate of the American republic will depend on how willing Americans are to take up the fight.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Editor’s note, November 6, 6 am ET: </em></strong><em>Donald Trump </em><em><a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has won the 2024 presidential election</a></em><em>.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Republicans have won a majority in the Senate, flipping the body after four years of Democratic control. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This was the <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings">predicted outcome</a> given how vulnerable Democrats were this cycle: While they were defending nine battleground seats, Republicans were only defending three. The GOP successfully flipped key states including West Virginia and Ohio, while holding off unexpectedly competitive challenges in places like <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380855/nebraska-dan-osborn-deb-fischer-senate">Nebraska</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/380707/texas-senate-race-allred-cruz-2024-election">Texas</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Republicans’ victories come as former President Donald Trump leads in electoral votes, with multiple swing states still outstanding. As of 2 am ET, the presidential race has not been called for either candidate, though <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/05/2024-election-results-live-coverage-updates-analysis/blue-wall-trump-battlegrounds-00187653">early results seem to suggest an advantage for Trump</a>, with Vice President Kamala Harris’s plausible paths to victory narrowing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In their campaigns, Republican Senate candidates leaned heavily on critiques of Democrats’ economic policies as many voters continued to grapple with inflation and high costs of living. They also kept up fear-mongering on immigration as well, arguing that only they could offer solutions to <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24153132/us-border-crisis-mexico-migrant-immigration-asylum">border crossing surges</a>, like the one in 2023. Overall, because they weren’t in control in the Senate, Republican candidates were able to capitalize on anti-incumbent sentiment — and current discontent — as they campaigned to take back certain seats.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Republicans’ gains could have major implications for a potential Trump or Harris administration. If Trump wins, the Republican Senate would effectively offer him a blank check on appointments, and allow him to resume stacking the courts with his judges. Depending on the outcome of House races, a GOP Senate could also enable a possible Trump administration to pursue policy priorities like rolling back the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/31/politics/aca-trump-repeal-affordable-care-act/index.html">Affordable Care Act</a> (ACA) and renewing <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/370753/taxes-debate-trump-harris-irs-tariffs-child-tax-credit">corporate tax cuts</a>. If Harris wins, the Senate could well stymie key judicial appointees, and block her legislative goals.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Republican Senate control could mean</strong>&nbsp;</h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The role the Senate will play in the next few years will depend heavily on who wins the presidential race.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The last Trump presidency was ultimately illustrative of what happens when both the White House and Senate are held by Republicans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In that scenario, Trump was able to advance his judges at a rapid pace, reshaping the Circuit Court and Supreme Court with conservative picks. In total, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-judicial-nominations-judge-appointments/">Trump was able to get 234 judges confirmed</a>, including the three who now sit on the Supreme Court who proved integral to overturning <em>Roe v. Wade.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similarly, Trump faced little backlash or accountability for his rhetoric or policy decisions throughout his term, including attempts to implement <a href="https://time.com/5322856/trump-travel-ban-republicans/">a Muslim travel ban</a> or to shut down the government as leverage for funding for a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/senate-republicans-all-but-surrender-to-trump-on-wall-despite-shutdowns-toll/2019/01/20/dc3efb96-1b56-11e9-a804-c35766b9f234_story.html">wall along the US-Mexico border</a>. Although some Republican senators spoke out, few truly vocalized their opposition to Trump or scrutinized his actions. When Trump was <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/1/13/22227519/house-second-impeachment-trump-incitement-insurrection">impeached for his role in fomenting the January 6 insurrection</a>, for example, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/2/13/22280838/senate-acquits-donald-trump-impeachment-vote">only seven Republicans voted to convict</a> him — the rest voted to acquit him.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Republicans maintain control of the House, a GOP Congress could also help Trump advance his legislative agenda.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has focused more on executive actions he’d like to take (such as on <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/374102/trump-harris-tariffs-congress">tariffs</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies">immigration</a>, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382679/trump-foreign-policy-america-first-tariffs-nato-alliance">international relations</a>) than on a congressional agenda. However, Republicans have long expressed an interest in curbing access to the ACA. One issue lawmakers will weigh in the next year is the expiration of ACA premium subsidies, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/06/election-2024-republican-senate-health-care-policy/">Stat reports</a>. House Speaker Mike Johnson has emphasized already that he’s interested in major “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/us/republican-congress-trump-johnson.html">reform</a>” to the health care bill as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/us/republican-congress-trump-johnson.html">tax cuts that Republicans passed in 2017</a> are also up for renewal, and will be another issue that lawmakers in the next Congress will need to tackle. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kamala-harris-trump-tax-cuts-election-2024-what-to-know/">Trump has suggested cutting</a> the corporate tax rate and has floated some income tax cuts too. Regardless of whether they take the House, Senate Republicans will likely advocate for those cuts. And Republicans could push, too, for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/climate/republicans-climate-change-fossil-fuels.html">expanded oil and gas drilling leases</a> that Democrats had previously curbed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Senate Republicans have already signaled that they plan to be as obstructionist as possible if they’re dealing with a Harris administration.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Notably, both Sens. John Thune (R-SD) and John Cornyn (R-TX), two likely successors to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/29/politics/cornyn-thune-supreme-court-plans/index.html">have told CNN</a> that they aren’t sure if they would hold a vote for any potential Harris Supreme Court nominees. With the majority, the GOP can try to block <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/377729/kamala-harris-supreme-court-electoral-college-senate-constitution">any Harris judicial appointment from advancing</a>, much like they once did with former President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland and some of his lower court picks. In the case of Garland, the GOP successfully refused to ever hold a confirmation hearing or vote for him — and were able to prevent him from getting seated on the bench.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They could do the same for other Cabinet roles as well, and they could also block legislation from advancing. Harris campaigned heavily on working to enact policies that require congressional approval, including sweeping <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/dnc-harris-speech-election-2024/card/harris-pledges-to-sign-bipartisan-border-bill-csVc4bVyNHlyx9yqnyyE">immigration</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/31/nx-s1-5172251/how-much-power-does-a-president-have-when-it-comes-to-abortion-access">abortion reform</a>. Those policy goals are unlikely to become a reality in a GOP-controlled Senate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Regardless of whether Trump or Harris is in the White House, expect the upper chamber to play a significant role in advancing or hampering their efforts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Editor’s note, November 6, 6:07 am ET:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Donald Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy">has won the 2024 presidential election</a>. For more of our 2024 campaign coverage,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382197/trump-harris-live-results-polls-updates-analysis-explainers">click here</a>.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though votes are still being counted and several battleground states remain to be called, we can see a handful of trends developing in the 2024 election. Former President Donald Trump is once again showing that he can turn already ruby-red parts of the country even more Republican. And in the suburbs, where Democrats have made gains throughout the Trump era, those gains seem inconsistent at best this time around.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, though it’s still too early to say for sure, it appears that Trump has made large-scale inroads with voters of color, particularly in Latino communities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Exit polls, the main way commentators and journalists try to make sense of the electoral trends happening nationally, are notoriously unreliable, and it will be weeks, or months, before they paint a full picture. But here are some trends that appear clear so far.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Trump has been able to maximize his support in rural areas</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Everyone expected Trump to dominate in rural areas. What wasn’t clear, however, was whether he could improve on the already large margins by which he won in 2020.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, it seems that he has. Early in the night, Trump built big cushions of support in Indiana, Kentucky, Georgia, and North Carolina. That trend continued throughout the night. In rural counties across Pennsylvania, for example, the general trend as votes were counted was that Trump was able to both increase turnout and increase his margin of support in the GOP heartland.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One obvious example of this rural surge: Lackawanna County, home to President Joe Biden’s hometown of Scranton, swung 5.6 points to the right from 2020 — even though Kamala Harris still looked on track to win the county by the smallest of margins.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The suburban shift toward Democrats stalled</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To offset those expected GOP margins of support in rural places, Democrats have had to rely not just on winning urban centers, but getting a boost in surrounding suburbs. Those suburbs have been trending toward Democrats since 2016 — but it’s not clear today that this leftward lurch has continued.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first clear sign of trouble in the suburbs came northern Virginia’s Loudoun County, a Washington, DC, suburb with a large concentration of college-educated voters. Biden won it by about 25 points in 2020; this year, Harris appears to have won it by just about 17 points.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Indiana’s Hamilton County, seen as perhaps an early indicator of other trends because of its Indianapolis suburbs, Harris was trailing Trump by about 6 points — running nearly even with Biden’s performance in 2020 (Trump +7).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, other suburbs around the country did continue that Democratic drift. In the suburban counties surrounding Atlanta, for example, Harris was on track to do a bit better than Biden in 2020, increasing the Democratic margin in Cobb and Gwinnett counties by about a point each.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Democratic support among voters of color, especially Latinos, is continuing to erode</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pre-election polling indicated that Trump was on track to post historic gains in support from nonwhite voters. Though we don’t have great national data yet (early exit polls can be unreliable), we did see some dramatic shifts from places with large Latino populations.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The most obvious example is Florida. The state moved in a decidedly Republican direction, and its Latino electorate did as well. Miami-Dade County, which used to be a reliably Democratic county with a huge Cuban American population, swung for Trump by double digits. Osceola, a county with a large Puerto Rican community, also flipped for Trump, after Biden won it by 14 points. And more specifically, cities with large Puerto Rican and Cuban populations, like Kissimmee and Hialeah, saw a dramatic drop-off in Democratic support, according to Democratic firm <a href="https://x.com/carlosodio/status/1854008462826488012">Equis Research’s analysis</a>. One caveat: Florida’s Latino population is unlike those in other parts of the country&nbsp;— it’s much more diverse in terms of national origin and had been already shifting toward Republicans after 2020.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, similar swings happened in South Texas, where Trump expanded his margins in the county he won in 2020, Zapata; flipped two more counties (Starr and Cameron); and ran nearly even with Harris in Hidalgo and Webb counties. Beyond those two states, which drifted further red, national exit polls, as unreliable as they may be, seem to be painting a broader picture of eroding Democratic support with Latinos: <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-elections/exit-polls">Early results</a> suggest Democrats just barely won the majority of these voters, after exit polls in 2020 signaled Biden won about two-thirds.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Let’s say you decided to vote by mail.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The bad news is if you make a mistake filling it out — even a small one — your ballot can be tossed out. Some voters in Nevada, for instance, are reportedly having their ballots rejected because the signature they used to sign their ballots <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/11/nevada-voter-signature-matching-election-forensics/">does not resemble the signature the state has on file</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there’s also good news: Often, a voter whose mailed-in ballot would otherwise not be counted can “cure” that ballot and then their vote will count. All “curing” means is that voters are given a chance to fix the disqualifying error. The rules vary by state, and if you want to know what the rules are in your home state, <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/table-15-states-with-signature-cure-processes">the National Conference of State Legislatures lists them here</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One important thing to keep in mind is that, if you did cast a ballot that needs to be cured, both state election officials and your political party may attempt to contact you by phone, text, or email. So, <em>if you voted by mail and receive a call from an unfamiliar number in the next few days, it’s a good idea to answer it</em> — it may be someone warning you that you are about to be disenfranchised if you don’t act.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of the seven swing states, five allow ballots to be cured in at least some circumstances:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Arizona</strong>: In Arizona, ballots can be tossed out if an election official determines that the signature on the envelope containing the ballot <a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/arizona/title-16/section-16-550/">doesn’t match the signature</a> in a voter’s registration record. State law, however, requires election officials to “make reasonable efforts to contact the voter, advise the voter of the inconsistent signature and allow the voter to correct.” The voter has until the fifth business day after the election to correct the signature.</li>



<li><strong>Georgia</strong>: In Georgia, a ballot <a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/title-21/chapter-2/article-10/section-21-2-386/">can be rejected for a number of reasons</a>, including if the voter incorrectly writes their driver’s license number when they submit their ballot. If a ballot is rejected, state law says election officials “shall promptly notify the elector of such rejection.” The voter then has three days to cure the ballot, although what they are required to do to cure it varies depending on what caused the ballot to be rejected.</li>



<li><strong>Michigan</strong>: In Michigan, ballots can also <a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/Laws/MCL?objectName=MCL-168-766">be rejected due to a signature matching problem</a>. To cure the ballot, the voter must fill out a cure form and return it by 5 pm on the third day after the election.</li>



<li><strong>Nevada</strong>: Nevada also can reject ballots because of signature-matching problems. According to state law, if that happens, “the clerk shall contact the voter” and inform them of what they need to do to cure the ballot. The voter then must cure the ballot by 5 pm on the sixth day following the election.</li>



<li><strong>North Carolina</strong>: North Carolina ballots can be <a href="https://ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_163/GS_163-230.1.html">rejected for a variety of clerical errors</a>. Should that happen, state law says “the county board of elections shall promptly notify the voter of the deficiency and the manner in which the voter may cure the deficiency.”&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Again, if you cast a ballot that needs to be cured, you will likely be contacted either by election officials, by your political party, or both. For this reason, voters who cast their ballot by mail should be alert to phone calls from unfamiliar numbers, as the caller may be trying to inform them that their ballot needs to be cured. If you miss that call, and your ballot is disqualified, you could lose your chance to vote in this election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Editor’s note, November 6, 6:29 am ET: </em></strong><em>Donald Trump <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy">has won the 2024 presidential election</a>. For more of our 2024 campaign coverage, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382197/trump-harris-live-results-polls-updates-analysis-explainers">click here</a>.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The results aren’t in yet, but if Donald Trump ends up winning the 2024 presidential election and regaining the presidency, he could radically reshape international politics.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has made very clear on the campaign trail that he believes major changes to US foreign policy are necessary. “We have been treated so badly, mostly by allies &#8230; our allies treat us actually worse than our so-called enemies,” <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/26/not-just-china-trump-2point0-could-spell-trouble-for-us-allies-as-he-doubles-down-on-tariff-talk-.html">Trump told the audience</a> in September at a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kykpqbOSjI&amp;t=568s">Wisconsin</a> campaign event. “In the military, we protect them, and then they screw us on trade. We’re not going to let it happen anymore.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those aren’t empty promises. Presidents have wide latitude on foreign policy and can enter or nix many international agreements unilaterally.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It really does vary, agreement to agreement, in terms of what the exit criteria are, but there are very few where a congressional approval for withdrawal is required,” Jennifer Kavanagh, senior fellow and director of military analysis at Defense Priorities, told Vox.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In his first term, Trump pursued what he called an “America First” foreign policy, which saw him withdraw from <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2018/5/8/17328520/iran-nuclear-deal-trump-withdraw">major international agreements</a>, launch a <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2018/7/6/17542482/china-trump-trade-war-tariffs">trade war with China</a>, verbally <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/6/28/17513972/trump-nato-russia-putin-nafta">antagonize allies</a>, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2019/2/26/18239694/trump-north-korea-kim-jong-un-vietnam-summit">attempt complex negotiations</a> with <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/7/16/17577096/trump-putin-meeting-nato">several of the US’s adversaries</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This campaign season, he has promised to continue attempts to dramatically alter or otherwise hamper international agreements, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/07/02/nato-second-trump-term-00164517">including the NATO security alliance</a>, in ways that could fundamentally weaken the US’s place in the global order.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of Trump’s stated foreign policy positions, his <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/2024/2/9/24064244/trump-economy-china-tarriffs-today-explained">planned protectionist trade policy</a> would likely be the most immediately damaging to Americans; his <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/374102/trump-harris-tariffs-congress">proposed tariff increases</a> would spark a global trade war and drive up prices for American consumers. In the longer term, his ideas about the US role in international affairs could erode US diplomacy and undermine institutions like NATO and the UN. That could have lasting effects on the geopolitical landscape, much as his first-term foreign policy decisions did.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Trump’s isolationist first administration, briefly explained</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During his first term, from 2017 to 2021, Trump withdrew the US from multiple international agreements, including the <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2018/5/8/17328520/iran-nuclear-deal-trump-withdraw">Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), often called the Iran deal</a>. That agreement, negotiated in 2015 under President Barack Obama, essentially eased US sanctions on Iran in exchange for curtailing its nuclear program and allowing greater international oversight of it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“​The Iran deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into,” Trump said when the agreement was terminated in 2018. Since then, <a href="https://armscontrolcenter.org/a-worthless-withdrawal-two-years-since-president-trump-abandoned-the-jcpoa/">Iran has built up its stockpile of enriched uranium</a> and increased its missile supply, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/investigations/no-evidence-iran-rushing-build-nuclear-weapon-cia-director-says-rcna174004">reportedly bringing the program much closer to developing nuclear capabilities</a> — despite the Trump administration’s promise that Iran would never have them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump also pulled the US out of the Paris climate agreement, which commits all signatories to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Other diplomatic casualties of the Trump administration include the <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-withdraw-united-states-intermediate-range-nuclear-forces-inf-treaty/">Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty</a> (INF), a Cold War-era pact between the US and Russia limiting the development of short- and intermediate-range nuclear weapons; the <a href="https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/openskies">Open Skies Treaty</a>, which allows signatories to conduct military reconnaissance flyovers; and two <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/trump-wants-out-of-global-migration-discussions-cities-want-in/">international migration agreements</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump also repeatedly critiqued NATO during his first term. He argued the other countries in the military alliance weren’t spending enough on defense (and they did <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360160/nato-summit-allies-trump-biden-zelenskyy-ukraine">begin to spend more</a>), questioned whether the organization was still necessary, and in 2020 <a href="https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/trumps-sudden-and-dangerous-troop-withdrawal-germany">withdrew almost 10,000 troops stationed in Germany</a>, a decision Vice President Kamala Harris’s foreign policy adviser Philip Gordon said seemed “designed to send a message about the limit of what Americans are prepared to spend to defend foreign borders and, more broadly, uphold world order.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Trump could do in a second term</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a second term, Trump has pledged to again withdraw from international agreements and organizations.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He explicitly promised to pull the US out of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQcZZbCFL2I">Paris climate accords again</a>, after the US reentered the agreement under President Joe Biden. And Trump could limit US cooperation with UN organizations that his administration was critical of, like the <a href="https://2017-2021.state.gov/update-on-u-s-withdrawal-from-the-world-health-organization/">World Health Organization</a>. He has also floated a variety of new tariffs — at times calling for new taxes as high as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/14/trump-rally-speech-north-carolina-economy-jd-vance/?itid=lk_inline_manual_30">20 percent on US trading partners</a> and recently threatening to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/11/04/trump-mexico-tariff-trade/">impose tariffs of up to 100 percent on Mexico</a>, the US’s <a href="https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/highlights/topcm.html">largest trading partner for goods in 2024</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One partnership that would be difficult for Trump to alter is the US agreement with NATO. The NATO charter doesn’t have a withdrawal mechanism. As Kavanagh explained, “Recently, Congress passed a law specifically aimed at NATO that would require congressional approval for withdrawal from NATO,” in an effort to further protect the US membership in the alliance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even with that safeguard, there are ways a second Trump administration could hollow out NATO or other US military pacts, such as the one between the <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/new-horizons-korea-us-japan-trilateral-cooperation">US, South Korea, and Japan</a> meant to deter China and North Korea.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“​​Trump can decide to change US posture in any country, whether that&#8217;s Asia or in Europe, and just pull forces out, close bases, stop investing in sort of the joint infrastructure and on all the committees and logistical pieces that keep an alliance running, that keep us tied into allies and partners,” Kavanagh said. “Any president could do that.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But neglecting NATO and alienating those allies is not the only way a Trump administration could damage US foreign policy and diplomacy, according to James Lindsay, a senior fellow in US foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“A lot is going to depend upon how he staffs his administration,” Lindsay told Vox. “We don&#8217;t have a good sense of who would be a secretary of state, secretary of defense, [or] national security adviser.” The people in those positions could have serious implications for all kinds of foreign policy decisions, from how (and if) ceasefire negotiations are conducted to which countries receive weapons transfers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the absence of a robust, experienced diplomatic apparatus, Trump may try to negotiate foreign policy largely on his own, as he has in the past. Those attempts had poor outcomes, like when his <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-at-the-us-north-korea-summit-in-hanoi/">attempt to negotiate with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/7/1/20659074/north-korea-trump-kim-jong-un-dmz">ended in 2019</a> with no guarantees on the North Korean side to stop nuclear weapons development and no fundamental change in the relationship. His talks with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/08/20/trump-peace-deal-taliban/">the Taliban</a> led to the withdrawal of US and NATO forces and the <a href="https://www.vox.com/22626240/taliban-afghanistan-baradar">collapse of the civilian government in Afghanistan</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has made big promises on the types of negotiations he’d conduct as president —&nbsp;like ending the war between <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-russia-ukraine-war-un-election-a78ecb843af452b8dda1d52d137ca893">Russia and Ukraine in 24 hours</a> —&nbsp;but as was the case in his first term, the reality is likely to be much harder and messier than he’s suggested.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Come Tuesday night, millions of Americans will be glued to their TV screens or refreshing their browser windows to see the latest election returns, all in anticipation of a final race call. (Though&nbsp;we might not know the next president until days later.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Counting ballots can take a while, but news organizations don’t necessarily need to wait for every cast ballot to be counted before announcing a winner. They’re often able to declare who won without the full returns, thanks to the work of teams colloquially known as “decision desks” — groups of political scientists, statisticians, pollsters, and reporters who use mountains of data, statistical models, and on-the-ground reporting to understand which candidate is up where, and how likely a candidate is to win a given precinct, county, or state. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given the doubt that former President Donald Trump has sown over the past eight years,&nbsp;both about the election process and the media, it’s worth understanding in detail how the processes of projecting and calling election results work, and why consumers of news should trust those results.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Remember that we don&#8217;t elect anybody,” <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/team/anthony-salvanto/">Anthony Salvanto</a>, who as CBS News’s executive director of elections and surveys, oversees the network’s decision desk, told Vox. “The voters do that. Elections officials are reporting the vote, and what you&#8217;re getting from us and the networks is our analysis of what they&#8217;ve reported, as well as our first-hand reports from talking to voters.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How exactly do news organizations figure out who’s winning?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To figure out who won an election, news organizations like Fox News, CNN, the Associated Press (AP), and others use a combination of data from election officials, statistical modeling, and polling and surveys of voters.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Raw vote counts come in at the precinct, county, and state levels, and these help decision desks both ensure voting is in line with their expectations and to make decisions on tight contests. Those expectations are shaped by statistical models based on history and other voter information, like geographical location, gender, age, and more.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This year, there are two main systems that news media will rely on for their projections.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The AP and Fox News use a system called <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/ap-votecast/">AP VoteCast</a>, which debuted in 2018 and has been used in every national election since. In a shift from past practice, VoteCast doesn’t rely on exit polling, and instead uses large-scale online surveys of registered voters who are chosen randomly from a <a href="https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/how-do-probability-based-online-panels-work">probability-based sample</a>, in an attempt to get the most accurate information from the most representative sample.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A different method is used by the National Election Pool (NEP), which provides data to ABC News, CBS News, CNN, and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-elections/how-election-data-is-collected">NBC News</a>. The NEP relies on Edison Research to conduct three types of surveys: Election Day exit polls, in-person early voting exit polls, and polls of likely voters to capture data from those likely to vote by mail, Rob Farbman, executive vice president at Edison Research, told Vox. (AP and Fox News used to be part of this group, but left after the 2016 election.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">(<a href="https://forecast.decisiondeskhq.com/methodology">Decision Desk HQ,</a> a private company that contracts with news organizations including the Economist and The Hill — and Vox.com in 2020 — doesn’t use voter surveys, and instead it relies on a proprietary statistical methodology to project winners.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Each outlet and agency creates their own criteria for interpreting these results.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sometimes, that can lead to one decision desk getting ahead of the others, like in 2020 when <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/10/21/fox-news-decision-desk-2024-election-00184396">Fox News’s decision desk head Arnon Mishkin</a> called Arizona for President Joe Biden much earlier than any other news source, including the AP, or when <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/21535103/when-will-we-get-election-results-calls-networks">Decision Desk HQ called the race</a> far ahead of other experts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Overall though, when it comes time to make a call, “Our decision team will examine all of the models we are running, consult with the networks’ decision teams, and consider any possible data issues to ensure that the possibility of our call being incorrect is sufficiently small,” Farbman said.&nbsp; “We generally will not make a call unless we are 99.5 percent confident in the call.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similarly, the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/decision-desk-votecast-election-2024-polling-3db119b2d439ce8a0c08878e693b004e">AP doesn’t call an election</a> until “we are confident that there’s no chance the trailing candidate can catch up,” according to David Scott, the AP’s vice president and head of news strategy and operations.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The combination of inputs&nbsp;allows the services to accurately understand who has won each of the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ap-race-calls-presidential-election-winners-0fd480f8ba2f37d0439b76e0c7071413">around 5,000 elections taking place this year</a>, from the presidential race to local contests and ballot measures. And they can do it quickly, without having to wait on election officials to count each vote. That’s true even in the case of a tight race (like the presidential race is expected to be), though calling those is a bit more complicated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If you get a very close race, then you&#8217;re looking at where the outstanding vote is, the vote that hasn&#8217;t yet been reported, and you&#8217;re looking at the kind of places that the outstanding vote is from,” Salvanto, of CBS News, said.&nbsp;“You&#8217;re looking at whether it is a mail vote or Election Day vote, if there are any differences in the patterns that you&#8217;ve seen by ballot type.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Along the way, news organizations keep viewers up to date as the polls close and votes come in, showing the public the data that’s being used to make the calls is accurate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We will tell you if our models show that it&#8217;s a toss up or that it&#8217;s leading one way or the other,” Salvanto said. “We will show you, in real time, where the counted vote is coming in — from which counties, which areas of the state, and where it&#8217;s still outstanding, where we know there are registered voters, and we know there are still reports to come, so that the viewer can see the whole picture, the way that we see it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, these methods aren’t perfect. Very occasionally, news organizations call a race wrong. The most dramatic instance was in 2000, when news networks <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Bush-v-Gore">initially called Florida for Al Gore</a>. Errors do happen —&nbsp;decision desks are made up human beings, after all —&nbsp;but when they do, organizations work to correct them as quickly as possible. Still, mistakes are incredibly rare, so come Election Day (and the days after) you can be confident you’re seeing the real results.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Support independent journalism that matters — </em></strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/support-now"><strong><em>become a Vox Member today</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In media and politics, timing is everything — which leaves many people wondering why journalist and author Michael Wolff waited until mere days before the presidential election to drop a bombshell: what he says are recordings of Jeffrey Epstein discussing his intimate friendship with Republican candidate Donald Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wolff, author of <em>Fire and Fury</em>, a bestselling 2018 book about the Trump White House, dropped a brief clip from the tapes last week on his <em>Fire and Fury</em> podcast, on which he and co-host James Truman gab about the news and political insider gossip. In the clip, Epstein chit-chats about how Trump played mind games with his staff. After it made headlines over the weekend,&nbsp;Wolff shared a wider selection of the “hundred hours” of his Epstein recordings <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/listen-to-the-jeffrey-epstein-tapes-i-was-donald-trumps-closest-friend/">with the Daily Beast</a>, which published excerpts Monday.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the tapes — which, it must be noted, feature only Epstein&#8217;s version of events — Epstein proclaims he was Trump’s “closest friend.” He depicts the pair as bros who partied together for over a decade, and Trump as a dedicated womanizer and adulterer.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The only thing I really like to do is fuck the wives of my best friends,” Trump allegedly told Epstein after a tryst. “That is just the best.’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Trump campaign has responded to the tapes by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/01/trump-jeffrey-epstein-tapes">accusing</a> Wolff of outright lying and “blatant election interference on behalf of [Trump’s opponent] Kamala Harris.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s striking about the allegations Epstein makes in the tapes is that they aren’t anything we haven’t heard before, about Trump’s friendship with Epstein or Trump himself. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The pair’s “<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/01/jeffrey-epstein-and-donald-trump-epic-bromance?srsltid=AfmBOopc6xYmovJN66T-4RU7AHiuLlBJSF2cl2OAb6mVhMXJhOHJnTXG">bromance</a>” has been a matter of public record since the ’90s, with plenty of accompanying salacious gossip. No fewer than <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/10/28/trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations-women">28 women</a> have come forward to publicly accuse Trump of sexual misconduct against them over the decades. The two most recent allegations were made within days of each other, with the 27th accuser, Stacey Williams, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/23/donald-trump-accuser-stacey-williams-jeffrey-epstein">claiming</a> that Epstein had introduced Trump to her and that the two men seemed to be treating her like the object of a “twisted” game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wolff said on the podcast that he was motivated to release the Epstein-Trump clip after the 28th accuser, former Swiss pageant queen Beatrice Keul, also made <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/donald-trump-jumped-hotel-suite-190903635.html">a recent allegation of sexual assault</a> against the former president.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wolff claimed to the Daily Beast that he’d attempted unsuccessfully to interest various media outlets in the tapes at various points in the past. Those editors likely passed on the clips due to the difficulty of fact-checking them or verifying any of the claims made by Epstein, who <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/12/3/18116351/jeffrey-epstein-case-indictment-arrested-trump-clinton">died in 2019</a> while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vox likewise makes no claims to the veracity of Epstein’s statements, but even if the claims Epstein makes about Trump can’t be verified, the recordings serve as a visceral reminder that the Epstein-Trump connection was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/donald-trump-and-jeffrey-epstein-partied-together-then-an-oceanfront-palm-beach-mansion-came-between-them/2019/07/31/79f1d98c-aca0-11e9-a0c9-6d2d7818f3da_story.html">real</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/7/9/20686347/jeffrey-epstein-trump-bill-clinton">well-documented</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It may even serve as a much-needed reminder about the many, many accusations of sexual misconduct that Trump himself has yet to really confront.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who was Jeffrey Epstein?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jeffrey Epstein was, ostensibly, a money manager, though whose money he managed was always somewhat unclear. You can learn more about him <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/12/3/18116351/jeffrey-epstein-case-indictment-arrested-trump-clinton">here</a> or <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/8/10/20799896/jeffrey-epstein-found-dead-jail">here</a>, but at a basic level, it’s important to know that by the 1990s, he was wealthy enough to buy a private island in the US Virgin Islands and that he moved in circles with some of the richest and most powerful men in the world.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During that time, dozens of women say that he sexually abused them, often while they were underage, then offered them money to find him more girls or young women to abuse. “He told me he wanted them as young as I could find them,’’ one woman <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/topics/jeffrey-epstein">told Miami Herald reporter Julie Brown</a>, saying she recruited 70 or 80 girls for Epstein. A detective in Palm Beach, where much of the alleged abuse took place, called it a “sexual pyramid scheme.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Epstein avoided any legal consequences until 2008, when he pleaded guilty to charges of solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors for prostitution, and served a shockingly light sentence: just 13 months in a private wing of a Palm Beach county jail.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In July 2019, however, thanks in part to Brown’s reporting at the Herald, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/epstein-maxwell-timeline-b9f15710fabb72e8581c71e94acf513e">Epstein was arrested</a> and charged with sex trafficking, accused of recruiting young girls for abuse in both Palm Beach and New York. A month later, before he could be tried, he was found dead in jail; the New York City medical examiner <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-autopsy-results.html">ruled his death a suicide</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Epstein has since become a kind of symbol for the most depraved sort of sexual abuser, a man who, according to the women who came forward, knowingly and repeatedly targeted children, manipulating them and forcing them to become his accomplices in harming others. Other men accused of serial sexual misconduct, like <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24006759/puffy-diddy-sean-combs-video-cassie-rape-lawsuit">Sean Combs</a>, are often compared to Epstein. Investigations and reports have continued since the money manager’s death — in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-virgin-islands.html">a 2020 lawsuit</a>, for example, the attorney general of the Virgin Islands said Epstein had run a sex trafficking operation from his private island there, bringing girls as young as 11 to be abused.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Trump and Epstein were more than acquaintances — they were self-professed close friends<strong> </strong>who partied together for over a decade</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/fire-and-fury-the-podcast/id1750757108">episode 22</a> of the <em>Fire and Fury</em> podcast, released October 31, Wolff discusses Epstein and Trump’s “longstanding deep relationship.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Epstein knew him, really, I think, better than most,” Wolff said. “I mean, this was a true BFF situation: two playboys very much styling themselves as playboys in that Hefner sense, who palled around for the better part of 15 years.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s own previous statements bear out this assessment. “I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy,” Trump <a href="https://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/n_7912/">told New York magazine</a> in 2002, in a profile that now reads like an indictment of the many powerful people in&nbsp;Epstein’s orbit. Archival <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/portrait-of-american-financier-jeffrey-epstein-and-real-news-photo/681946574">photos</a> abound of the pair hanging out at events, <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/deborah-blohm-jeffrey-epstein-ghislaine-maxwell-and-news-photo/1192977809">partying</a> at Mar-a-Lago, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/photo-trump-epstein-resurfaces-after-jd-vance-fox-news-1941065">double-dating</a> with Melania Trump and Epstein’s girlfriend-turned-business partner Ghislaine Maxwell. In one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUDr_c2PalI">video recorded at Mar-a-Lago</a> in 1992 and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/behind-the-scenes-the-night-trump-partied-at-mar-a-lago-with-jeffrey-epstein-and-nfl-cheerleaders/2019/07/17/64be823c-a8c6-11e9-9214-246e594de5d5_story.html">released in 2019</a>, Trump appears to point out women to Epstein and then to whisper something in his ear, making him laugh. The earliest photos hail from the early ’90s; Trump was a frequent <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey-epstein-200303">dinner guest</a> of Epstein’s until at least 2003.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump told New York magazine that “Jeffrey enjoys his social life” and “he’s a lot of fun to be with.” He also told the magazine, “It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”&nbsp;A source once <a href="https://pagesix.com/2007/10/15/sex-case-victims-lining-up/">told Page Six</a> that Epstein had formerly “use[d] the spa” at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club “to try to procure girls.” (The club claimed it had since banned Epstein, a claim Epstein disputed to Page Six.) Photos of Trump and Maxwell — now <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ghislaine-maxwell-sex-trafficking-conviction-2e090610b579c8313bea7c31174ae0c4">serving her conviction</a> on sex trafficking charges for having procured underage victims for Epstein — <a href="https://archive.ph/PJbJr">also abound</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition to Epstein frequently attending Trump parties at Mar-a-Lago, Trump allegedly also frequently partied at Epstein’s former New York townhouse. This included allegedly having sex with at least one of Epstein’s victims “<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-jeffrey-epstein-documents-b2475210.html">on regular occasions</a>,” according to an Epstein survivor who later testified in court to witnessing the meetings. Another Epstein accuser <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/jeffrey-epstein-introduced-trump-14-ghislaine-maxwell-accuser-says-rcna7253">testified in court</a> that Epstein introduced her to Trump when she was just 14.&nbsp; (Trump has denied the accusations.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Epstein and Trump eventually had a falling out in 2004 after they reportedly <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/09/news/donald-trump-and-jeffrey-epstein-feuded-over-this-mansion/">feuded over</a> the since-destroyed Maison de l’Amitie estate in Palm Beach. In 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to drastically reduced charges of procuring a child for prostitution and soliciting a prostitute — crimes for which he served 13 months of an 18-month sentence. Trump has since <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/everything-trump-has-said-about-why-he-broke-up-with-epstein/">distanced himself publicly</a> from Epstein, claiming he was “not a fan” of the money manager and had “no idea” of Epstein’s crimes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Wolff tapes, if true, add some new dimension to the dissolution of their friendship and Epstein&#8217;s downfall. According to Wolff, Epstein first told Trump that he was planning to buy the Palm Beach estate, only for Trump, as court records recently <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/donald-trump-and-jeffrey-epstein-partied-together-then-an-oceanfront-palm-beach-mansion-came-between-them/2019/07/31/79f1d98c-aca0-11e9-a0c9-6d2d7818f3da_story.html">revealed</a>, to outbid him. Following this dispute, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/why-jeffrey-epstein-lived-in-fear-when-donald-trump-was-president-author-michael-wolff/">according to Wolff</a>, Epstein came to suspect that Trump was the person who initiated the subsequent criminal investigation into Epstein’s now-infamous parties.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Epstein’s part, based on his comments to Wolff, it seemed he remained interested in Trump’s trajectory and had trouble even grasping that Trump, who he described as “functionally illiterate,” could have made it into the White House.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the tapes, Epstein emphatically showed his distaste for his former friend, calling him “a horrible human being.”</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why all this matters</h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s an open question whether Wolff’s revelations about Epstein and Trump will play any role in the 2024 election. The tapes have had little time to percolate through the media landscape or to be investigated and fact-checked. There’s also a widespread belief that no accusation against Trump, no matter how damning, can truly damage his standing with his supporters: He was caught on tape bragging about his ability to <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/381187/trump-access-hollywood-video-gen-z-tiktok">grab women “by the pussy,”</a> for example, and still won in 2016.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nonetheless, the Wolff tape underscores what many Americans already knew: that Trump and Epstein spent time together socially, chatting at parties and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/donald-trump-and-jeffrey-epstein-partied-together-then-an-oceanfront-palm-beach-mansion-came-between-them/2019/07/31/79f1d98c-aca0-11e9-a0c9-6d2d7818f3da_story.html">praising one another in the press</a>, for many years. What&#8217;s new on these tapes is largely Epstein&#8217;s perspective on their friendship. According to Epstein in his conversations with Wolff, that party life included sexual exploits — a suggestion that Trump himself teased in the New York magazine piece. Williams’ <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/10/24/donald-trump-allegations-jeffrey-epstein-stacey-williams/">recent allegation</a> against Trump further bolsters the theme of Trump and Epstein competing over women; in her recounting of the incident, Trump groped her aggressively while he and Epstein allegedly smiled at each other, after which Epstein grew angry with Williams.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Of course, we see now Epstein as the sexual monster,” Wolff said on the podcast episode, “but certainly, at least in Epstein’s telling, he and Trump were pretty much, in this regard, brothers in arms.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Besides the fact that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/11/3/21544482/trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations">Trump himself has been accused</a> of sexual assault or other misconduct by more than 20 women, he has been found civilly liable for <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23717295/donald-trump-verdict-e-jean-carroll-rape-sexual-assault-battery-defamation">sexual abuse and defamation of journalist E. Jean Carroll</a> in 2023. When Carroll first came forward in 2019 to say that Trump had <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/donald-trump-assault-e-jean-carroll-other-hideous-men.html">assaulted her in a dressing room</a> in the mid-’90s, Trump responded that she was “<a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/6/25/18744356/donald-trump-jean-carroll-not-my-type">not my type</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">American voters may never know how deep Trump’s association with Epstein went. But we are familiar with the fact that for Trump, abuse of women is a punchline, “<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/12/trump-timeline-sexual-misconduct-allegations-defense-292146">locker room talk</a>,” a little joke to share among friends. Trump has never made a secret of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/29/donald-trump-kamala-harris-sexist-post">what he thinks about women</a> and their bodies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, the Wolff tape may be less of a revelation than a reminder of what’s always been out in the open, if voters choose to see it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, the presidential race will be <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-podcast/378112/battleground-states-election-2024-trump-harris">decided by seven key swing states</a> where the margins between Democrats and Republicans are exceedingly close. The states — <a href="https://www.vox.com/e/378027">Arizona</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-podcast/373334/georgia-election-board-rule-changes-trump">Georgia</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-podcast/382226/michigan-2024-election-black-arab-american-voters">Michigan</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-podcast/380501/nevada-2024-election-economy-trump-harris">Nevada</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-podcast/378929/north-carolina-election-2024-hurricane-helene-turnout">North Carolina</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/375904/pennsylvania-kamala-harris-donald-trumplose-by-less-rural-black-suburb-voters">Pennsylvania</a>, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/e/378368">Wisconsin</a> — include some that voted for President Joe Biden in 2020, but that also voted for Trump in 2016. And as recently as this past weekend, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/us/politics/harris-trump-times-siena-poll.html">polls were so tight in many of them</a> that they remain a toss-up going into Election Day.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s everything you need to know about these pivotal states as well as when to expect results and race decisions to start coming in.&nbsp;</p>

<iframe frameborder="0" height="200" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP4198896063" width="100%"></iframe>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What time do polls close?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Poll closures vary by state —&nbsp;and in certain places, even by county —&nbsp;so be sure to check where you live for specifics. You can do so using <a href="https://all.votinginfotool.org/">this tool from Democracy Works</a>, a nonpartisan nonprofit focused on voting participation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Broadly, though, <a href="https://www.politico.com/2024-election/results/poll-closing-times/">cutoffs start at 6 pm ET</a> in states such as Indiana and Kentucky, with many others, including Illinois, Missouri, and Tennessee, closing at 8 pm ET. Alaska and Hawaii finish out the night, wrapping up voting at midnight and 1 am ET.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In swing states, poll closures are also staggered: Georgia, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania are the first to close at 7 pm, 7:30 pm, and 8 pm ET respectively. Some Michigan counties will close at 8 pm, while others will close at 9 pm ET. Wisconsin and Arizona both close at 9 pm ET, and Nevada is the last of the seven, closing at 10 pm ET.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>When will results start coming in?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">States and counties usually start disclosing results once the polls are shuttered in their jurisdictions. Many will post vote counts online as they are being processed, and news outlets and television networks may update their trackers based on these figures. These results are likely to change over time, however.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In some places, smaller and more rural counties may be able to count their ballots more quickly than larger cities, for example. Because of this, smaller towns might report their results faster, creating the impression that one candidate is ahead. This happened in 2020, when certain vote counts suggested that <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91220223/what-is-red-mirage-blue-shift-2024-election">Trump was initially ahead in battleground states</a>, creating a “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/10/29/blue-shift-and-red-mirage-explained-why-the-first-vote-tallies-may-be-misleading/">red mirage</a>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since it takes some states longer to count mail-in votes, that dynamic can also contribute to Republicans banking an early lead since they’re less likely to use absentee ballots.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In both instances, early leads might not match the final result, with margins potentially changing significantly as more votes are tallied. In 2020, this happened in states like <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/10/election-2024-trump-win-speech-danger.html">Pennsylvania</a>: As more mail-in ballots were counted, as well as votes from larger cities, Biden picked up support, fueling what political observers referred to as a “blue shift.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not clear if that same dynamic will play out this cycle, but it is a helpful reminder that things could shift dramatically over the course of hours and days.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How many electoral votes does Trump or Harris need to win, again?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are 538 Electoral College votes up for grabs, and a candidate needs to secure a majority&nbsp; — or 270 electoral votes — to win the presidency.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The majority of these votes are concentrated in safe red or blue states, meaning Trump and Harris are both guaranteed a sizable degree of support. The backing of some swing states, however, will be necessary for each to reach the 270-vote threshold, making them incredibly important.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>So, what do I need to know about these battleground states?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The presidential race in these seven states is so close that they have the potential to flip for either Harris or Trump and deliver a sizable number of electoral votes along with it. That&#8217;s why both campaigns have been focusing their ground game and advertising here in recent weeks.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Arizona</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why it’s a battleground: </strong>Arizona was a longstanding Republican stronghold until Democrats flipped it <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/11/12/18056978/senate-midterm-results-arizona-kyrsten-sinema-winner">during a Senate race in 2018</a> and subsequent <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-race-and-ethnicity-legislature-218ad4d596e87c6b1a223f19f817776e">presidential race in 2020</a>. Democrats have steadily made gains here, though Republicans still have plenty of support, so much so that it’s been a wellspring of election denialism since 2020. A ballot initiative enshrining abortion rights in the state Constitution could be very motivating for voters this cycle and give <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/25/abortion-2024-elections-arizona-00148683">Democrats a boost due to their support for it</a>.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Electoral votes: </strong>11</li>



<li><strong>How voting works: </strong>Arizona can quickly report results for ballots submitted prior to Election Day. A high proportion of mail-in ballots, however, have historically been <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-to-expect-in-arizona-on-election-day">submitted on Election Day itself</a>, and those aren’t counted until polls close, meaning there could be delays in reporting the final outcome, particularly in close races.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>When to expect results: </strong>In 2020, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-to-expect-in-arizona-on-election-day">the Associated Press (AP) called the race on the day after the election</a>, while other organizations, such as the New York Times, didn’t call the race until <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/results-timing-presidential-race-calls.html">nine days after Election Day</a>. In 2024, it could once again be several days until an official call is made.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pennsylvania</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why it’s a battleground: </strong>Pennsylvania had voted Democrat for years, but was one of three states in the party’s “blue wall” that went to Trump in 2016.&nbsp; Biden won back the state in 2020, though Republicans have continued to maintain a strong presence, keeping control of one of two chambers in the state legislature. Given its sizable number of electoral votes, the state is a major target for both parties, and could well determine who wins the election overall. Because of how competitive the race is, the state has also been a focal point for <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/29/politics/trump-voter-fraud-claims-pennsylvania/index.html">GOP misinformation about voter fraud</a>, which <a href="https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-election-misinformation-noncitizen-voting-dead-voters-34004d5c892ebd39101adb86533c469e">remains very rare</a>.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Electoral votes:</strong> 19</li>



<li><strong>How voting works: </strong>Pennsylvania isn’t allowed to process or count mail-in ballots until Election Day, which could contribute to a lag in reporting results.</li>



<li><strong>When to expect results: </strong>In 2020, the AP reported Biden as the winner four <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ap-called-pennsylvania-joe-biden-why-f7dba7b31bd21ec2819a7ac9d2b028d3">days after Election Day</a>. The timing could be similar this election, depending on how many voters opt for mail-in ballots.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Michigan&nbsp;</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why it’s a battleground: </strong>Michigan was another “blue wall” state that Trump won in 2016 and Biden took back in 2020. It has strong Democratic roots, and the party currently holds the governor’s mansion, two Senate seats, and both chambers of the legislature. But one major question in the state is whether opposition to Harris’s position on Gaza will lead to the state’s <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/4/harris-says-will-end-gaza-war-in-final-election-appeal-to-arab-americans">roughly 200,000</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/381550/arab-americans-protest-vote-harris-gaza-palestine-israel">Arab American voters</a> sitting out the election, voting for a third party or turning to Trump in protest. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/michigan/">Given how close the race is</a>, Harris needs high turnout from this group — and many others who have historically backed Democrats.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>How voting works: </strong>Changes in election laws <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/michigan-has-new-voting-processes-2024-what-know">made in 2023</a> are giving officials more time to process <a href="https://apnews.com/article/michigan-counting-absentee-ballots-9222e0187d3d027e10cf617f5e025315">mail-in ballots before Election Day</a>. This could help speed up the counting significantly.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Electoral votes: </strong>15</li>



<li><strong>When to expect results: </strong>In 2020, results were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/results-timing-presidential-race-calls.html">called by the AP one day after Election Day,</a> and officials anticipate that the same could be the case this time around.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Wisconsin</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why it’s a battleground: </strong>Wisconsin is the third “blue wall” state that Trump won in 2016 and Biden retook in 2020. Its status as a battleground is evident: It has a Democratic governor, one Democratic senator, one Republican senator, and two Republican-led chambers in the legislature.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>How voting works: </strong>Mail-in ballots in several large counties are stored in “central locations” and aren’t counted until Election Day, which can lead to some delays.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Electoral votes: </strong>10</li>



<li><strong>When to expect results: </strong>In 2020, Wisconsin was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ap-explains-wisconsin-joe-biden-636a771c35314b13a5e33cb19092f9d5">called by the AP the day</a> after the election and that could happen again.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Georgia</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why it’s a battleground: </strong>Georgia only recently flipped to Democrats during the 2020 presidential election and then narrowly reelected a Democrat to the <a href="https://www.vox.com/23496357/raphael-warnock-herschel-walker-georgia-runoff-2022-results">Senate in 2022</a>. The state has an enduring Republican lean — evidenced by its Republican governor and two Republican-led chambers in the legislature — but has continued to shift left as it has diversified.<strong> </strong>Previously, Georgia was a major target of Trump’s attacks in 2020, when he called on officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/03/us/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-georgia.html">in the state to overturn its results</a>.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>How voting works: </strong>Georgia has approved rules changes that enable the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/25/981357583/georgia-legislature-approves-election-overhaul-including-changes-to-absentee-vot">processing of mail-in ballots earlier</a>. These changes should expedite the process compared to 2020.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Electoral votes: </strong>16</li>



<li><strong>When to expect results: </strong>In 2020, an extremely tight margin resulted in election results being called by the AP a full <a href="https://apnews.com/article/why-ap-called-georgia-for-joe-biden-29c1fb0502efde50fdccb5e2c3611017">16 days after the race</a>. The turnaround could potentially be faster this year depending on the margin in the race.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nevada</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why it’s a battleground: </strong>Nevada has voted Democratic pretty consistently, and is known for its strong base of left-leaning union support. It has started to move right in recent elections, however, and elected a Republican governor in 2022. This cycle, the economy — and <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-podcast/380501/nevada-2024-election-economy-trump-harris">concerns about the state hospitality industry’s recovery post-pandemic</a> — are key issues that may fuel discontent toward Democrats.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>How voting works: </strong>Nevada has expansive mail-in voting, and allows ballots received up to four days after Election Day to be counted. As a result, there could be some delays in when we know the results.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Electoral votes</strong>: 6</li>



<li><strong>When to expect results:</strong> In 2020, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/nevada-decision-notes-president-senate-rosen-brown-c304b03049499c887737acc887f89008">election results were called by the AP</a> four days after the election, and it’s possible that could happen again.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>North Carolina</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why it’s a battleground: </strong>North Carolina has been reliably Republican in presidential and Senate races in recent years, though it has shifted left over time. Questions have been raised for years about if and when the state could flip blue again for a national election. This year, a scandal over incendiary statements made by <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/373094/mark-robinson-slavery-nazi-north-carolina-trump-2024">Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson</a> could drag down the Republican ticket as he makes a run for governor.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>How voting works: </strong>Processing of mail-in ballots can begin before Election Day, while the counting can’t start until then. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/results-timing-presidential-race-calls.html">Mail ballots must also be received by Election Day this year</a>, a change from 2020.</li>



<li><strong>Electoral votes: </strong>16</li>



<li><strong>When to expect results: </strong>In 2020, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/10/25/how-long-states-called-election">the race was called by the AP 10 days after Election Day</a>, and it’s possible it could be faster this year because of the change to mail-in ballot rules.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How will I know the race is actually called?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vox will monitor a variety of sources before we publish election results, including the AP and the <a href="https://www.edisonresearch.com/solutions/u-s-elections/">National Election Pool</a>, a poll conducted by Edison Research and funded by several major news organizations.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">States and counties <a href="https://www.kgw.com/article/news/nation-world/how-are-races-called-by-ap-other-networks/507-5f3fa369-20b4-4c2f-9900-ca8d8af70324">are in charge of running elections</a>, reporting results and certifying those outcomes. There’s a gap, however, between when states report the results of the election and when they declare a winner because of how long the certification process takes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The AP is one of the entities that fills in the gap in the meantime by analyzing the unofficial results that states and counties are posting. The AP has said <a href="https://www.ap.org/elections/our-role/how-we-call-races/">it makes a race call</a> when it’s clear there is no way an opponent can make up the gap in votes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vox’s Ellen Ioanes has <a href="https://www.vox.com/e/381654">a more detailed explainer</a> on how publications like the Associated Press make these calls.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How long is all this going to take?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s likely that tallying the votes could take several days, as it did in 2020. That year, in particular, it took more time to determine the winner of the election because more people used mail-in ballots due to the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The last presidential election also saw some of <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2021/2020-presidential-election-voting-and-registration-tables-now-available.html">the highest voter turnout in years</a>, and extremely close margins in key swing states. Both those dynamics meant that ballot counting took longer, and that more time was needed to determine whether a candidate had secured a high enough lead to win.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2020, it took four days before Biden was declared the winner of the Electoral College by publications including the AP.<strong> </strong>That year, states like <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/trump-campaign-press-release-trump-campaign-files-election-contest-georgia">Georgia</a> also saw legal challenges to their outcomes from the Trump campaign, which falsely alleged widespread fraud. States could see <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/381997/supreme-court-republican-genser-pennsylvania-ballots">similar lawsuits</a> this cycle, and those could fuel uncertainty about the legitimacy of the result, though they haven’t previously delayed calls by entities like the AP. (AP’s notable <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-georgia-elections-bb997641ca36805c0f53f406a3529d87">later call in Georgia in 2020</a> came only after the state conducted a hand audit that confirmed the outcome.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This year, don’t be alarmed if results aren’t announced immediately once again and it takes a few days to arrive at an outcome.</p>

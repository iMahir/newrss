<p class="has-text-align-none">The 2024 election is already historic for a number of reasons, from an assassination attempt to a last-minute dropout, with the country’s first Black woman candidate slated to secure the Democratic nomination. It is also perhaps the first time in American history that a vice presidential nominee has been rumored to have had sex with a couch. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Let’s get this out of the way: J.D. Vance did not say he had sex with a couch. The rumor began as a joke on X, when user @rickrudescalves tweeted on July 15: “can’t say for sure but he might be the first vp pick to have admitted in a ny times bestseller to fucking an Inside-out latex glove shoved between two couch cushions (vance, hillbilly elegy, pp. 179-181).” That the tweet appeared to be directly sourced from <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/360909/jd-vance-how-true-is-hillbilly-elegy-classism">Vance’s memoir, <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em></a>, convinced many people that it was in fact true, but if they were to read pages 179 to 181, all they’d find is Vance talking about his time at Ohio State University. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So many people embraced the shitpost, however, that it took on a life of its own, with countless memes popping up on TikTok and X. “[W]e cannot let JD Vance near the oval office,” <a href="https://x.com/lolennui/status/1816253691407851623">one person tweeted</a> with a picture of the many sofas inside the room. <a href="https://x.com/RichardHanania/status/1815596967516422476">Another juxtaposes</a> Vance staring longingly with zoom-ins of leather couches while Barry White’s “Never, Never Gonna Give Ya Up” plays. When the rumor had spread widely enough for the Associated Press to publish a lengthy explainer headlined “No, JD Vance did not have sex with a couch,” someone else <a href="https://x.com/djtweets/status/1816296893028180064">quoted it and referenced the infamous Bill Clinton denial, writing</a>, “I did not have sectional relations.”</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">we cannot let JD Vance near the oval office <a href="https://t.co/aKEAnaoLBB">pic.twitter.com/aKEAnaoLBB</a></p>&mdash; Amy A (@lolennui) <a href="https://twitter.com/lolennui/status/1816253691407851623?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 24, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s common for rumors about famous people that are objectively untrue but are funny or entertaining to go viral (a famous example suggests <em>Glee</em> actress <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/mychalthompson/lea-michele-responded-to-cant-read-comments">Lea Michele secretly can’t read</a>), whether started by intentional trolls, as was the case with Vance and the couch, or via games of digital telephone, where all context and factuality get left untranslated. Most of the time, the reason the rumors spread is because people genuinely want to believe them. In Vance’s case, the fact that he’d written a coming-of-age book meant that a common trope (teen boy tries to have sex with inanimate object) made some degree of sense, coupled with the fact that he’s espoused some <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/07/24/jd-vance-gender-views-00170673">extremely bizarre views</a> on sex and gender. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Curiously, the AP article debunking the rumor has been removed from its website — an unusual decision typically reserved for serious factual or editorial errors. As a spokesperson for the AP told Vox via email, “The story, which did not go out on the wire to our customers, didn’t go through our standard editing process. We are looking into how that happened.” Some still speculated that perhaps the AP’s commitment to fact-checking is such that, despite the fact that Vance didn’t write about it in <em>Hillbilly Elegy,</em> there’s <a href="https://x.com/knowyourmeme/status/1816498547753464034">no definitive proof</a> he didn’t try to have sex with a couch.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s more bizarre is that the couch joke was only one of the three most off-putting things Vance has been known for during his first 10 days as a VP nominee, and the only one that wasn’t verified as true. After Trump announced his pick on July 15, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gPGxB2FqEc">a clip</a> from his 2021 appearance on Tucker Carlson went viral in which he complained that the US was “effectively run” by “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives,” naming Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “The entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children, and how does it make any sense that we’ve turned our country over to people who don’t really have a direct stake in it,” he said, discounting Harris’s two step-children whom she co-parents with husband Doug Emhoff. Then, Vance tried and failed to get laughs at a Trump rally by <a href="https://people.com/internet-slams-jd-vance-for-cringe-diet-mountain-dew-joke-8682255">making an awkward joke</a> about drinking diet Mountain Dew and how “[Democrats] are going to call that racist.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance already <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/07/24/jd-vance-gender-views-00170673">held extreme views</a> on sex and gender; he opposes abortion even in cases of rape and incest and has <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjk8bd/ohio-republican-jd-vance-abortion-slavery">compared it to slavery</a>. He <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/j-d-vances-sad-strange-politics-of-family">has voted against</a> a bill ensuring access to IVF and suggested a <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jd-vance-senate-pornography_n_628d3ba1e4b05cfc2692705b">ban on porn</a>. He <a href="https://x.com/JDVance1/status/1387763955557445640">called</a> universal child care “a class war against normal people.” He <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2022/07/28/vance-would-vote-against-codifying-right-to-marriage-for-same-sex-couples/">opposes legislating codifying the right to gay marriage</a> and suggested that <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93abve/jd-vance-suggests-people-in-violent-marriages-shouldnt-get-divorced">people in “violent” marriages</a> shouldn’t get divorced.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He is also among the nebulous group of young intellectual conservatives backed by Silicon Valley venture capitalist Peter Thiel loosely called the “<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/04/inside-the-new-right-where-peter-thiel-is-placing-his-biggest-bets">New Right</a>,” whose main project seems to be making techno-fascist and incel-adjacent ideas seem cool and edgy. On X, where Vance has spent a great deal of time, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jd-vance-twitter-x-following-fyp-trump-b2583022.html">he at one point followed</a> several white nationalist accounts, many of whom glorify bodybuilding and fascism while promoting the <a href="https://www.vox.com/23076952/replacement-theory-white-supremacist-violence">Great Replacement theory</a>. He is, in other words, exactly the type of guy you could imagine claiming that couch sex robots were the beginning of a glorious future without women.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pointing out Vance and Trump’s obvious weirdness now seems to be among Democrats’ main strategies in combating the Republican ticket. And it’s working: Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz <a href="https://x.com/BrianOliu/status/1815955081977549272">was praised</a> for <a href="https://x.com/JoshRaby/status/1815889888207892619">his appearances</a> on MSNBC in which he stressed how “weird” the Trump-Vance platform is, while the Harris campaign went viral for <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/184249/78-year-old-criminal-kamala-harris-roasts-trump-press-release">its statement</a> on Trump’s Fox News appearance, which read, “is Donald Trump ok?” and listed major takeaways like “Trump is old and quite weird?” That kind of blunt, call-it-like-you-see-it candor was once a boon to the Trump camp, which delighted in offending “blue-haired” “soy milk” liberals whom they saw as myopic and out of touch. But when we’ve got someone like Vance spouting deeply antisocial and bizarre ideas that are way outside the realm of normal political discourse, the most effective response is often a simple, “What the hell?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I don’t really need to explain why everyone believing a joke about a vice presidential candidate having sex with a couch is funny, it just is. Much like the memes implying <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/362300/kamala-harris-meme-brat-summer">Kamala Harris is a pop icon queening out to “Brat” summer</a>, “JD Vance fucked a couch” is just another absurdity of the wildest election summer in recent history, one where the truth is so much crazier than fiction that the fiction starts becoming believable. No, J.D. Vance didn’t fuck a couch. But he’ll always be remembered as the vice presidential nominee that was once rumored to have fucked a couch. And that’s pretty weird.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Major spoiler alert: This post will absolutely ruin this movie for you. Please don’t read this unless you have seen the movie or want to get spoiled.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the hoopla of <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/356083/deadpool-wolverine-gay-queerbaiting"><em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em></a> was all about the introduction of two iconic characters to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), the movie is also about saying goodbye. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the film, Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) faces the prospect of the collapse of his entire timeline, which has been destroyed by the death of Wolverine in 2017’s <em>Logan</em>. To save it, he seeks out a still-living, alternate-universe version of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). But this new Wolvie has seen the rest of his X-Men die, and he can’t stop blaming himself. Together, they’re sent to the void (the same void that we see in Disney+’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/22522332/loki-review-marvel-tom-hiddleston-owen-wilson"><em>Loki</em></a>) where they sync up with an island of misfit toys: Marvel superheroes (mainly from Fox’s filmography) that, for one reason or another, did not make it to Disney’s promised land of perpetual intellectual property. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Deadpool and Wolverine’s fictional conflict is a self-referential gag about <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/3/20/18273477/disney-fox-merger-deal-details-marvel-x-men">Disney’s real-life 2019 acquisition of Fox</a> and its plethora of film rights, which includes some significant Marvel comic book characters. Reynolds’s Deadpool is one of those superheroes, but he&#8217;s currently the only actor playing a Marvel mutant slated to continue on and make the transition to Marvel Studios and the MCU. Having disposable superheroes of yore sent to the MCU trash heap is a meta way for <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/2/12/10979782/deadpool-explained">Deadpool to make an inside joke</a> about how Disney (and, to an extent, Marvel) now owns everything, including esoteric superhero nostalgia that you never knew existed and Deadpool himself.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They first meet the <em>Fantastic Four</em>’s Johnny Storm (played by Chris Evans, reprising his pre-MCU role from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120667/">2005</a>) who Deadpool mistakes for Captain America. All three are captured by the psychic villain Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin, playing an X-Men comic character we&#8217;ve never seen on film before). After Deadpool taunts her, as he taunts everyone, she telekinetically skins Storm alive before Deadpool and Wolverine make a miraculous, jetpack-fueled escape. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The duo eventually meet Storm’s compatriots, who have been living in this suspended state for years. There&#8217;s the half-human half-vampire Blade (Wesley Snipes, reprising his role from the <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/blade-at-25-marvel-vampire-ahead-of-its-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Blade</em></a> trilogy), ninja <a href="https://screenrant.com/deadpool-3-elektra-return-jennifer-garner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elektra</a> (Jennifer Garner, last seen in the 2005 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0287978/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_4_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_daredevl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Daredevil</em></a> sequel of the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0357277/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_4_nm_4_in_0_q_elektra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">same name</a>), murder clone X-23 (Dafne Keen, who appeared with Jackman in 2017’s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3315342/?ref_=nm_knf_c_1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Logan</em></a>), and mutant energy wielder Gambit (Channing Tatum, finally playing the part Disney&#8217;s Fox acquisition supposedly <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/channing-tatum-marvel-gambit-movie-canceled-disney-fox-deal-1234800607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made impossible</a>). Faced with an eternity of storytelling purgatory, the forgotten heroes team up with their new friends to help the two get back to Deadpool’s main timeline. The misfits break into Cassandra’s lair, drawing the attention of her henchmen and allowing the bosom buddies to take on Cassandra. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the end of the film, Deadpool and Wolverine dispatch Nova as well as Paradox (Matthew Macfadyen), the Time Variance Authority (TVA) middle manager who sent them to the void in the first place. They save Deadpool’s collapsing timeline and return home. Blade and the gang are rewarded by getting restored to their own timelines, mainly off-screen. Everything’s squared away and our <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/356083/deadpool-wolverine-gay-queerbaiting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ambiguously coupled</a> duo get to be friends happily ever after.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And one post-credits scene can’t change that … or can it? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s one scene that happens at the end of <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>’s credits scroll. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In it, we find Deadpool at the TVA headquarters. As established in <em>Loki</em>, the TVA are essentially cops who watch every parallel timeline in the multiverse and make sure nothing goes sideways. Also established in <em>Loki</em> — and so many Marvel movies that deal with the splintering <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23024945/everything-everywhere-all-at-once-multiverse-explained-quantum-physicist">multiverse</a> — the TVA are susceptible to serious goofs. (Frankly, they aren’t very good at their job.) They’re also an authoritarian agency that imposes their will on these timelines and the countless people who live within them, so you don’t have to feel bad for them when they mess up. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Deadpool breaks the fourth wall; he wants to clear something up. Although he insulted Cassandra Nova and blamed it on Johnny Storm, he says he isn’t responsible for Storm’s death, even though it seemed like he was. He claims that he simply repeated what Storm told them when they were captured. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To prove his point, he rewinds TVA surveillance footage and shows us what really happened. Sure enough, Johnny Storm unleashes a cuss-filled, raunch-heavy monologue — delivered in Evans’s native Boston accent, no less — that includes references to fellatio, analingus, <a href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Cain_Marko_(Earth-616)">Juggernaut</a> secretions, and derogatory comments about Cassandra’s baldness. He tells Deadpool that he can repeat it but would risk being skinned alive if he did because she is so beyond awful. The merc with a mouth is innocent!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps more importantly, he apparently has access to TVA HQ and ostensibly its timeline-jumping technology. By the logic and structure of this convoluted universe, that means Deadpool might be able to show up and snark in any MCU property (which, obviously, Marvel wants you to know). For now, though, he’s just content to show you Chris Evans saying absolutely filthy things.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/video/bodycam-shows-moment-police-fatally-shot-illinois-woman-sonya-massey-215428165541">Body camera footage</a> released this week offered a harrowing look at the police killing of Sonya Massey, a 36-year-old Black woman in Springfield, Illinois, and renewed scrutiny of the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/report-black-people-are-still-killed-police-higher-rate-groups-rcna17169">disproportionate violence Black Americans</a> face at the hands of law enforcement.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On July 6, Massey was shot by a sheriff’s deputy in her own home, after officers responded to her call about a potential prowler. Following checks of her backyard and surrounding area, at least two officers entered her home as part of their visit. Inside, one of them asks her to turn off her stove. While doing so, she picks up a pot of boiling water and the officers back away, noting that they want to distance themselves from it. She makes a comment about rebuking them “in the name of Jesus,” at which point one of them, Sean Grayson, shoots at her three times, including once fatally in the head.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A grand jury has since indicted Grayson on three counts of first-degree murder, with some <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/22/us/sonya-massey-police-shooting/index.html">law enforcement experts</a> questioning why he’d shoot Massey rather than pursue other alternative responses like adding more distance between them or using a taser. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The shooting also adds to a long history of <a href="https://www.vox.com/police-violence">police violence</a> against Black Americans — and underscores how enduring the problem continues to be. In 2020, mass protests erupted across the US following the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, after an officer knelt on his neck for over nine minutes. Those followed extensive demonstrations in 2014 after Michael Brown, an unarmed teenager, was shot and killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri. Massey is also among a number of Black Americans who’ve been shot by police in their own homes, including <a href="https://www.vox.com/24153974/roger-fortson-police-killing">Roger Fortson</a> in Fort Walton Beach, Florida, and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/us/aaron-dean-trial-atatiana-jefferson-killing/index.html">Atatiana Jefferson</a> in Fort Worth, Texas. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the incident</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Police arrived at Massey’s home after she called 911 around 12:50 am on July 6, and proceeded to do a sweep around the house. They eventually tell her that they didn’t find anyone in the area and appear prepared to leave, when video shows them entering her home. While speaking with Massey, they also ask her if she’s doing okay mentally and she responds by saying, “Yes, I took my medicine.” Ben Crump, a civil rights attorney for Massey’s family, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/body-camera-footage-released-illinois-state-police-woman/story?id=112162337">has said she dealt with mental health struggles</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not immediately apparent why the officers then go into Massey’s house, but video shows her looking for her ID. While they’re inside, the officers realize the stove is on and urge Massey to turn it off. As she goes to do so, she moves the pot of boiling water that’s on it, prompting the officers to back away.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Where are you going?” says Massey.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Away from your hot, steaming water,” says Grayson.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Away from my hot, steaming water?,” Massey asks, while holding the pot. “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“You better f****** not or I swear to God I’ll f****** shoot you in your f****** face,” says Grayson as he draws his gun.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Massey then says “I’m sorry,” and ducks while raising the pot over her head, as Grayson shoots multiple times and fatally wounds her.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As his colleague moves to get a medical kit from their vehicle, Grayson comments, “Nah, she’s done. You can go get it but that’s a headshot.” <a href="https://cbs58.com/news/illinois-police-release-bodycam-video-of-fatal-shooting-of-black-woman-in-her-home">He also states later,</a> “Yeah I’m good, this f******* b**** is crazy.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last week, a grand jury indicted Grayson on charges of first-degree murder, as well as aggravated battery with a firearm and misconduct, all of which he pleaded not guilty to. He’s also been fired from the Sangamon County Sheriff’s Department, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sangamoncountysheriff/posts/pfbid02VdbzM22GpUQPiEaC5AJWeLHZRT59aNNtM2bDo9LjNLCeiupXFjPtbf9uYdm8rKHKl">which noted that</a> “it is clear that the deputy did not act as trained or in accordance with our standards.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/24/us/sean-grayson-illinois-police-officer-shooting-sonya-massey/index.html">A state’s attorney review</a> of the incident similarly concluded that its analysis “does not support a finding that … Grayson was justified in his use of deadly force.” State prosecutors also cited an expert who described the act as comparable to “an officer intentionally and unnecessarily putting himself in front of a moving vehicle and then justifying use of force because of fear of being struck.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her family has said that Massey — a mother of two — was a “ball of energy,” and a “loving person” who was known for helping those around her. They also noted that they <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/24/us/sean-grayson-illinois-police-officer-shooting-sonya-massey/index.html">weren’t initially told</a> that the shooting had been committed by an officer and that there were early implications it was done by someone else.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Massey’s family are now calling for an investigation into the Sheriff’s Department’s hiring of Grayson, who has worked in <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/former-sheriffs-deputy-fatally-shot-sonya-massey-held/story?id=112229695">six different law enforcement agencies</a> in the last four years, and been <a href="https://www.ksdk.com/article/news/crime/illinois-deputy-charged-murder-dui-charges-macoupin-county/63-b1167b53-ef81-4af1-8383-e341359d41b4">charged twice</a> with driving under the influence. According to <a href="https://theintercept.com/2024/07/25/sonya-massey-police-killing-sean-grayson-army/">an Intercept report</a>, Grayson had also been discharged from the military due to misconduct. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the wake of the indictment, prosecutors will continue to pursue the charges against Grayson in a case that could head to trial. He has been denied pretrial release.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>It’s the latest incident to raise concerns about police violence</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Massey’s shooting highlights how pervasive police violence toward Black Americans still is, and the dearth of effective policies that have been passed to combat it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2023, police killed more than 1,300 people, which was a new record, according to the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/01/17/police-killings-record-2023/72174081007/">organization Mapping Police Violence</a>. That same data set found that Black people were almost three times more likely to be killed by police than white people.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Attempts to advance police reforms have varied at the city, state, and federal levels, with places <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/state-policing-reforms-george-floyds-murder">like San Francisco investing in crisis response teams</a> that serve as an alternative, and states like Minnesota <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/state-government/2021/04/the-minnesota-legislature-passed-new-deadly-force-standards-for-police-in-2020-why-lawmakers-are-already-looking-to-change-them/">approving new use of force standards</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But any federal compromise on police reform — including attempts after Floyd’s shooting in 2020 to end officers’ protections from legal liability — has thus far faltered.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President Joe Biden’s unwavering support for Israel’s war in Gaza created a rift between moderates and progressives in his party. Now that he has stepped aside in the 2024 presidential race, the question is whether Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, would chart a different path forward as president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One early signal that she might: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu<strong> </strong>addressed Congress on Wednesday, and Harris did not preside in her role as vice president due to a previously scheduled event she chose to attend in Indianapolis. A slew of congressional Democrats (not just progressives) decided not to attend in <a href="https://rollcall.com/2024/07/23/netanyahu-address-creates-a-dilemma-for-democrats/">protest of Netanyahu’s strategy in Gaza</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris will meet with Netanyahu one-on-one on Thursday in her ceremonial office in the Old Executive Office Building, and the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/harriss-support-for-gaza-cease-fire-hints-at-foreign-policy-shift-bbe8dc2a">Wall Street Journal reported</a> that she is expected to tell him “it is time for the war to end in a way where Israel is secure, all hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can enjoy their right to dignity, freedom, and self-determination.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Only days into her campaign, Harris has yet to articulate her Gaza policy, but the fact that she is not attending Netanyahu’s speech and privately communicating the urgency of a ceasefire signals that she might not follow Biden’s lead in giving the Israeli leader a “<a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/world/biden-netanyahu-bear-hug-disaster/">bear hug</a>.” Biden literally embraced Netanyahu on the tarmac when the president landed in Tel Aviv in November as a symbolic gesture of unequivocal support for Israel, and has since kept the prime minister close metaphorically, offering military and financial support.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Harris does change course, even slightly, that could alter the US-Israel relationship, but could also have important electoral consequences as well.</p>

</ul>
</div>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What does Kamala Harris think about Israel and the war in Gaza?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris has longstanding ties to the American Jewish community and Israeli interest groups.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, is Jewish and has been at the forefront of the Biden administration’s <a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2024/01/world-economic-forum-davos-antisemitism-herzog-greenblatt-emhoff-rosen/">initiative against antisemitism</a> since Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She has a good working relationship with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/kamala-harris-has-long-embraced-jewish-ties-but-critics-take-issue-with-gaza-stance/">shares a passion for climate issues</a>. She has also been on every one of the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/harriss-support-for-gaza-cease-fire-hints-at-foreign-policy-shift-bbe8dc2a">more than 20 phone calls</a> that Biden has had with Netanyahu throughout the war.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In her presidential bid, she has <a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2024/07/kamala-harris-jewish-democrats-vice-president-presidential-race/">won the backing</a> of major Jewish interest groups, including Democratic Majority for Israel, J Street, and the Jewish Democratic Council of America. She also has connections to the <a href="https://x.com/VP/status/1110301531306409986">American Israel Public Affairs Committee</a> (AIPAC) and gave a speech at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McK8bPR8pzU">organization’s annual conference in 2017</a> soon after she was elected to the US Senate, saying that one of her first acts in office was to introduce a resolution opposing a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israel. At the time, she said, “I believe the bonds between the United States and Israel are unbreakable.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After protesters outside Congress burned the American flag during Netanyahu’s visit, Harris issued a statement Thursday condemning that action and condemning “any individuals associating with the brutal terrorist organization Hamas, which has vowed to annihilate the State of Israel and kill Jews.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Concerning the war in Gaza, Harris has repeatedly upheld Israel’s “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/03/03/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-commemorating-the-59th-anniversary-of-bloody-sunday-selma-al/">right to defend itself</a>” against Hamas and emphasized that the threat posed by Hamas to Israel must be “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/03/03/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-commemorating-the-59th-anniversary-of-bloody-sunday-selma-al/">eliminated</a>.” This suggests she’s largely in agreement with Biden’s posture. Harris has, however, taken a sharper tone than Biden concerning Israel’s treatment of civilians in Gaza.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a high-profile <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/03/03/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-commemorating-the-59th-anniversary-of-bloody-sunday-selma-al/">speech in March</a>, she became the first person in the Biden administration to call for an immediate ceasefire, albeit only a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/03/03/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-commemorating-the-59th-anniversary-of-bloody-sunday-selma-al/">temporary</a> one. She also said that the Israeli government must do more to increase the flow of aid to Gaza, “no excuses,” and called the situation in Gaza a “humanitarian catastrophe.” The version of the speech that was ultimately delivered had reportedly <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/kamala-harris-gaza-speech-watered-down-cease-fire-rcna141750">been softened</a> from its original draft, which more directly criticized Israel for its obstruction of aid trucks into Gaza.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She also has expressed empathy for <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024/4/24/24138333/columbia-student-protests-gaza-nyu-divest-faculty">student protesters on college campuses</a> who are horrified by the death and destruction in Gaza and have attempted to pressure their schools into cutting ties with Israel.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“They are showing exactly what the human emotion should be, as a response to Gaza,” Harris <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/kamala-harris-interview-profile-excerpt/">told the Nation</a>. “There are things some of the protesters are saying that I absolutely reject, so I don’t mean to wholesale endorse their points. But we have to navigate it. I understand the emotion behind it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If she becomes president, the Wall Street Journal reported that Harris is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/harriss-support-for-gaza-cease-fire-hints-at-foreign-policy-shift-bbe8dc2a">expected to replace</a> some of the chief architects of the Biden administration’s strategy in Gaza, including national security adviser Jake Sullivan, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. It’s to be expected that a new president would want their own team in place, but any changes would open up possibilities for taking a different tack.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris’s national security adviser, Philip Gordon, has emphasized diplomatic rather than military solutions in foreign policy and written extensively about the difficulties of regime change in the Middle East. That background may prove relevant as Israel seeks to root out Hamas and install a new government in Gaza.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of this suggests that Harris might be somewhat to Biden’s left on Gaza — but by how much is an open question and one that she will have to clarify.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“She does have an opportunity. She’s using the right language in some instances. But we need a clearer explanation from her on where she stands,” said Abed Ayoub, national legal and policy director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And — as with Joe Biden’s campaign promises to make Saudi Arabia a pariah state — there’s always a chance that what Harris does eventually say while campaigning may change once she’s in office.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Biden’s Gaza policy has been divisive&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Politically, Harris faces the quandary of determining if — and by how much — she should distance herself from Biden’s record on Gaza, which has fractured the Democratic base.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden at one point <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/05/08/congress/progressives-cheer-israel-weapon-pause-gop-fume-biden-00156857">paused shipments of large munitions</a> to Israel over concerns about how they would be potentially used against civilians in Gaza but has otherwise continued to offer material support for the war, even after Israeli operations in Gaza’s southernmost city of Rafah <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/07/middleeast/destruction-inside-rafa-gaza-israel-intl/index.html">wreaked widespread destruction</a>. Over <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/latest-israeli-strikes-southern-gaza-palestinian-death-toll-112159613">39,000 Palestinians</a> have already died in the course of the conflict, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In May, Biden called for a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/biden-middle-east-remarks/index.html">deal to end the war</a> and return the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza, while continuing to advocate for a two-state solution to the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But the Israeli parliament has since voted to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israels-knesset-votes-overwhelmingly-palestinian-statehood-netanyahu-p-rcna162466">reject a two-state solution</a> and ceasefire talks are still ongoing two months later.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Monday, Biden promised he would <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/22/biden-gaza-war-end-hostages-return-pledge">deliver a ceasefire</a> deal before he leaves office. He did not elaborate on how he plans to overcome the roadblocks that have stalled negotiations thus far.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Progressives have for months been calling on Biden to halt weapons shipments to Gaza and put more pressure on Israel to end the war. Over 650,000 Democrats <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/05/biden-uncommitted-primary-vote-00161700">voted “uncommitted”</a> in the primary to protest Biden’s policies, and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/opinion/100000009565908/biden-voters-dearborn-michigan.html">scale of the opposition to Biden in the Midwest</a> appeared as though it could have tipped the election in Trump’s favor in swing states including Michigan and Wisconsin. Depending on how Harris positions herself, she could win back some of those voters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think there is excitement that [Biden] is not at the top of the ticket,” said Layla Elabed, a Palestinian American organizer in Michigan who helped lead the uncommitted movement, and the sister of Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI). “But we are also right now watching and listening to what Harris is going to do next.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Overall, however, Democrats and Republicans <a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/most-americans-support-israel-over-hamas-poll/">remain largely supportive</a> of Israel’s campaign. Since Israel’s establishment in 1948, the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/11/politics/presidents-israel-cnn/index.html">US has maintained a special relationship with the country</a>. It has been the largest cumulative recipient of American foreign aid since its founding, <a href="https://www.cfr.org/article/us-aid-israel-four-charts">totaling about $310 billion</a> (adjusted for inflation) in total economic and military assistance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For these reasons, it’s unlikely that Harris will deviate substantially from Biden on Israel — and if there is any change in her policy, it would be only slight. The question will be whether any changes can win back voters that the president has alienated without losing the voters who embraced his stance.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This leaves Harris with a difficult political tightrope to walk. But unlike Biden, she isn’t weighed down with the direct responsibility for all that has happened so far.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Update, July 25, 3 pm ET:</strong></em><a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/362782/kamala-harris-gaza-israel-palestine-biden-netanyahu"> </a><em>This story, originally published July 24, has been updated with developments after Netanyahu’s speech to Congress.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a child, Brian Hankerson daydreamed not of watching television or getting into trouble with friends after school. He wanted to high jump. A grade school-aged Hankerson would rush home from class, set up a fishing pole supported by two chairs, lay out a blanket beneath it, and hurtle his body over the makeshift setup. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the decades following, Hankerson never formally trained or competed as a runner or high jumper. That is, until his mid-40s, when he noticed adults racing at a track-and-field meet his kids were also participating in. “They weren’t young adults, they were older adults,” Hankerson says. Hankerson, a Coral Springs, Florida-based accountant, signed up to compete in a division called masters — <a href="https://world-masters-athletics.org/world-masters-athletics/">for those aged 35 and up</a> — and wound up setting meet records for the high jump and long jump. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now 64, Hankerson still competes across the country and internationally — he’s headed to the World Masters Athletics Championships in Sweden this August — and continues to sing the praises of organized athletics for adults. “If I can get out and push the envelope beyond what I think I can do, or I feel like I can do, then so can you,” he says. “Do you believe you can get out there and accomplish something? You will absolutely not know until you try.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Hankerson can attest, there’s no time like the present to pursue athletics, no matter your age. But the older we get, the more we suspect our time has passed. While kids are offered the freedom to dabble and play when they first pick up a sport, adults <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/23979535/permission-to-suck-terrible-hobbies">feel like they have to be good at it</a> or else the endeavor isn’t worth their time. “When adults come in for our gymnastics classes, they’re very apprehensive about doing new things with their body, or doing things they haven’t done in a very long time, and they get scared,” says Jackie Alexis, the recreational gymnastics coach at <a href="https://www.industrygymnastics.com/">Industry Gymnastics</a>, a Long Island-based gymnastics school for all ages and abilities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p> “Do you believe you can get out there and accomplish something? You will absolutely not know until you try.”</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With the <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/358882/simone-biles-olympic-trials-paris-floor-vault">2024 Paris Olympics</a> upon us, you might be feeling particularly inspired to learn a sport, or wistful about ones you weren’t able to try in the past. But there’s so much to gain when picking up — or returning to — a sport, coaches say. Not only are you moving your body and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6908518/">learning new skills</a>, but you’re <a href="https://systematicreviewsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13643-023-02264-8">fostering social connections</a> in a niche community — all of which have positive <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9902068/">impacts on mental</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11043276/">physical health</a>. If you don’t know where to start or are unsure of how to build athletics into your routine, coaches and athletes have some tips.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Let your interests motivate you</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From baseball to badminton, there are a myriad of athletic endeavors to choose from. Think about the sports currently capturing your attention, whether it’s Olympic gymnastics or <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24139393/challengers-sexy-tennis-zendaya-luca-guadagnino-investigation">tennis, thanks to <em>Challengers</em>,</a> and the ones that intrigued you as a kid. Use your interests — past and present — as a guide when selecting your sport.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If nothing comes to mind, let yourself be influenced. Patrick “Pat The Roc” Robinson began offering adult basketball classes at his <a href="https://pattherocacademy.com/">basketball skills academy</a> to keep parents of youth players engaged while their kids were practicing. Over time, parents began to take notice of the other lesson taking place during their child’s practice. “Each week, we get more and more parents that just happen to be in the gym,” Robinson says, “and they see the other adults participate. Now, they’re not ashamed or they’re not nervous about joining.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sign up for classes, but don’t splurge on gear</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Enrolling in a class is often the best first step when diving into a new sport. Coaches will teach you proper form, safety, and the rules of the game, and have equipment for you to use. Knowing you have practice every Thursday night offers structure and consistency, which is helpful for building routine, Robinson says. You can also join a local club for free but less individualized instruction. Resist the urge to spend exorbitant amounts of money on new gear, Alexis and Robinson say.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are a few options to find classes near you. See if your town’s parks and recreation department offers adult sport lessons or leagues — these may be cheaper than private gyms. Browse social media, like your city’s subreddit or local Facebook groups dedicated to specific sports to find recommended coaches or instructors.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Start with small, consistent efforts every day</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When people are super inspired, they tend to jump into their new sport headfirst, says <a href="https://www.teamsoho.org/coaches.html">Lucy Glanville</a>, the youth programming head coach at <a href="https://utaholympiclegacy.org/soldier-hollow-sports/">Soldier Hollow Nordic Center</a>, a facility that was used during the 2002 Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake City. This excitement is motivating in the short-term, but a two-hour pickleball lesson might leave you so sore the next day that you never want to pick up a paddle again. Small, daily, consistent efforts will ensure you won’t get burned out, Glanville says. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For instance, Robinson tells his adult students to practice their shooting form sans basketball throughout the week between practices; Alexis breaks down every gymnastics move into incremental steps. “Some people come in, and they’re like, ‘I want to do a backflip,’” they say. “I’m like, ‘Let’s work our way up to that.’” </p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“You can control getting your shoes on, stepping outside, and starting.”</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can also set incremental goals or milestones that support your consistency-building habits, Glanville says, making sure they are easily achievable and within your control. If your ultimate goal is to run a 10k, give yourself mini-goals that are more about the <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/23344385/beginners-guide-running">process of running, rather than the outcome</a> of finishing a race. “You can’t control whether your body’s going to make 10k that first time,” Glanville says, “but you can control getting your shoes on, stepping outside, and starting. Focusing on that start process and what it is that you can do, as opposed to what the dream is.” These smaller wins boost your confidence and allow you to set bigger goals. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bring a friend (and be open to making friends)</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re nervous about starting a new sport with a bunch of strangers, enlist a friend to come with you. Not only will you feel comfortable with a familiar face, but you can hold each other accountable. At Industry Gymnastics, friend groups often sign up for adult classes, Alexis says. “And if they come by themselves, they quickly make friends with the other people who come by themselves,” they say.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The social aspect of athletics is what brings players year after year to the adult basketball training center <a href="https://nevertoolate.com/">Never Too Late Basketball</a>, according to its founder, Steve Bzomowski. Ever since Never Too Late held their first clinic over 30 years ago, players have remarked on the organization’s ability to bring people together to collaborate. “People just really like the idea of getting together, meeting people you never knew before,” Bzomowski says, “and creating something that you had no idea that you could create.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Push yourself, but know your limits</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bzomowski wants to remind beginner adult athletes that they are capable of learning a new skill — it’s why he named his basketball clinic Never Too Late. At the end of weekend-long camps, each player is recognized for their particular strengths, whether it’s passing or effectively communicating, he says. Regardless of your skill level, there are areas where you will excel. While everyone’s bodies and abilities vary, Hankerson says you may be surprised at what your body can achieve. “I do something at 60 better than I did at 50,” he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kelley Shaw, the program director at Industry Gymnastics, believes no one is too old to learn gymnastics, but “you don’t have to do every skill,” she says. “You can do the ones that you feel comfortable with and don’t hurt.” This approach can apply to all sports: Give a drill or exercise your best effort, but listen to your body and ask your instructor for modifications if needed.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Don’t compete with anyone but yourself</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Adult gymnasts at Industry Gymnastics are often concerned with doing a move or drill perfectly, Shaw and Alexis say. But both instructors say learning a new skill or brushing up on old ones requires some imperfection before you start to improve. As difficult as it may be, don’t compare your abilities to your classmates’ — or your younger self. “Just try to do better than yourself each day,” Hankerson says, “not someone else you see on TV or on YouTube or at the track meet. Don’t worry about that.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Through these struggles, small accomplishments, and big wins, you learn about yourself, Bzomowski says. You learn what your body is capable of, how you work with other people, and what you’re able to overcome. “It’s not <em>just</em>, ‘I didn’t know whether I was capable of this physically,’” he says. “Feeling resistance within myself and overcoming that — I think that’s a big part of it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I had no business enjoying <em>Twisters</em> as much as I did.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For one, I’m not a fan of disaster movies. Nor do I have a relationship to the original 1996 film <em>Twister</em> — although, it turns out you don’t need to know anything about the first movie to watch this stand-alone sequel. I didn’t walk out of <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/359689/storm-chasing-twister-tornado-expert"><em>Twisters</em></a> thinking that it was particularly good. The performances by Daisy Edgar-Jones and (sorry) <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/361486/glen-powell-explained-twisters-hit-man-anyone-but-you">Glen Powell</a> were mediocre. The dialogue was silly. The music cues were laughable. Every aspect of the film felt like it was focus-grouped, including the omission of a climactic kiss between the two “romantic” leads. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So how did I manage to leave<em> Twisters</em> elated, you might ask? I paid an extra $6 to see it in 4DX, an “immersive” theater experience that feels like the only way anyone should consume this ridiculous film. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the uninitiated, 4DX is sort of like if you watched an entire action movie inside one of those virtual-reality space shuttles at an amusement park — only a lot more visceral. The experience at Regal Cinemas includes motion-enabled seats that jolt and rotate. In the case of <em>Twisters</em>, there are bursts of wind, trickles of rain, and fog. You’re also guaranteed a heightened communal experience. At my screening, several set pieces were followed by loud applause, including after a tragic scene where innocent characters die. By the end of the film, I had no idea whether everyone was responding to the events in the film or to the chaotic bodily experience we had all endured together. </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/2571_FP_00623B-3587x1500-d3275b2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=10.064120434904,0,79.871759130192,100" alt="A man and woman stand with their backs to the camera, facing a swirling cloud." title="A man and woman stand with their backs to the camera, facing a swirling cloud." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Glen Powell and Daisy Edgar-Jones in &lt;em&gt;Twisters&lt;/em&gt;. | Universal Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures, and Amblin Entertainment" data-portal-copyright="Universal Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures, and Amblin Entertainment" />
<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Twisters</em> has already done a lot of <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tyvid5/video/7393766876129578283">good advertising</a> for the limited format. The film made $2.1 million in 4DX tickets during its opening weekend, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mnelson1610/video/7394233559055142175">moviegoers</a> can’t <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thevelasquezfamilia/video/7393819455521901867">stop</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tyvid5/video/7394553154374831403">raving</a> about the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@trulyoliviaa/video/7395063773020589342">experience</a> on social media. It’s certainly good advertising leading up to <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>, out this weekend, which can also be experienced for a limited time in 4DX.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">4DX is just one of many movie formats that has made moviegoing more exciting but also a lot more confusing — and expensive. With streaming keeping more people at home, theater chains seem focused on selling premium experiences. However, are they enhancing the experience of moviegoing or complicating it with all these different options? The answer might be both. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Why are there so many movie theater formats?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’ve bought a movie ticket recently, you’ve probably noticed the increasing number of premium formats available. The list of options for <em>Twisters</em> in the New York City area is comically long and utterly perplexing. In addition to 4DX, you can also pay to see the film in IMAX, Laser at AMC, IMAX with Laser at AMC, Dolby Cinema at AMC, Prime at AMC, RPX, and Screen X. You could also see it in the standard digital 2D format, the cheapest of all these options. However, when listed alongside all these formats that sound innately fancy — even if you don’t have the vaguest idea what they mean — a standard screening might seem less ideal. </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-660166846.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.669135487166,100,78.661729025667" alt="4DX seats in a theater." title="4DX seats in a theater." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="The 4DX “Twist and Sway” chairs displayed during 2017 CinemaCon in Las Vegas, Nevada. | Bryan Steffy/Getty Images for 4DX" data-portal-copyright="Bryan Steffy/Getty Images for 4DX" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">So what do these formats entail exactly? For the most part, they magnify how you see and hear a movie. IMAX, which is shot on IMAX cameras using 70mm film, is probably the best-known. A more exclusive format like RPX is still a bit more foreign. <a href="https://www.regmovies.com/rpx">RPX</a> (Regal Premium Experience) is Regal Cinema’s in-house larger-screen format, which features an updated sound system. It’s not as high-quality as IMAX, nor is it as premium as <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dolby-showcases-the-immersive-power-of-dolby-cinema-in-latest-love-more-global-brand-campaign-302073543.html">Dolby Digital Cinema</a>, which is located in AMC theaters. Dolby Cinema uses dual 4K laser projectors, which has four times more resolution than a standard theater projector. These theaters are also equipped with Dolby Atmos, an ultra-surround sound system that includes speakers in the ceilings and transducers in the seats.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Laser at AMC uses laser projectors in place of digital ones, while <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/imax-launches-next-generation-imax-with-laser-experience-to-enhance-blockbuster-moviegoing-at-amc-theatres-300635259.html">Laser with IMAX</a> simply combines their respective technologies. <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/amc-to-bring-cinionic-laser-to-all-prime-at-amc-locations-301814426.html">PRIME at AMC</a> boasts Cinionic laser projectors, better acoustics, and “sublime seating.” (On paper, it doesn’t seem that different from Laser.) Lastly, Screen X is a more immersive experience, using a 270-degree panoramic presentation system. Like 4DX, it’s an export from South Korea. It’s equally gimmicky, expanding images along the walls during key scenes to make audiences feel like they’re inside a room or on a battlefield. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As confusing and even unnecessary as they may be, the advent of these new, snazzy formats makes sense in a time when people need some extra motivation to leave their couches to go sit in a theater. With the popularity of streaming and with films going quickly from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/28/media/movies-streaming-box-office-theaters/index.html">theaters to VOD</a>, it seems as though theater chains have to promote themselves differently — not just with their film offerings but with a unique experience that can’t be emulated at home. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The strategy of selling a movie in a special format seemed to work for <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/oppenheimer-imax-70mm-craze-projectors-1235697085/"><em>Oppenheimer</em></a>. While IMAX is hardly a new format, Christopher Nolan’s urging of the public to see <em>Oppenheimer</em> on the biggest screen possible, whether in IMAX 70mm or non-IMAX 70mm, seemed largely related to the overall success of the film. Not only did IMAX theaters sell out rapidly, particularly in New York City, but the level of demand prompted an <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/oppenheimer-imax-70mm-extended-tickets-1235689899/">extended IMAX run</a>. It also reminded audiences how much the size of their screens and quality of a picture can highlight good filmmaking. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">4DX, however, is an entirely different beast. Its goal is to entertain the audience, not elevate art. While it could grow into a huge cash cow for theater chains, it’s hard to know if it’s ultimately what’s best for cinema as a whole.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>How does 4DX affect moviegoing?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Twisters</em> might do for 4DX what <em>Oppenheimer</em> did for IMAX. Critics and average moviegoers alike are spreading the gospel of the format online and selling out showings. This is certainly the most PR 4DX screenings have gotten since they arrived in America in 2014. But is this something we could see the film industry push back on? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">4DX is designed to heighten moviegoers’ senses and put them inside of the film. But there’s an argument to be made that all the movement and effects distract from the story being told onscreen. I spent most of my <em>Twisters </em>viewing waiting for action sequences so that I could be jolted in my seat and giggle with my friends. Additionally, it was hard to pay much attention to the direction of the film, the dialogue, or the <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/359689/storm-chasing-twister-tornado-expert">science behind the storm-chasing</a> while being thrashed around. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the case of a silly movie about tornadoes, I didn’t feel like I was robbed. My friends and I agreed we would’ve been bored out of our minds if we had watched <em>Twisters</em> in any other format. Still, we walked away with a reaction that wasn’t truly genuine. Nor did we respond properly to the tone the film was trying to create in certain moments. For instance, a devastating opening sequence that sets up a post-traumatic arc for Edgar-Jones’s character, Kate, was met with excitement and laughter. Who knows whether being more locked into this moment would’ve made the stakes of the film feel more real. It’s hard to argue that you need to respect the gravitas of a film like <em>Twisters</em>, but for a higher-quality movie with good performances, one can imagine some seriousness being lost. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It has yet to be seen if 4DX will be an actual “threat” to cinema. Right now, there are only 50 4DX theaters in the United States. Plus, the higher ticket price, an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/27/4dx-movie-experience.html">average of $8</a> more than a standard ticket, may not be worth it to certain moviegoers. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, it’s not hard to see this becoming the next great film-viewing debate. Given the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/1/8528111/watching-movies-on-smartphones-spike-lee">panic</a> filmmakers have already displayed over young people watching movies on their iPhones, one can imagine the sort of uproar in Hollywood if 4DX became a bigger phenomenon. For now, though, it seems Americans haven’t been more excited about a new theater technology since before the pandemic. If film executives continue to feed us horrible IP, we might as well be allowed to rock out in our seats. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Former President Donald Trump has lately been trying to distance himself from <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce">Project 2025</a>, claiming it was cooked up by the “<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-project-2025-rally-b2583142.html">severe right</a>” and that he doesn’t know anything about it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it turns out the severe right is coming from inside the house.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kevin Roberts, the self-proclaimed “head” of Project 2025, has a book coming out in September — and the book’s foreword is written by Trump’s vice presidential candidate, J.D. Vance, who lavishly praises its ideas.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Never before has a figure with Roberts’s depth and stature within the American Right tried to articulate a genuinely new future for conservatism,” Vance writes, according to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dawns-Early-Light-Burning-Washington/dp/0063353504">the book’s Amazon page</a>. “We are now all realizing that it’s time to circle the wagons and load the muskets. In the fights that lay ahead, these ideas are an essential weapon.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What ideas? Like <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361455/jd-vance-trump-vice-president-rnc-speech">Vance</a>, Roberts is obsessed with the idea that the left controls major American institutions — he lists Ivy League colleges, the FBI, the New York Times, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Department of Education and even the <a href="https://www.netgalley.com/catalog/book/420673">Boy Scouts of America</a>. The book argues that “conservatives need to burn down” these institutions if “we’re to preserve the American way of life.” (Vox has requested a copy of the book, but has not yet received one at the time of this writing.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Obviously, this poses a problem for Trump’s attempts to distance himself from the virally unpopular Project 2025 and its lengthy agenda for what he should do if he wins, which includes proposals to restrict abortion access and centralize executive power in the presidency.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And it’s one more indication that Trump’s pick of Vance <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/184106/trump-picking-jd-vance-mistake-biden-kamala-harris">might be politically problematic</a> for him. Vance <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23373795/curtis-yarvin-neoreaction-redpill-moldbug">has a fascination</a> with provocative and extreme far-right thinkers, and a history of praising their ideas. He is not a running mate tailored to win over swing voters who are concerned Trump might be too extreme — quite the opposite.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The book was written and announced before Vance was chosen as Trump’s running mate. But there’s some indication that people involved had some late second thoughts about it. It was <a href="https://x.com/Bon__Mots/status/1813587219351048196">originally announced</a> as “Dawn’s Early Light: Burning Down Washington to Save America,” with a cover image showing a match over the word “Washington.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More recently, though, the subtitle <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dawns-Early-Light-Burning-Washington-ebook/dp/B0CQHPFHWT/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3F2DU567XZRSM&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.JJLB_KRiLLo1NMFtP-Gn4QnL_zVCR2ltpQaz8WLfQv5qVRf1xKTRhDIadUQ1KDANwziEvWMvIWXuq0d1vCJ5CgwkqFh0izVjpNc5Sz4-vudQnl90jezYmPx2BwZ3kcDtO4GIU83tYBEf9CkFqakSU0et4r0Kx8AvQD6v4zA1Qmht_1dWAzZdbSBzkt1ny8RF9ODuCzbcx9BpmrUQLWC2R4XjMqTQDEFsBIukdihaN1M.FMN8-LJ7hQn6C46DwhNNw32atyu_1it28xVsF8M3bnU&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=dawns+early+light&amp;qid=1721743470&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=dawns+early+light%2Cstripbooks%2C123&amp;sr=1-2">has been changed</a> to “Taking Back Washington to Save America,” and the match has vanished from the cover.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Roberts headed Project 2025 — and contributed some of its most controversial proposals</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Project 2025, which I recently <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce">wrote about at length</a>, is the conservative movement’s detailed and specific plan for what the next Republican president should do with his power.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It was crafted by people who have long worked closely with Trump and includes many policies Trump clearly supports — like centralizing power in the presidency over career civil service professionals, slashing regulations, and abandoning efforts to fight climate change. It also contains some proposals Trump currently finds politically problematic: aggressively using federal power to prevent abortions, restricting some contraceptive coverage, and banning pornography.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Project 2025 was put together by the conservative Heritage Foundation, which worked on it with more than 100 conservative groups. Though much of <a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf">its 922-page policy document</a> is written in dry, wonkish language, Roberts wrote the fiery introduction. The porn ban is his idea specifically — he writes:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">Pornography should be outlawed. The people who produce and distribute it should be imprisoned. Educators and public librarians who purvey it should be classed as registered sex offenders. And telecommunications and technology firms that facilitate its spread should be shuttered.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On abortion, Roberts writes: “Conservatives in the states and in Washington, including in the next conservative Administration, should push as hard as possible to protect the unborn in every jurisdiction in America.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.heritage.org/staff/kevin-d-roberts-phd">Roberts</a>, who has led Heritage since late 2021, has a history of controversial statements. “We are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be,” he <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/kevin-roberts-man-behind-project-2025-just-said-the-quiet-part-out-loud">recently said</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Vance is a big fan. “I was thrilled to write the foreword for this incredible book, which contains a bold new vision for the future of conservatism in America,” he <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1803537040555876682">tweeted in June</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tucker Carlson, who was heavily featured at the recent Republican National Convention, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063353504#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThere%20aren%E2%80%99t%20many%20public%20policy%20executives%20in%20Washington%20who%20actually%20understand%20where%20the%20world%20is%20going%20or%20why.%20In%20fact%2C%20I%E2%80%99ve%20met%20just%20one%3A%20Kevin%20Roberts%20of%20The%20Heritage%20Foundation.%20This%20is%20his%20plan%20to%20save%20America.%20It%E2%80%99s%20deep%20and%20wise.%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%94%20Tucker%20Carlson">has also praised</a> the book and Roberts’s “plan to save America,” calling it “deep and wise.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Vance agrees quite a bit with Project 2025’s most extreme ideas</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Project 2025 contains a multitude of proposals in its 922-page plan, not all of which J.D. Vance necessarily supports.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But he’s on record backing ideas similar to those put forth in two of Project 2025’s most controversial issue areas.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first is abortion. Project 2025 lays out <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce#:~:text=3)%20A%20hardline,fetal%20cell%20research">a sweeping agenda</a> by which the next president could use federal power to prevent abortions, including using an old law called the Comstock Act to prosecute people who mail abortion pills, and working to prevent women from abortion-banning states from traveling out of state to get abortions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance is on record supporting these ideas. Last year, he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/07/17/jd-vance-abortion-comstock-vice-presidential-nominee/">signed</a> a letter demanding that the Justice Department prosecute physicians and pharmacists “who break the Federal mail-order abortion laws.” In 2022, he said he was “sympathetic” to the idea that the federal government <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/kfile-jd-vance-abortion-comments/index.html">should stop</a> efforts to help women traveling out of their states to get abortions. That year, he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/kfile-jd-vance-abortion-comments/index.html">also said</a>: “I certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At other points, Vance has struck a different tone. ““We have to accept that people do not want blanket abortion bans,” he said <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/kfile-jd-vance-abortion-comments/index.html">last December</a>. And this month <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2024/06/supreme-court-preserves-access-to-abortion-pill/">he said</a> he supported a Supreme Court decision that allowed the abortion bill mifepristone to remain available. Here, Vance is trying to align with Trump, who — fearing political blowback — argues he merely wants abortion to be a state issue, despite his long alliance with the religious right. But Vance’s record implies his true agenda might be otherwise.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The second controversial area where Vance is sympatico with Project 2025 is centralizing presidential power over the executive branch. The project lays out various proposals to rein in what conservatives view as an out-of-control “deep state” bureaucracy — mainly, by firing far more career civil servants and installing far more political appointees throughout the government.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361455/jd-vance-trump-vice-president-rnc-speech">as I wrote last week,</a> has backed a maximalist version of this agenda. In 2021, Vance <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/04/inside-the-new-right-where-peter-thiel-is-placing-his-biggest-bets">said</a> that in Trump’s second term, Trump should “fire every single midlevel bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state, replace them with our people.” The courts would try to stop this, Vance continued, and Trump should then “stand before the country like Andrew Jackson did, and say, ‘The chief justice has made his ruling. Now let him enforce it.’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So it’s no big surprise that Vance would write the foreword for a book by Project 2025’s architect. They fundamentally agree on how they see the world, and in much of what they want out of politics: a battle against the left for control of institutions, and expanded government power to stop abortions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President Joe Biden addressed the nation from the Oval Office Wednesday night in the culmination of a pivotal few weeks that saw him relinquish the Democratic presidential nomination — an act that may one day be the defining moment of his political career.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The speech was an attempt to exit political life gracefully, but it also served as a reminder that only days after the president announced his unprecedented decision, the nation has already moved on. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democratic delegates quickly consolidated behind Biden’s chosen successor, Vice President Kamala Harris, and nearly 90 percent of Democratic voters surveyed said he made the right choice in a recent <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24989839/cnn-poll-harris-improves-on-bidens-performance-against-trump-in-early-look-at-new-matchup.pdf">CNN poll conducted by SSRS</a>. The media limelight has shifted to Harris, the new presumptive Democratic nominee, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/362619/kamala-harris-president-vision-political-ideology-2024-election">what her presidency would look like</a>. And Democrats have been able to refocus with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/23/kamala-harris-donations-election/">renewed enthusiasm</a> on their task at hand, which is beating former President Donald Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s left Biden suddenly in the role of elder statesman. Under extraordinary circumstances just months before the 2024 election, he’s unexpectedly fulfilled his 2020 promise to become a “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/09/politics/joe-biden-bridge-new-generation-of-leaders/index.html">bridge</a>” to the next generation of leadership.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,” Biden said in his speech. “It is the best way to unite our nation.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now that he’s done so, the question arises: What, if anything, is left for an outgoing president to do? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden himself insists that his work is not done, and made it clear Wednesday night that he wants to tie up loose ends on policy. For instance, he promised to continue his efforts to protect democracy, at home and abroad. And he’s vowed to deliver a <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/22/biden-gaza-war-end-hostages-return-pledge">ceasefire in Gaza</a> before he leaves office.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But beyond Biden’s legacy — and the needs of the country — there’s still a campaign going on. So what role can he play in both?</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>President Joe Biden endorsed Kamala Harris for president. Here’s what to know about her.</strong></h2>

</ul>
</div>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What can Biden do on the campaign trail — and what should he do?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Strategists and pollsters agree: Biden can be useful to Harris on the campaign trail.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden clearly thinks so too. On Monday, he <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/07/22/remarks-by-president-biden-and-vice-president-harris-at-a-campaign-event-wilmington-de-2/">said at a campaign event</a> in Delaware via teleconference, “I’m going to be on the road, and I’m not going anywhere.” He reiterated his support for Harris Wednesday night: “She’s tough; she’s capable. She’s been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Chuck Rocha, a former senior adviser for Sen. Bernie Sanders’s 2020 campaign, said that Biden has an opportunity to help Harris with union members and white working-class voters in Pennsylvania and Michigan — groups that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/national-results">helped power his 2020 victory</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Evan Roth Smith, lead pollster for Blueprint, said that Biden also needs to speak to the voters who have been most loyal to him, even over the course of the last month, and tell them that it’s important that they not just turn out to vote for Harris, but knock on doors on her behalf.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fernand Amandi, a Democratic pollster, said that Biden can reassert the successes of his administration as a “political wind behind the sails of the Kamala campaign,” emphasizing her role in getting things done.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Harris also has the unusual opportunity to get a second chance at a first impression and to define herself outside of being Biden’s vice president. Voters don’t associate her as much with the issues on which they rated the administration poorly, like inflation and immigration, Roth Smith said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“So she has this important opportunity to distance herself a little bit,” he said. “It’s important to not squander that and not overly tie her to Biden.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden also risks generating further questions about whether or not he should continue as president until the end of his term if he participates in the kinds of campaign events in which he has proven more likely to commit verbal flubs, Amandi said. Though Amandi added that he believes Biden wouldn’t complete his term if the president and his doctors didn’t think him capable, Republicans have recently argued that Biden is not fit for office and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnd0ek9el6ro">should step down now</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There was a lot of pressure on Biden to get out there, particularly following the debate performance, and do the kinds of events that he was less comfortable doing,” Roth Smith said. “He doesn’t need to do those kinds of events anymore … We don’t necessarily need him all over the campaign trail.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s especially the case given that, soon, Harris will have another major surrogate on her team in the form of her vice presidential candidate. Once she chooses a running mate, “there will literally be three people who can help bring this thing home for November for the Democrats,” two of which — Harris and her vice presidential pick — can provide “a fresh-faced contrast to Donald Trump,” Rocha said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Essentially, the move for Biden experts say, is for him to help out Harris where he can, but not overexpose himself. Biden seemed to recognize Wednesday that it was time for him to take something of a step back. “I know there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life,” he said. “There is also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices. Yes, younger voices. That time and place is now.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What about Biden’s remaining time as president?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Strategists and pollsters told me that Biden should focus on being president for the remainder of his time in office, and as he noted in his speech, that’s what he intends to do.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“An important role for the president is to be this statesman, to show that Democrats can govern,” Roth Smith said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Being competent, while finding opportunities to remind voters of the accomplishments of his administration — from the Inflation Reduction Act to the bipartisan infrastructure law — is one of the best ways he can support Harris. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The Biden-Harris administration has a fantastic story to tell,” Amandi said. “It was a story that had been undermined by the legitimate concerns about whether or not the president could continue another four years.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said that “Biden’s ability to do anything truly substantive is muted” given that he faces a divided Congress and election season is in full swing. But there are certain things that the president can do unilaterally. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For one, Americans are depending on his vast foreign policy experience at a tenuous moment for the Middle East and Europe. In his speech, he said he would seek to “bring peace and security to the Middle East” and keep rallying a coalition of nations to stop the Russian takeover of Ukraine, bolstering NATO and US allies in the Pacific. All that may not be achievable in five months, but he can work on making visible progress. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden may also look for domestic policy wins on issues that had dogged his candidacy, including immigration and inflation, which seems to be improving in time for the Federal Reserve to likely cut interest rates later this year. He can also highlight accomplishments on lesser-known, but still incredibly popular policies such as <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/faqs-about-the-inflation-reduction-acts-medicare-drug-price-negotiation-program/">negotiating decreases in drug prices</a> for Americans on Medicare. On Wednesday, he highlighted <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-16/biden-to-propose-supreme-court-reforms-including-term-limits?srnd=homepage-americas&amp;embedded-checkout=true">proposed Supreme Court reforms</a> and his <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/29/congress-is-killing-bidens-cancer-moonshot-00154718">cancer “moonshot”</a> among his priorities.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And as the administration makes progress, Biden needs to make sure he is “sharing the stage,” Roth Smith said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If there is going to be a great inflation report or a consumer confidence report, [Harris] needs to get credit for that,” he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That also serves the dual purpose of solidifying Biden’s legacy and increasing his approval rating, which Kondik said is also helpful to Harris. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think President Biden will leave office in January with significantly higher approval ratings because the one obstacle to judging him in the context of his success has now been removed, which is the concern that he would seek reelection at an age where his physical limitations wouldn’t allow him to continue,” Amandi said. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The stakes are still high for Democrats. Biden’s remaining time in office has the potential to lay the groundwork for a smooth transition to another Democratic administration that could protect the policies he set in motion. But as Biden himself has put it, before anyone — even Harris — can take over, he has to “<a href="https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2024/07/12/biden-vows-to-finish-the-job-at-press-conference">finish the job</a>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was back in a very familiar building. Not only was he making his fourth address to a joint session of Congress — breaking Winston Churchill’s record for foreign leaders — he’s also been a presence in the building’s halls since serving as a diplomat in the early 1980s. Since he made his first speech to Congress in 1996, Netanyahu has been almost as much a fixture of politics in America as in Israel. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Things felt different today. It’s not just that Netanyahu is a controversial figure, one who drew <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/24/netanyahu-congress-protests-security">thousands of protesters</a> onto the streets of Washington. That’s not new; Netanyahu’s 2011 speech to Congress was <a href="https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/benjaminnetanyahujointsession2011.htm">interrupted by a pro-Palestinian protester</a> in the chamber. What is new is that he has become an increasingly marginalized one.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even a few weeks ago, when Netanyahu’s speech was announced, it had the makings of a marquee political event. Today, it was overshadowed by President Joe Biden’s highly anticipated Wednesday night speech to address his decision to drop out of the presidential election. Dozens of lawmakers — <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/24/half-house-senate-democrats-boycott-netanyahu">around half of Congress’s Democrats</a> — skipped Netanyahu’s speech altogether.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Soon-to-retire Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin’s presence behind Netanyahu on the rostrum attested to how much of a partisan figure Netanyahu has become. Vice President Kamala Harris, Senate President Pro Tempore Patty Murray, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, one of whom would normally have been in that seat, all <a href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-811586">declined the role</a>. Netanyahu, who has been Israel’s prime minister for 17 of the last 30 years, has done more than anyone to make support for the country an increasingly partisan issue in the United States, in part through actions like his<em> </em>speech to Congress in 2015. That time, he was invited by congressional Republicans to lobby against the Iran nuclear deal then being negotiated by the Obama administration in what was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/02/26/politics/democrats-missing-netanyahu-whip-list/index.html">considered a remarkably partisan speech</a> for a foreign leader.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In today’s address, by contrast, Netanyahu made little news. It was a speech that gave little indication of a plan to end the war in Gaza, and likely undermined diplomatic efforts underway to do so. It was a notably defensive speech for Netanyahu, devoted more to refuting criticism of Israel than to charting a way forward out of the morass it has found itself in. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi <a href="https://x.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/1816208313572364356">called</a> it “by far the worst presentation of any foreign dignitary invited and honored with the privilege of addressing the Congress of the United States.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Netanyahu said — and what he’s doing</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Netanyahu recounted the horrors of Hamas’s October 7 attacks and vowed to the families of hostages currently being held in Gaza that he “would not rest until all their loved ones are home.” Not all of those families may be inclined to take him at his word. <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/international/4786324-hamas-hostages-netanyahu-speech/">Many of them</a> are calling for the prime minister to accept a ceasefire deal to secure the hostages’ release, but today Netanyahu vowed that “Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas’s military capabilities and its rule in Gaza and bring all our hostages home,” adding, “That’s what total victory means and we will settle for nothing less.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Netanyahu also said, as he has in several previous remarks, that “[Israel] must retain overriding&nbsp;control [in Gaza] to ensure that Gaza never again poses a security threat to Israel” — a demand likely to be a nonstarter for any ceasefire deal.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite that, Netanyahu <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israels-netanyahu-says-deal-could-be-nearing-hostages-gaza-2024-07-23/">has said in recent days</a> that a ceasefire deal may be near, and the deal currently being negotiated is likely to be the focus of the prime minister’s meeting at the White House with Biden on Thursday. The Biden administration has tended not to respond directly to Netanyahu’s public statements on the deal, and this time was no exception. Asked if Netanyahu’s remarks made that deal less likely, a senior US administration official told reporters on Wednesday afternoon, “We were in the Situation Room doing some other stuff, so I have not seen the speech.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Netanyahu didn’t indicate any specific asks beyond continued US military support. “Give us the tools faster and we’ll finish the job faster,” he said, riffing on a famous Churchill line from World War II. As he has in all three of his previous addresses, going back to the mid-1990s, Netanyahu kept the focus on Iran, which he mentioned before Hamas. He made the case that Israel’s fight against Iran-backed groups like Hamas and Hezbollah serves to “keep American boots off the ground while protecting our shared interests in the Middle East.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He pushed back against criticism of Israel over civilian casualties and preventing food from entering Gaza. He ripped into anti-Israel protesters in the United States, accusing them of being “useful idiots” for Iran, criticized university presidents, and compared “gays for Gaza” to “chickens for KFC.” This was likely the first speech on Mideast policy that included a shout-out to the “<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/white-house-praises-unc-frat-bros-protected-american-flag-anti-israel-agitators-admirable">fraternity brothers of the University of North Carolina.</a>”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to lose friends and influence</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Netanyahu praised President Biden for his “half a century of friendship to Israel” and noted that the president describes himself as a “proud Zionist.” But that only served to highlight the shrinking number of Democratic politicians who would publicly describe themselves that way. Polls have consistently shown a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/472070/democrats-sympathies-middle-east-shift-palestinians.aspx">deep partisan divide</a> opening up over sympathy toward Israel.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He also thanked former president and current Republican nominee Donald Trump for actions in support of Israel during his presidency, including recognizing Israeli <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-recognizing-golan-heights-part-state-israel/">sovereignty over the Golan Heights</a> and moving the <a href="https://il.usembassy.gov/statement-by-president-trump-on-jerusalem/">US embassy to Jerusalem</a>. Netanyahu will be traveling to Florida to meet with Trump (<a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/netanyahu-requested-date-for-trump-meeting-falls-on-miami-based-son-yairs-birthday/">and possibly celebrate the birthday of his son</a>, who lives in Miami). Still, while Trump has not exactly turned on Israel, he has clearly soured somewhat on Netanyahu, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2021/12/10/trump-netanyahu-disloyalty-fuck-him">who he is still angry at</a> for congratulating Biden on his election victory in 2020. It doesn’t seem like a coincidence that Trump posted a <a href="https://x.com/BarakRavid/status/1815939398841847899">friendly letter</a> from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on the day he announced the Netanyahu meeting.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From a purely visual standpoint, Netanyahu may have gotten what he wanted today: rapturous standing ovations, even if mainly from Republicans. But more than <a href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-810113">70 percent of Israelis now say that Netanyahu</a> should resign. His own defense establishment is turning on his <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/israeli-defense-minister-publicly-criticizes-netanyahus-gaza-strategy#:~:text=Israel's%20defense%20minister%20accused%20Netanyahu%20of%20indecision%20and%20leading%20Israel,he's%20here%20with%20us%20now.">handling of the war</a> and he’s under fire over issues ranging from his long-running legal troubles to the controversial question of whether the ultra-Orthodox should serve in the country’s military.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the past, Washington has served as a sort of relief valve for Netanyahu, a place he could count on strong support, even when his political position looked rocky at home. In that first speech back in 1996, after receiving a five-minute standing ovation from Congress, he <a href="https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/benjaminnetanyahujointsession1996.htm">quipped</a>, “If I could only get the Knesset [Israel’s parliament] to vote like this.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, though, “the magic is gone,” Nimrod Novik, a former senior Israeli foreign policy official who is now an analyst at the Israel Policy Forum, told Vox. “The fellow that mastered verbal acrobatics to the point that different audiences could hear different messages in the same speech —&nbsp;that’s over. Those who were in awe of his verbal skills now take it with a grain of salt.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In more than 40 years of coming to Washington, Netanyahu has surely grown used to being a controversial figure. He may have to get used to being an irrelevant one.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Correction, 7 pm ET: </strong>An earlier version of this story referred to Netanyahu as a former ambassador to the US. He was a deputy chief of mission.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vice President Kamala Harris has 103 days to convince the American public to vote for her for president. It’s not a lot of time — especially considering former <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-launch-new-white-house-bid-while-his-party-licks-its-wounds-2022-11-15/">President Donald Trump launched his campaign in November 2022</a> — but it’s a timeline not too different from that of other countries, many of which have short campaign cycles.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US has the longest campaign cycle of any of its peer countries partly because we operate on a presidential system. We have fixed terms of leadership, and we know there will be elections every four years, so it’s easy to start early (especially given all <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/01/31/primary-elections-frontloading-voters-00138616">the procedural hurdles to running for president</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“That’s different from most other democracies, which are parliamentary systems and which have irregularly scheduled elections where you can have — as in Israel —&nbsp; five elections in a very brief period of time,” <a href="https://truman.missouri.edu/people/squire">Peverill Squire</a>, professor of political science at the University of Missouri, told Vox. “Or you can call a snap election, as happened in France or the election <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/358985/uk-labour-keir-starmer-tories-migration-politics-elections-july-4-rishi-sunak-boris-johnson">in Great Britain</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So how do other countries with shorter campaign periods manage their leadership elections — and can that tell us anything about what the next three months could look like for Harris’s campaign?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The US system has unique factors that make comparison difficult</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Comparing US presidential campaigns to those in other countries —&nbsp;even our allies and peers —&nbsp;is kind of like comparing apples and oranges for many reasons.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A parliamentary system’s uneven cycles force campaign apparatuses — from how debates are run to deadlines for printing ballots — to be a lot more flexible than they are in the US. Plus, many of these systems are highly centralized, rather than federalized like in the US. In parliamentary systems, candidates run on relatively narrow party manifestos; there’s less individual variance between candidates of the same party. That means in a case like Harris’s, where one candidate is substituted for another late in the race, voters don’t really have to figure out how the new candidate differs from the old.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One major challenge Democrats may face is the role that money plays in the US election system. The 2010 Supreme Court decision in<em> </em><a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2008/08-205"><em>Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission</em></a><em> </em>essentially qualified political donations as free speech. It determined that corporations have the rights of individuals when it comes to campaign donations and <a href="https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/candidate-taking-receipts/contribution-limits/">can in some cases donate unlimited amounts</a>. That’s caused astronomical increases in campaign fundraising, which alters the course of American politics in critical ways that just don’t apply in European countries like France.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>President Joe Biden endorsed Kamala Harris for president. Here’s what to know about her.</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Vice President Kamala Harris could replace Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket in 2024.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360327/vice-president-kamala-harris-joe-biden-nominee">Harris’s strengths and vulnerabilities as a presidential candidate</a></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris has raised more than <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kamala-harris-fundraising-100-million-biden-drops-out/">$100 million since gaining President Joe Biden’s endorsement</a> on Sunday, but will need to keep the money flowing; Trump’s <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kamala-harris-fundraising-100-million-biden-drops-out/">second-quarter haul</a> was more than $60 million more than Biden’s. Campaigns run through money quickly as they fund ad buys and ground operations, and their outside partners do too. In an era of unlimited political spending, there’s a race to have the largest war chest — a competition that just isn’t an issue in European politics, <a href="https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/people/patrick-chamorel">Patrick Chamorel</a>, senior resident scholar at the Stanford Center in Washington, told Vox.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It&#8217;s parties that receive the money” in European elections, “and this money is public money.” Plus, Chamorel said, “in Europe, you have spending limits, which would in the US be considered an encroachment on freedom of expression.” There’s always a ceiling on how much the parties can spend in European elections —&nbsp;and there are very strict limits on corporate donations, which is meant to maintain the independence of the candidates and to ensure a pluralistic political system by keeping a relatively even playing field.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And in most European countries, “you don&#8217;t have money spent on advertisement in the media,” Chamorel said. Media organizations are required to give equal airtime to official candidates — “even the small candidates from the tiny parties, they have equal time.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s not the case in the US. And in the absence of spending caps or media rules, Democrats — who have emphasized getting the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/04/biden-dems-grassroots-donations-00109766">support of small donors in recent years</a> — will need to continue to find ways to keep Harris’s fundraising numbers high, particularly as they work to ward off the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361087/trump-silicon-valley-fundraising-musk-andreessen-horowitz">large individual donors</a> who have promised sizable donations to outside groups allied with Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One other key difference Democrats will have to contend with is the idea that voters need to be introduced to candidates. Harris, though vice president for the last four years, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/362619/kamala-harris-president-vision-political-ideology-2024-election">remains something of a blank slate</a>, leading to a lot of <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/362782/kamala-harris-gaza-israel-palestine-biden-netanyahu">speculation about what her policy positions are</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She has just over three months for voters to get to know her, but her European counterparts don’t face the same struggle in their short election cycles. Party leaders are usually a known quantity already, having worked their way up through leadership over many years after holding different positions in government. Plus Europeans tend to pay much more attention to politics than Americans, Chamorel said —&nbsp;so voters are likely to know candidates and what their parties actually stand for in a way American voters don’t.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>But there is a way that circumstances could play to Democrats’ advantage</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is one way Harris could really benefit from the European-style campaign cycle she faces.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Normally, America’s campaign cycles are so long that candidates run the risk of voters becoming disengaged by the time Election Day rolls around. That certainly appeared to be the case this cycle, with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/americans-dismayed-by-biden-trump-2024-rematch-reutersipsos-poll-finds-2024-01-25/">voters regularly telling pollsters</a> they wished they had <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/06/23/double-haters-biden-trump-deciders/">choices other than Trump and Biden</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“One of the problems of having candidates running for years in advance of an election is the public can become tired of them and their message,” Squire said. “[Harris will] reap the benefits of having an organization in place; she can just take over the Biden-Harris organization,” while still being relatively fresh to voters. “She can run as not really the incumbent, and as somebody who is known a little bit, but not that well by many Americans.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris may, to an extent, have the best of both worlds: She already has the benefit of being in national leadership positions. She has the Democratic machinery behind her, including Biden and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and she will have <a href="https://www.vox.com/joe-biden/361991/361991biden-campaign-funds-after-drops-out">access to Biden’s fundraising dollars</a>. But voters haven’t been seeing her campaigning everywhere for months now, which means she’ll <em>seem </em>new.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a two-party system in which the Democrats have a broad mix of ideologies —&nbsp;think of centrist Democrats like Biden versus more left-wing politicians like Sen. Bernie Sanders (who is an independent, but is broadly part of the Democratic coalition) — Harris will need to clarify and explain her positions. She’ll have to maintain a balance of staying close enough to Biden’s policies while offering the change that voters have expressed they want, which could prove to be a challenging needle to thread in a short period of time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, the shorter campaign cycle may mean less opportunity for errors like the debate performance that ultimately caused Biden to step down. And there will be less time for Trump and the Republican Party to create damaging narratives about Harris that overshadow her policy and performance —&nbsp;provided she creates a narrative about herself first.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris has clinched the support of all the major Democratic players —&nbsp;now she’ll have to concentrate on what’s most important, which is broadcasting her policy and building a coalition of voters who think she can be the next president.</p>
